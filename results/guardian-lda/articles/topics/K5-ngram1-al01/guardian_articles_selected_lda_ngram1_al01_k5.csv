We’re young, we’re students and we’re calling for change. Our movement started in February when tens of thousands of young people took to the streets in towns and cities around Britain, in an unprecedented emergence of a youth climate justice movement.
We’ve joined a movement that’s spreading rapidly across the world, catalysed by the actions of one individual in taking a stand in August last year. Greta Thunberg may have been the spark, but we’re the wildfire and we’re fuelled by the necessity for action.
The climate is in crisis. We will be facing ecological catastrophe and climate breakdown in the very near future if those in power don’t act urgently and radically to change our trajectory. Scientists have been giving increasingly dire warnings about the state of our planet for years, with the urgency and severity of their message escalating in recent times. It’s abundantly clear: change is needed, and it’s needed now!
Previous generations and those in positions of power have failed to protect us, they’ve failed to ensure we’ve got a future to look forward to. Not only this, those elected to lead and govern have betrayed countless people across the world already suffering the devastating impacts of climate change.
The burden for creating the change we need to see in the world has sadly fallen upon us and our peers around the world, unified in our common struggle to address the climate crisis. Failure is not an option, that’s why we’re demanding the following:
The government must declare a climate emergency and prioritise the protection of life on Earth, taking active steps to achieve climate justice. We must realign our economy along environmental principles to protect not only the planet, but also to create an equitable world for all people.
Our education system is failing us. We’re not being adequately taught about the climate crisis in our classrooms. Schools are not preparing us for the world we’re about to enter, yet still prepare us for jobs and a society based on the system that caused the crisis. We must urgently reform the national curriculum and learn to address the ecological crisis as an educational priority.
The government must also communicate to the general public the severity of the ecological crisis and the necessity to act now. The population cannot be expected to hold those in power to account without the necessary information. Our environment is being destroyed and we have a right to know the facts.
The government must recognise that us, young people have the biggest stake in the future. Legislation must be immediately adopted to lower the voting age to 16 and incorporate youth views into policy making. For too long we’ve been disenfranchised and frozen out of the political system. It’s clear that politics isn’t working. We can’t keep operating within these failing models of civic engagement. Without reconfiguring the way decision making takes place, we’ll be incapable of addressing the climate crisis.
We need you to listen, we need you to support us. This is a common struggle. It encompasses all people, and will require action across all of society. There’s no longer time for those who want to deny or delay. We need to continue demonstrating, we need to keep rising up and we need to disrupt the status quo. If the politicians and those in power won’t make the changes we need to see in the world, then it’s time they step aside or else we’ll remove them to put those in power that will.

This could be an important transitional step to shifting a world economy already falling out of love with globalisation towards one shaped by green “progressive protectionism”. At its heart would be an emphasis on protecting and rebuilding sustainable local economies. This would offer a far more secure future for the majority than the socially and environmentally destructive form of global economic warfare inherent in international competitiveness and export-led growth.
Prioritising the domestic would allow massive funding for a long-term, climate-healing “jobs in every community” approach of making all buildings and transport systems energy efficient and powered by decentralised renewables. It would also see off rightwing populists by providing long-term employment for those parts of the “left behind” that can’t be reached by any other form of economic activity. The threat of carbon tariffs on relevant US exports could well be a useful tool towards pushing Trump to shift his promised increase in infrastructure investment into one that would be a nationwide, decentralised job generator that also helped tackle climate change.Colin Hines(Author, Progressive Protectionism) London
• Thank you for your G2 special on climate change (19 January). Chris Goodall (Look on the bright side, page 4) argues that cheaper renewables may mean that “the end of the fossil-fuel era is already in sight”. This is too optimistic: large amounts of fossil fuel are still very cheap to extract, and will be competitive even with much lower prices for green energy. This will be part of the reason why the leading scientists quoted by Andrew Simms (Another degree closer to disaster, page 8) are saying that we are not going to keep the global temperature rise below two degrees.
We have to accept that the changes in personal lifestyle which you rightly advocate (The heat is on, ) and the developments in green energy are not going to be enough. We also need to invest in technology to remove carbon dioxide (carbon scrubbing) and to artificially lower global temperatures (geoengineering).Richard MountfordHildenborough, Kent
• Trump’s tweet (‘The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive’, G2 front page, 19 January) may not identify the subtle distinction between causation and cause and effect, but there is a justified underlying observation. By our own consumer choices we support economies that show no concern for their climate pollution or human sweatshops.Christopher CoombeLondon

The Bureau of Meteorology said temperatures had been “definitely well above average” across most of the eastern states so far this month.
The high for Sydney was 28C on Tuesday when the average temperature for May is 19.5C.
Duty forecaster Philip Landvogt said it was a similar story for “pretty much all of the eastern states”.
“All the way from Brisbane down to even Hobart is warmer than average for this part of year.”
In Brisbane the average high temperature for May is 23.2C – and so far this month not a day has fell below 24C. The city can expect temperatures in the mid-to-high 20s “well into next week”.
Canberra has also been warmer than the average May, with an average high of 18.9C so far this month compared with the usual 15.6C.
And the effect has been felt as far south as Melbourne, where this month it has been 20.3C while the average May day peaks at 16. 7C.
The cause was warm ocean temperatures off the east coast and over northern Australia and prevailing winds bringing warm air from over the central part of the country to the eastern states.
“The combination of those two factors has been the reason we’ve had these warm temperatures,” said Landvogt.
Landvogt said the warmer weather was set to continue for at least a week in many parts of Australia.
A high of 25C for Sydney on Wednesday was forecast to be followed by at least seven days of temperatures in the region of early to mid-20s – all well above the May average of 19.5C.
Tasmania and Melbourne would start to cool down early next week, with the arrival of a cold front in the coming days.
The warm water temperatures off the east coast of Australia and dry conditions over much of the country that were associated with El Niño were continuing but Landvogt said that system would start to break down soon.
Sea surface temperatures across the tropical Pacific Ocean have cooled in the past fortnight as El Niño draws closer to an end.
Landvogt said there was a “50-50 chance” of a La Niña weather pattern forming with the onset of winter. That could lead to more rainfall over the winter through northern, central and eastern Australia.
The unseasonal weather follows confirmation of the hottest April on record globally – and the seventh consecutive month to have broken global temperature records.
The latest figures, released by Nasa over the weekend, smashed the previous record for April by the largest margin ever recorded, setting 2016 up to be the hottest year ever.";"landvogt, 19.5c, eastern, average, warm, 20s, temperatures, brisbane, month, 15.6c, 18.9c, 23.2c, australia, warmer, 20.3c";"landvogt";"frisby, seiu, gk, mcmurray, qbe, markham, sundt, gbr, ffos, xenophon, randol, nxt, 400ppm, energetics, cramer, mergers"

Sheila Deane, who comments on the Guardian as thoughtballoons, will select from your recommendations and had this to say about widening the scope:
You could include songs about any extreme or changeable weather, or the impact of weather on sea levels, wildlife or humans. Also songs from before present scientific thinking that now might seem prophetic, or about historical environmental catastrophes that may or may not be linked to humans. For instance, songs about flooding, such as Led Zeppelin’s When the Levee Breaks.
Nominate and tell us why in the comments. You can find a list of all songs previously picked and so ineligible (including that Led Zeppelin song) here.
You have until 11pm on Monday 25 April to post your nomination and make your justification in the comments.
If you would like to volunteer to compile a playlist from readers’ suggestions – and potentially blog about the process/selection for the Guardian – please email matthew.holmes@theguardian.com, or make yourself known in the comments.
Here’s a reminder of the guidelines for RR:
 We’d like to learn a bit more about you and what you love. Each week, alongside RR, we’ll be asking you to tell us more about the songs you’ve nominated through our GuardianWitness page.

I love books and I love going to book festivals, both as an author and a reader. So it might come as a surprise to learn that I’ve got together with book blogger Zoe Toft to organise the Think Twice Campaign that encourages authors and illustrators to think twice about appearing at a book festival.
Before you think we’ve lost our minds, I should say that we’re only asking authors and illustrators to think twice about going to a particular festival – the Emirates Airline Festival of Literature that is held every year in Dubai. Lots of authors and illustrators we admire and respect attend the festival each year and it seems to be well organised and very enjoyable for everyone involved. So why are we kicking up a fuss about it? Our objection is to the festival’s sponsor, Emirates Airline, part of an environmentally irresponsible industry and owned by a very oppressive government.
Generally speaking, we are in favour of companies sponsoring book festivals to help them cover their costs. However it’s important to recognise that both sides benefit from a sponsorship deal. By associating themselves with high-profile, respectable authors and illustrators, Emirates Airline are able to raise their own profile and make themselves appear more respectable. Zoe and I don’t think that a company like Emirates Airline should be regarded as respectable. We think they are quite the opposite. And we’ve given authors and illustrators three good reasons to think that too.
One reason is climate change. While governments are making other industries reduce their CO2 emissions, the aviation industry’s carbon footprint gets bigger and bigger every year. It looked like aviation was finally going to be brought under control at last year’s Climate Change summit in Paris, but at the last minute, they were let off the hook again. Environmental groups have said that the absence of both aviation and shipping from the Paris agreement will make it “close to impossible” to keep global warming beneath the 2ºC level needed to avert climate catastrophe. As the airline that flies the highest number of international kilometres, Emirates Airline’s international flights already generate more CO2 than any other airline and instead of reducing their emissions they have just announced plans to double in size. Does that sound respectable?
A second reason is free speech. The airline is owned by the family of Sheikh Mohammed, the ruler of Dubai and the book festival’s patron. Dubai is part of a country called the United Arab Emirates or the UAE. Sheikh Mohammed is also the UAE’s Vice President and Prime Minister. The UAE government is very different from the UK’s and the Sheikh is more like a king than a UK prime minister. The UAE is not a democratic country, so the Sheikh cannot be voted out in an election, no matter how unpopular he is with his people. Many UAE citizens are very unhappy with the way the country is run. Unfortunately, citizens that dare to criticise the country’s government are arrested and imprisoned for doing so (find out more in this link from Amnesty International). There are currently 67 prisoners serving long sentences just for speaking out in favour of democracy. Does that sound respectable?
The third reason is human rights. If you’re not a rich heterosexual man, you may be treated as a second class citizen – or, worse still, a criminal – by Sheikh Mohammed’s government. Attacks against women are not taken as seriously as they are in the UK and often the victim, rather than the man attacking her, ends up being arrested and imprisoned. Homosexuality is illegal and people can be imprisoned for up to 10 years simply for being gay. People of both sexes working in low paid jobs are not protected by the law in the same way that rich people are. Low paid women are especially badly treated, with many being forced to work long hours with little to eat and no days off. Does that sound respectable?
Zoe and I do have a lot of sympathy for children that might miss out on meeting an author or illustrator as a result of this campaign. However we have more sympathy for the people – children and adults – in the groups whose interests the Think Twice campaign are trying to champion: the women, migrant workers and gay UAE citizens whose human rights are being abused, or the future generations who will have to contend with the life-threatening consequences of climate change. 
If authors and illustrators are thinking of cancelling, but are worried about disappointing a young audience, they could offer to Skype with UAE schools. There are lots of tips for authors and illustrators who are new to Skype at virtualauthors.co.uk. 
Emirates Airline is an extremely rich company. They use their money to sponsor many other high-profile events and organisations, from football clubs to symphony orchestras. This all helps to create a smokescreen of respectability around a company and a government that is anything but respectable. I hope that the Think Twice Campaign will help many authors and illustrators to see through that smokescreen and think twice about going to this particular book festival.

I love books and I love going to book festivals, both as an author and a reader. So it might come as a surprise to learn that I’ve got together with book blogger Zoe Toft to organise the Think Twice Campaign that encourages authors and illustrators to think twice about appearing at a book festival.
Before you think we’ve lost our minds, I should say that we’re only asking authors and illustrators to think twice about going to a particular festival – the Emirates Airline Festival of Literature that is held every year in Dubai. Lots of authors and illustrators we admire and respect attend the festival each year and it seems to be well organised and very enjoyable for everyone involved. So why are we kicking up a fuss about it? Our objection is to the festival’s sponsor, Emirates Airline, part of an environmentally irresponsible industry and owned by a very oppressive government.
Generally speaking, we are in favour of companies sponsoring book festivals to help them cover their costs. However it’s important to recognise that both sides benefit from a sponsorship deal. By associating themselves with high-profile, respectable authors and illustrators, Emirates Airline are able to raise their own profile and make themselves appear more respectable. Zoe and I don’t think that a company like Emirates Airline should be regarded as respectable. We think they are quite the opposite. And we’ve given authors and illustrators three good reasons to think that too.
One reason is climate change. While governments are making other industries reduce their CO2 emissions, the aviation industry’s carbon footprint gets bigger and bigger every year. It looked like aviation was finally going to be brought under control at last year’s Climate Change summit in Paris, but at the last minute, they were let off the hook again. Environmental groups have said that the absence of both aviation and shipping from the Paris agreement will make it “close to impossible” to keep global warming beneath the 2ºC level needed to avert climate catastrophe. As the airline that flies the highest number of international kilometres, Emirates Airline’s international flights already generate more CO2 than any other airline and instead of reducing their emissions they have just announced plans to double in size. Does that sound respectable?
A second reason is free speech. The airline is owned by the family of Sheikh Mohammed, the ruler of Dubai and the book festival’s patron. Dubai is part of a country called the United Arab Emirates or the UAE. Sheikh Mohammed is also the UAE’s Vice President and Prime Minister. The UAE government is very different from the UK’s and the Sheikh is more like a king than a UK prime minister. The UAE is not a democratic country, so the Sheikh cannot be voted out in an election, no matter how unpopular he is with his people. Many UAE citizens are very unhappy with the way the country is run. Unfortunately, citizens that dare to criticise the country’s government are arrested and imprisoned for doing so (find out more in this link from Amnesty International). There are currently 67 prisoners serving long sentences just for speaking out in favour of democracy. Does that sound respectable?
The third reason is human rights. If you’re not a rich heterosexual man, you may be treated as a second class citizen – or, worse still, a criminal – by Sheikh Mohammed’s government. Attacks against women are not taken as seriously as they are in the UK and often the victim, rather than the man attacking her, ends up being arrested and imprisoned. Homosexuality is illegal and people can be imprisoned for up to 10 years simply for being gay. People of both sexes working in low paid jobs are not protected by the law in the same way that rich people are. Low paid women are especially badly treated, with many being forced to work long hours with little to eat and no days off. Does that sound respectable?
Zoe and I do have a lot of sympathy for children that might miss out on meeting an author or illustrator as a result of this campaign. However we have more sympathy for the people – children and adults – in the groups whose interests the Think Twice campaign are trying to champion: the women, migrant workers and gay UAE citizens whose human rights are being abused, or the future generations who will have to contend with the life-threatening consequences of climate change. 
If authors and illustrators are thinking of cancelling, but are worried about disappointing a young audience, they could offer to Skype with UAE schools. There are lots of tips for authors and illustrators who are new to Skype at virtualauthors.co.uk. 
Emirates Airline is an extremely rich company. They use their money to sponsor many other high-profile events and organisations, from football clubs to symphony orchestras. This all helps to create a smokescreen of respectability around a company and a government that is anything but respectable. I hope that the Think Twice Campaign will help many authors and illustrators to see through that smokescreen and think twice about going to this particular book festival.

It’s true: despite decades of warnings from top scientists, ecocide remains an unfashionable issue, thanks in no small part to intensive lobbying and spin from agribusiness, biotech corporations and carbon barons, who use art world patronage to create an illusion of benevolence.
Musicians across genres and generations are calling time on this lie, from Neil Young’s furious Monsanto Years album and Greenpeace’s striking Requiem for Arctic Ice to THEEsatisfaction’s lush, eco-conscious odyssey, EarthEE. “We want to start a conversation about climate change,” the Sub Pop duo told the Guardian last year. “Because it’s a real issue, a problem many try to avoid.” 
Hopelessness, Anohni’s forthcoming album, is a stunning response to this inaction, joining journalist Rebecca Solnit’s call to label climate change “extreme, horrific, long-term, widespread violence”. The songs are sublime in their movement, devastating in their truth-telling – war, surveillance, American imperialism, the slow murder of the Earth and its inhabitants not just by men with machines, but by all of us who are complicit in the planet’s devastation. It is, to quote Elizabeth Barrett Browning, a curse from the depths of womanhood: “salt, and bitter, and good” – a sonic extension of Anohni’s work in the Future Feminists collective. 
Fear and rage are powerful tools for change, but delight and pleasure are equally formidable. These things are in abundance on THEEsatisfaction’s limber, Afrofuturist poetry (on the aforementioned EarthEE, or their debut, AwE NaturalE, and their catalogue of mixtapes) – heady, rich, semi-mystical music that traces symbiotic lines between earth and body, music and mind, lineage and land.
Brooklyn-based rapper Junglepussy has a similar, pesticide-free MO on her excellent second album, Pregnant with Success, a record ripe with carefree confidence, black love and green metaphors – witty, salacious and earthy in equal measure. In JP’s world, merch is a line of organic beverages (Junglepussy Juice), self-love is paramount (“I seen you eating Mickey D’s, knew you ain’t love yourself / I’m up in Trader Joes, shopping cart full of health”) and would-be lovers are advised to woo her not with popping bottles (“that’s not impressive”) but freshly picked fruit. 
It makes sense that artists like Junglepussy, Anohni and THEEsatisfaction are at the forefront of green music, since it’s marginal communities – oppressed, poor, BAME, “other” – who are, and will continue to be, the first and worst affected by ecocide, while the 1% holiday in the sun. Ask the black, working-class people of Flint, Michigan, who are forced to drink and bathe in lead-contaminated water; the victims of developing countries devastated by the droughts and famines that follow extreme weather; the many indigenous peoples across the globe fighting oil spills and pipelines, land grabs and deforestation.
And yet, as Anohni points out, identity politics in this “tipping point” era are increasingly used against us by big business as smokescreens to distract us from a culture of wealth extraction:
They are going to try to convince us that they have our best interests at heart by waving flags for identity politics and fake moral issues. But don’t forget that many of these [award show] celebrities are the trophies of billionaire corporations whose only intention it is to manipulate you into giving them your consent and the last of your money. They have been paid to do a little tap dance to occupy you while Rome burns.
Hopelessness works because it articulates the despair so many of us feel on our worst days – that we’re all doomed, that the world is past saving, that we’re all to blame. But it also speaks to defiance and refusal, joining a growing resistance that is starting to take root across the globe: in Sudha Kheterpal’s SPARK technology, in Björk’s tireless activist-art, in the healing, pleasure-filled rhythms and melodies of THEEsatisfaction and Junglepussy.";"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change";"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/mar/22/eco-conscious-anohni-theesatisfaction-outsider-music-artists-challenge-ecocide-business"

The government’s actions have been described as Soviet in style and intent but the political thuggery pales compared to the activation of a subtler and more powerful effect known as psychological distance.
Psychological distance is a construct that measures the “distance” of an event or object in terms of geography, time, cultural similarity and factual certainty. If something is nearby, likely to occur soon, involves people like you, and the facts are certain, that “something” is considered psychologically close. The closer it is, the more likely you are to perceive it as concrete and be willing and able to act on it.
Work by our environmental psychology research group at the University of New England shows that alternatively, as psychological distance increases, an object is perceived more abstractly and is less likely to be acted on.
Saving for retirement is a classic example. In our 20s, the facts of retirement are uncertain: it will occur in the distant future, and possibly in a different location and cultural context. Other more concrete concerns capture our attention.
By the time we reach our 50s the abstract has become concrete. We likely know when we’ll be retiring, where to and with who, all with relative certainty. As a result, we’re more likely to save every spare dollar.
But of course with retirement savings – like climate change and coral bleaching – we can’t wait until the last minute to act.
To that end, our research indicates that psychological distance is a significant predictor of climate change concern and intention to act in ways such as reducing household energy use.
We’ve also found that we can increase or decrease psychological distance by framing climate change messages in different ways. When we presented messages designed to increase psychological distance, our participants became less concerned about climate change and more disengaged. When we reduced psychological distance, our participants became more concerned and more willing to take action.
Which brings us back to the federal government’s “bleaching” of UN documents. By requesting that references to reef damage be removed from the Unesco report, the government is, intentionally or otherwise, increasing the psychological distance of climate-related threats to the reef.
Geographic and cultural distances are increased: climate change might be killing coral but there’s no indication that it’s happening in Australia. Therefore it must be happening elsewhere to people who are different to us.
The perception of time, as it relates to psychological distance, is also stretched. Many Australians have heard that climate change will affect our reef, but it’s not happening yet, apparently.
Finally, the release of an authoritative climate change report that doesn’t mention the Great Barrier Reef contrasts with other reports that do mention it. This type of inconsistency creates a level of factual uncertainty that only further increases psychological distance.
Of course we’ve learned that nearly a quarter of the coral on the Great Barrier Reef is now dead, according to two government agencies. How is it possible for almost a quarter of our reef to die without it triggering unprecedented, national concern and debate?
 Sadly, those of us who work with the psychology of climate change don’t find this surprising in the least. Psychological distance is one of the many “dragons of inaction” that we wrestle with, psychological barriers that hinder environmental action.
But we also have cause for optimism. Our research suggests that reports of environmental damage that include graphic images can decrease psychological distance, and be an effective mechanism for increasing public concern and engagement. However, for that to occur people must read the articles and see the pictures.
And so it becomes apparent that the government’s very own bleaching event is truly masterful, if the goal is to prevent meaningful action on climate change.
The dying of the Great Barrier Reef is a national tragedy. In a democracy it is mandatory that the electorate be informed about matters of national significance. In this case the opposite has occurred, and the psychological damage done may already be more profound than most realise.";"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change";"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/10/the-great-barrier-reef-and-the-subtle-power-of-psychological-distance"

Trump, who will be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States on Friday, has threatened to pull out of the historic Paris agreement and dismissed climate change as a Chinese “hoax” and “expensive… bullshit”. 
But in an address to the United Nations in Geneva on Wednesday, which observers saw as a high-profile bid to bolster China’s image as a reliable and dedicated climate leader, Xi issued a direct challenge to those views, warning “there is only one Earth in the universe and we mankind have only one homeland”. 
“The Paris agreement is a milestone in the history of climate governance. We must ensure this endeavor is not derailed,” the Communist party leader said.
 “All parties should work together to implement the Paris agreement. China will continue to take steps to tackle climate change and fully honor its obligations,” Xi added, according to a transcript published by Xinhua, China’s official news agency.
Just a few months ago, climate campaigners hailed a major breakthrough in efforts to tackle global warming when Barack Obama and Xi jointly announced that their countries, the world’s top two emitters of greenhouse gases, would ratify the Paris accord. 
“We have a saying in America that you need to put your money where your mouth is,” Obama said at the time. “And when it comes to combating climate change that is what we are doing … we are leading by example.”
Signatories of the deal, which came into force in November last year, agreed to keep global warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels. 
However, Trump’s shock election – and the presence of so many climate sceptics in his administration – has thrown the US’ commitment to such goals into doubt. 
The Guardian has interviewed more than a dozen leading global voices on climate change in the run-up to 24 hours of live, uninterrupted digital coverage running from Thursday through to Trump’s inauguration on Friday.
Reporters have investigated countless examples of climate change utterly transforming lives and livelihoods, from Bangladesh to Egypt, west Africa to the south Pacific, even Europe and the United States itself, despite Trump’s repeated claims that it is a hoax. 
In his Geneva speech Xi reaffirmed Beijing’s pledges to slash its emissions and sought to position China, which remains the world’s top polluter, as a global pacesetter on climate change and sustainable development. 
“We should make our world clean and beautiful by pursuing green and low-carbon development,” he told his audience. 
“Man coexists with nature, which means that any harm to nature will eventually come back to haunt man. We hardly notice natural resources such as air, water, soil and blue sky when we have them. But we won’t be able to survive without them.” 
“Industrialisation has created material wealth never seen before, but it has also inflicted irreparable damage to the environment,” Xi went on. “We must not exhaust all the resources passed on to us by previous generations and leave nothing to our children or pursue development in a destructive way. Clear waters and green mountains are as good as mountains of gold and silver. We must maintain harmony between man and nature and pursue sustainable development.”
Li Shuo, Greenpeace’s China climate policy adviser, described Xi’s speech as “a very important political signal … especially in the context of the incoming US administration”.
The activist said he believed Xi’s call to arms on the climate was designed to pressure Trump’s White House into sticking to his predecessor’s commitments while simultaneously highlighting China’s role as a responsible climate leader. 
“It is a calculated move… it is their first move on the chess board and I expect further moves if they are needed at a later stage,” said Li. 
“China has a very important and a very special role in keeping the US on course and we would very much like to see them use their leverage on that,” he added. 
Zhang Haibin, an expert in environmental diplomacy from Peking University’s school of international studies, said Xi’s speech was a response to the global “uncertainties and concerns” that Trump’s election had thrown up, including over climate change.
 The president’s words “sent a strong signal to the world” about China’s determination to tackle global warming. 
Zhang said Beijing would stick to its climate commitments since it understood the importance of cutting deadly air pollution but argued China would not want to serve as the world’s “sole leader” on climate change. 
“We regard ourselves as a developing country and, in addition to that, we’ve got pollution issues and are facing an economic slowdown at home,” he said.

Thank you to everyone for reading and taking part in the discussion.
What type of world do you want to live in?
Paul, thanks for posing this question. We want to forge a world in which climate justice is enshrined as a core value. We need to see a society based on equity and the removal of the economic disparity created by the system we operate. It’s precisely this system that’s responsible for the climate crisis, we have no other option than to make a different world. We may not have all the answers, but we’re hopeful we can still create a world that works for everyone. We’re young and creative, let’s use our collective imagination to do so much better than we currently are.
JamesMackay asks:
I think the most important question is this: What practical steps can we take to help amplify young voices? Should we consider climate change strikes by workers? Should we donate money? As someone in employment, I feel that “share, like and subscribe” isn’t enough, but I don’t know what to do with my limited time and resources.
Don't try to do anything alone. Work with existing groups like Extinction Rebellion to amplify your voice, and ensure you become part of an effective political wave.
Here’s a short Guardian film worth watching if you want to know more about the Extinction Rebellion movement:
JohnSmith73 has this:
Climate change (and many other issues) will be solved relatively easily and quickly with the advancement of AI, machine learning and other technologies. Why are students not in school learning how to find solutions to these problems instead of taking a day off and complaining about it?
No technological solution is effective without the political pressure required to retire old technologies and replace them with better ones. It's a huge political struggle, thanks to the inordinate power of companies with sunk costs. We have had the means of electrifying transport - to give one example - for over a century, but it has been continually thwarted by industrial interests. 
It is amazingly naive to expect that technology just strolls in and sorts it all out. By far the greatest factor is political will.

Children and youth are striking to demand action. But many of not most are themselves involved in one of the most damaging practices towards earth's climate, I mean consuming massive amounts of meat and diary in their diets. 
What is their thought on this regard ? 
Are they? I see young people leading on this. There's been a massive surge towards veganism by young people, which has resulted in a sevenfold increase in the UK within 5 years. Quite remarkable. And it should be recognised.
George has added his thoughts to an earlier question asked here (Are students naive to be asking politicians to be the agents of change? Was Greta Thunberg more on the ball when she went to Davos to speak to the one percent?):
It's a good question. But I think they recognise that the change won't come from asking anyone nicely. It'll come from generating such political pressure that politicians and other powerful people have to change course. 
And you do it by building up your own strength, within the group, then pulling in the people closest to you, then moving on to the next closest etc. You're never going to do it by appealing to those furthest away from your position. It's the political momentum you generate that counts, and you must build it until it becomes unstoppable.
Claire, from Cambridgeshire, asks this:
What are the top five big things that urgently need to change to really make a difference; in policy, regulation, how money flows, in industry, agriculture...etc, and in what timescale?
1. Dethrone GDP as the measure of our well-being, and replace it with indicators whose optimisation does not require mass destruction.
2. Leave fossil fuels in the ground within 5 years, using a crash programme similar to the comprehensive retooling when the US entered the second world war, to replace them with low carbon alternatives.
3. Introduce a moratorium on new fossil-fuel dependent infrastructure.
4. Change farm subsidies to incentivise the retirement and rewilding of unproductive land, while encouraging a shift towards a plant-based diet.
5. Change the presumption permitting the exploitation of the seas: commercial fishing and other extractive activities should be permissible only under special licence, to be granted in exceptional circumstances. 
As mentioned earlier, to mark the youth climate strikes around the world, Guardian Opinion is being edited in collaboration with the UK Student Climate Network today. You can read more from the series here, including a piece where a panel of politicians answer the activists.
viney has this to say in the comments:
Young people are right to demonstrate their passionate concern about climate change. However, they may not envisage the type of world/society which the more extreme climate activists wish to see. I would like to ask which specific things you would be willing to give up entirely in the future, or pay very much more money for?
This is an interesting question but unfortunately I think you're directing it at the wrong people. We're under no illusions that everyone needs to take positive steps to live more environmentally friendly lifestyles, but I believe your question should be directed toward the powerful actors, big business and corporations accumulating vast amounts of wealth from the destruction of the planet. 
It is precisely these actors and people that need to give certain things up to allow everyone else to prosper, not just economically, but environmentally as well. Our current system is not compatible with a just and healthy planet. We need change, and we need it now! Jake - UKSCN
jessthecrip asks:
How can we remain hopeful and positive whilst facing the increasingly scary reality of environmental breakdown? How can we best support and strengthen each other as activists?
Supporting each other is crucial. We cannot get through this alone. Social solidarity is essential to prevent burnout and despair. And it is amazingly effective.Some fascinating research shows that we experience much lower levels of physical and emotional pain if we have strong support networks.
We’re going to be wrapping the blog up in the next 30 minutes, but there’s still time for more discussion below.
Global coverage of today’s strikes will continue on our dedicated liveblog.
Reader Harriet, 34, in Devon, says:
I think the school strikes are really inspirational. However, as adults we seem to be sitting back and allowing students to fight on our behalf. Would more pressure not be placed upon government policy if, for example, it was teachers themselves who were striking? How can we mobilise the adult population, which seems to be currently unwilling to face up to the reality of climate change?
Yes, I think there’s a lot to be said for adult strikes in this area. As long as we made it clear that we are following the lead of the young climate strikers, and not trying to make the movement ours. They are the leaders now, we are the followers. Where they want our help, we should be ready to provide it.
Oliver Quantrill, 48, in Wiltshire, asks:
How important do you think it is to be seen to be taking personal actions to live more sustainable lifestyles yourselves? You are asking politicians to make difficult decisions, potentially putting their personal ambitions to one side to stand up for what is right, so do you need to be seen to be making similar levels of commitment? Two obvious examples being choosing not to fly and reducing our consumption of meat. 
Hey Oliver, great to hear from you – Jake here again. The scale of the issue at hand means that to avert the climate crisis, we need to see those in power enact systemic change. Personal actions and lifestyle changes are positive, and definitely a step in the right direction, but sadly won’t be enough. We don’t think that individuals shouldn’t do their best, but the onus needs to move away from the individual and onto the powerful actors, politicians and big corporations.
Narcspotter asks:
Why do [youth climate strikes] create such a powerful reaction from people who [call it] “a fraud, virtue signalling, left wing conspiracy” etc? Why do they take it so personally, that youth, and others, are protesting about the destruction of the planet that they also live on?
Good question. 
There's a virulent conspiracy theory circulating at the moment: the children can't possibly be organising and thinking for themselves. Someone must be controlling them. 
Not one shred of evidence has been adduced to support it. Why? Because there isn't any.
The strikes took us veterans by surprise - and they fill me with hope of a kind I thought I'd never feel again. We'll help if they ask for it. But they are the leaders now, and we are the followers. 
The conspiracy theory is incredibly patronising and condescending, as well as implausible. As someone put it to me today, ""The biggest argument against it is: have you ever tried telling a teenager what to do?""
RicoS321 asks:
Do you think that the children protesting today are aware of the links between climate change and [...] problems with the existing economic system? Can they make that link and do you get a sense of they are the generation that will change it?
Young people protesting around the world today are very much aware of the links between the climate crisis and the existing economic system. We're the generation that grew up through the financial crisis, we're also the generation that will be worse off than our parents, inherit an Earth damaged beyond belief and riddled with systemic inequalities. We're united under the banner of ""system change, not climate change"". Out of the wreckage of this system, we need to collaborate, come together and create communities that prosper together, with climate justice as a core value. There's no reason we can't have a world that works for everyone, we just need to break away from the corporate greed and extractivist profit-making that has led to the potential impending climate breakdown.

While we’re here, a chance to share this climate quiz, put together by UK Student Climate Network members who have collaborated to part edit Guardian Opinion today.
Let us know how you get on!
Hugh, 28, a reader in New Zealand, says:
I feel powerless to make any real change in regards to climate change. I do everything I can but ultimately I know that on a person to person basis these actions don’t make enough of a difference. What can I actually do to make any difference to the industrial scale pollution, destruction, or consumerism that are the main contributors?
As a consumer, you can make no appreciable difference, except in two areas: switching to a plant-based diet and changing your travel patterns (particularly cutting down/cutting out flights and cycling/walking/taking the bus rather than driving). In these two areas you can make a lot of difference. But you will make very little in seeking to buy a better kind of biscuit or cotton bud.
However, as a citizen, you can make a huge difference across all areas. Our struggles are primarily political, but we have been gulled into believing that we can win them by changing our buying choices. The media has put great effort into persuading us to see ourselves as consumers, not citizens. Don’t fall for it. Get political.
jamiebd asks:
Working in the field of environmental education, I would be interested in knowing what young people think should be in a climate change curriculum. Do students feel let down by what is next to currently taught? Do students feel school gives them the skills to take effective action?
It's clear as day, students and young people are not being taught anywhere near an adequate amount of information about the climate crisis in schools. The content is basic, and more importantly is severely lacking with regards to the amount of hours covered. It's likely what is covered is shoehorned into a couple of Geography lessons whereas in reality, this needs to be weaved through all strands of learning to incorporate environmental principles throughout all disciplines.

Reader Janette Ward asks a question related to some of George’s recent writing on cars:
How can we compel the government to stop building roads and invest in public transport? How can we change the culture of cars as a status symbol and ensure that people travel by public transport whenever possible?
This is a crucial issue, especially as, in rich nations like ours, transport has now become the top source of greenhouse gas emissions. Last week I called for a 90% cut in car use within a decade.
This might sound extreme, but it seems to me to be commensurate with the scale of the multiple crises cars are causing: climate breakdown, air pollution, resource use, use of space, domination of urban life etc. There’s a series of steps in any such process: think it, say it, debate it, campaign, change the system. There are lots of great organisations campaigning on these issues already.

yale’s environmental performance index ranks countries’ performance in protecting human health and ecosystems, and looks at nine areas including air quality, climate and energy, forests and water resources.
when australia’s climate change policies were questioned in november, the environment minister relied on the index to defend its record. “the yale environment performance index, the most credible, scientifically based, hard data-based analysis in the world, ranks australia number three of 178 countries in terms of our environmental performance,” he told abc’s 730.
the index’s report, released this week, shows australia has dropped 10 places overall, leaving it at 13 out of 180 countries examined. 
 it performed worst in the climate and energy category. it was ranked 150th for its trend in carbon emissions each kilowatt hour, leaving only saudi arabia behind among wealthy nations. overall in the climate and energy category, australia was ranked 82nd.
while global co2 emissions appear to have dropped in 2015 for the first time during a period of economic growth, australia’s emissions have continued to grow. 
mark butler, labor’s spokesman on the environment, told fairfax media: “the yale report states that over the last decade ‘nearly every country has improved it’s [index] score’ – every country, that is, except australia … the turnbull government is taking australia backwards at a shocking pace.”
hunt’s office has been contacted for comment."

the standard would mark a turning point for efforts to regulate fast-growing emissions from airplanes, which are not covered by december’s much-hailed paris climate agreement.
the milestone would apply to new models and existing aircraft put into production after 2020, but the eu’s preferred version would be less stringent than alternative us proposals, which the guardian has also seen. both blueprints have been filed with the un’s civil aviation agency, icao, ahead of talks in montreal next month.
“the us proposal is definitely more ambitious,” said joris melkert, a former flight test engineer and senior aerospace lecturer at delft university in the netherlands. “it would save more emissions, and the difference is quite considerable.”
the gap between the two proposals is greater than the annual emissions of most medium-sized european countries, and privately confirmed by eu officials. 
aviation is responsible for around 5% of the world’s global warming at present and the industry is growing so fast that, on current trends, it could make up 22% of global emissions by 2050, according to a recent european parliament study.
the icao talks are pursuing a twin track approach of making airlines pay a cost for their co2 output under a market-based scheme, and greening aircraft with a new fuel efficiency standard.
 the debate on the standard began in 2007 and proposals agreed in montreal will be sent on to an icao council for approval next year. “after many years, decision time has finally come,” one eu official said. “i believe that we are going to have an ambitious standard and i hope we can secure it next month.”
airplanes emit co2 in the process of burning engine fuel to provide a lift force that can overcome the aerodynamic drag created by wind resistance. for this reason, the icao proposals focus on measures to improve planes’ aerodynamics, lightness and engines.
under the technical proposals, a stringency option of ‘9’ suggested by the us would reduce overall aircraft emissions by 37.5%, while the ‘7’ setting favoured by the eu would imply a 33% cut. the 4.5% gap is equal to 350m tonnes of co2, or slightly more than spain emits every year.
eu officials privately concede that their proposal is “the second most ambitious of the positions put on the table”. but they insist that it is still “quite close to the us one” and that the agreement’s small print on cargo aircraft and categorisations should not be overlooked. 
environmentalists argue that the involvement of the environmental protection agency and an unshackled president obama in the us has contributed to the relative weakness of the eu’s position.
but insiders in brussels say that the sheer variety of complex issues still to be agreed – and the amount of aircraft manufacturing countries involved, from brazil and ukraine to india and china – make like-for-like comparisons unwise, and stringency factors of ‘10’ impossible.
“there are so many parameters to be decided that it creates a lot of pieces you can move around on a chessboard,” one eu source told the guardian.
europe has proposed a 60 tonne threshold for classifying aircraft, as this could cover 90% of emissions and apply to aircraft of the size of a boeing 737 or airbus 320 and above.
but the classification would be further sub-divided between new model types and those in production; jets ferrying 19 people or less, and planes carrying freight instead of passengers. alternate starting dates of 2020 and 2023 for the benchmark are other options under discussion.
an eu source said: “we need a standard that reflects the state of art of the technology, that is as close as possible to what engineers are capable of doing, without going so high that a number of 60-tonne aircraft types would be put out of the market as that would be environmentally unhelpful, economically detrimental and also quite unfair, as lead-in times for aircraft take about 10 years.”"

last year it emerged that volkswagen had cheated on tests for emissions of nitrogen oxides (chemical name nox), the name for the toxic gases nitric oxide (no) and nitrogen dioxide (chemical name no2), both of which are found in diesel fumes. paul willis, managing director of vw uk, told mps on wednesday that tackling no2 emissions could come at the expense of cutting carbon dioxide (co2) emissions from cars – the greenhouse gas seen as a major contributor to climate change.
no2 is responsible for nearly 6,000 annual premature deaths in london, parts of which breached annual limits last week.
“i would say that unless we have a significant diesel mix in europe, within our fleet, we will miss that target, not vw, the industry will miss that [co2] target,” said willis, referring to the eu target of an average new car emitting 95g co2 per kilometre by 2021, compared to an average of 123.4g co2 per km in 2014.
transport is responsible for around a quarter of european union greenhouse gas emissions, so moves to cut them are seen as vital to climate change efforts.
during an often heated exchange with environment, food and rural affairs committee mps, willis defended vw’s environmental record but conceded the company had to win back consumer trust after the revelations last year that 12m of its cars were equipped with “defeat devices” to cheat nox emissions tests.
“for almost everyone in our company to learn what we learned in september [when the scandal emerged] was very difficult for us to swallow and very difficult for us to understand. i think you heard the apologies i made at that time and i’m still really sorry for that.” he said the company would redouble efforts to win back trust.
but owners of the 1.2m vw cars in the uk affected by the diesel emissions testing scandal should not receive any compensation because they have not suffered any loss, he argued. “to pay compensation, there has to be a loss. at this stage i see no reason for there to be a loss. the adjustment of the software, our engineers are telling us, there will be no difference in in fuel consumption as a result of this fix. 
“the other area is on the question of residual values, i have seen no clear evidence there has been any adverse impact on residual values.”
a survey last year found that nine out of 10 vw drivers in britain affected by the scandal believed they should receive compensation, in addition to the software fix that vw is rolling out to customers.
asked whether consumers would begin to factor health into their purchasing decisions, willis said that pollution emissions were not a priority for most car-buyers.
“i’m sorry to tell you but look at the data and look at what customers’ priorities are when they’re buying vehicles, they don’t talk about nox,” he said.
he said the scandal had had some effect on its sales in november and december but noted that retail orders in december 2015 were actually higher than orders in december 2014. “i think people know there was an error in the testing regime, and they understand in the real world there was no difference at all,” he said.
asked how much more no2 had been emitted as a result of his company cheating on the tests, willis repeated previous assertions that it was impossible to say because there is no agreed standard for “real world” emissions.
mike hawes, chief executive of the society of motor manufacturers and traders, sitting next to willis, said the technology for testing real world emissions had only been available for two to three years.
separately on wednesday, vw’s chief executive matthias müller is meeting regulators in washington to attempt to reach agreement with us authorities on a solution for the affected cars. on sunday he appeared to downplay the idea the company had cheated tests, telling npr it was simply a “technical problem” not an “ethical problem”."

Yale’s environmental performance index ranks countries’ performance in protecting human health and ecosystems, and looks at nine areas including air quality, climate and energy, forests and water resources.
When Australia’s climate change policies were questioned in November, the environment minister relied on the index to defend its record. “The Yale environment performance index, the most credible, scientifically based, hard data-based analysis in the world, ranks Australia number three of 178 countries in terms of our environmental performance,” he told ABC’s 730.
The index’s report, released this week, shows Australia has dropped 10 places overall, leaving it at 13 out of 180 countries examined. 
 It performed worst in the climate and energy category. It was ranked 150th for its trend in carbon emissions each kilowatt hour, leaving only Saudi Arabia behind among wealthy nations. Overall in the climate and energy category, Australia was ranked 82nd.
While global CO2 emissions appear to have dropped in 2015 for the first time during a period of economic growth, Australia’s emissions have continued to grow. 
Mark Butler, Labor’s spokesman on the environment, told Fairfax Media: “The Yale report states that over the last decade ‘nearly every country has improved it’s [index] score’ – every country, that is, except Australia … The Turnbull government is taking Australia backwards at a shocking pace.”
Hunt’s office has been contacted for comment."

The standard would mark a turning point for efforts to regulate fast-growing emissions from airplanes, which are not covered by December’s much-hailed Paris climate agreement.
The milestone would apply to new models and existing aircraft put into production after 2020, but the EU’s preferred version would be less stringent than alternative US proposals, which the Guardian has also seen. Both blueprints have been filed with the UN’s civil aviation agency, Icao, ahead of talks in Montreal next month.
“The US proposal is definitely more ambitious,” said Joris Melkert, a former flight test engineer and senior aerospace lecturer at Delft University in the Netherlands. “It would save more emissions, and the difference is quite considerable.”
The gap between the two proposals is greater than the annual emissions of most medium-sized European countries, and privately confirmed by EU officials. 
Aviation is responsible for around 5% of the world’s global warming at present and the industry is growing so fast that, on current trends, it could make up 22% of global emissions by 2050, according to a recent European Parliament study.
The Icao talks are pursuing a twin track approach of making airlines pay a cost for their CO2 output under a market-based scheme, and greening aircraft with a new fuel efficiency standard.
 The debate on the standard began in 2007 and proposals agreed in Montreal will be sent on to an Icao council for approval next year. “After many years, decision time has finally come,” one EU official said. “I believe that we are going to have an ambitious standard and I hope we can secure it next month.”
Airplanes emit CO2 in the process of burning engine fuel to provide a lift force that can overcome the aerodynamic drag created by wind resistance. For this reason, the Icao proposals focus on measures to improve planes’ aerodynamics, lightness and engines.
Under the technical proposals, a stringency option of ‘9’ suggested by the US would reduce overall aircraft emissions by 37.5%, while the ‘7’ setting favoured by the EU would imply a 33% cut. The 4.5% gap is equal to 350m tonnes of CO2, or slightly more than Spain emits every year.
EU officials privately concede that their proposal is “the second most ambitious of the positions put on the table”. But they insist that it is still “quite close to the US one” and that the agreement’s small print on cargo aircraft and categorisations should not be overlooked. 
Environmentalists argue that the involvement of the Environmental Protection Agency and an unshackled president Obama in the US has contributed to the relative weakness of the EU’s position.
But insiders in Brussels say that the sheer variety of complex issues still to be agreed – and the amount of aircraft manufacturing countries involved, from Brazil and Ukraine to India and China – make like-for-like comparisons unwise, and stringency factors of ‘10’ impossible.
“There are so many parameters to be decided that it creates a lot of pieces you can move around on a chessboard,” one EU source told the Guardian.
Europe has proposed a 60 tonne threshold for classifying aircraft, as this could cover 90% of emissions and apply to aircraft of the size of a Boeing 737 or Airbus 320 and above.
But the classification would be further sub-divided between new model types and those in production; jets ferrying 19 people or less, and planes carrying freight instead of passengers. Alternate starting dates of 2020 and 2023 for the benchmark are other options under discussion.
An EU source said: “We need a standard that reflects the state of art of the technology, that is as close as possible to what engineers are capable of doing, without going so high that a number of 60-tonne aircraft types would be put out of the market as that would be environmentally unhelpful, economically detrimental and also quite unfair, as lead-in times for aircraft take about 10 years.”"

Last year it emerged that Volkswagen had cheated on tests for emissions of nitrogen oxides (chemical name NOx), the name for the toxic gases nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (chemical name NO2), both of which are found in diesel fumes. Paul Willis, managing director of VW UK, told MPs on Wednesday that tackling NO2 emissions could come at the expense of cutting carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from cars – the greenhouse gas seen as a major contributor to climate change.
NO2 is responsible for nearly 6,000 annual premature deaths in London, parts of which breached annual limits last week.
“I would say that unless we have a significant diesel mix in Europe, within our fleet, we will miss that target, not VW, the industry will miss that [CO2] target,” said Willis, referring to the EU target of an average new car emitting 95g CO2 per kilometre by 2021, compared to an average of 123.4g CO2 per km in 2014.
Transport is responsible for around a quarter of European Union greenhouse gas emissions, so moves to cut them are seen as vital to climate change efforts.
During an often heated exchange with environment, food and rural affairs committee MPs, Willis defended VW’s environmental record but conceded the company had to win back consumer trust after the revelations last year that 12m of its cars were equipped with “defeat devices” to cheat NOx emissions tests.
“For almost everyone in our company to learn what we learned in September [when the scandal emerged] was very difficult for us to swallow and very difficult for us to understand. I think you heard the apologies I made at that time and I’m still really sorry for that.” He said the company would redouble efforts to win back trust.
But owners of the 1.2m VW cars in the UK affected by the diesel emissions testing scandal should not receive any compensation because they have not suffered any loss, he argued. “To pay compensation, there has to be a loss. At this stage I see no reason for there to be a loss. The adjustment of the software, our engineers are telling us, there will be no difference in in fuel consumption as a result of this fix. 
“The other area is on the question of residual values, I have seen no clear evidence there has been any adverse impact on residual values.”
A survey last year found that nine out of 10 VW drivers in Britain affected by the scandal believed they should receive compensation, in addition to the software fix that VW is rolling out to customers.
Asked whether consumers would begin to factor health into their purchasing decisions, Willis said that pollution emissions were not a priority for most car-buyers.
“I’m sorry to tell you but look at the data and look at what customers’ priorities are when they’re buying vehicles, they don’t talk about NOx,” he said.
He said the scandal had had some effect on its sales in November and December but noted that retail orders in December 2015 were actually higher than orders in December 2014. “I think people know there was an error in the testing regime, and they understand in the real world there was no difference at all,” he said.
Asked how much more NO2 had been emitted as a result of his company cheating on the tests, Willis repeated previous assertions that it was impossible to say because there is no agreed standard for “real world” emissions.
Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, sitting next to Willis, said the technology for testing real world emissions had only been available for two to three years.
Separately on Wednesday, VW’s chief executive Matthias Müller is meeting regulators in Washington to attempt to reach agreement with US authorities on a solution for the affected cars. On Sunday he appeared to downplay the idea the company had cheated tests, telling NPR it was simply a “technical problem” not an “ethical problem”."

The new data is good news for the fight against climate change but bad for the struggling global coal industry.
China saw a huge increase in coal-burning for power and industry in the last two decades but has suffered serious air pollution as a result. However in recent years there has been a surge in low-carbon energy and a slowdown in the economy - GDP growth fell in 2015 to its lowest in 25 years - as China moves away from manufacturing.
The result is that global carbon emissions are set to continue the fall seen in 2015 for the first time outside of worldwide recessions, potentially for many years.
“This trend may continue for 3-5 years or even longer,” said Li Junfeng, director general at the National Climate Change Strategy Research and International Cooperation Centre, a thinktank close to China’s government. “Today’s figures are sending the strong signal of the clear acceleration of China’s energy transition. I think thermal [coal] power generation will continue to drop with an annual speed of 2-4% and the non-fossil power generation will stay in a high growth rate of 20%.”
Tim Buckley, at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said: “The implications of these changes are huge. China’s total emissions are on track to peak potentially a decade earlier than their official target of no later than 2030.
“This comes at the same time that the US has confirmed a 10% year-on-year decline in coal consumption in 2015, plus a three-year moratorium of new federal coal mine leases. That the largest economies globally are moving rapidly in concert to exceed the Paris [climate change] agreement sets a very positive scene for 2016.”
China’s coal use has fallen in 2015 across a wide range of measures and its national carbon emissions are likely to have fallen by about 3% as a result. There was a 3.5% drop in coal production, coal-fired electricity generation fell 2.8% and overall power generation dropped 0.2%, the first fall in 50 years. There were similar decreases in coal-intensive heavy industry such as iron, steel and cement. 
Other recent developments were coal imports to China plummeting by 35% year-on-year in December 2015 and the government’s ban on new coal mines for three years.
In contrast, renewables investment in China hit an all-time high in 2015 at $110bn. Overall low-carbon electricity generation - hydro, wind, nuclear and solar - increased more than 20% in 2015.
“The growth of non-fossil-fuel power generation in China in the past few years is the largest deployment of renewable energy in history,” said Greenpeace’s Lauri Myllyvirta. “This has enabled China to cover a 20% increase in power demand from 2011 to 2015 with clean energy while reducing coal use in the power sector, an astounding achievement.”
Benjamin Sporton, chief executive at the World Coal Association, said: “The cyclical slowdown in economic growth in China is affecting all energy and commodity markets, including coal. Long-term forecasts however show that coal will remain the backbone of the Chinese electricity mix for decades to come and that China will remain the world’s largest producer and consumer of coal.”
He said the International Energy Agency expects coal demand in south-east Asia to grow at 4.6% a year through to 2040.
“Rather than focussing on short-term fluctuations and wishing coal away, it is important to focus on making sure coal is used in the cleanest way possible with high-efficiency low-emission plants using modern emission control technologies and working to develop carbon capture and storage,” Sporton said.
But Li said: “Coal production and consumption [in China] has entered into a turning point since 2014. Even if it bounces back in the future, it will not be big bounce.”
A series of major coal companies have gone bankrupt in recent years, as the international coal price fell by 60% since 2011. The second biggest coal miner in the US, Arch Coal, filed for bankruptcy last week. Investment bank Goldman Sachs declared in January 2015 that the fuel had reached “retirement age”."

For the environment, though, it should at least mean that more fossil fuels stay in the ground";"A decade ago, British civil servants were packed off on a training day about, in a then-fashionable phrase, future-proofing UK plc. The idea was to game the mid-century economy on a range of feasible assumptions, one of which concerned the oil price. There was an “expected case” for 2050 of $45 a barrel, a “best case” of $35 and a “worst case” of $55. So much for the bureaucratic imagination. Over the short years since, the price has twice been more than double the so-called worst case, and then twice also come skidding down by two-thirds.
We are currently in the midst of a great oil collapse, with prices sinking to within touching distance of $30 on Tuesday afternoon, 73% down on 18 months ago. As with every climb up and every slip down the greasy price pole, analysts are scrambling around to figure out whether the change will endure. Nobody can know, but when financial sentiment swings, some always conclude that it will soon swing even harder. The RBS note for investors which this week unleashed a note of panic by advising them to “sell everything” mentioned the possibility of $16 a barrel, a number with little obvious basis apart from being half the current price.
But there are solid reasons why the world has now convinced itself that oil is worth much less than before. On one side of the ledger there is supply, not only of oil itself, but also of the other fossil fuels which can often substitute for it, notably gas, which is more abundant than anyone would have imagined a few years ago, courtesy of the fracking boom. On the demand side, things have been developing even more rapidly, with a serious slowdown in the resource-intensive emerging economies, above all debt-laden China. The fracking revolution will not be reversed, and it increasingly looks like the Chinese flu will be hard to shake. All of which suggests that low oil prices could be here for a while.
So is this a good thing or not? The potentially profound geopolitical consequences are considered in today’s other editorial. Economically, the standard western assumption is that cheap oil is a boon. Certainly, price spikes have arrived shortly before recessions, as in 1973, 1979-80 and 1990. But cheap oil can be a consequence as well as a cause of economic weakness, as it was in 2008, when it became a mere symptom of the great recession. The best that can be said of cheap oil today is that the global slowdown would be sharper without it.
What of the environmental effect? Here, although the story is complex, there is more reason for optimism. Start with the premise of the Guardian’s Keep it in the Ground campaign, that the only way to avoid catastrophic climate change is to leave the bulk of the world’s remaining fossil fuels where they are. Cheap oil encourages waste; worse, it discourages investment in a more efficient “energy infrastructure”. Renewables, as well as upgrades to clean up fossil fuel power stations, yield less return. Drivers feel less pressed to trade in their SUV for a G-Wiz, and car manufacturers are less inclined to concentrate R&amp;D on fuel economy.
But cheap oil also discourages investment in fossil fuel extraction. Already, this week has seen BP scale back its North Sea operation. Indeed, one reason why the Saudis are prepared to endure $30 a barrel is because they hope it will discourage American frackers from switching their focus from gas to oil, and making investments that – once the capital is sunk – become too costly to abandon. If “keeping it in the ground” is indeed the priority, this is the worst outcome of all; by discouraging it, cheap oil is a force to the good.
Bargain-basement energy should also be the spur for far-sighted politicians to act on carbon pricing and other regulations and taxes that can’t be done when prices are high. In Paris last month, world leaders wrote post-dated cheques to the planet. Cheap oil is the opportunity to make a down payment."

The annual assessment of risks conducted by the WEF before its annual meeting in Davos on 20-23 January showed that global warming had catapulted its way to the top of the list of concerns.
A failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation was seen as likely to have a bigger impact than the spread of weapons of mass destruction, water crises, mass involuntary migration and a severe energy price shock – the first time in the 11 years of the Global Risks report that the environment has been in first place. 
The report, prepared by the WEF in collaboration with risk specialists Marsh &amp; McLennan and Zurich Insurance Group, comes a month after the deal signed in Paris to reduce carbon emissions. The WEF said evidence was mounting that inter-connections between risks were becoming stronger. It cited links between climate change and involuntary migration or international security, noting that these often had “major and unpredictable impacts”.
Espen Barth Eide, the WEF’s head of geopolitical affairs, said there was a risk of Europe fragmenting as a result of “people on the move”.
Speaking at a press conference in London to launch the report, Eide said: “I am concerned about the continued support in national politics for keeping Europe together.”
Eide added that if enough countries decided to pursue a non-integrated approach to coping with migration it would have “profound effects on Europe’s politics and its economy”, and would have a knock-on impact on the rest of the world. “If things unravel at the core, what does it mean in other parts of the world?”
Cecilia Reyes, Zurich’s chief risk officer, said: “Climate change is exacerbating more risks than ever before in terms of water crises, food shortages, constrained economic growth, weaker societal cohesion and increased security risks. 
“Meanwhile, geopolitical instability is exposing businesses to cancelled projects, revoked licences, interrupted production, damaged assets and restricted movement of funds across borders. These political conflicts are in turn making the challenge of climate change all the more insurmountable – reducing the potential for political cooperation, as well as diverting resource, innovation and time away from climate change resilience and prevention.” 
The WEF said the broad range of risks – from environmental to geopolitical and economic – was unprecedented. 
It added that risks appeared to be rising, with global average surface temperatures increasing by more than 1C over pre-industrial levels for the first time, and the number of forcibly displaced people at 59.5 million – almost 50% more than in 1940, when the second world war was being fought. “Data from the report appears to support the increased likelihood of risks across the board, with all 24 of the risks continuously measured since 2014 having increased their likelihood scores in the past three years,” the WEF said.
When asked which risk was most likely to materialise in 2016, respondents chose large-scale involuntary migration. This follows last year’s refugee crisis, in which hundreds of thousands of people arrived in Europe fleeing conflicts in the Middle East and north Africa.
This was followed by extreme weather events, climate change, interstate conflict with regional consequences, and major natural catastrophes.
“Events such as Europe’s refugee crisis and terrorist attacks have raised global political instability to its highest level since the cold war,” said John Drzik, president of Marsh Global Risk and Specialties. 
“This is widening the backdrop of uncertainty against which international firms will increasingly be forced to make their strategic decisions. The need for business leaders to consider the implications of these risks on their firm’s footprint, reputation and supply chain has never been more pressing.”
Drzik said at the press conference: “Most risks are rising. It’s a riskier world right now.”"

The eighth-grader argues that the candidates are talking about money, religion and immigration, but rarely mentioning the science challenges impacting her future. Singroy says,
If they talk about the big science issues, maybe they’ll actually do something about them.
Her point is well taken. The Republican and Democratic candidates for president both held debates just days after the Paris climate summit, yet the debate moderators didn’t ask a single question about climate science—remarkable considering that climate change has emerged as a major global science, economic, environmental, tech, civil infrastructure, and foreign policy challenge. US journalists have similarly avoided asking the candidates about other major science, health, tech, and environmental issues.
So Susan, who wants to be a scientist, decided to volunteer with other kids to create what may be the most memorable political ad you’ll see all year:
I’m chair of sciencedebate.org, the volunteer-run nonprofit that produced the ad. We’re working with Susanlyn and other kids elevate these issues in the US political dialogue, because they disproportionately affect the next generation. 
Candidates for president attend debates dedicated to economics and foreign policy, but science issues now have an equal or greater impact. Voters—and their kids—deserve a nationally televised discussion dedicated to science, health, tech and the environment.
The public seems to agree. ScienceDebate.org and Research!America, a nonprofit that advocates for medical research, recently commissioned a national poll. We found that 87% of likely voters think the candidates for president ought to be well versed on science issues. 91% of Democrats, 88% of Republicans and 78% of Independents also said the presidential candidates should participate in a debate to discuss key science-based challenges facing the US. 
What would such a debate look like? The possibilities for questions are fascinating, and could fill hours of discussion. Here’s a small sample:
Americans deserve answers to these questions, and thinking about them now will make the candidates better qualified for the job they seek in November.

Activists caught in legal showdown";"‘Delta Five’ blocked oil train in Washington but say their actions were moral as judge gives them a ‘Hail Mary pass’ to argue a ‘necessity defense’";"A jury in Washington state is hearing evidence on whether the threat of climate change is a justifiable defense for criminal acts, the first time such a defense has been allowed in an American court.
On Thursday, in a tiny municipal courtroom amid the strip malls and ranch houses of this suburban community north of Seattle, defense attorneys for five climate activists will call the final witnesses in their “Hail Mary pass” that has set up a historic legal showdown.
The five activists – Michael LaPointe, Patrick Mazza, Jackie Minchew, Elizabeth Spoerri and Abigail Brockway – face misdemeanor charges of criminal trespass and obstructing a train for a September 2014 protest. The group erected an 18ft metal tripod over railway tracks in Everett, Washington, in order to block train shipments of crude oil and coal. 
The defendants – who have been dubbed the “Delta Five” by their supporters – admit they knowingly broke the law in stopping the train. Their unique legal argument, known as a “necessity defense”, is that their actions were a moral imperative because not breaking the law would result in catastrophic harm to the planet.
Though the necessity defense was used successfully by climate change activists in England in 2008, it has yet to be allowed and tested in a trial in the United States. 
That changed last Thursday when Snohomish County judge Anthony E Howard reversed his own ruling to permit the activists’ lawyers to present the necessity defense after hearing oral arguments from MJ McCallum and Evelyn Chuang. 
Arguing for the necessity defense was a “Hail Mary pass”, said McCallum, and one that, improbably, met its mark.
Whether the jury is allowed to consider that evidence in their deliberations remains uncertain. After the defense testimony concludes on Thursday, the judge will determine how to instruct the jury. It’s then that he will decide whether he’s heard a strong enough case to allow the six-member jury to take the threat of climate change into account in rendering their verdict.

Outside the courtroom on Wednesday, sheriff’s deputies pushed through the narrow corridor, escorting handcuffed men in variations on the Pacific north-west uniform of jeans, flannel, and rain gear, past the crowd of supporters, journalists, and documentary film-makers jockeying for seats inside.
Inside the courtroom, the counsel table in Judge Howard’s six-sided courtroom was excessively crowded with five defendants, four defense attorneys, and prosecutor Adam Sturdivant, who was pushed to the far left end with little space to rest his yellow legal pad and copies of the 2016 Washington Court Rules and Courtroom Handbook on Washington Evidence.
It’s an apt metaphor for the trial itself, in which the everyday machinery of the municipal criminal justice system has been shoved aside for loftier arguments about justice and democracy.
Having opened the door to testimony from climate scientists, Judge Howard also appeared inclined to allow expansive testimony from the defendants. He has permitted each defendant to testify to their personal history as activists, mapping their development from idealistic voters to frustrated believers in the necessity of civil disobedience.
“It felt like projects were being rubber-stamped no matter what we did,” Brockway said of her years spent writing letters to officials and testifying at hearings on environmental issues. “Before I switched to direct action, I felt I worked within the system as much as I could.”
That the defendants exhausted all the legal means of political persuasion available to US citizens in order to achieve their goals is a key factor of the necessity defense, McCallum explained. The defendants must show that they reasonably believed their actions were necessary, that the harm they sought to prevent was greater than the harm of breaking the law, that they didn’t create the laws they broke, and that they had no reasonable legal alternative. 
By eliciting testimony that the activists had no reasonable legal alternative to prevent the catastrophic effects of climate change, the defense team is building a depressing but compelling argument against the efficacy of American democracy and government. 
“The reality of climate urgency will force judges and juries to rethink what is ‘reasonable’, because the process of law is so slow,” said Mary Wood, a professor of environmental law at the University of Oregon. “As scientists urge immediate action to slash carbon emissions, many drawn-out political and legal processes that may have been ‘reasonable’ to pursue two decades ago now extend beyond the short window of time left available to act.”
In the face of these lofty arguments, the prosecutor was stuck on the defensive. In the cross examination, Sturdivant (who declined to speak with the Guardian) asked Gammon whether there was any scientific evidence that illegal protest was more effective than legal protest and asked Brockway whether her arrest had succeeded in drawing a response from Washington’s governor, Jay Inslee. Both Gammon and Brockway answered no. 
As for Millar, who testified at length to the threat of trains carrying crude oil that are “too long, too heavy, and going too fast”, Sturdivant had no questions at all. 
Tim DeChristopher, a 34-year-old climate activist and the closest thing the Snohomish County south district court has had to a celebrity this week, views this trial as “the culmination of seven years of his life”. When DeChristopher enters into a conversation, other activists drift in his direction, just to listen to what he is saying.
Standing outside the court room during a lunch recess, DeChristopher recalls reading about the successful necessity defense in England. In 2008, a jury acquitted six Greenpeace protesters who argued their occupation and damage to a Kingsnorth coal-fired power station in Kent was justified by the threat of climate change. 
Inspired by that case, DeChristopher decided to test his own luck. In December 2008, he infiltrated a Bureau of Land Management auction, bidding on and winning the right to drill on land with no intention of following through with the $1.8m payment. But a judge refused to allow DeChristopher to mount a necessity defense. He was found guilty of defrauding the government in 2011 and eventually served 21 months in jail.
In 2013, DeChristopher helped organize another protest designed to test the necessity defense – this time with two activists using their lobster boat to block the delivery of coal to a New England power plant. The judge in the case decided to allow the defense, but at the last minute, the prosecutor decided to drop the charges, stating that he agreed with the defendants and could not argue against the urgency of climate change. 
DeChristopher says that the Delta Five train protest was designed to bring about a trial such as this one, and he hopes the third time is the charm. He compares the climate movement’s legal strategy to the civil rights and women’s suffrage movements. 
“The legal structure was not designed to address the rights of those people,” he says, until it was forced to change through acts of civil disobedience. “I believe we’re in the same situation. Our legal system was not designed to protect the rights of future generations.”

Worse than the dead birds, though, are the birds seen swimming in the rare pockets of open water along the fast-flowing Susitna and Yentna rivers. These are starving animals still struggling to live, and yet doomed to die prematurely.
Wildlife scientists say the dead and dying birds – 18in tall common murres – are only a few among what might be as many as 100,000 or more of their species losing the battle to survive in the storm-pounded North Pacific Ocean.
Since late summer, thousands of murres have washed up dead on beaches along the Gulf of Alaska after apparently dying at sea. Others were strong enough to get airborne in fall or winter only to be swept inland as seasonal storms roiled the offshore waters.
An estimated 8,000 dead murres showed up on the beaches near Whittier, an isolated community of only about 220 people 60 miles south-east of here. Thousands more were found dead near Homer, a popular summer tourist destination 125 miles to the south that is home to about 5,000 year-round residents.
As yet, no has any clue as to exactly how many carcasses litter the remote and little visited beaches along the hundreds of miles of undeveloped coast that rims the Alaska gulf, according to John Piatt at the Alaska Science Center of the US Geological Survey. The full death count might never be known.
Piatt has spent almost 30 years studying Alaska murres and other seabirds. He has seen big die-offs before. He and other researchers estimated 120,000 murres died of starvation in the winter of 1993. About 185,000 were calculated to have perished after being smeared with a mousse-like emulsion of water and oil that spewed out of Prince William Sound and rampaged north across the gulf after the Exxon Valdez oil tanker spilled 11m gallons of crude oil in1989.
What has been different this time is the number of dying murres pushed inland by an oscillating jet stream that has played havoc with Alaska weather for the past two winters. Some blame climate change, but climate experts say it is hard determine whether Alaska is witnessing a long-term shift or only a strange, short-term anomaly in a region where the weather is notoriously unpredictable.
Whichever the case, winds that normally blow west to east across the Pacific have been eddying into a south to north pattern as the atmosphere swirls like a whirlpool in a river. Starving murres still strong enough to get airborne have found themselves caught in warm, moist winds of up to 100mph roaring north out of the gulf into the heart of the 49th state.
Thousands, possibly tens of thousands, of the birds rode these winds until they faded only to find themselves stranded and awaiting death far from their natural habitat. Some birds were pushed over the towering Alaska Range mountains into the bitterly cold Alaska interior hundreds of miles from the sea.
Most, however, came to earth near this city or just to the north in the Matanuska-Susitna Valley. Urban Alaskans rallied to save those found on or adjacent to the state’s few roadways. 
The Bird Treatment and Learning Center here has taken in 411 murres since October, said director Guy Runco. In a normal year, the center handles 600 to 700 birds of all species. One or two of them might be murres. “It’s really strange,’’ Runco said.
Rehabilitating malnourished murres has taxed the center’s finance and its staff of volunteers, and there’s no telling if saving the murres has had any environmental value. Released back into the wild fat and well fed, they could just end up starving again.
Murres need to eat about a fiftieth of their body weight in small fish per day to survive. Piatt and other scientists said the birds are obviously having problems finding enough food. The causes could be a decline in forage fish or simply a shift in where the forage fish feed.
Some have pondered climate change there, too. The forage fish thrive in cold water, and the water in the gulf has been unusually warm this year. It could be the fish declined because of this – or that they moved away from the normal feeding grounds of the murre as they sought cooler waters.
The murre die-off, though dramatic, is not thought to be any threat to the species as a whole given that there are an estimated 2.8 million breeding murres in 230 nesting colonies in Alaska. There are also animals that have benefited from the tragedy of the murres.
“The eagles are eating well,’’ Runco said. Alaska’s bald eagles are notoriously efficient scavengers. So, too, the state’s ravens, magpies, coyotes, foxes, mink, weasels and other animals.
Jean Gabryszak, whose family runs the remote Yentna Station Roadhouse, said: “The ravens are all fat and happy.’’"

“Greenhouse gas emissions are loading the weather dice towards these warmer, wetter winters,” said Friederike Otto, scientific coordinator of the climateprediction.net project, which harnessed the collective power of roughly 70,000 home computers to run thousands of climate models extremely quickly. 
The results, which were analysed at the University of Oxford and the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, showed natural variation was equally influential in stocking the storms with rain and hurling them at northern Britain.
“Chance still played a large role in December’s weather,” said Otto, pointing to an abnormally large difference in water temperature in the east and west Atlantic. She said the possible contribution of the massive Pacific El Niño was still uncertain.
Throughout the last month of 2015, a succession of brutal storms - Desmond, Eva and Frank - struck the UK. Farmland and towns in Cumbria, Lancashire, Yorkshire and Scotland were submerged in deadly and heartbreaking floods.
It was the wettest December since records began 105 years before. At the same time, the UK average temperature was 8C, 4.1C above normal. The previous warmest December was in 1934 and was 6C on average.
Some of the rainfall can be explained by what is known as the thermodynamic effect. Warm air can carry more water, which means precipitation events become larger and more frequent in a warmed climate. But this had only increased the risk of such a wet December by around 7%.
The study, which was released publicly before being submitted to a scientific journal, simulated a world in which the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere had not occurred and found that in the real world Britain was 50-70% more likely to receive the catastrophic rainfall levels of last month. 
Otto postulated that disturbances of atmospheric pressure systems, caused by warming, was responsible for much of the increased risk. But this analysis had not yet been conducted.
The Met Office’s Peter Stott, who was not involved in the study, said it added further credence to the long-held prediction that climate change would bring wetter conditions to some parts of the globe and could be seen as broadly indicative of the role of climate change in the December floods.
“That is robust,” he said. He said the use of home computers to simultaneously run thousands of experiments dramatically increased the turn around of research, but he cautioned they were not powerful enough to run the most up to date global climate models.
“I think the uncertainty is potentially larger than the 50-75% [indicated in the study],” he said. “We are looking at very extreme parts of the calculations and it’s hard to be precise when we are talking about rare events like this.”
Nick Reynard, lead natural hazard scientist at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, said the picture was further complicated trying to link increased rainfall to flooding.
He said rainfall was known to be generally increasing in the UK, but at the same time “there is little compelling evidence for any upward trend in long records of flood magnitude or frequency”. This counter-intuitive finding was due to the differing ways particular catchments respond to heavy rain; some are known to be highly resistant to large events.
The links between extreme weather and climate change are now widely reported in academic papers. So perhaps more remarkable than the findings themselves, is the speed at which scientists are able to draw links between events. In the past, this work has taken months, even years. Thursday’s preliminary study has been released before the waters have even receded and is one of the fastest such analyses ever conducted.
Scientists told the Age newspaper in Australia last year that they were trying to adapt their responses to events in order to fit with the media cycle. Stott said the inclination to release preliminary results was understandable. 
“The media, and people generally, are asking these questions as the flooding is happening or in the immediate aftermath. But we shouldn’t forget that as we seek to have the right policies and advise government about how best to protect ourselves from flooding, for that we need a carefully considered scientific analysis. You’ve got to be careful of over-interpreting very rapid studies,” he said.
Richard Black, the director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank said the emergence of attribution science - our ability to find the fingerprints of climate change in individual weather events - was “one of the most exciting developments in the climate change field”.
“Only a few years ago scientists had to make do with saying things like ’this or that weather event is consistent with what we’d expect’ - but now, increasingly, it’s possible to determine whether climate change is increasing the risks of particular weather events, and by how much,” he said.
“That in turn gives policymakers the economic rationale they need to justify emission reduction programmes, as well as increasing the chances of legal action in future if decision-makers don’t act on the science.”"

Hurricane Alex’s maximum sustained winds were near 85mph (140kmh) and residents of Portugal’s mid-Atlantic Azores islands were warned to expect waves up to 60ft (18 metres) high and wind gusts up to 100mph.
The islands’ Civil Protection Service issued a weather red alert, the highest of four warnings that indicates extreme risk, for five of the archipelago’s nine islands. 
The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) in Miami said in a Facebook post there hadn’t been a hurricane present during the month of January since 1955, when Alice formed in late December 1954 and continued into the next month.
The hurricane was centred about 350 miles south of Faial Island in the central Azores and was moving north-north-east at about 22mph. Alex was expected to move near or over parts of the Azores on Friday, the NHC said.
The Azores government on Thursday advised kindergartens to stay closed and told residents to ensure drainage systems were not blocked.
The archipelago, which has a population of about 250,000, has been threatened by hurricanes before, but they usually lose their strength as they move into colder northern water.
Alex formed only days after a rare event in the Pacific. An El Niño-related tropical storm formed south-west of Hawaii last week. Tropical Storm Pali, only the third such system to develop in January in more than 40 years, had weakened to a depression by Thursday and was expected to dissipate in the next day or so. It never made landfall.
Alex’s formation, however, had nothing to do with El Niño, said Mike Halpert, the deputy director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Climate Prediction Center in the US. 
The NOAA researcher Jim Kossin said the water in which Alex formed was about 1.7C to 2.2C (3F to 4F) warmer than normal, but still barely warm enough for a storm to form."

Speaking at a Guardian Sustainable Business debate on the role of business in tackling climate change, Garrett-Cox, herself an outspoken advocate on the issue, said: “Within the last 12 months, I’ve had conversations with CEOs of major corporates in Europe and they just say, ‘It’s not real, it’s not something I should be bothered about’.” It is “scary” how little discussion there is at boardroom level about whether climate change is a risk at all, she added.
One month on from a landmark climate change deal at UN talks in Paris, Garrett-Cox hopes this will be the tipping point for businesses waking up to climate change. Ikea’s sustainability chief Steve Howard agreed, saying 2016 presents the corporate world with “an unprecedented opportunity” to reinvent its business models in line with the challenge.
However, speaking at the event, the UK’s only Green party MP Caroline Lucas said the government was making this transition more difficult: “This is a government that doesn’t like scrutiny ... and that’s part of the whole way it’s going about its green policies.” 
The UK government has been widely criticised since its election in May for making a series of changes to environmental policy such as scrapping subsidies for onshore wind, ending the green deal scheme that helps homeowners insulate their homes and cutting support for the solar industry, which has since seen a number of firms going into liquidation.
“What this government is doing in the name of being business friendly is constantly moving the goalposts so that no one knows where it’s going to be safe to invest,” she said. “The green economy is actually one of the best places to invest for jobs, to enable us to get out of the economic crisis we face as well as to keep emissions down.”
And moving to a green economy means rethinking consumption patterns, especially in the west, according to Howard . “If we look on a global basis, in the west we have probably hit peak stuff. We talk about peak oil. I’d say we’ve hit peak red meat, peak sugar, peak stuff … peak home furnishings. If you look on a global basis, most people are still poor and most people actually haven’t got to sufficiency yet. There is a global growth opportunity ... but it’s a distribution issue.”
Ikea has hit the headlines for introducing a raft of environmental policies in the last year. It has pledged to invest €1bn (£755m) in renewable energy and measures to help poorer communities deal with the impacts of climate change; announced that 100% of the energy used to power its shops and factories will come from clean sources by 2020; and phased out all non-LED lightbulbs from its stores.
Leading climate change scientist Kevin Anderson, from the Tyndall Centre for Climate Research, was more sceptical and said the idea that the green economy would enable people in the west to consume more was irreconcilable with international climate change commitments.
“At a global level – if you want to see any level of equity around the globe – the idea that people like us can consume and see improvements in material wellbeing is to me not compatible with what the science is telling us about climate change … there are real problems if we try to tell people that, actually, if we’re really clever in the wealthy parts of the world that we can have our cake and eat it. That misunderstands the severity of the challenge we’re facing.”
Anderson said that in the future it could be necessary to introduce a shorter working week, he added.
“Under the current model you need growth because there is a pursuit of productivity, which people always say is a good thing. If we have an increase in productivity that means you have fewer people producing the same number of goods. If you want to then maintain employment you have to maintain growth to have the same number of people employed,” he said.
“So you have to start unpicking all these pieces and saying, ‘Well what would that mean for our society?’ There are different reasons why we might be looking at a world where we have to work fewer hours. We consume fewer goods but we have a higher quality of life in that time that we have available.”

Politicians need to spell out how science will inform their decisions";"Musician Billy Bragg and President Barack Obama would probably enjoy a beer together. “Cynicism is our great enemy,” said Bragg in a 2010 interview. “If we, coming together, can’t overcome our cynicism, then there really is no hope. We just might as well pack up and go home.”
Tuesday night, in his final State of the Union address, Obama spent the majority of his time detailing his legacy and his vision for the nation. The clarion call came towards the end:
It’s easier to be cynical; to accept that change isn’t possible, and politics is hopeless, and to believe that our voices and actions don’t matter. But if we give up now, then we forsake a better future. Those with money and power will gain greater control over the decisions that could send a young soldier to war, or allow another economic disaster, or roll back the equal rights and voting rights that generations of Americans have fought, even died, to secure. As frustration grows, there will be voices urging us to fall back into tribes, to scapegoat fellow citizens who don’t look like us, or pray like us, or vote like we do, or share the same background. 
They’re both right. Cynicism creates a toxic environment that makes change and community less possible. We hear it from elected officials who say we can’t grow the economy while protecting the environment. We hear it from those who base their decisions regarding refugees on fear, not data. 
The biggest danger, however, comes from our own resignation. We see the deck stacked against us and we give up. We begin to see all government officials and business leaders as part of the same rigged game. We disengage. Nobody wants to be a chump.
So how do we avoid a descent into cynicism? The President’s address offers a few more clues: 
Most of all, democracy breaks down when the average person feels their voice doesn’t matter; that the system is rigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some narrow interest.
Obama alluded several times to reducing money in politics. Money doesn’t necessarily buy votes, but it does buy outsized access to shape the agenda. And as more and more dollars flow into the political system, it has become considerably harder to track where the money is coming from. 
Campaign finance reform, however, is not the sole provenance of Congress. There is a step that the President can take right now to create more transparency and accountability: issue an executive order to require federal contractors to disclose their political spending. This move is supported by scores of Democratic legislators. Why won’t he act? 
Sixty years ago, when the Russians beat us into space, we didn’t deny Sputnik was up there. We didn’t argue about the science, or shrink our research and development budget. We built a space program almost overnight, and twelve years later, we were walking on the moon.
In the wake of the historic Paris climate agreement The Guardian’s Fiona Harvey called “the world’s greatest diplomatic success,” governments and companies worldwide are moving forward with plans to cut carbon emissions and move toward more sustainable energy sources. 
Unfortunately, Congress seems to be moving in the opposite direction. House Science Committee Chairman Lamar Smith recently attacked the integrity of government climate change scientists, suggesting their research on the surface temperature record was fraudulent. The chairman subpoenaed scientists’ deliberative correspondence, and suggested that the journal Science had some kind of hidden agenda for publishing the peer-reviewed research. He has since temporarily suspended some of his demands. People within Chairman Smith’s party should push back against this behavior, and the Obama administration should continue implement its Climate Action Plan. 
Democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise; or when even basic facts are contested, and we listen only to those who agree with us.
We need presidential candidates to talk more about how science will inform their decisions, and whom they will trust for information. Recently, a group of kids filmed a public service announcement detailing the science-based issues that they want the candidates to address: drinking water, vaccinations, honeybees, the war on drugs.
The organization that sponsored that announcement, Science Debate, is trying to get the candidates to address these kinds of issues, and the chair of Science Debate, Shawn Otto, has blogged about the initiative at the Guardian Environment blog. The video is worth a watch. And then it’s worth heading over to Science Debate’s website to endorse their effort. 
Much of what President Obama said concerns the relationship between evidence and democracy. Societies function better when they can unite around a common knowledge base. We should all reject the path of cynicism and the notion that we should stop using our voices to restore science to its rightful place in society.

On Friday, the campaigners were convicted in a court in suburban Seattle of misdemeanor trespassing relating to a September 2014 protest in which they blocked railway tracks used by crude oil trains in Everett, Washington. 
They were acquitted of a second count of misdemeanor obstructing a train.
The so-called “Delta 5” – Michael LaPointe, Patrick Mazza, Jackie Minchew, Elizabeth Spoerri and Abigail Brockway – had hoped that their trial would mark the first time that a US jury was allowed to consider the “necessity defense” in a case of climate activism. 
The defendants intended to argue that their acts, though illegal, were necessary to prevent the greater harm of catastrophic climate change.
But after allowing two days of expert testimony on topics ranging from the Paris climate talks to railway safety standards and the health impacts of particulate matter, Judge Anthony E Howard ruled that the defense had failed to present sufficient evidence to show that the defendants had “no reasonable legal alternative” to trespassing on a private rail yard and blocking trains.
The case is a blow to environmental campaigners but marks the furthest defendants have managed to go in an American courtroom using the so-called “necessity” defense that argues such actions are justified to combat catastrophic climate change. 
The activists progressed unusually far because Howard allowed them to call expert witnesses to testify to the harms of climate change, even though he later felt compelled to instruct the jury to disregard their evidence. The judge appeared to do so reluctantly, expressing some sympathy for the activists in a court on Thursday.
“Frankly the court is convinced that the defendants are far from the problem and are part of the solution to the problem of climate change,” Howard said from the bench. But, he added: “I am bound by legal precedent, no matter what my personal beliefs might be.”
That precedent, including a per se ban on necessity defenses in cases of indirect civil disobedience by the ninth circuit court of appeals, is overwhelmingly against the idea that such an argument should be available to defendants. After his ruling, the judge directed the jury to disregard the expert testimony on climate change, public health, and the dangers of transporting crude oil by train.
In an act of judicial consolation, Howard added that he hoped the defendants, whom he described as “tireless advocates of the kind that we need more of in this society”, would find “some value in having been able to present their beliefs in a public forum”. He also allowed an extra 10 minutes for lunch on Thursday, in recognition of the fact that he had “just crushed your hopes and dreams”. 
Though the necessity defense dominated the proceedings in the courtroom, it is something of a legal oddity that MJ McCallum, Bridge Joyce and Evelyn Chuang – three of the four lawyers on the defense team – recalled learning about in law school through a case of sailors lost at sea who resorted to cannibalism when one of their fellow castaways died of natural causes. (The defendants in Regina v Dudley and Stephens were found guilty when they admitted that they actually murdered the child they ate, but trust a defense team to put a different spin on it.) 
Robert Goldsmith was the sole attorney on the defense team to have argued for necessity, which he did successfully, once, in the 1979 case of 20 protesters who blocked the entrance to the Zion nuclear power plant in Waukegan, Illinois.
Despite the odds, however, the necessity defense remains the holy grail for some climate activists.
“We’re going to keep working with folks to keep pushing these defenses,” said Tim DeChristopher, a climate activist who served 21 months behind bars for a civil disobedience action after a judge refused his attempt to employ the necessity defense. 
DeChristopher’s organization, Climate Disobedience Center, is supporting the efforts of another group that was arrested attempting to block a fracked natural gas pipeline in Westchester County, New York. According to DeChristopher, the protesters will try the necessity defense during a bench trial today, 15 January, in New York. 
The defense has been used successfully in the UK, where a jury acquitted six Greenpeace protesters in 2008 after they argued their occupation and damage to a Kingsnorth coal-fired power station in Kent was justified by the threat of climate change.
Beyond the necessity defense, some climate activists are looking at other strategies in the US to challenge the limitations of statutory law and push for urgent governmental action to limit climate change.
“Our legal principles have to account for the clear, imminent danger perpetrated by the fossil fuel industry,” said Mary Wood, a professor of environmental law at the University of Oregon.
Wood is an advocate for applying “public trust doctrine” to climate change, arguing that a government has a fundamental responsibility to preserve crucial resources like the land, water, and air that “predates statutory law”.
Michael Foster, who attended the Delta Five trial each day, works with Seattle youth who adopted Wood’s theory and sued the Washington state government for failing to adequately protect the environment for their generation.
“The system is broken enough that we have to pursue every other avenue,” Foster said.
In December, a judge issued a ruling in the case, which Foster described as “kickass poetry about the constitutional rights of these kids to air, land, and water”.
Though the loss of the necessity defense in this case was a disappointment, DeChristopher remains hopeful that the law will be pushed to take a different view of climate change civil disobedience. 
“We understand that precedent is not in our favor,” he said, “but we also understand that people’s consciences are hard to oppress.” "

Countries can deliver on the promises of the historic Paris climate change agreement by rapid scaling up wind and solar power to 36% of the global energy mix by 2030, an international energy gathering will be told on Saturday.
The International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) meeting in Abu Dhabi – the first major global gathering since Paris – is seen as an important test of countries’ readiness to put those plans into action.
Nearly 200 countries agreed to keep warming below 2C, and work towards a 1.5C limit, during the Paris climate negotiations last month. Some 187 put forward plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions.
Now comes the hard part, government officials admit: making good on those promises by translating emissions cutting targets into policies, and expanding access to clean energy technologies.
Irena said those goals were within reach – if countries move fast. Scaling up renewable energy to 36% of the global energy mix by 2030 would provide about half of the emissions reductions needed to hold warming to 2C. Energy efficiency could make up the rest.
“The Paris agreement set a long-term vision for the deep reduction of global emissions and the need to decarbonise the energy sector,” Adnan Amin, Irena’s director general said in a prepared statement. “The Irena assembly must now take the next steps and establish a blueprint for action to meet our climate goals and set the world on a path to a sustainable energy future.”
In an effort to spur countries to action, an Irena report released on Saturday found doubling the share of renewables by 2030 would increase global GDP by up to 1.1% or about $1.3tn, and provide jobs for more than 24 million in the renewable sector.
The United Nations climate chief, Christiana Figueres, has said repeatedly she was looking to the Paris agreement to send a clear signal to the business community of a shift away from a fossil-fuel driven economy.
Some of those changes are already underway. Global clean energy investment attracted a record $329bn last year, according to a report released on Thursday by Bloomberg New Energy Finance. 
The report noted the rise in clean energy investment came despite the drop in oil prices.
Irena officials said they hoped that the Paris climate accord would add momentum to the shift.
“We are not seeing climate change action as a cost, but starting to see it in terms of opportunities,” said Angela Kallhauge, Irena’s climate change officer. "

In her first public reflections on the climate accord signed in December, Christiana Figueres, the UN climate change official, said that after two decades of meandering negotiations, countries had at last discovered their “higher purpose” and risen to the challenge of dealing with global warming.
The Paris agreement, in which 195 countries committed to limiting the temperature increase to well below 2C, set a new standard for dealing with complex global problems, she said.
“Climate change is a very, very good example of how we are moving to a completely new social contract from the last century,” Figueres told the Guardian at a conference hosted by the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) in Abu Dhabi. “The social contract that is going to underpin the 21st century has at least five very, very different ways of dealing with challenges and very different ways of delivering solutions.
 “To have Paris is a huge flame of hope. We can really take some confidence from there that if we decide we want to do something, then we can,” said Figueres, who will step down this summer after guiding the negotiations for six years. “We are not bound by situations we are confronted with. We can rise above them. It’s fantastic.”
A number of key players in the Paris climate deal attended the annual Irena conference at the weekend. 
More than 80 countries committed in their climate plans in Paris to expand their use of solar and wind power as a way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. These countries are now looking for financing and technological assistance to make the switch to cleaner energy sources.
Figueres said countries had overcome multiple faultlines to arrive at a deal in Paris – the divide between rich and poor countries, between the public and private sector, between different regions. 
Unlike other negotiations, the Paris climate talks involved governments, business leaders and campaign groups. A number of foreign policy experts have held up Paris as a new model for diplomacy, and commentators have praised the French hosts for skilfully guiding the talks to a successful resolution. “It is the way that we are going to operate increasingly in the 21st century,” Figueres said.
The agreement abandoned the idea of a traditional international treaty with clear rules and fixed obligations, in recognition that the US would never sign on to an agreement that needed approval from a Republican-controlled Senate.
Instead, the agreement relied on countries to come forward with plans for cutting greenhouse gas emissions and then to review those plans at regular intervals to make even deeper cuts. 
Anne-Marie Slaughter, a former US Department of State official and president of the New America Foundation, wrote of the deal in December: “By the standards of a traditional treaty, it falls woefully short. Yet its deficits in this regard are its greatest strengths as a model for effective global governance in the 21st century. The Paris agreement is a sprawling, rolling, overlapping set of national commitments brought about by a broad conglomeration of parties and stakeholders. It is not law. It is a bold move toward public problem-solving on a global scale. And it is the only approach that could work.”
But there have also been a number of high-profile critics of the Paris agreement. James Hansen, the climate scientist, dismissed the agreement as a fraud. Bernie Sanders, the Democratic presidential contender, said the deal went nowhere near far enough. 
Figueres said the 31-page agreement had exceeded her expectations. “The surprise for me was actually the clarity of the text and the way in which governments worked with each other to get to common ideas,” she said. “In previous negotiations, people have got so caught up with the wording itself – this comma, that comma, that verb – that they tripped over themselves and were not able to reach for the stars. In this case they first reached for the stars and then thought: how do we express that?”
She said Paris was the first time in six such climate meetings that she never had a moment when she feared it would all end in a collapse. 
 “At every other one there was at least one moment in which I thought we are going to lose this whole thing,” she said. “This was the first time in which it was so evident that there was overwhelming, not just political will, but political determination to actually come to an agreement.”
And not just an agreement for the sake of it, she said. “The overriding current was getting to an agreement that they could all be proud of. It wasn’t just for a photo.”

Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) and his fellow climate contrarians love the satellite data, but as Carl Mears of the Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) satellite dataset and Ben Santer recently wrote,
 they are not thermometers in space. The satellite [temperature] data ... were obtained from so-called Microwave Sounding Units (MSUs), which measure the microwave emissions of oxygen molecules from broad atmospheric layers. Converting this information to estimates of temperature trends has substantial uncertainties.
Scientists process the raw microwave data, applying a model to make numerous adjustments in order to come up with a synthetic estimate of the atmospheric temperature. Climate scientists have identified many errors in the model, and so it’s undergone several major revisions. It’s a complicated process for many reasons discussed in greater detail in this new Skeptical Science myth rebuttal, and by Mears and Santer. 
For example, satellites have a limited lifetime and are replaced (so far there have been 10 different satellites with MSUs); the MSU instruments change - they now use advanced MSUs (AMSUs); their orbits drift and decay due to friction; clouds get in the way; they have to isolate the data from the different layers of the atmosphere, etc.
In a recent Senate hearing, Ted Cruz and one of his witnesses, Judith Curry, claimed “the satellite data are the best data we have.” Most experts disagree.
At first blush the claim sounds plausible. After all, satellites are high tech! But how do we decide which data are “the best”? That’s a subjective question, but we can apply some objective criteria to answer it.
For example, as humans, we might consider the temperature where we live (at the Earth’s surface) the most important. Satellites estimate the temperature of the atmosphere, most of which is above us. In fact, as John Christy, who runs the University of Alabama at Huntsville (UAH) satellite dataset recently said, 
the main product we use now for greenhouse model validation is the temperature of the Mid-Troposphere
The mid-troposphere is the atmospheric layer from about 25,000–50,000 feet, or about 8–15km in altitude. For perspective, the highest point on the Earth’s surface is on Mount Everest at 29,000 feet (8.8km), and the highest elevation city in the world is La Rinconada, Peru at 16,700 feet (5.1km). So, by this criterion, surface temperature data would be “the best;” better than satellite data because they’re more relevant to people.
Maybe we value the data with the least uncertainty. Because of all the processing, adjustments, and modeling involved in creating the synthetic temperature data, satellite trends have far greater uncertainty than the surface temperature datasets. By this criterion, surface temperature data would again be “the best;” about five times better than satellite data.
Or perhaps we think it’s important that different groups processing the same raw data in different ways arrive at consistent final temperature estimates. This is true for surface temperature data, which are analyzed by NASA, NOAA, the Met Office, Berkeley Earth, Cowtan &amp; Way, the Japan Meteorological Agency, and others. These groups all arrive at consistent end results.
On the other hand, different groups processing the same raw satellite data arrive at very different estimates of the warming trend in the atmosphere. By this criterion, again, surface temperatures beat satellites. As Carl Mears has said,
I consider [surface temperature datasets] to be more reliable than satellite datasets (they certainly agree with each other better than the various satellite datasets do!). 
Maybe we consider it important to measure how much humans are warming the entire planet. Only about 2% of the heat trapped by increased greenhouse effect goes into warming the atmosphere; over 90% goes into warming the oceans. By that criterion, ocean heat content data would be “the best;” far better than satellite data.
One benefit noted by proponents of the satellite data is that it’s validated by weather balloons directly measuring the temperature of the atmosphere. The problem is, the weather balloons indicate that the lower atmosphere has continued to warm in recent years, diverging from the satellite synthetic temperature estimates. That’s not much of an argument in favor of the satellite data.
 In fact, the weather balloon data debunks the “no significant warming since 1998” myth that motivates contrarians like Cruz to cherry pick the satellite data in the first place. It’s also worth noting this myth is based on über cherry picking.
So, the surface temperature data are “best” if you value the least uncertain temperature measurements, of the part of the planet where people live, with consistent results among different groups. The ocean heat data content are “best” if you want the most comprehensive measurement of the warming of the Earth.
The satellite data are best … if you want the data that show the least warming.
As Carl Mears notes starting at the 7:35 mark in the above video, 
Look at all the different datasets. You don’t want to trust only the satellite temperatures, you want to look at the surface temperatures and that sort of thing.
Every other data source paints a consistent picture of global warming – surface thermometers, weather balloons, ocean buoys, and even natural thermometers like rising sea levels, melting land and sea ice, and shifting seasons and species habitats. Even the satellites show a long-term warming trend in the atmosphere.
There is a great irony here. Climate contrarians decry necessary adjustments to raw surface temperature data (even though the adjustments reduce the warming trend), and have even launched inquiries, accusing scientists of conspiring to manipulate the surface temperature data. Yet they have no qualms with the more numerous and complex adjustments made the satellite data. Contrarians claim that models are worthless, and yet unwaveringly trust the models used to turn microwave detections into synthetic temperature estimates. 
There’s excessive “skepticism” applied to the surface temperature data and a serious lack of skepticism of the satellite data. There’s a term that describes this behavior: ‘confirmation bias.’ The data that conflict with contrarian worldviews are rejected, while those that conform to their preconceived biases are accepted. 
In the end, Ted Cruz’s claim is rated false by every objective measure."

Does it offer viable solutions to the widening gap between humanitarian needs and available resources? Is the “grand bargain” it offers enough to transform a struggling aid system?
All eyes are on humanitarian financing in 2016. The World Humanitarian Summit in May is fast approaching and the launch of the report comes against a backdrop of the displacement of millions of people in Syria, Yemen, South Sudan, Iraq and other disaster and conflict-affected countries. Their suffering reminds us of the need to get this right fast.
The report contains many good ideas; the strongest and most exciting are those that speak to audiences beyond the usual humanitarian crowd. For example, giving middle-income countries access to grants and low-income loans to finance large-scale refugee hosting, working with the insurance industry to adapt its risk-financing strategies to humanitarian situations, and tapping into the billions of dollars generated each year through Islamic social finance.
Few of the initiatives suggested are new – nor does the panel claim they are. Many have been discussed at length by other groups, and already piloted and reviewed in some cases. But seen together for the first time, and presented as compellingly as they are in the report, they have the potential to expand the responsibility to act beyond the narrow confines of the humanitarian community. The recommendations use finance as a driving force to enrich the aid ecosystem and push for institutional changes to bridge the humanitarian and development divide. This challenge is more pertinent than ever today given the increasingly protracted nature of crises around the world.
 The “grand bargain” comes at the end of the report and may leave many readers asking whether the deal is radical enough. It proposes that the major donors and largest humanitarian organisations commit to make their spending more flexible, efficient, transparent and effective. The bargain is aimed in particular at the five largest government donors of humanitarian assistance, those that supplied over 60% of the international humanitarian resources in 2014; and the six UN agencies that spent nearly half of it.
The logic is that if the giants can get it right, other donors and aid organisations will follow. But starting here does risk establishing the terms of the bargain in favour of these powerful few and thereby entrenching the concentration of funds even further, rather than encouraging a more diverse and equitable distribution of resources as recommended elsewhere in the report. 
There is also the question of those without a seat at the bargaining table. The Gulf states and other emerging donors are clearly a central part of the financing solution. The choice of Dubai for the report launch yesterday reminds us of how important they are. The report is unclear however whether Gulf states are invited to negotiate the terms of the bargain, or to be bound by it. The same goes for international, national and local NGOs – vital links in the chain between UN agencies and crisis-affected populations – who are already asking what their role is in the bargaining process.
The specific components of the bargain also appear to fall short of the panel’s ambition to ensure that resources are found to meet the needs of those most likely to be left behind. We don’t just need more joint assessments between a few big humanitarian agencies, we need a radical rethink of what we know about what makes people vulnerable to crisis in the first place and how to match their needs with the right resources. On transparency, the grand bargain may do something to improve reporting of international humanitarian assistance by a few, but we should aim for more. A bigger vision is required, in which all resources, beyond just international humanitarian resources can be counted. 
Turning the grand bargain into a big deal will clearly be a challenge. Vested interests, competition for scarce resources, and the humanitarian-development divide are as old as aid itself. What’s different now, perhaps, is the window of opportunity that the World Humanitarian Summit has created. Responsibility for taking the panel’s recommendations forward now passes from the hands of technical experts to those of the political and financial decision-makers who will be represented en masse in Istanbul in May. This combined with the scale of the problem, and the reputation and clout of the panel members themselves as they go out and canvass support, may be the tipping point that we’ve all been waiting for. 
The grand bargain will be a central topic of numerous global-level humanitarian meetings in the coming months. Even more interesting will be to see whether the panel’s recommendations get picked up outside of the humanitarian calendar. Will other actors agree that this is too important to ignore, and that they too have a stake in addressing the humanitarian financing gap? If the answer is yes, then the grand bargain may turn out to be a big deal after all.

The ensuing four days of debate will focus on the following themes:
The relentless rise of automation and ever more intelligent machines will be a key issue at the WEF.
The official theme of the 2016 meeting is “mastering the fourth industrial revolution”. That, in WEF-speak, means the “fusion of technologies that is blurring the lines between the physical, digital and biological spheres”.
For some Davos attendees, this means business opportunities. Top executives such as Satya Nadella of Microsoft and Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg will debate how the new industrial revolution could improve industry and society.
But Davos will also look at the threat to white collar jobs, asking if the changes are “failing the middle classes”. Another question is whether we are heading towards “a world without work” – a serious issue given that some experts reckon one in two jobs could eventually be taken by intelligent automation.
More than 7m jobs are at risk in the world’s largest economies over the next five years, according to a WEF report published on Monday, with women losing out more than men as they are less likely to be working in areas where the adoption of new technology will create jobs.
And if the daily trudge through icy Davos does not provide enough shivers, attendees will be told the implications of smart machines going to war. Sir Roger Carr, the chairman of defence giant BAE Systems, will discuss whether robots will become soldiers and generals, along with experts such as Prof Alan Winfield of the University of the West of England.
World leaders and the heads of humanitarian agencies will debate how to address the growing migration crisis and better integrate refugees into the communities who shelter them.
Queen Rania of Jordon will discuss the Middle East turmoil driving millions overseas, as desperate people continue to risk the winter cold and storms by crossing the Mediterranean. The leaders of Iraq and Tunisia are also attending.
The EU foreign affairs chief, Federica Mogherini, and the French minister Emmanuel Macron are to consider whether Europe has been pushed to a tipping point by the crisis and discuss recent terrorist attacks.
John Kerry, the US secretary of state, is giving a keynote speech. Last year, he delivered an electrifying talk on the need to tackle violent extremism and the “monsters” of Islamic State.
But it is not just talk. Delegates can choose to be jolted out of their comfortable existence by spending an hour experiencing a day in the life of a refugee. This has become a regular event at Davos, with some people being moved to tears by a taste of the trauma felt by displaced people. Some former refugees are also on hand to share their stories.
Angela Merkel won’t be signing up, though. With criticism over her refugee policies rising by the day, the chancellor is skipping this year’s event. So Germany’s president, Joachim Gauck, will be carrying the black, red and gold flag instead. 
The stock market rout of 2016 has already made a small dent in the large fortunes of the Davos elite. So there will be plenty of nervous chatter about whether we are heading into a new crash – and whether it can be fended off.
The big worry, of course, is China, with its slowing economy and swelling credit levels. One of the Chinese government’s top market regulators, Fang Xinghai, will update the global elite on wherethe economy is heading, alongside the IMF chief, Christine Lagarde.
Jack Ma, the head of Chinese online retailer Alibaba, could also be in demand for his insights.
With crude prices falling below $30 per barrel, the energy ministers of the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait will talk publicly about how Arab economies can reform to handle cheap oil.
Argentina’s new president, Mauricio Macri, is to discuss how emerging economies could suffer from the turmoil. Macri has just experienced his own painful shock; he is nursing a cracked rib after an incident playing with his daughter. 
No fewer than 10 central bank governors are descending on the ski resort, a chance to consider whether they will need to do more to help the global economy this year.
The WEF hopes to build on the Paris climate deal, agreed in December, by examining how governments and businesses can work together to cut carbon emissions. 
Its annual risk survey found that failing to deal with and prepare for climate change is the biggest single threat facing the world economy. This is the first time in more than a decade that environmental issues have topped the list of worries.
A string of top scientists will be providing technical expertise on how to tackle global warming and create cleaner energy. This includes the Solar Impulse team, which broke the world record for the longest solo flight in an un-refuelled vehicle last summer.
DiCaprio will also be pushing for action; his foundation helps protect threatened ecosystems and funds projects to shield wildlife from the impact of climate change.
Turmoil in the Middle East and in the markets has pushed the eurozone debt problems down the agenda.
But it still provides hope of a verbal punch-up, when the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, and the German finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, discuss the future of Europe. Memories of last summer’s crisis, where Tsipras was forced into a painful third bailout deal, are still fresh. 
Tsipras is also expected to meet with Lagarde. On the agenda: debt relief and pension reforms. 
The European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, will be giving his own assessment of the eurozone economy on Friday morning, fresh from a governing council meeting the day before.
David Cameron is also attending; Davos could give him an opportunity to push for EU reform ahead of Britain’s referendum on membership. But he could also have his ear bent by business leaders who fear a UK exit.
This annual gathering of the global elite is a perfect opportunity to remind them about wealth inequality.
Oxfam already got the ball rolling before some Davos attendees had even reached the ski resort, with a new report warning that wealth is becoming increasingly concentrated in the hands of a small group of billionaires. 
Save the Children will warn that the fourth industrial revolution risks deepening the gap between rich and poor. That is because automation can destroy job opportunities for those with few educational qualifications, hollowing out labour markets in the developing world. 
The US vice-president, Joe Biden, is heading to Davos to push his “moonshot” initiative to find a cure for cancer.
Biden, leading a heavyweight US delegation, will meet with top scientists, doctors and data researchers in an attempt to speed up the fight against the disease which claimed his son Beau in May 2015.
Last week, Biden said “cancer politics” were holding back progress and called for more data sharing about patient information and treatment outcomes. Davos is an opportunity to push that message.
Ebola will also be on the agenda. Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance is expected to announce an agreement with pharmaceuticals company Merck to help prepare for the next outbreak. Last summer, tests showed that Merck’s experimental ebola vaccine was 100% effective in providing immunity to a disease that killed more than 11,000 people last year.
But the world will always face new threats: Bill Gates is to lead a discussion on how to prepare for the next pandemic. 
Davos will see a clash between the authorities, which want closer control of our digital communications, and campaigners, who fear privacy is being eroded.
The US attorney general, Loretta Lynch, and Jürgen Stock, the head of Interpol, will be pushing for closer partnerships with companies and new laws to catch cybercriminals across the globe.
Salil Shetty, the secretary general of Amnesty International, is due to talk about how privacy and secrecy has changed in a world of digital communication and new terrorist threats."

And as he prepares to leave the job on Friday, Ian Chubb has some unflinching parting advice – Australia will inevitably have to adopt tougher greenhouse gas reduction targets.
Chubb is also on the board of the independent Climate Change Authority, which the Abbott government unsuccessfully sought to abolish, and he is convinced Australia will eventually have to adopt targets similar to those advocated by the CCA. 
The CCA found Australia should be cutting emissions by between 40 and 60% by 2030, measured against 2000 levels. Measured the same way the target announced by Tony Abbott and then adopted by Malcolm Turnbull equates to a cut of between 19 and 22%.
“That was solid work and I stand by those recommended targets,” Chubb said in an interview with Guardian Australia.
He said the continuing process set up under the Paris international climate agreement, struck late last year, and Australia’s particular susceptibility to the effects of global warming, meant “we will have to reconsider our target, I cannot see how we could possibly not”.
The Turnbull government has not ruled out increasing its targets as a result of the five-yearly reviews required under the Paris deal but has said it has no plans to do so.
Chubb recalls that he had “a lot of pushback” during the first few months of the Abbott government, “the emails from the usual suspects, people like Maurice Newman [who headed Abbott’s business advisory committee] who continue to believe [climate change] is all some vast conspiracy involving thousands of scientists around the world”.
In 2014 Chubb suggested Newman should “stick to economics rather than “trawl the internet” for papers questioning the overwhelming scientific opinion on global warming.
But Chubb said his conversations with the former prime minister himself had always been “rational and reasonable.”
“I was surprised at some of Tony Abbott’s public comments about climate change and some of his government’s initial responses and policies ... because [Abbott] and I talked about climate change quite rationally and reasonably,” Chubb said.
“He didn’t necessarily agree with me, we tried to persuade one another, but his questions were primarily about the modelling and the sensitivity of the climate to CO2 and how to build policy around the range of the projections.”
He also referred to a controversy over claims of threats against climate scientists at the Australian National University, where he had been chancellor.
“I was also questioned in the early stages because there was a suggestion that some scientists at the ANU had received death threats,” Chubb said. 
“I never said there had [been] death threats but their offices were open to the street and I thought it sensible to move them to offices accessed with a swipe card. The Australian newspaper spent a long time running FOIs [freedom of information requests] on that. I think they wanted to prove that I’d somehow timed the release of the information for a particular purpose, which was of course ludicrous.”
But Chubb says the antagonism towards climate science was easing.
“The debate here and overseas is much more sensible now, the sheer weight of scientific evidence is having a bearing,” he said.
He said he had also been deeply disappointed by the science funding cuts announced in Abbott’s first budget but was happy that the last budget and the recent innovation statement had seen some “selective reinvestment”.
Chubb will be succeeded by Dr Alan Finkel, an engineer and former neuroscience research fellow who has served as the chancellor of Monash University since 2008. Chubb has been chief scientist since 2011.
Catriona Jackson, the chief executive officer of Science and Technology Australia, thanked Chubb for his advocacy.
“There have been some difficult times for science and scientists in the past decade from virulent well-organised climate scepticism to a lack of interest in science,” she said. “The fact that that has turned around in Australia is very significantly attributable to Ian Chubb and his relentless energy.” 
The industry minister, Christopher Pyne, congratulated him on his “excellent term”.

As they work to reduce emissions, governments and public agencies – which often lack the resources to tackle the weighty global warming problem alone – are increasingly looking to the private sector for help, says Robert Puentes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Metropolitan Policy Program thinktank. 
“Tackling climate change – particularly from a transportation perspective – will require these kinds of partnerships largely because traditional governments and public agencies are underperforming,” Puentes said. “The public sector often does not have the capacity or expertise to design, finance, execute and sustain policies that work, so these partnerships are helping fill the vacuum with a new kind of problem solving.”
In one of the most recent examples, the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, a consortium of the world’s largest cities, has enlisted an unusual partner to help reduce tailpipe emissions: MasterCard. It’s one of the largest public-private partnerships aimed at fighting climate change so far.
The consortium – which includes more than 80 cities around the world, including London, Bangkok, Cape Town, New York and San Francisco – says its members collectively emit over 300m tons of carbon dioxide per year from transportation alone, or close to Poland’s total emissions from fossil fuels.
The partnership, announced last month, will set up what’s called a mobility management network, which will connect city staff members to each other and to experts to come up with ideas to nudge people to use public transportation more often. 
“These types of measures are all relatively low-cost, compared to investing in a new transport infrastructure, and are therefore of interest to a number of cities,” says Gunjan Parik, director of C40’s Transportation Initiative. “They also allow money to flow back into city coffers to deliver further improvements to public transit.”
Through face-to-face workshops and other events, as well as virtually through webinars, phone calls and a private online forum, cities and transportation experts will have ample opportunities to share their knowledge and brainstorm for answers on topics including parking, ticketing, congestion and integrating different modes of transportation.
MasterCard is working with cities to enable commuters to pay for bus and subway fares more easily, instead of needing to buy tickets in a separate step or having to carry cash or exact change. In London, for example, the company has helped create a system in which riders can use contactless bank cards or mobile phones to pay for fares. 
“Around 85% of the world’s transactions are still done in cash, which not only weighs as an inconvenience and a cost on our economies, but also facilitates crime,” says Hany Fam, president of MasterCard Enterprise Partnerships. A study by Tuft University found that using cash costs American society about $200bn per year, from fees paid for using ATMs to lost tax revenues from unreported transactions. 
C40 officials said their approach to solving transportation problems has achieved success in other initiatives. San Francisco created SFpark programme, which adjusts meter and garage pricing according to demand, helps drivers find available parking spaces quickly and reduces air pollution and congestion in the process. Milan’s Area C programme, which requires each vehicle that enters the city center on weekdays to pay a roughly €5 ($5.46) congestion charge, reduced the number of cars entering the restricted area by nearly one third this year compared to 2011, before the program was launched.
According to Fam, the success of the initiative with MasterCard will be measured over the next three years by looking at the number of lessons shared and adopted between cities and assessing how much these sustainable transportation projects contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions in cities. 
“The biggest thing we can do to truly make a difference in terms of emissions is to get people out of single occupancy vehicles and using whatever combination of bike sharing, walking, shuttles and so on,” said Sharon Feigon, executive director of the Shared Use Mobility Center, a national, public interest organization which advocates for car- and bike-sharing. “All of these modes together are enormously more efficient than the private automobile.”
While new payment systems can greatly improve the public transportation system, they alone aren’t enough to nudge people to forego driving or owning cars. Finding the right strategies to encourage people to take buses and trains is a big challenge. It remains to be seen whether simpler payments and better communication will make a significant difference.
“Information and technology transfer is very important in the adoption of shared mobility concepts,” said Susan Shaheen, adjunct professor and co-director of the Transportation Sustainability Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley. 
“It’s going to take many different strategies to accomplish these goals, and we need a vast set of transportation options.”"

Despite concerns about its impact on extreme weather events, such as recent flooding in the UK, climate change failed to register near the top of the list of business threats, according to a survey of 1,400 CEOs from around the world compiled by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and published at Davos this week. 
Instead, over-regulation was listed as the biggest threat to business (by 79% of CEOs), followed by geopolitical uncertainty (74%) and other key threats including cyber attacks (61%). 
In contrast, climate change and environmental damage was mentioned as a threat to business growth by just 50% of CEOs.
The findings were similar to a separate survey of 13,000 business leaders produced by the World Economic Forum (WEF). It also found a relative absence of concern about climate change and environmental risk amongst business leaders.
Business leaders from developed countries listed fiscal crisis and cyber-attacks as their biggest concerns, while in emerging and developing economies the biggest concern was unemployment, underemployment and energy price shocks. “No executive considers failure of climate mitigation and adaptation as the number one risk for doing business in his/her country,” states the report.
By contrast, a wider survey of economists, academics and civil society also produced by the WEF listed climate change as the biggest potential threat to the global economy in 2016. A failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation was seen as likely to have a bigger impact than the spread of weapons of mass destruction, water crises, mass involuntary migration and a severe energy price shock.
PwC suggested that contrary to its findings CEOs were concerned about the impact of climate change. “We don’t believe a low score in one question reflects overall thinking and action on it,” a spokesperson told the Guardian. “A quarter of all CEOs included ‘reduced environmental impacts’ in the three outcomes that should be joint government and business priorities in the countries in which they are based... and they are showing greater understanding of environmental impacts in their business and supply chain.” 
PwC said the results from this year’s survey also revealed a higher level of concern of climate change amongst CEOs than they did after the UN summit on climate change in Copenhagen in 2009 (50% vs 37%)."

But to me, these people are heroes. The 13 women and men on trial this week for cutting through the perimeter fence around Heathrow airport and chaining themselves together on a runway were excoriated by police, passengers and politicians. (One of the defendants in the case is a member of the cooperative society that rents my house.) If convicted, they all face a possible prison sentence. But there are two trials here: the legal proceedings in a local magistrates court, and a test of something much bigger.
Aviation enjoys some astonishing exemptions from the civilising rules that constrain other sectors. Other industries must limit the noise they make; but aircraft, thanks to an obscure clause in the 1949 Civil Aviation Act, are exempt. Other industries pay duty on the fuel they use; but even when air passenger duty is subtracted, aviation’s various tax holidays amount to a subsidy of some £7bn a year, forgone by the Treasury. Some industries must limit the air pollution they produce; but while in principle airports are subject to pollution laws, in practice they have been allowed to breach them routinely for years. (In this case the legal immunity also seems to extend to motor traffic.)
Most importantly, international flights are free from all climate constraints. They are covered by neither domestic legislation nor international agreements. There are no targets, no timetables, no limits. Airlines operate in a legislative vacuum, a transnational, extralegal limbo, accountable nowhere and to no one. As a result they threaten everything that was agreed at December’s climate talks in Paris.
Aviation accounts for roughly 6% of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions, and 2% of the carbon dioxide produced by people globally. But as this industry expands while emissions from other sectors are cut, a study commissioned by the European parliament expects it to produce 22% of the world’s CO2 emissions by 2050, unless there is a sharp change in policy. That’s enough to push us past the thresholds our governments promised to avoid.
At one point the draft Paris agreement contained a paragraph about aviation and shipping (another unregulated industry). By December this paragraph had disappeared, without public explanation or debate. The final agreement simply fails to mention either industry.
Governments left the issue instead to the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organisation, a body whose apparent purpose is not to make progress but to impede it. Dominated by the industry it is supposed to regulate, its work is an exercise in finely calibrated uselessness: it makes just enough noise to create the impression of something being done, without actually changing anything.
It has three main policies. The first is to offset the greenhouse gases planes release by encouraging other sectors to make bigger cuts, in lieu of those that aviation refuses to accept. It’s not just that this policy is likely to be unachievable, as the targets agreed for other sectors in Paris will be tough enough to reach. It is also unjust. Why should this sector, used mostly by the world’s richer people, be allowed to dump its responsibilities on the rest of the economy?
The second is replacing mineral jet fuel with biofuel. Already road fuels made from plants have helped to destroy the forests of Indonesia and west Africa, strip soil off the land, evict local farmers and spread starvation, as plantations of palm oil, maize, sugar cane and other crops grown to feed cars have replaced those grown to feed people. Already, governments envisage covering great tracts of the planet’s surface with energy crops to burn in power stations: a plan that’s as fanciful as it is destructive. Now they want to power planes this way as well? Will any corners of the planet be reserved for food production and wildlife?
The organisation’s third policy is promoting speculative and often unfeasible aviation technologies, that are highly unlikely to materialise. Perhaps we could call them mumbo-jumbo jets.
Because of the physical and technological constraints, the only way in which we can realistically reduce aviation’s greenhouse gases is to fly less. You might not have imagined, in the 21st century, that we would still need to hoist 180lb of human flesh 30,000 feet into the air every time we want a conversation. I’ve been limiting my own flights to one return ticket every three years. Yes, it has sometimes cost me opportunities and income, but this restraint has made me no less happy or fulfilled. If we can only challenge our sense of entitlement, I believe we inflict no damage on our lives by taking to the air less often.
But rather than seeking to manage demand, our government, like most others, aims only to meet its own inflated forecasts. It claims that the 219m passenger journeys through the UK’s airports in 2011 will rise to 445m by 2050, and it hopes to build enough capacity to accommodate them. In doing so, it vitiates every promise it has made about preventing climate breakdown.
Last month the government delayed its decision on a third runway at Heathrow, ostensibly because of concerns about local pollution (though the real reason was to avoid sabotaging the Conservative candidate’s campaign to become London mayor). But this represents no change in policy: Cameron intends to build the new capacity somewhere, even if it’s not in west London.
Each of aviation’s exemptions is a democratic deficit: a failure to hold the industry responsible for the harms it causes. So what are citizens to do, where the writ of government does not run? Sit back and watch? By doing so, we commit a disservice to democracy. A breach of the contract between state and citizens becomes normalised and ratified by our inaction.
Two verdicts will emerge from this trial. One will concern the legal status of what the protesters did, and there is no way of knowing what it will be. The other will concern the moral status. I suspect that if they are locked up then history will pass the same verdict upon them as it has passed upon suffragettes, Chartists, the pioneers of trade unionism, and civil and gay rights activists. Vilified, prosecuted, but – in the court of public opinion – ultimately vindicated: this is what happens to the heroes of democracy."

DiCaprio used an awards ceremony to demand more action on climate change, decrying those who deny it is a problem. And he insisted fossil fuels must be kept in the ground – backing a campaign launched by the Guardian last year.
After picking up a crystal award for his work on environmentalism, the actor explained he had seen the devastation caused by climate change firsthand, from melting glaciers in the Arctic to farmers whose crops had been washed away.
DiCaprio is tipped for Oscar success this year for his role in the bleak and gritty drama The Revenant. And he gave energy bosses a similar savaging.
In front of world leaders, business chiefs and campaigners, DiCaprio said:
We simply cannot afford to allow the corporate greed of the coal, oil and gas industries to determine the future of humanity. Those entities with a financial interest in preserving this destructive system have denied, and even covered up the evidence of our changing climate.
Enough is enough. You know better. The world knows better. History will place the blame for this devastation squarely at their feet.”
The solution to limiting global warming, he added, is to leave oil, gas and coal reserves alone:
Our planet cannot be saved unless we leave fossil fuels in the ground where they belong. Twenty years ago, we described this problem as an addiction. Today, we possess the means to end this reliance.”
DiCaprio also announced that his foundation was making $15m of fresh grants to support environmental protection. That includes funding to protect 6.5 million acres of rainforest on Sumatra from the “invasive and destructive practices” of the palm oil industry.
DiCaprio was one of four winners of a Crystal award at WEF this year. The fund also recognised Chinese actor Yao Chen for her work raising public awareness of the refugee, artist Olafur Eliasson, and musician will.i.am for his i.am angel Foundation, which tries to keep young underprivileged young people in education, and out of trouble.
Accepting his award, will.i.am joked he had grown up near gangs, but had kept out of them as he was more scared of his mother than the gang leaders. His dream is that a child in one of America’s poorest regions could become the next tech pioneer."

The contrarian scientists that were invited to testify are members of a shrinking tribe that every year has to work harder to deny the clear evidence of a human-caused warming world.
Those scientists were William Happer, Judith Curry, and John Christy. They argued that the Earth isn’t warming (or has slowed its warming) or that satellite temperature measurements are the best way to measure the Earth’s temperatures. In fact, satellites don’t measure temperature at all, but these witnesses didn’t mention that fact. 
Additionally, the satellite measurements that they showed are from the middle of the troposphere, high in the atmosphere (not at the surface). Finally, the contrarians declined to emphasize that the synthetic satellite temperature data have been wrong for years. The upper part of the atmosphere (stratosphere) is cooling as a result of the increased greenhouse gases while the lower layer (the troposphere) is warming. If any measurements of the stratosphere bleed into the measurements of the troposphere, it can cause a cooling bias.
I had the (dis)pleasure of testifying at a hearing in Minnesota where William Happer also testified. He, Roy Spencer, and Richard Lindzen all made errors in their testimony that were repeated at the Cruz congressional hearing. At the Minnesota hearing, these contrarians were representing Peabody Energy – the world’s largest private sector coal company.
They focused on high-altitude temperatures in the tropical part of the globe (near the equator) rather than temperatures at the surface or in the oceans. But it gets even worse – they combined two sets of satellite data into a single curve when in reality, satellite temperature measurements differ by as much as a factor of four depending on whose data you use! 
The figure below is nearly identical to Figure 9 Exhibit 2 in Richard Lindzen’s direct testimony, and similar to Figure 3 in Exhibit 2 to Roy Spencer’s Direct Testimony. You can see the schedule for the testimony here and access the filed court documents. My rebuttal testimony is available here and my surrebuttal is here. Climate scientist Andrew Dessler also testified at the hearing and his reports can be found here and here.
As I wrote last year and submitted in my court filings, the table below shows the huge spread amongst various satellite measurements. Why didn’t the contrarians point this out? Why do they only use the coldest two datasets? Why didn’t Roy Spencer tell the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission that his work has been found to be wrong multiple times? 
Why does this Peabody Coal case in Minnesota matter? Well, the same arguments were made by Ted Cruz and his contrarian witnesses in December in Washington DC. You can watch the video here. You can read John Christy’s testimony here. You can read Judith Curry’s written testimony here. The similarity between this group of contrarian documents is shocking. It is almost as if portions of their testimony were cut and paste. 
I am not really surprised the Ted Cruz would question climate science. And I am not surprised the well-known contrarians Judith Curry, John Christy, William Happer, Roy Spencer, and Richard Lindzen continue to question the mainstream expert consensus. I am not really surprised that some of these scientists are representing fossil fuel companies in litigation or hearings. What I am surprised about is that they are being so selective in presenting data and not telling the full story.
For instance, why don’t Roy Spencer and John Christy tell these judges and panels that they have had to revise their own temperature estimates several times over the past two decades when other scientists identified errors in their model? They originally claimed that the atmosphere was cooling, and now their data shows it is warming.
Why do these contrarians mislead by only showing some groups’ satellite temperature estimates while omitting others? Why do they neglect temperature measurements in the oceans and Earth’s surface where the warming is clear? Why do they falsely claim that there has been a halt or even a slowdown in overall global warming when no such halt or even slowdown has occurred, and in fact the warming is accelerating?
Why do some of these witnesses refer to their own publications after they were shown to be hugely in error, containing undergraduate-level math errors? Why don’t these contrarians and Ted Cruz tell us that the referenced satellite temperature recording team (Remote Sensing Systems) disagree with the way their dataset is being used?
I invite readers to view this great video created by Peter Sinclair which includes interviews from many real experts who discuss this very issue in a clear and understandable way. 
It will be interesting to see what the next contrarian argument is. They have retreated to higher and higher elevations in the atmosphere to run away from the reality of global warming. At some point, you’d expect they will reach escape velocity."

The group of Plane Stupid supporters are accused of cutting a hole in a fence and chaining themselves to railings on the north runway in July 2015. 
Labour MP McDonnell was due to be called as a defence witness in the case but his evidence was deemed irrelevant by the judge. McDonnell, whose Hayes and Harlington constituency includes the UK’s largest airport, is strongly opposed to the proposed third runway at Heathrow. 
District judge Deborah Wright said: “It (his witness statement) gives an opinion about the debate around the expansion of Heathrow and talks about the benefits of direct action, which he says may cause short term inconvenience.
“In order to allow his evidence to be given I have to be able to say that it is relevant. I am therefore not going to allow Mr McDonnell to give live evidence.” 
The activists are on trial at Willesden Magistrates Court charged with aggravated trespass and entering a security restricted area of an aerodrome. 
They admit being on the runway but claim their actions were necessary to stop people dying from the effects of pollution and climate change. 
One of the campaigners, Kara Moses, an environmental journalist, said they were wearing nappies in case they needed to go to the toilet during the protest. She said the group planned to block the runway all day and stop “hundreds” of planes from taking off. 
Wright asked: “If you thought you were going to be there all day, how were you going to address basic needs such as going to the toilet?” 
There was laughter from some of the defendants in the dock as Moses replied: “We were wearing nappies, madam.” 
The demonstration at around 3.30am on July 13 2015 caused delays for passengers around the world and 25 flights were cancelled. It came after a long-awaited report recommended a new runway should be built at Heathrow rather than Gatwick. 
Another protester Edward Thacker, a community worker and teaching assistant, said it was a “social justice” issue and he felt “compelled” to blockade the runway.
Green Party leader Natalie Bennett, who joined protesters outside court on the first day of the trial, was a character witness for one of the defendants, Melanie Strickland. In a statement read to the court she said Strickland was a “passionate, committed and knowledgeable” advocate of human rights issues and has written to her a number of times about climate change. 
Green party London mayoral candidate Sian Berry was also due to be a defence witness but her evidence was also ruled inadmissible.
It is alleged that on 13 July 2015 the defendants entered the northern runway at London Heathrow Airport, having trespassed on the land, and in relation to a lawful activity, namely the operations of landing and departing of aircraft which persons were engaged in on that land, did an act, namely erected a temporary structure and locked themselves to it, or within it, with the intent of disrupting that activity. 
The second charge alleges that they entered a security restricted area of an aerodrome without permission. 
The trial will resume at 10am on Monday when Wright is due to return verdicts in the case."

Data released on Wednesday by the UK Met Office shows the average global temperature in 2015 was 0.75C higher than the long-term average between 1961 and 1990, much higher than the 0.57C in 2014, which itself was a record. The Met Office also expects 2016 to set a new record, meaning the global temperature records will have been broken for three years running.
Temperature data released in the US on Wednesday by Nasa and by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) also showed 2015 shattered previous records.
Experts warned that the record-breaking heat shows global warming is driving the world’s climate into “uncharted territory” and that it showed the urgency of implementing the carbon-cutting pledges made by the world’s governments in Paris in December.
Heatwaves have scorched China, Russia, Australia, the Middle East and parts of South America in the last two years, while climate change made the UK’s record December rainfall, which caused devastating floods, 50-75% more likely.
The Paris agreement commits the world’s nations to limit warming to below 2C compared to pre-industrial times, or 1.5C if possible, to avoid widespread and dangerous impacts. But the Met Office data, when compared to global temperatures before fossil fuel burning took off, shows that 2015 was already 1C higher.
A strong El Niño event is peaking at the moment, putting the “icing on the cake” of high global temperatures. El Niño is a natural cycle of warming in the Pacific Ocean which has a global impact on weather. But scientists are clear that the vast majority of the warming seen in 2015 was due to the emissions from human activity.
“Even without an El Niño, this would have been the warmest year on record,” said Prof Gavin Schmidt, director at Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. He said he expected the long trend of rising global temperatures to continue because its principal cause – fossil fuel burning – was also continuing.
“It is clear that human influence is driving our climate into uncharted territory,” said Prof Phil Jones, from the University of East Anglia’s Climatic Research Unit, which produces the temperature record – called HadCRUT4 – with the Met Office. Peter Stott, at the Met Office’s Hadley Centre, said 2015 was the first year global average temperature was more than 1C above pre-industrial levels.
Noaa’s global temperature records stretch back to 1880 and it also found 2015 was the hottest year yet, beating the previous high by a record margin. The agency also found December was warmer than any other month in the record, when compared to long-term averages. Ten of the 12 months in 2015 had record high temperatures for their respective months, according to Noaa.
Nasa’s new data for 2015 also shattered its previous record and showed 15 of the 16 warmest years on record have occurred since 2001.
“Climate change is the challenge of our generation,” said Nasa head Charles Bolden. “Today’s announcement is a key data point that should make policymakers stand up and take notice - now is the time to act.”
 The Nasa, Noaa and HadCRUT4 temperature records all use independent methods to calculate the global average. They use many thousands of temperature measurements taken across the globe, on land and at sea, each day.
There are uncertainties in the measurements, partly due to fewer measurements in the polar regions, and these are included in the calculations. Stott said: “Remaining uncertainties are clearly much smaller than the overall warming seen since pre-industrial times.” Another independent temperature record, from the Japan Meteorological Agency, indicates 2015 was by far the hottest year on record.
Bob Ward, at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics, said: “This [record heat] should put pressure on governments to urgently implement their commitments to act against climate change, and to increase their planned cuts of greenhouse gases. The warming is already affecting the climate around the world, including dangerous shifts in extreme weather events. Those who claim that climate change is either not happening, or is not dangerous, have been conclusively proven wrong by the meteorological evidence around the world.”
Despite constantly rising greenhouse gas emissions trapping ever more heat on Earth, the last decade has seen relatively slow warming of air temperatures, dubbed a “pause” in climate change by some. In fact, global warming had not paused at all.
Instead, natural climate cycles led to more of the trapped heat being stored in the oceans (which already absorbed most the heat), some of which El Niño is now releasing. Scientists usually assess changes in climate over decades, rather than years, and the each of the last four decades has been warmer than any decade on record before. 
“It’s the long term warming trend we need to worry about rather than one hot year,” said Prof Piers Forster, at the University of Leeds in the UK. “So we shouldn’t get too excited - but it is certainly a sign of things to come.”"

Through the contributions of 188 countries, as well as thousands of additional commitments from states and cities, companies, foundations and international organisations, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change has given the world an ambitious goal for climate action.
The UN climate talks in Paris created important political momentum to get something meaningful done on climate change – momentum that is vital to spur aggressive emissions reduction and to cement a “clean” development dimension to the new sustainable development goals (SDGs) agreed in September.
The agenda for delivering this development now rightly intertwines inclusive economic growth, ambitious improvements in our social infrastructure for education, gender parity and improved health, as well as lower emissions.
The question now arises: how do we actually deliver this?
The challenge is enormous. The Paris Agreement recognises that the sum of countries’ Intended Nationally Determined Commitments (INDCs) for climate action, as it stands, will not be enough to keep within the agreed goal of staying below a 2°C rise.
The extra climate commitments made at Paris by countries and “non-state actors” – businesses, investors, cities, provinces and various action alliances – can provide a strong additional contribution to the INDCs, but these actors face daunting challenges because many of these commitments are interdependent. Industry often benefits from and needs policy reform to help transform to zero-emissions systems, governments usually need private and public finance these days, and financiers need well-structured projects, championed by the public and the private sector, to invest in.
In many cases success will be possible only through bold collaborations with diverse actors – public and private, incumbent and innovator, domestic and international. Think about the scale of new policies, projects and finance that will be required to move the world’s major cities towards becoming clean, sustainable urban systems by 2030. That’s the scale of the challenge the sustainable development goals and Paris Agreement have set us.
This ambitious new landscape requires innovative and to some extent unprecedented collaboration. Even those within the United Nations and other global organisations such as the World Bank recognise it will take more than the efforts of, for example, UNEP, the UNDP, and the UNFCCC to meet the new combined environment, development and climate goals.
Likewise, the CEOs of even the largest companies committed to climate action acknowledge the important role of governments (at city, state, national and international levels) to help them accelerate action. The Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition is a good example of this new environment. Through interaction between international organisations, governments and companies, about 40 countries and 23 regions, states and cities now have mechanisms to put a price on carbon, representing about 12% of global greenhouse gas emissions. This alliance would have been unthinkable even five years ago.
Talk about the potential of such public-private partnerships and alliances abounds. To mobilise the resources, innovation and actors required to start delivering a clean, sustainable development agenda as soon as possible it is generally accepted that we require a new kind of operating system for development. Indeed, goal 17 promotes a new global partnership agenda for action to meet all the other goals. 
We will need a community of action to create new public-private networks and platforms in order to identify and deliver specific, large-scale partnerships across a number of key global economic sectors and geographies, particularly in emerging economies. There is no longer a “long-term” development agenda. Rather, the international community has constructed a “time-to-goal” global initiative – a decade-long delivery imperative for the public and private sectors to carry out together to meet both climate and development goals.
At the World Economic Forum’s Annual Meeting in Davos this week, numerous meetings will bring together public, private and civil society leaders to forge and advance these new alliances. These are not abstract activities. The platforms for public-private cooperation provided by the World Economic Forum Global Challenge Initiatives have achieved many things over the past year, such as the Sustainable Development Investment Partnership (SDIP), the Tropical Forest Alliance, and Grow Africa and Grow Asia addressing food security. 
All these initiatives will meet in Davos this week to help activate a new global delivery agenda. The overarching theme – Mastering the Fourth Industrial Revolution – will explore the sweeping changes created by digitisation and new technologies, including for delivery of the SDGs. Davos will be a meeting where the desire among global business leaders and investors to accelerate these new models into new markets, intersects with the desires of governments and the international community to start work on the new climate and sustainable development goals.
The common ground is new models for delivery. Will history look back on Davos 2016 as the dawn of a new delivery decade? Let’s hope so.

 “We don’t have the facts yet, but I think that there is enough that has been revealed that it’s totally appropriate that (California) be conducting this investigation,” Steyer told the Guardian. “Anybody who puts out intentionally misleading information I think should be answering to us.”
 Steyer’s comments came hours after the Los Angeles Times reported that California’s attorney general, Kamala Harris, is looking into what ExxonMobil, the world’s biggest oil company, knew about climate change going as far back as the early 1980s. 
 Harris’s office declined to comment on the report, writing in an email: “We can’t comment on any ongoing or potential investigation,” according to press secretary Rachele Huennekens.
 Previously published reports suggest ExxonMobil may have spent millions over 27 years to publicly promote opposition to climate change science while privately basing strategies and business models around it.
 The Guardian reported in July on a company email from Exxon’s in-house climate expert that provided evidence that the company was aware, over a generation ago, of the connection between fossil fuels and climate change, and the potential for carbon-cutting regulations that could hurt its bottom line. It may have factored that knowledge into its decision about a large gas field in southeast Asia. The field, off the coast of Indonesia, would have been the single largest source of global warming pollution at the time.
New York’s attorney general is also conducting a similar probe into ExxonMobil based on previously published reports by the Los Angeles Times and the Columbia University Energy and Environmental Reporting Fellowship.
 But, Steyer said, California, as the “largest and most populous state” offers a “particularly strong platform” to increase the reach of any investigation. 
 “I’m not a lawyer but I believe the laws in California are different and give our attorney general a lot of leeway in terms of how she approaches it,” he said. 
 RL Miller, chair of the California Democratic party’s environmental caucus, added that the Los Angeles and Ventura Democratic party recently passed a resolution she wrote calling on Harris to investigate ExxonMobil. Harris is currently running for US Senate and will seek the party’s endorsement during its February convention.
 “I wanted to bring it up with Democrats because if she wants the Democrats’ endorsements, she needs to listen to Democrats,” said Miller of her outreach to Harris. 
 Like other climate change activists, Steyer also linked ExxonMobil’s alleged cover-up to similar scandals in the tobacco industry, which for many years fought to deny the negative health effects of smoking. 
 With climate change, “there is obviously a gigantic impact on the entire world and all the people of the world”, said Steyer. “It’s a society being misled.”"

Two winters with little rain, followed by completely dry springs and summers have left livestock producers in the west Wimmera and southern Grampians with record low levels of water storage, Tim Leeming, a farmer and regional chair of the Southern Australia Meat Research Council told Guardian Australia.
The region has the highest concentration of red meat production in the country, and produces 40% of Australia’s lamb, Leeming said. 
“If there is a mild winter and another failed spring this year, there will be hell to pay. It will be mega serious,” he said. “Producers will be forced into another agricultural enterprise like cropping – and that’s out of their skill set and not really supported by the landscape.
“You hesitate to mention climate change but we all know that in the last decade we’ve experienced the latest-breaking season in 40 years, we’ve experienced the wettest season in 65 years and two failed springs in a row – that has never occurred before.”
Leeming is calling for councils and the state government to build a pipeline to the nearby Rocklands reservoir, currently used to provide water for regions further north.
Jonathan Pollock, a climatologist at the Bureau of Meteorology, confirmed that the region had broken several records for dry weather and said it was most likely a result of climate change. 
“Rainfall in Victoria’s south-west was average to below average in December, but it also happened to be the warmest on record for most or all of that area, too,” he said. Record dry weather was also seen there in winter and spring of 2015, Pollock said. “Looking further back, parts of south-west Victoria are the driest on record at 18-month and 39-month time spans.”
The Bureau of Meteorology said in its most recent drought statement the dry weather was unlikely to be a result of natural changes and is probably due to climate change. 
“This suggests the tendency for recurrent dry conditions is less related to variations such as El Niño, and more due to other changes in the climate system,” it said. “Research suggests that long-term drying trends over southern Australia cannot be explained by natural variability alone.”"

What is more, it thwarts Brussels’ strategy to develop the clean technology in Europe.
That was the message from industry experts to lawmakers at a parliamentary committee hearing in London on Wednesday.
“There is a strategic risk for the UK in not developing capability in this area,” warned Luke Warren, head of the CCS Association.
Reeling from the unexpected cancellation of a £1bn (US$1.4bn) competition in November’s spending review, he pleaded for coherent policy.
That money had been destined to develop up to two projects at commercial scale. In the running were a coal-fired and a gas-fired plant, known as White Rose and Peterhead respectively.
White Rose had also won €300m (US$330m) from the European commission’s NER300 programme, which has repeatedly tried to back CCS without success. That money will be returned to the pot now UK funding has collapsed, according to finance director Richard Simon-Lewis.
While the demonstration projects were undeniably expensive, it was argued they were essential to bring costs down and meet climate goals in the long run.
The UK has a legally binding target to cut greenhouse gas emissions at least 80% from 1990 levels by 2050.
Prime minister David Cameron previously described the technology as “absolutely crucial” to meet that target. Earlier this month, he defended the U-turn, saying: “The economics at the moment really aren’t working.”
In a tight budget, CCS was judged to represent poor value compared to other infrastructure plans.
“There seems to be a view in government that we can afford to wait and buy CCS from other countries,” said Chris Littlecott of thinktank E3G. “It misses the point completely, of CCS as strategic infrastructure.”
The UK could buy in technology to capture CO2, he said, but the pipeline network to pump it under the North Sea required national planning.
On top of the £1bn upfront cash, the axed projects were in line for power generation subsidies. Known as “contracts for difference”, these were set up to support a range of low carbon technologies, including nuclear and renewables.
As a significant market intervention, it needed “state aid” approval from Brussels. This was duly awarded in 2014, on the basis that different technologies would be competing for cash, minimising market distortions.
Since then, however, the Conservative government has barred onshore windfarms and solar power from the mix, on the grounds of consumer cost.
Now CCS is also out of the picture, Littlecott told Climate Home “there are big questions” over the validity of that state aid clearance.
Controversially, Hinkley Point new nuclear plant is still in line for 35 years of subsidy. French state-owned company EDF is expected to make a final investment decision next week, Reuters reports.
Along with offshore wind, nuclear has enjoyed the most consistent support from Conservative ministers of any power source. Even so, the flagship atomic venture has been repeatedly delayed and is not certain to go ahead.
Accused of double standards in parliament earlier this week, energy minister Andrea Leadsom pinned the blame for high consumer bills squarely on renewables.
She said: “I find it extraordinary that Labour members seem to equate the deployment of renewables with decarbonisation. That is simply not the case.
“They fail to recognise that fuel poverty and endless renewables subsidies go hand in hand.”
The argument met with weary frustration from the renewables sector, which is facing job losses under the hostile policy shift.
Maf Smith, deputy chief executive of industry group RenewableUK, said: “Onshore wind is now one of the cheapest of all sources of power, which means that not supporting wind means higher bills for consumers.
“The government’s own advisors, the committee on climate change, says onshore wind is cost competitive with new gas and subsidy-free, and that offshore wind will become cheaper than gas during the next decade.”"

It’s an increasingly urgent question as the services proliferate, but the answer is currently unclear .
The companies have held their data close and are only now beginning to share, making it hard to assess critical questions like how people would have gotten to their destinations if Uber and Lyft did not exist.
A few researchers are making headway. A team at the University of California, Berkeley, is looking into the climate impacts of Uber and Lyft, with results due out in the fall. Unusually, the researchers will get access to data from both companies and, just as importantly, from their members (AKA riders).
Susan Shaheen, a Berkeley adjunct professor whose team is working on the project in partnership with the Natural Resources Defense Council, says: “With the companies, one of the most important things is to gain access to those members.”
Key questions for the Berkeley study include how long the trips are (as well as the time driving to pick up a passenger); whether the rider would otherwise have driven alone, taken public transportation or not have taken the trip at all; and the fuel efficiency of the vehicles involved.
The researchers will not look at congestion or at conventional air pollutants (such as nitrogen oxides or fine particles) generated by the vehicles. “There’s a lot of different angles that we could be studying here,” Shaheen says.
Everyone has an opinion on Uber and Lyft, but research results can be surprising. In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration feared that Uber was worsening traffic congestion in New York. But a report released by the city this month found that on-demand ride services like Uber and Lyft “did not drive the recent increase in congestion” in parts of Manhattan. The displacement of taxis was an important effect of the services.
In terms of the environment, early research suggests that companies like Lyft and Uber may have a positive impact, according to Juan Matute, a transportation expert at the University of California, Los Angeles. That’s partly because people may take public transit more often if they are certain they can later use a ride service. For example, someone might take a commuter train to work rather than drive because they know they can get home even if they miss the last train.
Some people also use Uber and Lyft to get to or from public transportation. “In some cases 25% of trips in a region (or more) start or end near transit, including such places as New York City, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Philadelphia,” an Uber spokesperson said in an emailed comment.
However, some people take trips with Uber or Lyft when they might have stayed home, which is bad for the environment. In 2014, Shaheen and other Berkeley researchers found that 8% of 380 passengers surveyed in San Francisco used on-demand ride services to take trips they would not have taken otherwise. On the other hand, half of all ride-service trips in the survey carried more than one passenger – that’s a far higher rate than for taxis. (However, the 2014 Berkeley survey was carried out before carpooling services like UberPool and Lyft Line launched in San Francisco. Those services, which bring together strangers in a shared ride, may be the services’ most effective tool for cutting emissions.)
The environmental calculus could change in the future, according to Matute. Currently, he said, it’s more expensive to use Uber or Lyft than to drive one’s own car. If the ride services became dramatically cheaper – which could happen if the vehicles contained advertising or eventually became self-driving – trips with the ride companies would become even more popular than they otherwise would have been.
Right now, “it’s still very expensive for somebody to exclusively rely on these services in any market”, Matute said.
Another factor is the type of car used by Uber and Lyft drivers. Some people hypothesize that since Lyft and Uber require cars to be relatively new – with the oldest models being from 2004 or 2005 – they may be less polluting than the vehicles owned by the general population, since cars in the United States are more than 11 years old on average. (The owners of Uber and Lyft cars also have an incentive for fuel-efficiency, since they must pay for gas.) 
The car companies, unsurprisingly, are bullish on their environmental impact. “By using Lyft to share rides, passengers are helping to reduce the carbon footprint left by our country’s dominant mode of transportation – driving alone,” said Tommy Hayes, the transportation policy manager at Lyft, in an emailed statement. Lyft will also help accelerate the uptake of green technologies like electrification and vehicle automation, he said.
Uber emphasizes that it is helping to reduce the need for personal car ownership. “Uber helps use today’s existing infrastructure more efficiently at no extra cost by getting more butts into the backseats of fewer cars,” a company spokesperson says.
What is clear is that the on-demand ride market is evolving so rapidly that studies will become outdated almost as soon as they are produced. When Uber or Lyft first comes to a city, riders use those services differently from how they use them in the second or third year, says Shaheen of Berkeley. With the advent of UberPool and Lyft Line, as well as the eventual potential of self-driving cars, the future is anyone’s guess.

The high level panel on water will find ways to coordinate the often piecemeal political decisions made by the plethora of regulators, governments, companies and individuals who draw from dwindling water reserves. It will also raise a widely-neglected problem to the highest level of political discourse.
“Water is a precious resource, crucial to realising the sustainable development goals, which at their heart aim to eradicate poverty,” said Ban, who announced the formation of the panel alongside the president of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, at a special session of the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos this morning.
“The new panel can help motivate the action we need to turn ideas into reality,” he said, adding that countries needed to take the lead on tackling the problem.
The panel will meet regularly between now and 2018 and will be chaired by the presidents of Mexico and Mauritius, Enrique Peña Nieto and Ameenah Gurib-Fakim. The two presidents were chosen for their countries’ diverse and representative water challenges. Mexico faces large scale water shortages associated with its booming developing economy, and as a small island state, Mauritius is especially vulnerable to climate change and the many water issues that come with a warming world and rising sea levels.
A further eight heads of state from the developed and developing world will be invited by Ban to join the panel. It is intended they will develop an agenda focused on tangible changes. One example given was the sway the heads of state will have over the operations of the World Bank. As shareholders and clients, heads of state are in a unique position to advise the bank on problems with the way water projects are funded.
“Achieving the water global goal would have multiple benefits, including laying the foundations for food and energy security, sustainable urbanisation, and ultimately climate security,” said Kim. “My hope is that this panel accelerates action in many countries so that we can make water more accessible to all.”
The politics of water can be divisive, and competition for the resource has become a serious threat to stability in water-scarce regions in parts of Africa, the Middle East and south Asia. 
“We are already seeing elements of water scarcity coming through - not just because of climate change, but [because of] over-abstraction. We are seeing stress points - social tensions or conflicts over a lack of access to water,” said Dominic Waughray, head of public-private partnerships at the World Economic Forum.
According to the UN, 90% of all disasters are water related and by 2050 the world will have just 60% of the water it needs. At last year’s announcement of the SDGs, the UN set its sights on delivering “water and sanitation for all” by 2030, but the issue is rarely discussed by those with the power to address it, said Waughray.
“There has never been a coordinated political momentum. Even when it gets to water ministers, they are sometimes not the most influential ministers in a cabinet. The water community might have done a very good job of analysing the problem and coming up with solutions, but it has never broken through politically at the highest level, at scale, in developed and developing countries,” he said.
The session in Davos was chaired by the former prime minister of Australia, Kevin Rudd. Rudd told the Guardian that water had not reached the top level of political discourse because there were “too many other pressing challenges”.
“But time is now right,” he said. “Climate change has now focused on the unfolding water crisis. As well as its impact on national security arising from water scarcity. We are now seeking to translate the sustainable development goals on water into reality.”
Rudd said the heads of state could build partnerships with the private sector and ensure investment in infrastructure could be found.
Attending the session, Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, chairman of Nestlé and chair of the 2030 Water Resources Group, said: “The mark of success for the panel will be practical action and tangible impact. Let this be an opportunity to break down silos at the highest level and collaborate with private sector and others.”

The conservative magnate’s departure from one of the US’s pre-eminent science museums was cheered by climate scientists and activists who have campaigned for the museum to cut ties with fossil fuel companies and those who head them.
A spokesperson for the museum, Roberto Lebron, told the Guardian that Koch’s term on the board ended on 9 December, at the trustees’ annual meeting. 
“This change was one of several that took effect at the meeting as part of the normal course of business,” Lebron said.
Cristyne Nicholas, a spokeswoman for Koch, said the billionaire was “honored to have served on the board” and to have helped make possible the museum’s dinosaur halls, which bear his name. She added that Koch plans to prioritize contributions to cancer research, and noted some $250m in donations to New York hospitals.
Elsewhere, Nicholas denied that Koch was at all moved by calls for his resignation.
Activists and some scientists nonetheless hailed a victory for their cause, which won national attention last year when dozens of scientists signed an open letter that singled out Koch. The scientists – including climatologist James Hansen, ecologist George Woodwell, and three Nobel laureates – called for science institutions to sever relations with fossil-fuel interests. 
“I think his name is still associated with the dinosaur hall, which with his political opinions is in some ways appropriate,” said Judith Weis, a signatory and marine biologist at Rutgers University. 
“This is one little chink out” of the divestment campaign, Weis said. “There’s a lot more still going on, a lot more museums.”
Beka Economopoulos, a campaign organizer and director of the mobile and politically minded Natural History Museum, said: “Regardless of the reason for his decision, it’s a step in the right direction.”
“We think the letter provoked some sector-wide soul searching, so we’re kind of happy that the American Museum of Natural History no longer has this figure there.”
Citing a petition that has received more than 200,000 signatures, Economopoulos added: “I’m not attributing the decision to [activists], but I think it’s safe to say he stepped down in the context of a lot of public pressure.”
A 2013 Drexel University study found that Charles and David Koch, along with ExxonMobil and a network of donor foundations, poured hundreds of millions into efforts to deny the reality of climate change, which the overwhelming majority of American and international scientists agree threatens life around the planet. 
The brothers also back a conservative group that recently declared its only climate change “hero” to be senator Ted Cruz of Texas, an opponent of environmental regulation who recently asked whether climate science was based on “data or dogma”. 
The Kochs’s conservative contributions, including $122m for Republican campaigns in the 2012 election and an $889m budget for 2016, have largely overshadowed their support for reforming immigration and the criminal justice system.
David Koch remains on the advisory board of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, where his name adorns the Hall of Human Origins. 
In response to scientists’ calls to cut ties with its rightwing donor last year, the Smithsonian released a statement that said: “Donors and supporters have no influence on the content or presentation of Smithsonian exhibitions, regardless of their private interests.”
The institution also repeated its official statement on climate change, that says “many decades of scientific research [point] to human activities as a cause of global warming”.
Koch is also a major funder for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where his donations have occasionally provoked protests."

Beetles dine on bird carcasses and gulls fight for scraps under a glaring sun in what marshes remain.
Lake Poopó was officially declared evaporated in December. Hundreds, if not thousands, of people have lost their livelihoods and gone.
High on Bolivia’s semi-arid Andean plains at 3,700 metres (more than 12,000 feet) and long subject to climatic whims, the shallow saline lake has essentially dried up before only to rebound to twice the area of Los Angeles.
But recovery may no longer be possible, scientists say.
“This is a picture of the future of climate change,” says Dirk Hoffman, a German glaciologist who studies how rising temperatures from the burning of fossil fuels has accelerated glacial melting in Bolivia.
As Andean glaciers disappear, so do the sources of Poopó’s water. But other factors are in play in the demise of Bolivia’s second-largest body of water behind Lake Titicaca.
Drought caused by the recurrent El Niño meteorological phenomenon is considered the main driver. Authorities say another factor is the diversion of water from Poopó’s tributaries, mostly for mining but also for agriculture.
More than 100 families have sold their sheep, llamas and alpaca, set aside their fishing nets and quit the former lakeside village of Untavi over the past three years, draining it of well over half its population. Only the elderly remain.
“There’s no future here,” says 29-year-old Juvenal Gutierrez, who moved to a nearby town where he has taken a job as a motorcycle taxi driver.
Record-keeping on the lake’s history goes back only a century, and there is no good tally of the people displaced by its disappearance. At least 3,250 people have received humanitarian aid, the governor’s office says.
Poopó is now down to 2% of its former water level, regional governor Victor Hugo Vasquez calculates. Its maximum depth once reached five metres (16ft). Field biologists say 75 species of birds are gone from the lake.
While Poopó has suffered El Niño-fuelled droughts for millennia, its fragile ecosystem has experienced unprecedented stress in the past three decades. Temperatures have risen by about 1 degree Celsius while mining activity has pinched the flow of tributaries, increasing sediment.
Florida Institute of Technology biologist Mark B. Bush says the long-term trend of warming and drying threatens the entire Andean highlands.
A 2010 study he co-wrote for the journal Global Change Biology said Bolivia’s capital, La Paz, could face catastrophic drought this century. It predicted “inhospitable arid climates” would lessen available food and water this century for the more than 3 million inhabitants of Bolivia’s highlands.
A study by the German consortium Gitec-Cobodes determined that Poopó received 161bn fewer litres of water in 2013 than required to maintain equilibrium.
“Irreversible changes in ecosystems could occur, causing massive emigration and greater conflicts,” said the study commissioned by Bolivia’s government.
The head of a local citizens’ group that tried to save Poopó, Angel Flores, says authorities ignored warnings. “Something could have been done to prevent the disaster. Mining companies have been diverting water since 1982,” he says.
President Evo Morales has sought to deflect criticism he bears some responsibility, suggesting Poopó could come back.
“My father told me about crossing the lake on a bicycle once when it dried up,” he said in December after returning from the UN-sponsored climate conference in Paris.
Environmentalists and local activists say the government mismanaged fragile water resources and ignored rampant pollution from mining, Bolivia’s second export earner after natural gas. More than 100 mines are upstream and Huanuni, Bolivia’s biggest state-owned tin mine, was among those dumping untreated tailings into Poopó’s tributaries.
After thousands of fish died in late 2014, the Universidad Tecnica in the nearby state capital of Oruro found Poopó had unsafe levels of heavy metals, including cadmium and lead.
The president of Bolivia’s National Chamber of Mining, Saturnino Ramos, said any blame by the industry was “insignificant compared to climate change.” He said most of the sediment shallowing Poopo’s tributaries was natural, not from mining.
In hopes of bringing it back, Morales’ government has asked the European Union for $140m for water treatment plants for the Poopó watershed and to dredge tributaries led by the Desaguadero, which flows from Lake Titicaca.
But critics say it may be too late.
“I don’t think we’ll be seeing the azure mirror of Poopó again,” said Milton Perez, a Universidad Tecnica researcher. “I think we’ve lost it.”"

A scant covering, on unfrozen soil, but enough for the children to tumble out into snowballs, snowman building and careering down north facing slopes on a variety of contraptions; that is until they rub the snow away.
Harper’s Brook is a significant tributary of the Nene, winding south-east from Corby, down a shallow valley, past Brigstock, Sudborough and Lowick, before jagging north and joining the Nene at Aldwincle. Between Sudborough and Lowick the valley floor is mostly still grazing land. One field contains a couple of dozen young Suffolk rams, thick set, black legs and head, and characteristically long and droopy black ears. They loaf about in little squads, watching us with mock disinterest.
At Lowick the valley is dominated by the pale yellow stone of the substantial and elegant St Peter’s church tower. It has an octagonal “lantern” top storey, like the better known Fotheringhay church, but this structure is surrounded and braced by four large, pencil sharp turrets, one on each corner of the penultimate tower storey.
A new agricultural enterprise nestles next to Lowick – row upon row of straight, tensioned wires, over which are draped the crooked and curled brown stems of grape vines. This is perhaps not as unusual as it at first feels; vine pollen has been found in Roman deposits at Wollaston, a site just a few miles upstream on the Nene. While wine production in the UK more or less ceased in the first half of the 20th century, there is now a scatter of midland vineyards that stretches north, even into Yorkshire. Some of the vineyards have been operational for 15 years or more, including one just three miles away from the Roman vineyard site at Wollaston.
Humans will adapt to a climate change by replacing crops that get harder to grow with others that are better adapted to the new conditions. Time will tell if vines and wines become a major part of Northamptonshire agriculture, but it is good that people are venturing and skills are being developed."

Laurent Fabius, who steered December’s UN talks, wants heads of state to ratify the accord at a meeting in April in New York, so that it can be enshrined in international law. Nations accounting for more than 55% of global emissions must formally sign up before the Paris agreement can be made official. 
He told the Guardian he had discussed the plans with UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon a few days ago, gaining his support, and was “pretty confident” that heads of government would attend what would be the third leaders’ climate summit in a little over six months.  “We should have the leaders there, to give a new impulse [to the implementation of the accord],” he said of the New York meeting, which he will preside over. “At the first day of Paris [which leaders attended] there was a tremendous push. It’s time for a new push in April.”  Fabius is acutely aware that, despite the success of the Paris negotiations, much more needs to be done before the future of the accord is secure. “There are many things which can go wrong,” he told the Guardian. “We have to avoid being lazy. We have to be calm, and to be hopeful. We have to talk to developing countries.” He pointed to the need to tackle emissions from aviation and maritime transport, which were omitted from the UN talks, and which he said are urgent.
 More work is needed on setting out clear rules on how to monitor emissions in a “transparent” fashion, he said. African countries must be assured that they are receiving the support that was promised to them at Paris. Businesses must also receive cooperation from governments to develop new clean technologies that will be “decisive” in bringing down emissions.  Fabius also called for a renewed focus on the possibility of putting a price on carbon, pointing to a Chinese plan to institute a national system of carbon trading from next year. This would be a major step forward, he said. At Paris, 196 countries agreed to limit greenhouse gases in line with scientific advice, to avoid temperature rises of more than 2C, and to review their commitments and progress on meeting them every five years. This framework is legally binding, and most countries - including all the biggest emitters - also set out national targets for emissions, to 2025 or 2030.  Fabius addressed the European parliament in Strasbourg on Wednesday, asking MEPs for their continued support for plans for the EU to meet its obligations on greenhouse gas emissions. He set out “four Ps” which he said are needed to implement the Paris agreement: the process of ratification of the accord, including the April meeting; clarifying the principles underlying the agreement, such as a precise definition of climate change financing, rules on the conduct of the five-year reviews and the transparency of monitoring emissions; the pre-2020 period, during which countries must make progress on their existing emissions goals; and preparing for this November’s UN climate conference, ‘COP22’. The success of the Paris conference was a rare bright moment in a dark end to 2015 for France, scarred by the terrorist attacks in November that left 130 people dead and scores more wounded. Fabius hailed the agreement as a triumph for international cooperation. “This is about security and peace,” he said. “There are massive risks to global warming, which could lead to widespread conflict. We have to stop that risk from becoming reality. That means this agreement was actually about peace for future generations, and current generations. This is a chaotic world, and a dangerous one. The Paris agreement is making the world safer.” Relaxed in a fashionably high-collared brown leather jacket as he travelled by French government plane to a snow-covered Strasbourg, Fabius reflected that the signing of the Paris accord had been just a beginning, though a very important one. 
“We need to look for concrete measures now,” he said. “I think that will arrive. The shift [to tackling climate change] has been made now, and there will be no turning back.”  For the year ahead, Fabius has a punishing schedule of climate meetings as part of his role as president of the COP, which under UN convention continues until COP22 in November. After the summit in April there will be a meeting in Germany in May to discuss some of the details of the accord, then a further conference in Washington DC in May or June hosted by the US, followed by a meeting of local authorities from around the world in Nantes, France, in September, as well as meetings held with the IMF and World Bank, and the UN general assembly in September. During that time, it is widely expected that Fabius will leave his post as foreign minister, perhaps to be succeeded by his long-time rival Ségolène Royal. He has been tipped in France as a potential future candidate for UN secretary-general, with his steering of the Paris conference having burnished his credentials.
Though he declined to speculate on his future, Fabius noted that he could remain COP president without being French foreign minister."

He said that because Trump was operating so “far outside” the political campaigns to which the company’s guidelines usually applied, and because he was saying things so obviously false, or overtly anti-Muslim, it was quite factual for reporters to call him, for example, a “mendacious racist” even though they wouldn’t normally use those kinds of terms about a candidate.
Using the same logic, it seems quite reasonable to say Clive Palmer – our own allegedly mega-rich and megalomaniac anti-politician – has taken the entire political system for a ride.
The latest example of how we are all being played for fools is the fact that his Palmer United Party sucked $21m in political donations from his 100% owned Queensland Yabulu nickel refinery before going into administration. The federal government has offered $500,000 to help 237 workers have been sacked but if the company cannot trade out of its problems and goes into liquidation then the rest of the workforce would almost certainly be able to access the federal government’s fair entitlements guarantee program and cost the government millions more. Oh, and he didn’t have to provide a bond for rehabilitating the polluted tailing dams and that could cost the Queensland government many more millions. This equation really doesn’t work out so well for us taxpayers.
Which shouldn’t be surprisingly really since the whole Palmer juggernaut has always been about Clive.
He effectively bought the balance of power in the Senate, spending $28.9m on the 2013 election and the Western Australian Senate rerun, most of which went on saturation advertising which in some cases promised things he would never have had the power to deliver, like getting WA voters more revenue from the GST. And despite poor polling though the campaign, those ads, in the final weeks, made the difference. He won his lower house seat and three spots in the Senate. 
As well as promising things he couldn’t do, he didn’t do some of the few things he had coherently promised. His election platform, for example, said he opposed offshore processing of asylum seekers. But he (and the two senators he had at a time) provided the deciding votes to pass a bill that dramatically increased the powers of the government to implement its offshore processing policy while avoiding the reach of the UN convention on refugees.
He was the anti-politician who would protect the “little guy”. Which is hard to reconcile with his party’s support for things like axing the government contribution of $500 a year to the superannuation accounts of the lowest income earners, from 2017.
And his position and rationale on other things changed according to political convenience. 
His senators provided the necessary votes for the abolition of the carbon and mining taxes, an obvious conflict of interest for a would-be miner and owner of a high-emitting nickel refinery that for a long time had an outstanding $8m carbon tax debt. He also provided the votes to pass the Coalition’s alternative Direct Action scheme, which as it stands is demonstrably inadequate to meet Australia’s greenhouse gas reduction promises while imposing no restrictions or costs on polluting industries, like, say, his Yabulu nickel refinery.
At the time, he also claimed he was some kind of born-again climate crusader – memorably appearing beside Al Gore – by “forcing” the government to ask the Climate Change Authority (a body it wanted to abolish) to prepare a report on alternative emissions reductions schemes, which it will deliver this year. To be fair, he did make tangible contributions, from an environmental point of view, by refusing to abolish the CCA and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which did at least preserve some institutional common sense.
But for the most part, in those days before his Senate voting bloc fell apart and all but one of the senators he had bankrolled went their own way, he engaged in last minute, high drama, chaotic negotiations, which maximised his publicity but mostly delivered “concessions” that were bad public policy or contradictory to the message he had given voters. I called it the Palmer pattern.
And as for representing the voters of his Queensland seat of Fairfax, for his own part in the lower house he hardly voted at all. He cast a vote in just 6.8% of divisions according to the OpenAustralia Foundation.
His whole tactic was to play the media, and the system, in a similar but slightly less spectacular way to Trump – luring journalists with all manner of publicity seeking stunts and then attacking them as part of the biased Canberra elite when they tried to hold him to account or point out the many things about his campaign that made no sense. And then, holding the Senate votes that could make or break legislation, the government and the opposition were also forced to pay due deference to the will of the electorate, as expressed through Palmer’s semi-coherent positions.
And – as well as many reports of his publicity seeking antics – there were also many attempts to hold him to account. Hedley Thomas in the Australian, in particular wrote numerous articles about his business interests and other questionable claims. Many journalists, myself included, called out his conflicts of interest, his inconsistent behaviour and his confused policy pronouncements, after he entered politics.
And while he never quite stooped to Trump’s treatment of the media, Palmer used the same tactics of attacking critics in order to ignore them. In the case of the Australian, he alleged a campaign motivated by things he had said about Rupert Murdoch’s former wife Wendy Deng. In the case of other interviewers he famously stormed out when the questioning got too hard, including from a 7.30 interview with Sarah Ferguson and another with Lateline’s Emma Alberici. In my own case he became belligerent and declared that I was a “naive girl” when I pressed him on a policy.
Palmer is by no means Australia’s first populist politician. And he didn’t go nearly as far as Trump in mocking the idea of accountability and truthfulness and threatening and abusing critics, which is forcing media and politicians in the US into the kind of assessments in the Buzzfeed memo.
US academic Jay Rosen, in this thought provoking blog on the topic, argues part of the answer is for political journalism to reconsider its sense of purpose and focus, which could reduce the coverage of the entertainingly outrageous that kickstarts the populist politician.
David Roberts in Vox argues that Trump is causing such consternation because he has broken the “accepted rules of lying” which have for a while condoned, or reported as a he said/she said story the really big policy lies, while calling out smaller, personal or trivial untruths.
That would fit with the Australian experience of the Coalition’s anti-carbon tax campaign or its reasoning that its 2014 budget broke no election promises – both arguments replete with obvious falsehoods. 
Australia now has a prime minister who says he wants to respect the electorate’s intelligence and Palmer’s influence is on the wane, so maybe our election year won’t be like the US primary season.
But if we don’t give some thought to the consequences of allowing political discourse to drift away even from the expectation that it is grounded in fact, and the reasons that might be happening, we really are mugs."

But it’s not often they publish a scientific paper tearing a politician’s comments to shreds. 
Sophie Lewis, from the Australian Research Council’s centre for excellence in climate science, has done exactly that, dissecting statements about climate records made by the former prime minister Tony Abbott in 2013.
Last week, temperature figures showed 2015 was officially the hottest year on record. Before that, 2014 was the hottest year on record. And scientists are expecting 2016 to once again win the dubious honour.
Heat records are being broken with wild abandon. Last year, 10 months broke temperature records.
Climate scientists say a rise in the average temperature caused by greenhouse gas emissions makes extreme heat records more likely.
In 2013, the UN’s top climate official, Christiana Figueres, linked bushfires in Australia to climate change. Abbott called such claims “complete hogwash” and said drawing links between broken records and climate change was a sign of desperation.
It drives me mental that these sorts of statements go unaddressed
He went on: “The thing is that at some point in the future, every record will be broken, but that doesn’t prove anything about climate change. It just proves that the longer the period of time, the more possibility of extreme events.”
Superficially it seems to make sense: if you wait long enough, you’re bound to see records fall. Lewis suspected many people shared Abbott’s interpretation, and set out to show it was wrong.
Lewis says she was frustrated by the gap she saw between what the science showed and what some politicians said was happening.
In a peer-reviewed paper published in the journal Weather and Climate Extremes, Lewis pulls Abbot’s comments apart, shred by shred. 
The first way to understand Abbott’s claim is that in any system, the longer you wait, the more often you will see records fall. But Lewis points out that the exact opposite is true. In a system without any sort of trend, such as a random string of temperatures, the first one will be a record-breaker, by default. The second one will have a 50% chance of being a record-breaker. The third has a one in three chance of being a record breaker … and so on. In a very long temperature series, you should see very few records being broken, and they will break less often over time.
Unless, of course, there is a warming or cooling trend.
Alternatively, Abbott might simply have meant there was no connection between extreme heat records and climate change. Instead, natural variability might be to blame: natural variability includes things such as the El Niño phenomenon, which push temperature around year-to-year.
To test if that might be the case, Lewis ran a series of climate models in which the greenhouse effect was removed – so all that was left was natural variability. Unsurprisingly, in those models, high temperature records were less common than they are in reality. In other words, the record-breaking that we have seen cannot be explained by natural variation.
“It drives me mental that these sorts of statements go unaddressed,” Lewis says. She says scientific literature generally tries to simply explain what is happening, ignoring misunderstandings in the public sphere. 
“This was an attempt to bridge that gap.”"

His own battle, however, is against all this ‘climate-change nonsense’…";"When Jeremy Corbyn won the leadership of the Labour party in September he celebrated in a pub up the road from the Houses of Parliament with a thank you to supporters and a rousing rendition of the Red Flag. On the edge of the impromptu stage that day, beside Len McCluskey of Unite and John McDonnell the future shadow chancellor, was a singular figure singing with particular pride: Piers Corbyn, the new leader’s elder brother, who has, you could say, led a parallel career of stubborn principle to his younger sibling. I was in the euphoric crowd that day, and since then I’ve wondered a bit about the relationship between the brothers, what they have learned from each other. With some of this in mind I called Piers recently and asked if he might like to talk about some of that. He agreed, but typically on the basis that he would happily talk about any subject under the sun – apart from his relationship with Jeremy and the vexed question of how his leadership is going. He shares much of his brother’s mistrust of the press; recently, he suggests, the Independent published an account of an exchange that had taken place over a family Christmas dinner. That wasn’t on. What he will talk about, though, is the thing he has talked about for just about as long as he can remember: the weather.
On this very British basis we met last week in a cafe over the road from his office on Borough High Street in south London. You don’t have to speak to Piers for very long to realise that at least a couple of Corbyn family traits are indelible: the first is that intransigent rasp of a voice with faint traces of west country burr; the second is the sense that life, like politics, is best played as a long game.
Piers Corbyn has a faith, even at 68, that if he states his beliefs often enough – though it might seem no one is listening – his day will surely come. He takes comfort in this not only from the recent elevation of his brother, but also from the example of Galileo, and of John Harrison and his measurement of longitude. “It is unfortunately not the case that the truth always prevails in the short term,” he tells me, with some conspiratorial conviction, “there are often vested interests to prevent it.”
The particular “truth” that Corbyn has in mind is perhaps the least fashionable proposal currently available in enlightened debate: it is the belief that changes in the Earth’s climate and its weather are dictated primarily by cyclical activity on the surface of the sun (and not, pointedly, by the effects of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere). It is a cause even more thankless than the return of 1980s socialism to British parliamentary politics seemed (until very recently). Corbyns have little fear of pariah status, though. What of the “settled opinion” of climate scientists and governments around the world, sealed in the recent Paris accord? “For one thing science doesn’t do settled opinions,” Corbyn says. “And for another they are all wrong.”
Thatcher probably knew climate change was nonsense. She was a scientist. But she was also a politician
This contrarian spirit began in Piers Corbyn at the age of five when his father, an electrical engineer, encouraged him to investigate the efficacy of a Victorian dew pond (he found it to be limited); it continued with his construction of all manner of meteorological equipment in the family garden in Shropshire; then through the study of tiny anomalies in the true orbit of the Earth (based, aged 17, on weekly measurements of the elevation of the sun, with findings published in the journal of the Royal Geographical Society) and into academic degrees in solid state physics and astrophysics at Imperial College London. The culmination of this obsession was a personal epiphany: “I was thinking of using the weather to discover what the sun had been doing in the past,” Corbyn says. “But then I thought, that’s just stupid: why not use the sun to predict what the weather will do in the future?” In his mind, the only thing that has got in the way of him making his fortune from that ambition, is politics.
To begin with, he says, his solar-based forecasts and calculations were way off, and he had as good as given up, but in 1984 a singular event changed the course of his working life. At the time, Corbyn says, of the year after his brother had first been elected a Labour MP, his own political loyalties were in a certain state of flux. He had been a radical student union president in London and sometime revolutionary socialist (a past that he believes would have prevented him working at the Met Office, still part of the Ministry of Defence, even had he wanted to). In the early 1980s he had been affiliated to the International Marxist Group, after a brief flirtation with the “quasi-Trotsky anarchist group, The Big Flame, for the 11 days it existed”. At the beginning of 1984, knowing his meteorological background, the IMG asked him to forecast what the winter was going to be like at the end of that year. The miners were planning a strike and “they wanted to know whether it was going to be cold enough for the strike to be effective, to bring Britain to its knees,” Corbyn recalls.
He said no, but under pressure from his comrades he went back to the data, “looked at a lot of new relationships and correlations” and came to the conclusion that, yes, it was going to be a very cold winter. He presented his evidence to the Miners’ Educational Support Committee (“I think it was called that. We had a lot of committees…”) And it was passed on up to the NUM. As the strike unfolded Corbyn’s prediction proved correct, the winter of 1984-85 was unusually cold.
Was the NUM grateful?
“Very,” he says. He had phone calls from head office, “not [Arthur] Scargill personally but one of his senior assistants”, asking how long the cold weather would last. He told him he thought it could possibly last long enough to bring down the Thatcher government, but by March the strike had collapsed and he never got the chance to be proved right.
All the while Corbyn was assessing the proximity of revolution by monitoring the electricity output at Goldsmith’s college where he was a lecturer in the physics department. “The voltages were below the legal minimum all that winter,” he says. “It is supposed to be 240v, it was below 210v and for safety they are legally bound to turn it off. The government were desperately doing everything they could to conserve power. I called to say I had measured the voltages at the University of London and they were below that minimum. They said, ‘Well, Mr Corbyn you must have faulty equipment,’ and put down the phone.”
It was in those weeks and months, Corbyn suggests, that Margaret Thatcher came up with her most devious plan to deindustrialise Britain and defeat the miners once and for all: she would popularise and endorse the science of man-made climate change, as a way of converting Britain from coal to nuclear power. The Hadley Centre, the world’s first dedicated research institution became her pet project. Thatcher, who later recanted her doom-mongering, “probably knew climate change was nonsense,” Corbyn suggests, “she was a scientist. But she was also a politician. The rest is history.”
Corbyn sees that moment as the one in which politicians first saw the political capital to be made from prophesying the coming apocalypse. Worse though, in his mind, the most vehement expression of that prophesy was not on the right but on the left. Climate change became a progressive cause.
For Corbyn, it answered the crisis on the left created by the fall of the Berlin Wall. “The left needed a new totem pole. Something for the young to dance around and feel good about,” he says, somewhat bitterly. “Revolutions had failed. Russia had failed. Socialism wasn’t dead but it needed a cause. The Red-Green alliance became that cause. It needed massive state spending, which they equated with socialism. In my view the left stopped thinking in 1989. It is only my brother who has started to change the agenda of privatisation and so on.”
It is hard to imagine that Piers has not bent his brother’s ear with elements of this analysis at family gatherings for about 25 years. Does he show signs of wavering?
“I don’t speak for my brother on any of this,” he says. “I don’t give advice to him where it is not appropriate.”
Did Jeremy share his obsession with the weather as a kid?
“Not really,” he says. “We were all different. Our eldest brother was into cars. He became a flight test engineer for Concorde. The next brother is a mining engineer, went to Imperial college. Then there is me, scientist. Then Jeremy, who was always politics. I think we all took after different aspects of our dad; while my mother encouraged us to make things all the time. The house was rundown and we boys had to do repairs. Jeremy and I learned how to repoint brickwork and so on. We became pretty good builders.”
The left stopped thinking in 1989. It is only my brother who has started to change the agenda
Piers has had perhaps less convincing success with the construction project that has occupied most of his adult life. After the relative triumph of his forecast for the miners he worked pretty much full-time on his long-range models. By 1989, the first year he heard of the idea of man-made climate change, he was ready to sell his formula to the world.
Ignoring the traditional model of publication and peer review, ostensibly to prevent others stealing his ideas, he engaged the bookmaker William Hill to construct some weather bets for him with the help of the Met Office. “That went on for 12 years,” he says. “I had 30 bets at £20 each on long-range aspects of the weather each month; betting the average temperature would be below normal, that kind of thing. We made a lot of money that way.”
How much is a lot of money?
“I made about 40% profits on stake, overall,” he claims. “I would bet £600; I would get an extra £200 back. It would pay the rent basically.” He and his girlfriend at the time no doubt spent a lot of time looking anxiously at the sky.
After this marginal success, a little better than putting a wet finger in the wind, some commercial clients came calling. For a while, Corbyn exclusively told the clothes store Etam the optimum time to sell its T-shirts or its hats and scarves. Some farmers were seduced by his predictions of storm and drought. And then the scientific consensus around carbon dioxide as principal climate-changer hardened, and Corbyn’s company, WeatherAction, which floated on the stock exchange in 1997, went back into private ownership after two years.
Adversity has only stiffened Corbyn’s resolve, however. Despite his marginal status he is fighting global opinion on all fronts. These days he does the odd presentation for Texan oil companies, or Russian climate sceptics. And he has not given up on a shift of opinion closer to home.
“Whatever you think of it all, the net result of these beliefs has been a deindustrialising of the west and the shift of carbon dioxide production from Britain to India and China,” he says. “Labour under Jeremy are now saying we have got to make a special case for steel and various industries that have to pay all these significant taxations on energy costs, which is the reason a lot of them are closing down.”
Piers is whispering in the ear of any MP who will listen: “Graham Stringer, of Labour, is sympathetic,” he says, “Sammy Wilson DUP, a number of Tories, Boris is very sympathetic [Johnson tends to use Corbyn, in an unlikely alliance, as his climate guru]. Now I think we have George Galloway which is significant, because he can be very persuasive…”
Inevitably, Corbyn has arrived for coffee armed with graphs and charts; so before I go I try to get him to explain how his calculations work. He talks 10 to the dozen about solar magnetic fields and lunar modulation and stratospheric winds. He outlines his database of 200-year-old German weather maps and solar observation from American satellites. “The principle is that all weather that happens has happened before, all storm systems, the question is finding the closest match…”
If the results are as good as he claims, I suggest, why haven’t other people picked up on his system?
“We haven’t told them how it’s done!” he says. “We had the Solar Weather Technique, ‘SWT zero’. We now have now got the Solar Lunar Action Technique, ‘SLAT’, and we are on version 12CS – s is for special. We have gone through 20 improvements and understandings on this…”
As he talks I have the impression of an army of researchers tracking and calculating, poring over maps in order to compete with the Met Office’s supercomputer.
When you say “we…” I ask.
“I mean me,” he says.
“OK” I say. “And what does the system suggest we can look forward to?
“It will get much, much colder,” Corbyn asserts (he has lately suggested that in the longer term we are on the verge of a great cooling cycle, which will vindicate him once and for all). “Next month we have a displaced polar vortex situation. Plenty of snow coming.”
We both glance out at the spring-like day on Borough High Street.
“It’s got a chance, I guess,” I say. Corbyn grins. As he knows only too well, stranger things have happened."

But can it last?";"Traditionally the Sahel – a semi-arid strip of land, south of the Sahara Desert – is one of Africa’s most productive crop regions. But during the 1980s this region, which stretches from the Atlantic to the Red Sea, became better known for drought and famine. Thankfully the region has become wetter again, and now new research indicates that the return of the rains is most likely a beneficial side-effect of global warming.
Rainfall statistics show that between the 1950s and 1980s summer rainfall fell by around 40% across the Sahel, bringing the region to its knees. At the time scientists speculated that the drought was linked to poor land management, and a rapidly growing population. But newer data indicates that it may have been sulphate aerosols, produced by fossil fuel burning in Europe and North America, which slowed evaporation from the North Atlantic and cut off the Sahel’s moisture source.
Since then we’ve cleaned up our skies, but in the meantime sea surface temperatures have risen and greenhouse gas concentrations have climbed. By modelling these changes, and studying the impact of each change individually, Buwen Dong and Rowan Sutton, from the University of Reading, have found strong evidence that the rise in greenhouse gases was the dominant driver of the recovery of Sahel rainfall. But wWhether these increases will continue into the future isn’t clear, and the scientists also caution that increased rainfall isn’t always beneficial. “If more of the rain falls in short intense events then it may cause flooding and could run-off very quickly rather than penetrate the soil,” says Sutton."

While the overall coverage in the Guardian, Independent and Mirror titles tends to reflect the mainstream scientific, economic and political consensus about climate change, the Mail, Express, Times, Sun and Telegraph titles all continue to use their opinion columns and leaders to try to cast doubt on the risks. This was plainly shown by the contrasting reports last month of the link between climate change and this winter’s flooding.  However, not all of the naysayers are the same, with some science and environment correspondents valiantly battling to serve the best interests of their readers with fact-based reporting about climate change. Sadly, it appears that some of these newspapers are now carrying out a cull of writers who choose not to reflect the uninformed prejudices of their editors and proprietors. Last summer, the environment editor of the Sun, Ben Jackson, left the newspaper and was not replaced. This was the culmination of a slow slide in the newspaper’s coverage of climate change and other environmental problems since James Murdoch left its parent company, News International (now News UK), in the wake of the phone hacking scandal.
Murdoch junior, unlike his father, is acquainted with the scientific evidence for climate change, and had persuaded his stable of newspapers to recognise the importance to their readers of being better informed about environmental issues.  Since his departure, however, the editors of the Times and the Sun have fully embraced unscientific denial of climate change. Soon after losing its environment specialist, the Sun published an article from “climate expert”, James Delingpole, a notorious rightwing polemicist whose lack of scientific knowledge was cruelly exposed on national television by the president of the Royal Society. And the Times has been providing Viscount Ridley, the former chair of Northern Rock bank, with a regular column to downplay the risks of climate change.  Meanwhile, the Daily Telegraph also decided last summer to make redundant Geoffrey Lean, one of the UK media’s most experienced voices on the environment. Lean wrote on his blog: “In the British press... there [are], in my estimation, some 10 columnists who reject or underplay the dangers of global warming, with precious few columnar voices on the other side”.  Fortunately, the Daily Telegraph still retains an environment correspondent, and at least occasionally publishes well-informed contributions to “balance” the babbling nonsense on climate change that appears in its columns by famous non-scientists such as Boris Johnson and Charles Moore.  But it is readers of the Mail on Sunday and the Daily Express who suffer the most, with drivel appearing on both their news and comment pages. The Mail on Sunday has published a series of articles by David Rose, under the campaign banner of “The Great Green Con”, which attempt to undermine confidence in climate science in a very clumsy and unconvincing way, including stories that have been based on a fake magazine cover he found on the internet and a typographic error on a website.  Nevertheless, it is the Daily Express which has the worst track record, mixing ideological propaganda and inaccurate journalism. For instance, on 20 January, the United States National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, Nasa and the UK Met Office all announced that they had independently found 2015 to be the warmest year globally since records began in the 19th century.  The online report by the Daily Express, under the headline “What Global Warming? USA temperatures DOWN as climatologists claim 2015 was hottest year,” reflected the talking points handed out by climate change sceptics. Written by Jon Austin, who describes himself on Twitter as “Science &amp; Paranormal Correspondent”, it stated: “Todays [sic] announcement that a major developed nation like the US did not experience its hottest year ever is likely to fuel the argument put forward by many US-based climate sceptics that human activities simply do not have the level of impact being claimed by the climate change lobby.”  This is bunkum. The contiguous United States, not including Alaska and Hawaii, covers less than 2% of the Earth’s surface and recorded its second highest annual average temperature in 2015, just behind 2012. The United States is warming, just like the rest of the world.  It should be noted that the Daily Express struggles with its coverage of weather as well as climate. On 10 January, the newspaper’s website reported the impending arrival of a few days of seasonal weather under the headline: “Arctic SNOWBOMB to smash into Britain: Coldest winter in 58 YEARS now just days away.”  In fact, the meteorological winter (December, January and February) of 1957-58 was not particularly cold, and 22 of the UK’s winters since then have recorded lower average temperatures. Given that last month was the warmest December on record in the UK by a considerable margin, and that the first half of January was also mild, this prediction by the Daily Express appears to be little more than uninformed speculation.  When will editors of the Daily Express and other British newspapers abandon their daft crusade to promote climate change denial, and instead put the best interests of their readers first by reporting the real causes and potential consequences?

Thirteen of the 15 hottest years in the 150-year-long record occurred between 2000-14 and the researchers found there is a just a 0.01% chance that this happened due to natural variations in the planet’s climate.
2015 was revealed to have smashed all earlier records on Wednesday, after the new study had been completed, meaning the odds that the record run of heat is a fluke are now even lower.
“Natural climate variations just can’t explain the observed recent global heat records, but manmade global warming can,” said Prof Stefan Rahmstorf, at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany and one of the research team.
He said the record heat brought substantial impacts: “It has led to unprecedented local heatwaves across the world, sadly resulting in loss of life and aggravating droughts and wildfires. The risk of heat extremes has been multiplied due to our interference with the Earth system, as our analysis shows.”
The UN World Meteorological Organization (WMO) confirmed on Monday that the global average surface temperature in 2015 shattered all previous records and said 15 of the 16 hottest years on record have all occurred since 2000. “We have reached for the first time the threshold of 1C above pre-industrial temperatures. It is a sobering moment in the history of our planet,” said WMO secretary-general Petteri Taalas. 
The new research by Rahmstorf and colleagues, published in the journal Scientific Reports, is based on a statistical analysis that combines real-world measurements with comprehensive computer simulations of the climate system. This allowed natural climate variability to be better separated from human-caused climate change. The results did not vary significantly when UK Met Office temperature data was used instead of Nasa data.
The research was prompted by earlier claims that the run of record-breaking years was vanishing unlikely, a one in 650m shot, according to one report.
However, the average global surface temperature of the planet each year is influenced by the warmth of the previous year, meaning that a record broken one year is not independent of the year before. The UK Met Office expects 2016 to break the record set in 2015, partly because of the continuing El Niño weather phenomenon.
“Natural climate variability causes temperatures to wax and wane over a period of several years, rather than varying erratically from one year to the next,” said Prof Michael Mann at Penn State university in the US, who led the new study. “That makes it more challenging to accurately assess the likelihood of temperature records. Given the press interest, it seemed important to do this right, and address the interesting and worthwhile question of how unlikely it is that the recent run of record temperatures might have arisen by chance alone.”
The study concludes: “While considerably greater than cited in some media reports, the odds are low enough to suggest that recent observed runs of record temperatures are extremely unlikely to have occurred in the absence of human-caused global warming.”
In 2013, the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded with 95% certainty that humans are the main cause of global warming."

Milton Keynes and Derby will copy similar measures in Norway and allow the cars to drive in miles of bus lanes, while owners in Hackney will be able to plug in at street lights. York drivers will be able to recharge their batteries at a solar-powered park-and-ride and electric car owners in Bristol and Milton Keynes will be allowed to park for free.
The schemes were announced by the Department for Transport on Monday as part of a £40m pot shared out among eight towns and cities. Nottingham, Bristol, Milton Keynes and London are the main beneficiaries, but Dundee, Oxford, York, Derby have also won funding.
Electric cars are seen as a key way for the UK to meet its carbon budgets and cut the illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide pollution that blight many British cities. While still relatively niche compared to combustion engine cars, the number of 100% electric cars registered in 2015 nearly doubled on the year before, to 9,934.
In Norway, incentives including generous tax breaks and allowing electric cars in bus lanes have spurred uptake of the cars which now account for nearly one in five of all new cars sold.
London, which suffers the worst air pollution in the UK, gets the lion’s share of the funding. The Go Ultra Low fund will give the capital £13m for “neighbourhoods of the future” in several boroughs, where electric cars will be prioritised over other vehicles.
The transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, said: “I want to see thousands more greener vehicles on our roads and I am proud to back this ambition with £40m to help the UK become international pioneers of emission-cutting technology.”
Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, gave the initiatives a cautious welcome but said ultimately it was up to industry to drive take-up.
“We are all in favour of encouraging drivers to go ultra-green, but the risk of relying on perks such as access to bus lanes, free parking and exemption from London’s congestion charge is that they can be at odds with other policies such as promoting public transport and easing congestion,” he said.
The government has pledged to continue a long-running electric car grant, but it will decrease in April from the maximum £5,000 currently available to between £2,500 and 4,500, depending on which models buyers choose."

To put that into perspective, the previous two hottest years (2014 and 2010) only broke the prior records by 0.002°C, according to Berkeley Earth data. The only time the temperature record was shattered by such a large margin was in the monster El Niño year of 1998.
While the current El Niño event is also becoming monstrously strong, it’s only now reaching its peak intensity, and there’s an approximately 4-month lag before changes in El Niño are reflected in global surface temperature changes. Thus, the El Niño of 1998 had a greater warming influence than its 2015 counterpart. 2015 was nevertheless more than 0.2°C hotter than 1998, due to human-caused global warming. 
As the graphic below shows (animated version here), there’s a consistent warming trend among El Niño years, La Niña years, and neutral years. Over the past 50 years, there’s a 0.16°C per decade trend among each category, and individual years fall close to those trend lines. That underlying human-caused global warming trend is what’s causing annual temperatures to so frequently break records, with 4 new record-hot years in the past decade.
As NASA GISS director Gavin Schmidt said,
The El Niño that we’re seeing is starting at the end of 2015, and so there hasn’t been enough time for that to really have an impact on the annual mean temperatures. So 2015 was warm even though there was an El Niño, and it would’ve been a record year even if you abstract out the El Niño affect, 2015 would’ve been a record warm year by a long chalk.
And due to the aforementioned lag, 2016 could be even hotter yet. Prof Adam Scaife, head of long-range forecasting at the Met Office, said in an interview with Carbon Brief,
Given the strength of the current El Niño, we expect 2016 to be even warmer globally than 2015. The lagged effects of El Niño are already starting to appear in the monthly temperature observations, which are registering more than 0.8 degrees above norm in recent months. This is consistent with our forecast for unprecedented warmth in the coming year. Overall, we expect El Niño to contribute around 25% to what will most likely be a new record global temperature in 2016. Much of the rest is down to climate change.
If 2016 breaks the temperature record yet again, it will be the first time in the past 150+ years that three consecutive years set a new annual global temperature record.
Contrarians have responded to the news of record-shattering 2015 temperatures by noting that in the satellite data, it was only the third-hottest year on record in the lower atmosphere. There are two main reasons for this. First, atmospheric temperatures are more sensitive to changes in El Niño than surface temperatures. As a result, satellites still have 1998 as the hottest year on record, 0.14°C hotter than the second-hottest year of 2010, even though surface temperatures were about 0.07°C hotter in 2010 than 1998, and more than 0.2°C hotter in 2015.
Second, there’s an even bigger lag between changes in El Niño and changes in atmospheric temperatures, where it’s about 6–7 months. Thus the peak temperature influence of the current monster El Niño won’t be reflected in the satellite temperature record until summer 2016. As a result, 2016 is likely to become the hottest year in the satellite record.
However, the surface temperature data are more relevant to humans because they reflect temperatures where we live, and are less uncertain and more reliable than indirect satellite temperature estimates.
Over 90% of the energy trapped by the increased greenhouse effect goes into warming he oceans. A recent paper led by Peter Gleckler at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory estimated that the oceans have been building up heat at a rate equivalent to 4 Hiroshima atomic bomb detonations per second since 1998. That’s over 2.3 billion atomic bomb detonations worth of heat building up in the oceans over the past 17 years.
During that time, the oceans accumulated as much heat as they did during the previous 130 years, with 2015 reaching record levels.
In fact, research by Kevin Trenberth and colleagues suggests even this is an underestimate, and that from 1992 to 2005 the oceans built up heat at a rate of 6 atomic bomb detonations per second. Trenberth believes many other studies have underestimated the rate at which the southern hemisphere oceans are warming.
Previous estimates of ocean heat content change have been too conservative in the changes in the southern hemisphere. The absence of data does not mean absence of warming. Several estimates then use zero change in those regions. By better assessing what changes are likely in the no-data regions, based upon the regions where there are data, the ocean heat content changes increase. 
Encouragingly, on average, climate models are nailing the increase in ocean heat content quite accurately.
As the above ocean heat content chart shows, the overall heating of the planet never paused or even slowed down. The warming of surface temperatures did briefly slow, due to a period with more La Niña than El Niño events since the turn of the century. However, with the apparent return of more El Niño events, global surface temperatures are surging, and it’s hard to even see the slowdown anymore.
This argument is now relegated to the satellite temperature data, which have greater uncertainty, are more influenced by El Niño events, and diverge from direct weather balloon atmospheric temperature measurements.
For the global climate as a whole, there wasn’t even a warming slowdown (in fact it’s accelerated, as the Gleckler paper shows), and surface warming only temporarily slowed and is now speeding up again.
As Trenberth wrote, the record heat that we’re seeing now will soon become the norm.
What we have seen this past year will likely be routine in about 15 years, although regionally the details will vary considerably. Indeed, we have had a glimpse of the future under global warming.
2014 broke the temperature record without an El Niño, and 2015 would have broken it without an El Niño as well. Human-caused global warming is taking over.
That long-term global warming trend will continue, making the 2015 Paris climate accords all the more crucial in limiting the damages we experience as a result of climate change. As Michael Mann noted in a commentary on new research he published with colleagues on the record heat,
The next time you hear someone call into question the threat of human-caused climate change, you might explain to them that the likelihood we would be witnessing the recent record warmth in the absence of human-caused climate change is somewhere between one-in-a-thousand and one-in-a-million. You might ask them: Would you really gamble away the future of our planet with those sorts of odds?"

But no single item on the list seems any more horrible than the emerging news from South America about the newly prominent Zika disease.
Spread by mosquitoes whose range inexorably expands as the climate warms, Zika causes mild flu-like symptoms. But pregnant women bitten by the wrong mosquito are liable to give birth to babies with shrunken heads. Brazil last year recorded 4,000 cases of this “microcephaly”. As of today, authorities in Brazil, Colombia, Jamaica, El Salvador and Venezuela were urging women to avoid getting pregnant. 
Think about that. Women should avoid the most essential and beautiful of human tasks. It is unthinkable. Or rather, it is something out of a science fiction story, the absolute core of a dystopian future. “It is recommended that women postpone – to the extent possible – the decision to become pregnant until the country can move out of the epidemic phase of the Zika virus,” the Colombian health authorities said, adding that those living in low altitude areas should move higher if possible, out of the easy range of mosquitoes.
Now think about the women who are already pregnant, and who will spend the next months in a quiet panic about whether their lives will be turned upside down. Try to imagine what that feels like – the anger, the guilt, the pervasive anxiety at the moment when you most want to be calm and serene. 
And now think about the larger, less intimate consequences: this is one more step in the division of the world into relative safe and dangerous zones, an emerging epidemiological apartheid. The CDC has already told those Americans thinking of becoming pregnant to avoid travel to 20 Latin American and Caribbean nations. 
Eventually, of course, the disease will reach these shores – at least 10 Americans have come back from overseas with the infection, and one microcephalic baby has already been born in Hawaii to a mother exposed in Brazil early in her pregnancy. But America is rich enough to avoid the worst of the mess its fossil fuel habits have helped create. 
As usual, it’s the most poor and most vulnerable who bear the brunt. In Brazil army troops are going door to door draining puddles and flowerpots of stagnant water where mosquitoes might breed; in Jamaica the minister of health said plaintively “I’m going to be very frank, we don’t have enough fogging machines to fog every single community in Jamaica” with the pesticides that might help control the outbreak. 
And so the residents of the rich world will, inevitably, travel less frequently to the places just beginning to emerge from poverty. The links that speed development will start to wither; even the Olympics, theoretically our showcase of international solidarity, is likely to be a fearful fortnight in Rio this August.
 Zika’s not the only force tending in that direction, of course. It’s hard to imagine who’s going to visit Burkina Faso or Mali any time soon, after al-Qaida and Isis have blown up the major western hotels. Expats are starting to desert Beijing and New Delhi because who wants to raise their kids in smog so bad that a facemask is a fashion accessory.
Obviously we need to extend every possible aid to people across the Americas – we need to make sure they have fogging machines and testing equipment and teams of doctors who can help. But even more obviously we need to face up to the fact that pushing the limits of the planet’s ecology has become dangerous in novel ways. The Paris climate accords already seem dated and timid in the face of this news. We’re in an emergency, one whose face morphs each week into some new and hideous calamity.
A civilization where one can’t safely have a baby is barely a civilization. "

Depending on your point of view, the chief executive of Unilever, one of the biggest companies in the world, is either a gloomy pessimist or a unique figure in international business who believes his company has a duty to help the world tackle its big issues.
Being a pessimist certainly has its advantages as a chief executive. If you talk down the markets you operate in then no one expects much from you. If you also promote your own social conscience then it can help boost how customers view your company, particularly important for a business such as Unilever that produces everyday consumer brands from the washing powder Persil to Magnum, the ice-cream on a stick. 
Polman is a regular on the global summit circuit, visiting Davos for the World Economic Forum last week and Paris for the climate change summit in November.
However, if you spend any time in his presence, it is clear the Dutchman’s views are at the heart of how he runs Unilever. With a workforce of more than 170,000 and a market value of almost £90bn, he believes Unilever has a duty to lead on key topics.
“The global economy has many factors coming together at the same time that people probably struggle with, more than in previous times,” he says.
“You have the geopolitical situation, we have a hard time getting economies growing in the US and Europe, and the emerging markets are clearly slowing down.
“So there is pressure all around the world on an economic growth basis. Then there are the geopolitical tensions that you are well aware of – and we have added Saudi Arabia and Iran to this now. And the issues of climate change are really showing up as well – this year’s El Niño will probably be one of the more severe, we have just had the flooding [in Britain] and we have had significant flooding in Latin America.”
Polman, who will turn 60 this year, believes it is important that businesses intervene in the challenges facing the world because it is not clear who will step in otherwise.
“Actually, that is one of the key issues in the world right now – the lack of global governance in a world that has become far more interdependent,” he says.
“Some countries have played their role historically, but seem to be falling back to their home base; others have not been able to step up to the plate, claiming developing market status. But increasingly the issues that we are facing – climate change, unemployment, social cohesion, food security – these are issues of global proportions. We are often trapped in short-termism … or other things. 
“Many of the institutions that were designed have served us very well, but they were designed in 1948 at the time of Bretton Woods [the conference held in 1944]. It is not surprising that you have now got an Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and other alternatives because the world has moved on.”
Since Polman took charge of Unilever in January 2009 he has tried to back his words with actions. Unilever has stopped updating the stock market on its performance every quarter to encourage a long-term perspective, and it has launched a sustainable living plan that includes a commitment to cut calories in its ice-cream products. The company has pledged to eliminate coal from its energy usage within five years, and derive all of its energy solely from renewable sources by 2030. In Paris, Polman was part of a group of business leaders calling for a price on carbon.
However, is a business like Unilever really committed to long-term global issues such as climate change when it must also meet the demands of shareholders and pay out hundreds of millions of pounds in dividends each year?
Polman insists that the dividend is part of “balancing the choices to multiple stakeholders” and that the financial markets are increasingly coming round to his way of thinking. 
“Businesses are also discovering that the costs of not doing things are becoming higher than doing things,” he says. 
“The age of transparency should also not be underestimated. There are many people now that don’t want to invest in companies that create a worse future for their grandchildren. They are able to see it by going to the internet and they vote increasingly with their wallet.”
He adds that investors are aware of companies that behave responsibly and those that do not, noting that nearly half of Volkswagen’s market capitalisation has been wiped out in the wake of the emissions scandal. 
Polman accepts that there are also still significant numbers of investors looking for the biggest possible short-term returns who do not care too much how companies achieve their dividends. But he is optimistic that a growing number are taking a longer-term view. 
“Companies in the US now spend more money on share buybacks or special dividends than they do reinvesting in their companies and protecting their futures. Many in the financial community are starting to be concerned about that,” he says.
“We are fortunate in Unilever that we have about 70% of our shareholder base that has now been with us as long as I have been here. We have deliberately sought longer-term shareholders.”
However, for all the long-term issues on Polman’s mind, there are also short-term challenges that must be addressed, including the referendum on whether Britain should remain part of the European Union.
The Unilever boss is against Brexit, believing that the UK and the EU will be stronger together. However, Polman also believes that Europe needs reform if it wants to stay competitive.
“Europe is very occupied with itself in the short-term,” he says. “The fundamental issues of how to make Europe more competitive, how to grow Europe for the longer term, are not being addressed. That is why you don’t see any growth in Europe, there is still deflation in many markets. The real issues that started the euro crisis have not been addressed, either.”
As for Unilever itself, Polman wants to continue to show that its personal and homecare products, food and refreshments can remain popular no matter what shape the economy is in.
Even though he is moving into his 60s and his tenure as chief executive is longer than average, Polman has no plans to retire: “I am 100% concentrated as if it is my first day. I still have that same energy.”
“For us, it is very important that we can continue to show to everybody that in hell or high water, whatever the economic situation, we can continuously give competitive topline growth, improve our profitability, and do that in a responsible way. We can show that there is a different business model out there. We can hopefully start to address some of these major problems out there whilst at the same time satisfying the need of our shareholders.”"

The findings in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a peer-reviewed US journal, suggest that increasingly severe storm surges could be anticipated as a result.
Sea level can mount due to two factors – melting ice and the thermal expansion of water as it warms.
Until now, researchers have believed the oceans rose between 0.7 to 1mm per year due to thermal expansion.
But a fresh look at the latest satellite data from 2002 to 2014 shows the seas are expanding about 1.4mm a year, said the study. 
“To date, we have underestimated how much the heat-related expansion of the water mass in the oceans contributes to a global rise in sea level,” said co-author Jurgen Kusche, a professor at the University of Bonn.
The overall sea level rise rate is about 2.74mm per year, combining both thermal expansion and melting ice.
Sea level rise was also found to vary substantially from place to place, with the rate around the Philippines “five times the global rate.”
Meanwhile, sea level on the US west coast is largely stable because there is hardly any ocean warming in that area, said the findings.

Singapore-headquartered Wilmar says it has made “significant progress” on a commitment it made two years ago to eliminate deforestation, exploitation and peatland development from its supply chain. This includes publishing a list of crude palm oil mill sources that supply its refineries, enabling greater transparency along the company’s supply chain.
However, campaigners and industry experts say the company is yet to prove that its suppliers are not responsible for clearing forests or abusing human rights.
Glenn Hurowitz, senior fellow at the Centre for International Policy, who wrote an introductory commentary for Wilmar’s progress report, told the Guardian that being able to measure progress is key: “Among the large agribusiness companies, Wilmar is leading the way in many areas, from supplier engagement to transparency to rapidly responding to grievances filed by civil society ... But no company is providing comprehensive information about whether [its suppliers] are clearing forests or abusing human rights – the metrics that really matter.” 
Even Wilmar’s chief sustainability officer Jeremy Goon points out that “much remains to be done, including the development of a clear means to measure and track the progress of sustainability commitments to assess its effectiveness in reducing actual deforestation”.
The key sticking point according to NGOs such as Greenpeace and the Forest Peoples Programme is that Wilmar, which controls 45% of global palm oil trade, cannot prove that its suppliers are not responsible for ongoing deforestation. The palm oil supply chain is notoriously complex and lacking in transparency, but Greenpeace Indonesia campaigner Annisa Rahmawati believes the company should be making better progress on its commitments.
“Wilmar promised that by the end of 2015 it would be able to show its palm oil suppliers were not destroying forests, developing on peatlands and were respecting human rights of communities and workers. This was the cornerstone of its policy, but now the company talks only of ‘aspirations’. That is simply not good enough,” says Rahmawati. 
Wilmar’s 2013 commitment was a bold move but it didn’t happen without considerable pressure from what environment author and journalist Fred Pearce describes as “strenuous NGO campaigns” and an announcement by Unilever – one of Wilmar’s customers and the world’s largest purchaser of palm oil in 2012 – that it would be tracking its entire supply chain to ensure it met its promise to end its role in deforestation. 
It’s this same pressure that environmental non-profit CDP believes will help companies realise their no deforestation pledges. In its latest report CDP points out that suppliers and buyers of key agricultural forest-risk commodities, including palm oil and soy, are coming under growing pressure to ensure their supply chains do not destroy forests. “That pressure is building from their consumers and their investors,” says CDP. In 2015, 298 investors with $19tn (£13.3tn) in assets under management requested that companies report data about forest risks through CDP, a 24% jump from the previous year.
Hurowitz adds that Wilmar and other companies need to be absolutely clear to their suppliers that if they engage in deforestation or human rights abuses, they will lose access to global markets. “There’s been altogether too much ambiguity about consequences, which has only encouraged some rogue actors to think they can deforest first and apologise later,” he says.
So what will help end the ongoing land grab claims and forest fires that engulfed south-east Asia towards the end of last year? Hurowitz believes that governments must step up and take deforestation seriously, although this doesn’t give companies carte blanche to carry on business as usual.
“For the sake of their own commercial interests, the leading companies need to do more to make clear to governments that effective law enforcement is essential if the palm oil industry is to restore its damaged reputation. To accelerate progress and prevent another haze crisis, companies should join with civil society to support government efforts to hold anyone who destroys forests and peatlands legally accountable.”
Both Hurowitz and Rahmawati cite the example of the soy moratorium in Brazil, which brought companies, government and NGOs together to prevent deforestation of the Amazon. “By working together, traders like Wilmar were able to help eradicate forest destruction for soya in the Brazilian Amazon,” says Rahmawati.

The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, the group which created the clock in 1947, said it was keeping the clock hands set at three minutes to midnight – the closest the clock has come to destruction since the throes of the cold war in 1984.
“The clock ticks now at just three minutes to midnight because international leaders are failing to perform their most important duty,” the scientists said.
The ominous forecast was imposed despite two major diplomatic accomplishments last year: the Iranian nuclear deal and the historic Paris agreement to fight climate change.
“The decision not to move the hands of the clock in 2016 is not good news,” Lawrence Krauss, who chairs the Bulletin’s board of sponsors, said in announcing the new clock setting.
The scientists, reinforced by former US cabinet secretaries William Perry and George Shultz, based their dire symbolic forecast on challenges of a global scale such as nuclear war and climate change. 
They also acknowledged the gathering threats posed to world order over the last year by Islamic State and cyberwarfare.
The scientists noted that the 11.57pm setting was one of the worst since the clock’s inception. In 1991, when the threat of nuclear annihilation receded with the end of the cold war, the clock stood at 17 minutes to midnight.
Barack Obama’s election was another occasion for the scientists to lower the danger setting, based on his campaign promise to abolish nuclear weapons. 
With the Iranian nuclear agreement reached last year, the Obama administration made important progress in lowering tensions. But the Bulletin said US domestic political constraints had blocked Obama from doing more.
In addition, the scientists said such progress was undermined by high tensions between the US and Russia that are reminiscent of the cold war. The US, India, China and Russia were spending $350bn modernising their nuclear arsenals, and North Korea remained a nuclear risk.
In many ways, the world was a more dangerous place since the end of the cold war, said Shultz, who served as Ronald Reagan’s secretary of state in the 1980s during the height of the superpower rivalry between the US and former Soviet Union.
“We have a world awash in change. There is nowhere you can look and say it’s a world of stable prosperity,” Shultz said in a webcast from Stanford University. “It’s a terrible mess.”
Regarding the other great global challenge, climate change, the scientists and political leaders noted that 2015 was the hottest year on record – smashing through the previous record, set just one year before.
The Paris climate agreement – though supported by more than 190 countries – on its own was not enough to limit warming below 2C, the goal for preventing a climate catastrophe.
Leaders needed to focus on the big challenges of the age, said Jerry Brown, California’s governor. 
“Climate change is moving slowly but tipping points are around the corner and you don’t know when you are going to reach one,” he said."

(Bowie died on 10 January, in case you’re just now waking up from a very long nap. If so: good job!) In Five Years, the first song on his most famous album, The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, he imagines what it would be like to learn that the world was ending.
It’s one my favorite songs of his, and I’ve listened to it often these past weeks. But I can’t relate to the sentiment, exactly, because Tuesday, the Science and Security Board of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists announced, using the “Doomsday Clock” as an indicator, that as far as they can tell, the world is no closer to ending than it was last year – though it’s also no farther away.
The SSBBAS was started in 1945 by scientists involved with the Manhattan Project with the express intent of gauging, and reporting, just how close mankind was to wiping itself out with nuclear weapons (and has since added “the changing energy landscape, climate change and emerging technologies,” to its list of concerns). Midnight on the Doomsday Clock, as you might have guessed, means the end of the world. We were three minutes to midnight last year and that’s where we remain. It’s not as close as we’ve ever been – the clock struck two back in 1953, when the US and Russia were both testing Hydrogen bombs – but certainly too close for comfort.
There’s a big part of me, though, that says, Who cares? (Likely a reaction that many of you are having to reading this very article!)
All those years after taking a first philosophy class and reading Nietzsche and having it blow your mind and then finding out that he really wasn’t so terrific after all, and all that listening to the Doors and later learning the same about them, the nihilist argument carries. So what if the world is ending? Is that really so bad? 
The world disappoints us in so many ways. People are stupid and cruel and life is full of pain and misery. We kill each other and we’re killing the planet we live on. Would it really be a net negative for everything to come to a full, abrupt stop? 
This week I stepped into a puddle of slush that was deeper than it looked, and I felt the icy slush-water crest the top of my boot and thought, No, that wouldn’t be bad at all. In fact, it would preferable to the alternative. As the cold, wet liquid seeped down and soaked my sock, it occurred to me that it might even be something to celebrate. But other days, I focus on how good it feels to put a nice warm new sock after peeling off a wet, cold one. Everything changes, and sometimes for the better. What else is there to do with our time except to try our best to enjoy it? 
That points towards hedonism when you’re young: have a second helping of pie and a third refill of your drink. But then when you get older, when you have a kid or kids, if you do that, it becomes something different. I did that and it became different for me, at least. Now the end of the world seems a little sadder. And my attitude about it is more one of, Let me not let this life-sustaining environment end on my watch.
Did you ever read Cormac McCarthy’s novel The Road? It’s really good. I often think it’s the best novel written this century. (It came out in 2006.) If you have not read it, and you still plan to do so, click this silly article off your screen now and go pick up the book instead, because I’m about to talk about the end. (Of the book, I mean. I realize we’re already talking about the end of everything else.)
The Road is a post-apocalyptic novel that tells the story of a father wandering the remains of the American east coast, trying to keep his son alive while most of society has descended into rape and cannibalism and human farming. The language is extremely terse in describing an ash-blanketed black-and-white world. I don’t think there’s any mention of color at all through the first 286 pages of the book. (Someone can surely check me and correct me on that, but I’ve looked and not found any.) The dad dies in the end, but the kid is found by another family of survivors and then the story zooms backwards in time, centuries, eons, who knows how far back? And we find this:
Once there were brook trout in the streams in the mountains. You could see them standing in the amber current where the white edges of their fins wimpled softly in the flow. They smelled of moss in your hand. Polished and muscular and torsional. On their backs were vermiculate patterns that were maps of the world in its becoming. Maps and mazes. Of a thing which could not be put back. Not be made right again. In the deep glens were they lived all things were older than man and they hummed of mystery.
Those are the last words in the book. People often say The Road is super-depressing, but I find great joy in it. I’m flooded with a sense of peace when I read those last words. Because to me it doesn’t seem like we’re zooming backwards in time; we may well be zooming forward. 
Who knows what will come as we come closer and closer to destroying ourselves and rendering our planet uninhabitable? Who knows what will happen after the clock ticks midnight? Maybe time will go on. Maybe people will have moved on to space stations by then. Or Mars. Who knows what they’ll grow there? Who knows what they’ll find. Maybe brook trout. That would be a treat."

Although just between us, I may have lost a bet to climate seer Joe Romm because he correctly predicted 2015 would blow 2014 out of the water. Instead, this is a post about the probability that temperature records keep getting broken if climate change is natural. 
A paper just published in Nature Scientific Reports by Michael Mann and Stefan Rahmstorf and their colleagues considered this question. In particular, they wanted to know how likely recent temperature records and the string of records would be if the climate was completely driven by natural variations. Not even including the crazy-hot 2015, what did the authors find?
Well it depended on the “record” they looked at. For instance, the likelihood that 13 of the hottest 15 years would be in the past 15 years is 1 in 10,000. The likelihood that 9 of the 10 hottest years occur in the past decade is 1 in 770. The results are similar regardless of whose temperature dataset is used.
Some media stories reported that the temperature records were even more unlikely. The reason this study arrived at different results is that they took into consideration the fact that temperature records are not like coin-flips. Each year is not independent of another year or the prevailing situation. 
For instance, there are natural events that alter the temperature such as volcanoes, variations in the solar output, or even internal variability such as the La Niña/El Niño cycle. If climate change were all natural, you could get these natural events to align just by chance, and this could give a naturally-occurring record. So, while it’s very unlikely that this could occur, it is much more likely than if we just treated each year as a coin flip.
The authors then asked how likely it would be to have a string of records given the reality of human-caused warming. They found that it’s 83% likely that 9 of the last 10 years would be the hottest on record and 76% likely that 13 of the past 15 years were hottest on record. They also found that the odds of 2014 being the hottest year on record was 40%. Without human influences, that chances 2014 would have been the hottest year is approximately 1 in a million. Mann said:
The press reports last year about the unlikely nature of recent global temperature records raised some very interesting questions, but the scientists quoted hadn’t done a rigorous calculation. As a result, the probabilities reported for observing the recent runs of record temperature by chance alone were far lower than what we suspected the true probabilities are.
Although the new odds of producing recent runs of record temperatures by chance are greater than the odds previously reported in the news (between 1 in 27 million and 1 in 650 million), they’re still incredibly slim at between 1 in 5,000 and 1 in 170,000. Including the data for 2015, which came in after the study was completed, makes the odds even slimmer. 
In calculating the odds, the previous reports did not take into account that the data did not end simply because December 31 occurred, but that trends overlap into previous and subsequent years. This needs to be taken into account to determine the real probabilities of chance causing the warming events. As Mann noted,
We provided a method for doing this based on combining information from state-of-the-art climate model simulations with the observational temperature record, and we used this method to estimate the probabilities correctly.
 Rahmstorf added:
2015 is again the warmest year on record, which adds even more weight to our findings. What is more, the anomalous warmth has led to unprecedented local heat waves across the world - sadly resulting in loss of life and aggravating droughts and wildfires. The risk of heat extremes has been multiplied due to human greenhouse-gas emissions, as our data analysis shows."

I love books and I love going to book festivals, both as an author and a reader. So it might come as a surprise to learn that I’ve got together with book blogger Zoe Toft to organise the Think Twice Campaign that encourages authors and illustrators to think twice about appearing at a book festival.
Before you think we’ve lost our minds, I should say that we’re only asking authors and illustrators to think twice about going to a particular festival – the Emirates Airline Festival of Literature that is held every year in Dubai. Lots of authors and illustrators we admire and respect attend the festival each year and it seems to be well organised and very enjoyable for everyone involved. So why are we kicking up a fuss about it? Our objection is to the festival’s sponsor, Emirates Airline, part of an environmentally irresponsible industry and owned by a very oppressive government.
Generally speaking, we are in favour of companies sponsoring book festivals to help them cover their costs. However it’s important to recognise that both sides benefit from a sponsorship deal. By associating themselves with high-profile, respectable authors and illustrators, Emirates Airline are able to raise their own profile and make themselves appear more respectable. Zoe and I don’t think that a company like Emirates Airline should be regarded as respectable. We think they are quite the opposite. And we’ve given authors and illustrators three good reasons to think that too.
One reason is climate change. While governments are making other industries reduce their CO2 emissions, the aviation industry’s carbon footprint gets bigger and bigger every year. It looked like aviation was finally going to be brought under control at last year’s Climate Change summit in Paris, but at the last minute, they were let off the hook again. Environmental groups have said that the absence of both aviation and shipping from the Paris agreement will make it “close to impossible” to keep global warming beneath the 2ºC level needed to avert climate catastrophe. As the airline that flies the highest number of international kilometres, Emirates Airline’s international flights already generate more CO2 than any other airline and instead of reducing their emissions they have just announced plans to double in size. Does that sound respectable?
A second reason is free speech. The airline is owned by the family of Sheikh Mohammed, the ruler of Dubai and the book festival’s patron. Dubai is part of a country called the United Arab Emirates or the UAE. Sheikh Mohammed is also the UAE’s Vice President and Prime Minister. The UAE government is very different from the UK’s and the Sheikh is more like a king than a UK prime minister. The UAE is not a democratic country, so the Sheikh cannot be voted out in an election, no matter how unpopular he is with his people. Many UAE citizens are very unhappy with the way the country is run. Unfortunately, citizens that dare to criticise the country’s government are arrested and imprisoned for doing so (find out more in this link from Amnesty International). There are currently 67 prisoners serving long sentences just for speaking out in favour of democracy. Does that sound respectable?
The third reason is human rights. If you’re not a rich heterosexual man, you may be treated as a second class citizen – or, worse still, a criminal – by Sheikh Mohammed’s government. Attacks against women are not taken as seriously as they are in the UK and often the victim, rather than the man attacking her, ends up being arrested and imprisoned. Homosexuality is illegal and people can be imprisoned for up to 10 years simply for being gay. People of both sexes working in low paid jobs are not protected by the law in the same way that rich people are. Low paid women are especially badly treated, with many being forced to work long hours with little to eat and no days off. Does that sound respectable?
Zoe and I do have a lot of sympathy for children that might miss out on meeting an author or illustrator as a result of this campaign. However we have more sympathy for the people – children and adults – in the groups whose interests the Think Twice campaign are trying to champion: the women, migrant workers and gay UAE citizens whose human rights are being abused, or the future generations who will have to contend with the life-threatening consequences of climate change. 
If authors and illustrators are thinking of cancelling, but are worried about disappointing a young audience, they could offer to Skype with UAE schools. There are lots of tips for authors and illustrators who are new to Skype at virtualauthors.co.uk. 
Emirates Airline is an extremely rich company. They use their money to sponsor many other high-profile events and organisations, from football clubs to symphony orchestras. This all helps to create a smokescreen of respectability around a company and a government that is anything but respectable. I hope that the Think Twice Campaign will help many authors and illustrators to see through that smokescreen and think twice about going to this particular book festival.

One month after the Paris climate agreement, Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, told business leaders they needed to act decisively to hasten the transition away from the fossil fuel economy – or they would put the historic accord in jeopardy.
“I call on the investor community to build on the strong momentum from Paris and seize the opportunities for clean energy growth,” Ban told a UN investors’ meeting in prepared remarks. “I challenge investors to double – at a minimum – their clean energy investments by 2020.”
Global clean energy investment attracted a record $329bn last year, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.
But Ban told the New York meeting that was still not fast enough to build the new green infrastructure that would enable countries to meet the Paris goal of limiting warming to below 2C. He said it was time for investors and fund managers to move from “aspiration to action”. 
The gathering today of about 500 investors, organised by the Ceres sustainable business network, was the third stop for Ban and other UN officials this month on an itinerary designed to get business leaders firmly behind the Paris climate agreement, after meetings in Abu Dhabi and Davos.
Under the agreement, 196 governments agreed on the 2C goal, an aspirational goal of 1.5C, and to build a net-zero carbon economy in the second half of the century. Rich countries committed to providing climate finance, and all countries committed to revisiting and strengthening their national climate goals, starting as early as 2018.
But the commitments made at Paris would at best cap warming to 2.7C.
Christiana Figueres, the UN climate chief, who will also address investors on Wednesday, and other leaders, have acknowledged that governments cannot finance the economic transformation, and that mobilising support from business leaders was a critical component of the Paris agreement.
The message to those business leaders underlined at the Davos and Abu Dhabi gatherings and again in New York on Wednesday was that, left unchecked, climate change posed a dangerous risk, and that there were business opportunities in the transition to a clean energy economy. 
In Davos, some 750 experts gathering for the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum declared a climate catastrophe to be the single biggest threat to the global economy in 2016.
A few days earlier, the annual meeting of the International Renewable Energy Agency in Abu Dhabi was told that doubling renewable energy to 36% of the global energy mix by 2030 would take countries halfway to the Paris goal of limiting warming to 2C, and increase global GDP by up to $1.3tn. 
“We had this extraordinary agreement in Paris, we have got points on the horizon,” Rachel Kyte, the UN special envoy for sustainable energy, who will also address investors, said on the sidelines of the Abu Dhabi meetings. “Now we have got to get down to the nitty gritty of long term development of the low carbon economy and that is a lot less sexy in some respects than things negotiated last year.” 
The International Energy Agency estimated it will cost the global energy industry $16.5tn by 2030 to make the switch from high-polluting power plants to wind and solar electricity generation, required by governments’ commitments at Paris.
But a number of experts, including those of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, say the prices on new wind and solar projects are coming down - and could come down even further if there is a dramatic increase in investment.
Ceres said business leaders needed to start moving now to take advantage of those new greener markets. 
“Ultimately, global investment portfolios need to shift far more capital to low-carbon business activity and away from risky high-carbon sectors that may perform poorly in the years ahead,” Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, said in prepared remarks."

Lord Krebs, the government’s statutory adviser on adapting to the effects of global warming, told an influential committee of MPs on Wednesday that although recent flooding has caused houses and other buildings to be inundated, property could continue to be constructed on flood plains. He said that the attendant risks and the possible devastation would have to be made clear to households, local government and developers.
The wettest ever December in the UK at the end of last year saw 16,000 properties hit by flooding, while more than 75,000 lost electricity and most northern and western parts of the UK registered more than double the average rainfall. Some uplands registered three times their average.
The committee on climate change was set up under the Climate Change Act to advise governments on meeting targets on greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to the effects of global warming.
Flood plains are often more attractive to developers because they tend to be flat and therefore easy to build on and close to other amenities such as transport and utilities networks. The UK is facing an acute housing crisis with hundreds of thousands of new dwellings needed each year to keep pace with the nation’s housing needs.
But while previous reports by the committee have warned of the dangers of building on flood plains, Krebs said that it should be possible to do so as long as property owners were made aware of the risks.
It is not known the effect such a policy would have on insurance, as most of the UK’s properties are supposed to be automatically protected from flood risk under a system known as Flood Re, an arrangement between the government and the insurance industry. This replaced a previous and unwritten agreement whereby all homes were guaranteed flood insurance by the industry.
Flooding is likely to become more common in the UK, the committee said, even if efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are effective, because of the effects of climate change. The average national rainfall is no longer a good guide to the likely effects because instances of localised but more intense rainfall are becoming more common – an effect of climate change that has been predicted by researchers including the Met Office.
On Wednesday MPs on the environmental audit committee also asked whether the Environment Agency’s responsibilities for overseeing flooding risk in the UK should be devolved to a new body. However, the complexities of devolving such responsibility – along with problems such as drought and the environmental protection of waterways – mean it is unlikely to be discussed in the short term.
Separately, a group of former high-ranking officials from UK governmental environment bodies said that a UK exit from the EU would lead to a much worse situation in terms of environmental protection in the UK."

So how do managers balance their climate change fears and the reality of the business world?";"Earlier this week Tim Sanderson, a former executive of the fossil fuel giant BP, wrote about the pride he felt for his daughter after her involvement in a climate change protest at Heathrow airport. With 12 others from climate activist group Plane Stupid, Rebecca Sanderson had occupied a runway to highlight the conflict between airport expansion and escalating carbon emissions.
Having spent most of his working life in oil exploration, Sanderson said he was an “unlikely apologist” for his daughter’s actions. However, climate change had become a galvanising issue for his family. When his daughter and her colleagues were convicted for aggravated trespass – and face a likely jail term – the former oil executive stood with other protesters loudly chanting: “No ifs, no buts, no new runways”. As with a growing number of business people, Sanderson’s story demonstrates how climate change has become an increasingly personal business.
In our book, Climate Change, Capitalism and Corporations, Daniel Nyberg and I explore how businesses and the managers who run them are responding to the climate crisis. A key finding of our research is that climate change poses a fundamental challenge to business as usual. While corporations frame climate change through the optimistic prism of innovation, technology and “green” products and services, the unpleasant reality is that our existing economic system fundamentally undermines a habitable climate.
For a number of managers, awareness of the environmental destruction that our economic system is exacting poses deep moral and emotional questions. Some chief executives have spoken candidly about their concerns for the future of humanity and their desire to change our trajectory. Often such epiphanies are cast from the personal and emotional realisation of the world they are leaving to their children. As the Californian venture capitalist John Doerr confided in a tearful TED talk about climate change and his teenage daughter: “I’m scared. I don’t think we’re going to make it.”
The emotional engagement with climate change is particularly relevant for those whose task is to make their companies more “sustainable”. Here, personal concerns about the environment run directly up against the competing logic of short-term profitability and shareholder value. This was highlighted with stark candour early on in our research by a sustainability adviser in a large Australian consulting firm who told us:
 “I would say that most businesses’ efforts, probably with a genuine intent, are more about appearing to be environmental and reducing impact where possible where there’s a business case for doing so ... because the best thing a business could do for the environment would be to shut down … But that’s clearly not a viable option.”
Many environmentally concerned managers thus operate in a conflicted space: they can advocate for greater corporate environmental sustainability but this must not threaten business growth. 
Responding to the inevitable gap between corporate rhetoric and action requires significant emotional labour, although ironically the outcome may be that emotions need to be deliberately left aside. For example, a sustainability manager at a major Australian property developer explained how he often downplayed his environmental concerns and framed his appeals for renewable energy to the company’s chief financial officer around cost improvements: “There’s nothing [in the discussion] about climate change. You can’t talk about drought and floods. We looked at this stuff, but they can’t get hold of it.” 
Many of those we spoke to also often compartmentalised their feelings about climate change between work and home. They might voice strong environmental values at home or among like-minded colleagues, but would moderate their views in the presence of more senior colleagues. As the sustainability manager at a national insurer admitted: “That’s the other challenge: how do you have passion without being seen as too passionate?” Essentially, fervour for the environment often needed to be tempered in the corporate space by fervour for the market.
However, many managers noted the need to sometimes stand strong and challenge business assumptions. Here the personal became the political by stepping outside convention and opposing proposals entailing environmental harm. As a manager in a major global food company told us: “We have to be the voice of the environment ... so sometimes decisions are made and those considerations aren’t there, and we’ve got to be the ones who stand up and say no.” For some of the managers we interviewed, these were pivotal events for them that involved putting their jobs on the line, or even leaving their companies to pursue alternative careers.
Of course personal responses are not sufficient to change an economic system hard-wired for environmental destruction. However, they demonstrate the potential for an individual’s emotional engagement to begin the process of corporate and political change. 
Future visions of a climate-shocked world prompt strong emotional responses, whether our concerns focus on the extinction of animal species, humanitarian disasters, or the wellbeing of our society or our children. Rather than denying our emotional responses to the climate crisis, we need to use them to champion alternative narratives to business as usual. 
Christopher Wright and Daniel Nyberg’s book, Climate Change, Capitalism and Corporations: Processes of Creative Self-Destruction, explores the role of business in the climate crisis

Campaigners said a letter published on Thursday from the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) to energy and climate secretary, Amber Rudd, was “desperately disappointing” for failing to increase the ambition of the so-called fifth carbon budget in light of the Paris climate deal.
Nearly 200 governments in Paris agreed to work towards keeping global temperature rises below 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, a more exacting target than the 2C previously agreed on by leaders, and which the UK carbon budgets are based on. It also required a longterm reduction to net zero emissions, which is more ambitious than the UK’s Climate Change Act.
The proposed fifth carbon budget’s 57% cut in emissions by 2032 was laid out before Paris by the committee, and has yet to be legislated on. In today’s letter, it said the budget’s demands were the minimum necessary to meet the UK’s international responsibilities under the Paris accord.
New government policies would be needed to reach this target, the committee wrote in its letter, because current policies would not be enough. 
The current Conservative government has rowed back on a variety of carbon-cutting strategies, for instance by slashing the subsidies available for onshore wind and solar power; abandoning the green deal scheme for encouraging home insulation, without a replacement policy; and scrapping the target for zero-carbon homes.
Craig Bennett, Friends of the Earth’s CEO, said: “This is desperately disappointing advice from the government’s climate advisor. Last month the international community agreed to ‘pursue efforts’ to keep global temperature rises to 1.5C – the Committee on Climate Change should have provided comprehensive advice and guidance on what measures the UK needs to take to help achieve this.”
Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, a UK-based thinktank, said it was sensible the committee had reviewed the carbon budget after Paris but added: “The committee also pointed out that we currently have little idea how this government intends to reduce emissions, let alone ensure energy security. Having spent its first six months emptying the energy policy cupboard, it has yet to re-stock and thereby give investors the confidence they need to get us back on track.”
The CCC also issued a stern warning on the future of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. 
Last year, the government scrapped a long-standing competition offering at least £1bn in funding for CCS. The future of the fledgling technology in the UK is now in doubt.
But the CCC said that research suggested the cost of meeting the UK’s carbon goals by 2050 would be twice as high without CCS technology. “CCS has a crucial role to play in cost-effective decarbonisation technology,” the committee wrote in the letter to Rudd.
Professor Stuart Haszeldine, director of the Scottish Carbon Capture and Storage group, said: “To stay on track in the ‘high ambition coalition’ of leading nations agreed in Paris climate talks, the UK needs to do a lot more on UK electricity, and a lot more on UK low-carbon industry and low-carbon heat. 
“But now this government is doing a lot less. There is no sign yet that facts, unbiased scientific evidence and rationality are regarded as more important than lobbying by corporations and colleagues wishing to take the UK back to the 1960s energy mix.”

The announcement comes one month after the Paris climate agreement, where nearly 200 countries agreed to dramatically cut emissions. This week UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon urged business leaders to act decisively to hasten the transition away from the fossil fuel economy – or they would put the historic accord in jeopardy.
But even if business leaders do reach this ambitious target, it only marks the start of the investment needed to meet the agreed 1.5 degree target. The International Energy Agency has estimated that to hit this taget the world will need to spend more than $16trn (£10.55trn) over the next 15 years, to cover the costs of replacing coal and gas-fired power stations with emissions-free sources of energy such as wind, solar and nuclear as well as the costs for improving existing energy efficiency in homes and businesses.
So who’s going to foot the bill? What can developing countries do to help ensure we reach the 1.5 degree target? How can markets be used to promote private-sector solutions to climate change? And what can be done to create effective alliances to deliver the ambition of the Paris agreement?

Greenland, which is almost the size of Europe but with a population of less than 60,000 people, is a self-governing territory of Denmark.
However, it is seeking full independence from Denmark and will only be able to survive on its own by exploiting its proven oil, gas and mineral reserves, which could take its emissions to some of the highest per capita on Earth.
“The economic situation gives us no choice but to develop mining and oil. We would most likely [seek] a territorial reservation. It would be very costly if we were to submit to a binding agreement,” the administration’s foreign minister, Vittus Qujaukitsoq, told the Guardian at a meeting of Arctic countries in Tromsø, Norway.
The deputy foreign minister, Kai Holst Andersen, said Greenland would likely seek a territorial opt-out from the Paris deal, agreed by nearly 200 countries last month. “If we sign it will cost us hundreds of millions of dollars and we would never be independent,” he said. While Greenland is not a party to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which shepherded the Paris deal, Denmark is.
Greenland receives a block grant of nearly $1bn a year from Denmark, around half its income. If it chose independence this would be lost, said Andersen.
New emissions restrictions on Greenland would be almost impossible to honour, said Andersen. “If we want to make a living we cannot afford to make an agreement that will bind us [to cutting emissions]. We are not an independent state. Independence is cancelled if we sign [Paris].”
Under the previous Kyoto climate agreement, which applied to Denmark and other rich countries, Greenland had an emission quota of 650,000 tonnes of CO2 a year - less than is emitted by a single coal-fired power station. The Paris deal covers emissions curbs post-2020.
Greenland’s position will not affect the ratification of the Paris agreement, which will come into force when signed by 55 countries that produce at least 55% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. This is due to take place at a ceremony in New York in April.
But it gives a clear signal to rich countries that they will have to urgently find ways to help poorer countries and regions to finance emission cuts. Many developing countries have said that they will be unable to fulfil their pledges without considerable help. How this money is raised has not been decided, but is likely to be with a mix of carbon trading, taxes and development assistance. 
Climate change in the Arctic is believed to be taking place faster than anywhere else with Greenland seeing rapid changes in farming, fishing and development. Mining has become easier as ice retreats and new species of fish enter Greenland waters, but the traditional way of life has been severely disrupted and the melting of the Greenland ice cap is taking place faster than anticipated, giving rise to fears of sea level rise. 
“We are seeing the effect of climate change much more clearly now. We must address it in any way we can to make the rest of the world understand how it is affecting all life and livelihoods,” said Qujaukitsok.
“It is is a blessing and a curse for us. We must address it in any way we can. It is affecting our life and ecosystems. It is posing threats but also offering new opportunities,” he said.
Climate change in Greenland was highlighted in the Paris talks when tonnes of ice from one of its fjords were placed in front of the Pantheon to show rapid melting and to inspire negotiators to come up with an ambitious global deal. "

Since 1986, mean summer temperatures have been about 1.3C hotter than they were two millennia ago, while heatwaves have been longer, more frequent and more persistent, the study says.
The paper was compiled by 40 prominent academics, using tree-ring analysis, climate modelling and historical documentary evidence from the notes of doctors, priests and monks.
“This degree of warming is unprecedented in the last two thousand years,” Professor Jürg Luterbacher, the report’s coordinator, told the Guardian. “It is exceptionally high and cannot be explained by natural variability, tropical volcanoes or solar changes. It is because of anthropogenic [manmade] climate change.”
While the paper offers new insights into the effects that volcanic eruptions, solar variability and land use change can have on climate, its range is limited to periods between June and August. 
Much of the data for the period before 755 comes from analysis of tree rings and density information from three pine tree species in Finland, Austria and Sweden. These trees grow in warm weather but are dormant in the cold, meaning that their rings, density – and the outside temperatures – can only be measured in summer. 
After 755, more pine trees in countries such as Switzerland, France and eventually Spain become accessible to the scientists, allowing spatial variations – or regional differences – to be more accurately recorded, and comparisons to be drawn.
“The anomalous recent warmth is particularly clear in southern Europe, where variability is generally smaller, and where the signal of anthropogenic climate change is expected to emerge earlier,” the report says.
The report finds evidence that past swings in summer temperatures were larger than previously thought. It says that summers were warmer between Roman times and the third century, before cooling until the 7th century.
A warmer medieval interlude was then punctured by a ‘Little Ice Age’ that lasted from the 14th to the 19th centuries. As the 20th century dawned, the effects of climate change became progressively more pronounced.
“Summer temperatures during the last 30 years have been anomalously high and we find no evidence of any period in the last 2,000 years that has been so warm,” the paper says. "

Over the next 15 hours, six twin-engine planes took off from an airfield in Al Ain, on the eastern edge of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and flew repeatedly into the clouds, firing off 162 flares loaded with tiny particles of potassium chloride and sodium chloride – table salt. By the end of Farrah’s shift at the National Centre of Meteorology and Seismology, a light drizzle was falling across much of the UAE. Farrah had made it rain.
 With the Gulf region confronting an even hotter, drier future under climate change – potentially testing the limits of human endurance – the UAE’s leadership is hoping to secure the country’s water supply by wringing more moisture out of the clouds. 
 The UAE this month launched an international research prize for weather modification, awarding a first tranche of $5m to researchers from Germany, Japan and the UAE. 
 “There are many techniques to secure water resources,” said Masataka Murakami, of Nagoya University’s Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research, who will lead one of the research teams. “But only precipitation enhancement can produce a lot of water for industrial use, irrigation etc cheaply.”
Such claims hold a lot of promise for the UAE. The country receives less than 100mm rainfall a year, and much of that is lost to evaporation because of extreme heat. Winter rains, like the one Farrah was involved with, are especially rare.
But the country – despite having such natural scarcity – is also one of the world’s biggest per capita consumers of water.
Farmers still rely on flood irrigation, pumping out so much water the ground is sinking in some parts of the country.
An expanding urban population with a taste for water parks, golf courses, and lush green landscaping is also rapidly draining groundwater reserves. 
Over the next three years, Murakami’s team will deploy sensors and algorithms to identify the most promising clouds. A German team, led by Professor Volker Wulfmeyer of the University of Hohenheim, will study how winds and topography affect cloud formation and movement. Linda Zou will lead a team of researchers from the UAE’s Masdar Institute of Science and Technology using nanotechnology to increase water condensation within the cloud.
Other options under consideration by a water-strapped government include boosting the efficiency of the desalination plants that produce fresh water from the sea, importing icebergs and water trading. But weather modification historically has been the favoured course.
Since the 1990s, the UAE has invested heavily in weather modification operations, working with Nasa and private US companies to try to boost rainfall and replenish dwindling groundwater supplies.
 On good days, the cloud-busting operations manage to squeeze an extra 15% of rainfall out of the clouds, Farrah said. The country’s record was 35% above the expected rainfall, he said. 
“It is expensive but compared to desalination plants it is very, very cheap,” Farrah said.
However, those numbers could not be independently verified and are much higher than those recorded by scientists engaged in weather modification operations elsewhere.
Murakami said that with additional research such operations could prove even more productive.
“The work we do today isn’t like the old cloud seeding. This is more advanced, and more involved in finding solutions in the way that nature works,” he said.
But water experts remain unconvinced. In the 60 years governments and private companies around the world have been trying to alter the weather, it is still impossible to conjure clouds from a clear blue sky. And there is no reliable way to gauge the effectiveness of their operations – since those clouds might have produced rain anyway, scientists said.
“Weather modification is a pretty sketchy option anywhere but it is really hard to wring moisture out of the atmosphere when it isn’t even there,” said Peter Gleick, a US water scientist and founder of Pacific Institute in California, who was invited by the royal family to deliver a lecture in Abu Dhabi in 2011. 
The UAE poses its own particular challenges, said Roelof Bruintjes, a weather modification expert at the National Centre for Atmospheric Research in Colorado.
Bruintjes spent four years trying to increase the rain potential of the UAE in the early 1990s, using radar and aircraft. But researchers found that the clouds were to some extent already being artificially stimulated by dust from the surrounding desert, and pollution from the oil industry. As the researchers soon discovered, there was little more moisture to be wrung from the clouds. “One of the things that we found was that, in general, it’s hard to modify those clouds,” he said. “It’s already being seeded naturally.”
Bruintjes said he was “doubtful” that a new generation of researchers would be able to crack open the clouds. But he added: “let the science take its course. Maybe they will find something we didn’t.” And he went on, the UAE does not have a lot of options. 
By mid-century, the country will be desperately short of water, and the costs of running the desalination plants to secure its supply are already prohibitively expensive. 
The plants, powered by fossil fuels, suck up huge amounts of sea water and energy, accounting for about 20% of the country’s entire electricity supply.
With oil prices below $30 a barrel, and the UAE reduced to a net importer of gas because of rising domestic use, the authorities acknowledge dependence on desalination plants is a luxury even oil-rich Gulf countries can no longer afford. 
 “Our arid climate makes us dependent on energy-intensive desalination,” Dr Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, the UAE special envoy for energy and climate change, said in announcing the award. “This is not sustainable nor is it desirable.”
The country is building six desalination plants including a pilot project at Ghantoot that will seek to cut electricity use by 25%. Masdar, the state-owned renewable energy company that owns the Ghantoot project, is looking at powering the plant with solar energy, instead of oil and gas. 
Such energy-saving moves are critical to an increasingly water-stressed future, said Dr Nawal Al-Hosany, Masdar’s director of sustainability. “When it comes to desalination it is a very expensive exercise,” she said. “We are trying to work with our partners to find innovative ways to improve the efficiency of our desalination plants.”
The UAE is also moving – slowly – towards conservation. Abu Dhabi this month for the first time began charging Emirati households for water use, and raised fees on expatriates.
A number of hotels have began reusing water for flushing toilets and landscaping. There are plans to expand water reuse.
But it would take a lot more than some some fat rain clouds and the sporadic embrace of water conservation to guarantee the UAE’s water security, Gleick said. 
“They have very little water. They can make as much as they want from the Gulf – but that’s at a high cost,” he said. 
It was time, he said, for the UAE to have a “serious conversation” about what they were really using their limited water for. “They are in a really tough spot.”"

If his proposal is approved at a finance committee meeting next Tuesday, as expected, the Danish capital will become the country’s first investment fund to sell its stocks and bonds in fossil fuels.
“Copenhagen is at the forefront of world cities in the green transition, and we are working hard to become the world’s first CO2 neutral capital in 2025. Therefore it seems totally wrong for the municipality to still be investing in oil, coal and gas. We must change that,” the city’s mayor, Frank Jensen, told the Danish newspaper, Information, which first reported the story.
“I think this move sits well with Copenhagen’s desire for a green profile for their city,” he added.
It is unclear exactly how much of the city’s money pot is currently tied up in equities and bonds in the dirty energy sector. 
A council spokesperson told the Guardian that no decision had yet been taken as to where exactly the withdrawn monies would be reinvested. 
The divestment initiative began with a small leftwing party on the Copenhagen council, before being taken up by Jensen, a social democrat.
Last year, Oslo became the first capital city to divest from fossil fuels, when it ditched $7m of coal investments, to join a growing movement of cities that have pledged to combat climate change. The world’s largest coal port, Newcastle in Australia, has also made a divestment commitment.
In a possible sign of Scandinavian rivalry, Jensen suggested that Copenhagen’s move might be more significant. “I am not aware of any other capitals, which have made decisions as clear as the one, we are making,” he said. “But I believe more will follow in the wake of the climate agreement in Paris. The development will be fast.”
Around 80% of the world’s known coal, 50% of its oil and 30% of its gas reserves will have to stay in the ground if dangerous global warming is to be avoided, climate scientists say. "

“Everyone is focused on what happens by 2100. But that’s only 2 generations from today. It’s like: If the world ends in 2100 we’re probably OK!” says Professor Richard Zeebe of the University of Hawai’i. “But It’s very clear that over a longer timescale there will be much bigger changes.”
If the next century seems impossibly far off, bear in mind that if you have a young child now, we’re talking about the world her or his grandchildren will be trying to raise their kids in.
Scientists who take the long view on climate change see parallels between global warming today and mass extinctions in Earth’s past: “Apart from the stupid space rock hitting the Earth, most mass extinctions were CO2-driven global warming things,” says Professor Andy Ridgwell of Bristol University in the UK.
It has been a consistent pattern throughout geological time: “If you screw with the climate enough, you have huge extinctions,” says Ridgwell.
So much of what you read and hear about climate change is heavily based on instrument records that only go back 160 years or so. But Richard Zeebe and Andy Ridgwell are among a few scientists who look millions of years into Earth’s past to learn how the Earth responded to big additions of CO2 into the atmosphere before. I had the opportunity to chat with each of them about their work during the American Geophysical Union conference in San Francisco at the end of last year.
It’s true that scientists can learn about the ice age climate going back 800,000 years from bubbles of air trapped in ancient ice drilled from Greenland and Antarctica. They reveal many swings from warm to cold to warm again, in a low-CO2 world mostly cooler than today. “We went from very cold and low sea level to a mild climate with normal sea level,” says Ridgwell. But it was a very different scenario than today - those cycles were mainly driven by Earth’s wobbles as it circles the Sun, and those same orbital wobbles mean we should be cooling, not warming, today.
So both Ridgwell and Zeebe have been studying the best equivalent to modern climate change they have found so far, a relatively rapid global warming event that occurred 56 million years ago, called the “Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum,” mercifully shortened to “PETM.” For Ridgwell, it’s a better analog for the future: 
This is why I like the PETM, at least it’s a warming event. It had a peak global warming of about 5º or 6ºC, which is a little bit beyond the end-of-the-century worst case scenario.
For Zeebe it’s also about data quality: 
We are focusing on the PETM is because we have relatively good sediment records. We are able to constrain timescales and ages relatively accurately. If you go further back in time, these constrains become very, very difficult.
Scientists use a wide variety of data from rocks exposed and drilled at various locations around the globe. They look at geology, fossils, and the chemical makeup of sediments, particularly chemical isotopes - different atoms of the same element that differ minutely in their mass. As Zeebe says,
We have two isotope systems that we can look at. One of those are oxygen isotopes and they are essentially a thermometer, they tell us about climate change. And the other isotope system we’re looking at is carbon isotopes and they tell us something about carbon release.
Zeebe and colleagues compared isotope samples with computer models of the climate system. They stretched the models’ carbon emission timescale until they got a match with the isotope measurements. This showed that the carbon emissions which caused the PETM took about 4,000 years - remarkably similar to an estimate of about 3,000 years just published by Ridgwell and his colleague Sandy Kirtland Turner. They used a completely different approach from Zeebe, focusing on the differences in the carbon signal between marine and land sediments.
Narrowing the PETM emissions timeframe to around 3,000 to 4,000 years shows that, like today, the global warming back then was caused by geologically-fast carbon emissions. But our emissions have taken just a couple of centuries so, as Zeebe points out: 
What we’re doing with our emissions is unprecedented in the past 66 million years!
Even if the PETM isn’t a perfect equivalent of today’s climate (it was slower, and it happened in a world that was already warmer than today), it still tells us how the planet reacts to a sharp excess of carbon in the atmosphere. For example, the 2013 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report says we can expect a warming of between 1.5°C and 4.5°C if we double atmospheric CO2 levels, but also acknowledges that the longer term warming (over centuries to millennia) “could be significantly higher” than that. The PETM tells us it is. Zeebe notes:
If we just try to explain the PETM with a climate sensitivity of 4.5°C, we only get maybe 60% of the warming. So my conclusion would be that long term sensitivity must be more than 4.5°C.
Ridgwell has also investigated global warming events going back deeper in geological time, including the big mass extinction events like the end-Permian and the end-Triassic, as well as so-called “Ocean Anoxic Events” in the Cretaceous. These involved profound and long-lived environmental disruption, with symptoms quite similar to today’s climate change, such as global warming, rainfall changes, and ocean acidification.
“Overall these are relatively slow events, on timescales of tens to hundreds of thousands of years,” says Ridgwell. But recent advances in rock dating, and in tracing Earth’s magnetic field frozen into ancient lava, suggests that within those slow events there may well have been intense, rapid episodes that came closer to today’s human emission rates.
You might have very short pulses of CO2 release within them. Some of these pulses of CO2 could look like what we’re doing now in terms of amount and rate. That’s an area of active research, because the estimates of individual pulses are getting better, but the estimates of how much CO2 would be released associated with an individual pulse are still uncertain.
Ridgwell is skeptical about ambitions to limit warming to 1.5°C: 
We have 1.5°C already programmed in, so even if we bring emissions right, right down, immediately, now, we already have 1.5 degrees! So how we’re keeping to a 1.5-degree threshold isn’t clear.
So a fun thing we’re doing now with our very fast warming is the ocean surface warms up and the deep ocean is still cold, which is partly why we have this programmed-in warming that we haven’t seen yet. The deep ocean hasn’t yet noticed that the planet at the surface is rather warmer. If we just sit here at current CO2 levels and let the system equilibrate, it’s 1.5°C anyway. Which comes back to COP21 - what is this 1.5°C target? We’ve emitted the CO2 to reach 1.5°C already, so I don’t know what they’re thinking of!
It seems as if everyone is assuming, without thinking about it, that there is massive carbon geoengineering going on.
Geoengineering is a word that covers a multitude of sins, but in this case it refers to sucking CO2 out of the atmosphere and burying it. Even the 2ºC target aimed at (but not reached) in Paris assumes quite a lot of active CO2 burial. The feasibility – or not – of that endeavor is an active debate, usefully summarized by Andy Skuce on SkepticalScience.com, but it may be crucial if we are to avoid the more extreme long term environmental effects and sea level rises that scientists see in the geological record.
Ridgewell again:
If the COP21 agreement works out even partly, then we probably won’t see 5 or 6°C. But the PETM took several thousand years, so marine and terrestrial ecosystems had thousands and thousands of generations to adapt and evolve, whereas we’re doing this on a decade-to-century scale. It’s a very, very different event in terms of rates, although you at least have a total magnitude maybe like the future.
For Zeebe the ability not only to reduce emissions, but to reverse them, is crucial.
The timescale over which ice sheets disintegrate depends on the duration of a temperature anomaly. If you warm the planet by 3 degrees [Note: that’s effectively what the COP21 Paris Agreement adds up to] over a few decades, and then you cool it down, you can probably keep large portions of Greenland and West Antarctica. But if temperatures remain elevated, this will melt big ice sheets. And then we’re not talking just of a sea level change of 1 meter by 2100, but rises of several meters for centuries.
But people tend to ignore this. The opinion seems to stop at 2100!

“We know that if we burn all the coal, oil and gas available, the Paris agreement cannot be fulfilled. Significant parts of the total fossil resources must remain, untouched,” said Karl Eirik Schjøtt-Pedersen, director of the Norwegian oil and gas association and a former minister of finance. 
Schjøtt-Pedersen argued that by exploiting its own fossil fuels Norway would help other countries, like Germany and Britain, to emit less because Norwegian gas was cleaner than coal.
“If Europe were to replace coal with Norwegian natural gas, this would result in a 50% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions for every unit of energy produced. We produce gas with low emissions, which can replace coal with high emissions,” he told a meeting this week of politicians, scientists and business people from Arctic nations in Tromsø, Norway.
Despite the Paris agreement to cut global emissions and oil prices falling to under $30 a barrel, Europe’s biggest oil and gas producer intends to expand production in some of the riskiest and most environmentally sensitive areas.
Earlier this month it issued 56 new licenses to allow 36 companies to explore near the picturesque Lofoten islands, which are home to some of the world’s richest cod stocks, as well as in the North and Barents seas. 
National oil company Statoil also plans to spend $6bn developing the Castberg field. This Arctic stretch of ocean north of Norway is estimated to hold up to 650m barrels of oil equivalent. 
According to the Norwegian prime minister, Erna Solberg, the current low oil prices will stimulate the global economy and the demand for Norway’s oil. “The oil and gas industry has been through major slumps before, but has kept growing. Although bad for Norway, low oil prices stimulate the global economy and the demand for oil,” she told the conference. 
She said Norway had no option but to exploit its oil. “Norway’s oceans cover a vast area. The seabed contains large resources of oil and gas. Our oceans provide vast opportunities for harvesting their bounty. Therefore, it is vital that we make every effort to ensure that the oceans are clean and productive,” she said.
Environmentalists said the prosperous country, with one of the highest GDPs per capita in the world, was acting as if Paris and the recent slump in oil prices had never happened. 
“The government is hypocritical and in denial over Paris. It does not think it is any brake on oil. They say our oil is cleaner and that the EU needs us. Meanwhile it is lobbying in Europe against stronger energy efficiency laws. There seem to be no limits on the Norwegian oil industry. They want to keep on expanding,” said Silje Lundberg, of Friends of the Earth Norway.
Norway intends to reduce emissions by 30% by 2020 and 40% by 2030. However, it is one of very few wealthy countries to have increased emissions since 1990. State statistics bureau SSB has stated that Norway’s oil industry accounted for 27% of all carbon emissions in Norway in 2013. Annual emissions from oil and gas production have increased by 91% since 1990.
The Norwegian oil and gas industry has been sharply hit by falling oil prices with many companies laying off staff and projects being mothballed. "

Aircraft emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), which are linked to lung damage, doubled since 1990 and are forecast to rise 43% by 2035.
The increase so far tracks a rise in the number of flights over the last 25 years, and a similar jump in the sector’s carbon dioxide emissions.
Airlines have reduced their planes’ NOx emissions in the last decade as the Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP) has tightened standards. But the improvements are coming too slowly, the report says.
 “We expect that the increase in growth in the air transport sector is going to offset those technological and operational efficiencies, leading to an absolute increase in emissions,” an official with the European Aviation Safety Agency told the Guardian.
NOx is an indirect greenhouse gas created by fuel combustion, that can lead to the formation of health-damaging air pollutants such as particulate matter (PM).
Around 23,500 Britons die prematurely each year from exposure to NOx, according to provisional government figures. Another 29,000 people die early from the effects of PM pollution.
High NOx concentrations around airports are a particular public health concern with Heathrow airport breaching safety limits in several different locations and times in 2012, according to its own measurements.
The UK government has been in beach of EU air quality laws since 2010, but a cleanup plan published in December did not envisage cities such as London becoming compliant for another decade.
Campaigners say that increasing emissions standards during aircraft landings and take offs would have the double benefit of protecting people who live close to airports and cutting the cruise emissions of airplanes in the future, as better engines are developed.
“The doubling of NOx emissions from aviation since 1990 is having a huge impact on our health and climate,” said Andrew Murphy, the aviation and shipping officer for Transport and Environment. “EU and international policies need to be urgently strengthened to reverse this trend, and that must include tighter emissions standards.”
The EU’s transport commissioner, Violeta Bulc, said that the report was intended to feed into international discussions on reducing planes’ emissions.
“Aviation brings significant economic and social benefits to Europe, but also has an impact on the environment,” she said. “In 2016, the EU will reach out to its partners to take global and ambitious steps.”
That process will begin in earnest in Montreal next week when a committee of the UN International Civil Aviation Organization meets to discuss a new CO2 standard for planes, and market measures to drive emissions down."

Responding to a rare question about climate change in Thursday’s Republican debate in Des Moines, Iowa, Rubio denied that he ever supported a “cap and trade” system to lower emissions, despite his having called it “inevitable” in 2008. 
“I have never supported cap-and-trade and I never thought it was a good idea,” the Florida senator said. “And I do not believe it’s a good idea now. I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment.
“And especially what these programs are asking us to pass … will do nothing to help the environment, but will be devastating for our economy. When I am president of the United States of America, there will never be any ‘cap and trade’ in the United States.”
On the campaign trail in Iowa this week, Rubio said policies being implemented by Barack Obama will harm the economy and cost “hundreds of thousands of jobs”.
Obama’s initial cap and trade plan was blocked by Congress. Instead, the Environmental Protection Agency will impose greenhouse gas limits on power plants, allowing a form of emissions trading between the states. 
Obama’s administration has pledged to cut US greenhouse emissions from all sectors by up to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025. Research released this week by scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) and the University of Colorado Boulder found that the US could slash emissions much further, cutting them by up to 78% below 1990 levels within 15 years, while meeting increased demand.
The market will work faster. There’s someone in a garage somewhere … that’s going to have a clue, to have an answer
These cuts, the Nature Climate Change study states, could be achieved “without an increase in the levelized cost of electricity”. It would be undertaken via a shift to a national energy system using existing renewable sources such as solar and wind and deploying the latest electricity storage technology.
Bush, once governor of Florida, has said he supports federal government support for “basic research” into low-carbon energy but, like Rubio, places his faith in the free market to deal with rising temperatures and the extreme weather events, drought and sea level rise they bring.
“What we shouldn’t try to do is pick winners and losers through the federal government,” he said at a gathering in New Hampshire on Saturday, in a newly emerged video. 
“The market will work faster. There’s someone in a garage somewhere, parochially I hope it’s in Miami, that’s going to have a clue, to have an answer to this. 
“There are people well-intended on climate change but they need to be careful to not paint the apocalypse. Because we are not there. But we should be adapting.”
Bush said he doubted sea level predictions for south Florida but, if they did come true, he has told his wife that they should move house. 
Last week, a group of 15 mayors in Florida, including Tomas Regalado, the mayor of Miami, wrote to Rubio to call upon him to “acknowledge the reality and urgency of climate change and to address the upcoming crisis it presents our communities”.
The letter states that sea levels rose by around 8in off the coast of south Florida during the 20th century and that a further rise of 1ft by 2050 will wipe out about $4bn of Florida real estate.
Florida is considered particularly vulnerable to sea level rises as it is low-lying and sits in parts on a base of limestone, which causes excess water to seep underground and inundate areas. Salt water intrusion is also a concern for the Everglades and the many species that rely upon the wetland ecosystem.
The League of Conservation Voters, which is backing Hillary Clinton, said Rubio had a “weak relationship with the facts” on the economic impact of tackling climate change.
“In 2016, the American people are making it increasingly clear they have little tolerance for candidates who willfully ignore the facts of climate change,” said Seth Stein, a spokesman for the lobby group.
Rubio’s views on climate action have gotten more dangerous as the threat to his home town has gotten more severe
 “The other news networks should follow Fox News’ lead, and finally ask the Republican candidates a question on climate change.”
Adam Beitman, a spokesman for environment group the Sierra Club, said: “Rubio’s views on climate action have gotten more dangerous as the threat to his home town has gotten more severe and the Koch brothers’ influence on his positions has gotten more pronounced.”Beitman said Bush’s comments showed that Republicans were paying “lip service” to action on climate change while opposing serious solutions to it.“When your plan is to wait around and hope that someone in their garage fixes the climate crisis, it’s clear you’re not taking the issue seriously at all – especially while seas are rising around your home state.”
Last year was the hottest year on record, according to Noaa and Nasa, beating the record set in 2014 by a “wide margin”. Of the 15 hottest years in the 150-year-old temperature record, 13 have occurred since 2000."

Why can’t we do it to solve climate change?";"We need an estimated $1tn per year to stay below a global temperature rise of 2C. Creating new money might be the only way to meet this financial challenge";"The international community has agreed on an ambitious agenda to curb climate change. Some 195 countries have decided to try and cut greenhouse gas emissions to a level that will limit the rise in average global temperatures to well below 2C. The question we now face is: how are we going to finance the changes needed to reach this goal? Quantitative easing – creating new money – might just be the answer.
To reach zero emissions by 2050 (and for a likely chance to stay below a rise of 1.5C), we need to scale up and accelerate the move towards 100% renewable energy, and replicate globally what is already being created in many communities, cities and regions: a fossil-free society based on a customer-centric and inclusive energy infrastructure.
The International Energy Agency has established that $1tn per year of renewable energy investment would be needed to stay under the 2C limit. To achieve the ambitious 1.5C limit agreed in Paris, substantially higher investment will be required. Our rough – and unofficial – estimate puts the figure between $1.5tn and $2tn.
The UN Green Climate Fund (GCF) – tasked with obtaining the “significant portion [of] new and additional” funds from developed countries, to $100bn per year until 2020 – currently stands at just $10.2bn. Previous experiences with getting financial commitments from taxes or semi-public funds – such as from emissions trading – also tell us that the sums provided regularly fall short of what’s promised.
Assuming that the GCF does manage to obtain a sum close to the promised $100bn a year, it is crucial that it receives the funding in the form of non-repayable grants. Only then will the GCF have the ability to make renewable energy and other projects attractive to private co-investors. If the only problem facing climate financing was a lack of credit, it would have been solved a long time ago.
A percentage of that spent to bail out private banks could pay for investments needed to stabilise the world’s climate
Since the beginning of the financial crisis, central banks have created trillions to stabilise the global financial system. First they bailed out private sector banks, and then they bailed out governments by buying up private and public bonds worth billions. The European Central Bank is currently buying assets with newly created money of €60bn a month to stimulate the economy in the eurozone and prevent deflation, for example. All this is possible because central banks can never become insolvent in their own currency as they alone issue the legal tender.
But an important side effect of these bailouts has been the realisation that central banks could play a more active role with their monetary policies; newly created money can be used to finance urgent global tasks that would otherwise not be undertaken. Just a percentage of that spent to bail out private banks could pay for investments needed to stabilise the world’s climate
To provide the necessary financial resources ( a big part of the $100bn promised to the GCF), central banks would carry on with what many of them are doing already: buying bonds with newly created money. But instead of buying existing private and public bonds, central banks would buy our proposed green climate bonds, which would be issued by the GCF, to finance climate change mitigation and adaptation projects. 
Under our proposals, these bonds would be for the long term (100 years or more) and would only bear small, if any, interest rates. They would become permanent assets of central banks and form the foundation of regular money creation, ensuring that the GCF is at the receiving end of new and non-repayable money. 
For developing countries, the advantages would be immediate access to the foreign exchange required for the construction of new sustainable infrastructure. If the central banks of developed countries purchased green climate bonds, they would benefit from an increase in demand for their goods and services. The purchase of such bonds would also finance new exports, which would revive domestic economies and lead to job creation.
Climate protection investments and the transition to 100% renewable energy are not only a moral obligation to future generations, but are also socially and economically beneficial today, as has already been shown in hundreds of communities around the world. 
As the Austro-British economist Friedrich Hayek once said, capitalism has one key advantage: the ability to respond to a sudden new demand with a spontaneous expansion of the relevant supply and – as long as there are idle economic resources – without risking inflation. 
If the GCF is given the financial power to expand demand for the renewable energy infrastructure required to reach the 1.5C goal, capitalism will have shown that it can meet the climate challenge.

Some Republican presidential candidates are beginning to peer out from behind the wall of climate denial that has defined the party as long as Barack Obama has been in the White House. Finally, it seems, the most open expressions of climate denial – such as dismissing long-established scientific fact – may be seen as a bit retrograde, and possibly embarrassing, even by some who are looking for votes from an increasingly rightwing Republican party.
In response to a rare question about climate change in Thursday night’s Republican debate, Marco Rubio offered up an answer that was rarer still in the 2016 campaign. He did not reduce climate change to a punchline or bash the science underlying climate change, as Ted Cruz and Donald Trump have been doing throughout the primary. 
Rubio spoke instead about policies for fighting climate change – in his case his opposition to cap and trade in his home state of Florida.
“When I am president of the United States of America, there will never be any ‘cap and trade’ in the United States,” the Florida senator said.
Jeb Bush, Rubio’s fellow Floridian, also steered clear of open climate denial, telling a gathering in New Hampshire on Saturday that he opposed federal government policies to deal with global warming.
“The market will work faster. There’s someone in a garage somewhere, parochially I hope it’s in Miami, that’s going to have a clue, to have an answer to this,” Bush said.
The fact that both candidates were operating under the assumption that climate change even exists might seem like progress of a sort. As Obama noted last month, the Republican party is the only major party in the advanced world that denies climate change.
In many cases, they still are. In the undercard debate on Thursday night, Carly Fiorina dismissed climate change as a silly Democratic party distraction from real security threats. Rubio and Bush openly expressed doubt about the existence of manmade climate change earlier in the campaign. Bush butted heads with the pope. Rubio made his now infamous remark that “America is not a planet”.
But there are signs of a shift. The Republican-dominated Congress voted by significant margins in December to extend tax credits for wind and solar power, a decision expected to lead to a boom in renewable energy. This week Republicans and Democrats joined forces on an energy reform bill, the first such bipartisan measure in more than eight years.
The White House believes the combination of constant ridicule from Obama and other Democratic leaders and “facts on the ground”, in the form of the clean power plan and other policies enacted through the use of executive authority, will force the next president to deal with climate change, even if a Republican wins the November election. 
“The next president will not be inclined to be able to [scrap the plan] whether he or she wants to change it,” Denis McDonough, Obama’s chief of staff, told a forum celebrating the Pulitzer Prizes at the Washington Post on Friday.
But mere acknowledgement of the existence of climate change is not enough. Neither Rubio nor Bush came forward to say what they would do to fight climate change. Their response to a gathering danger acknowledged by the Pentagon, 196 world leaders at the Paris climate summit and, yes, scientists, was merely to express opposition to the Democratic policy prescriptions already out there. Do they have no policy ideas? Would they leave climate solutions entirely to the market? That’s a huge oversight.
And given the abundance of evidence all around us about the dangers of climate change – extreme sea level rise in the Bush and Rubio home state of Florida, the public health emergency of the Zika virus, the climate-fuelled drought in California and super-sized blizzards in the north-east, just to name a few examples – such oversight by candidates is really just another kind of denial."

The report was a follow-up and expansion of a similar survey conducted in 2009 by the same institute. The key finding: there’s a strong consensus among climate economics experts that we should put a price on carbon pollution to curb the expensive costs of climate change.
The survey participants included economists who have published papers related to climate change “in a highly ranked, peer-reviewed economics or environmental economics journal since 1994.” Overall, 365 participants completed the survey, which established the consensus of expert climate economists on a number of important questions.
In the 2009 version of the survey, the respondents were asked under what conditions the United States should commit to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 57% answered that the US should cut its emissions no matter what actions other countries take, while another 38% said that American emissions cuts would be warranted if many or all other countries commit to reducing theirs (as just happened in the Paris international negotiations). 
In the 2015 survey, the number of expert economists saying that the US should cut its emissions no matter what rose to 77%. A further 18% said that if other countries agree to cut their emissions, the US should follow suit. In other words, there is a 95% consensus among expert climate economists that the US should follow through with its pledges to cut carbon pollution in the wake of the Paris international climate negotiations, and more than three out of four agreed that the US should take action to curb global warming no matter what.
This expert consensus is in stark contrast to conservative political opposition to the Paris accord. For example, Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio said of the agreement,
This kind of unilateral disarmament in our economy is reckless, and it is hurting the American Dream
Quite obviously an international agreement made by 195 nations around the world is the antithesis of unilateral action. However, 77% of expert economists agree that unilateral action would be appropriate in any case, directly contradicting Rubio’s comments. Additionally, 82% of the experts agreed that by implementing climate policies, the US could strategically induce other countries to cut their carbon pollution.
When asked at what date climate change will have a net negative impact on the global economy, the median survey response was 2025. In the recent past, climate change likely had a net positive impact on the global economy, due primarily to the effect of carbon fertilization on crops and other plant life. However, even contrarian economists agree, when accounting for the vulnerability of poorer countries to climate impacts, global warming has been hurting the global economy since about 1980. 
The NYU survey asked when the economic benefits we experienced up to 1980 would be completely wiped out; 41% of respondents said that’s already happened. Another 25% answered that it would happen within a decade, and 26% said we’d see net negative economic impacts by 2050. If we continue with business-as-usual pollution and warming, on average the experts predicted a GDP loss of about 10% by the end of the century, and that there would be a 20% chance of a “catastrophic” loss of one-quarter of global GDP.
Of course, ideally we would have stopped warming the planet in 1980 to preserve the economic benefits of global warming to that date. At this point it’s a question of just how much damage climate change will do to the global economy, and the economic experts are worried that the results could be catastrophic.
78% of the survey participants said that it’s likely (36%) or extremely likely (42%) that climate change will have a long-term negative impact on the growth rate of the global economy. That’s an important point, because most current integrated economic-climate assessment models assume that economic growth will continue regardless of climate change impacts. There’s been a growing body of research indicating that as you might expect, that won’t be the case. 
The results of this survey question show that most expert economists agree, climate change will hurt global economic growth. That also suggests that past model-based studies likely significantly underestimated the costs of climate change. Along the same lines, 51% of the experts answered that the US government’s estimate for the “social cost of carbon” ($37 per metric ton), which is largely based on estimates from these models, is too low. 18% of the experts said that value is about right, and just 8% said it’s too high.
The survey also asked the experts about the most economically efficient method of reducing carbon pollution. 81% said a market-based system (carbon tax or cap and trade system) would be most efficient, while 13% answered that coordinated performance standards and programs that prioritize cleaner fuels and energy efficiency would be most efficient.
In the US, President Obama’s Clean Power Plan is closer to the latter system of performance standards, although the president has said he would prefer the type of market-based system favored by 81% of economic experts. Implementing a carbon tax or cap and trade system would require bipartisan congressional action, but over the past several years, Republican Party leaders have shown scant interest in crafting the efficient climate policies favored by economic experts and by their own voters.
The NYU survey reveals a clear economic consensus on global warming. The experts agree: climate change is hurting the global economy, we should mitigate those costs by cutting carbon pollution, and the most efficient way to do that is with a market-based system like a carbon tax or cap and trade system.
This expert consensus clearly contradicts the arguments made by Republican Party leaders and other opponents of climate policies – that taking these actions will cripple the economy. In reality, economists are worried that if we fail to cut carbon pollution and instead continue with business-as-usual, it will badly stunt economic growth and may potentially lead to catastrophic economic consequences. 
However, we can still solve the problem while creating jobs and growing the economy, if our political leaders will listen to the economic experts and their voters. So far, convincing Republican Party leaders to listen to an expert climate consensus has been a fruitless task, but there are signs that the party is starting to move in the right direction."

Hydro- and thermo-electric (nuclear, fossil-fuelled, biomass-fuelled) power plants are vulnerable to dwindling rivers and reservoirs as the planet warms, a study published in Nature on Monday said.
These technologies, which provide 98% of global electricity supply, depend on abundant water to cool generators and pump power at dams.
Lower river levels and warmer water temperatures could reduce generating capacity by as much as 86% in thermo-electric- and 74% in hydro plants, according to researchers at Wageningen University and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis.
It comes as water demand for power generation is set to double within the next 40 years, the report said. Drought-stricken hydro producers have reverted to dirtier energy sources in the past to shore up tottering grids.
Global warming is set to boost river levels in Canada, India and central Africa as global weather patterns shift. Yet most hydroplants are in regions forecast to see shortages, like South America, which generates almost two-thirds of its electricity from hydro.
If those plants became 10% more efficient in producing electricity that could offset the constraints, the study said.
Converting to seawater and dry air cooling would achieve the same result for thermo-electric plants, but likely raise energy bills. Switching from coal to gas-fired power plants, whose cooling towers need less water, was preferable.
Non-hydro renewable sources are growing, but are unlikely to be the dominant sources of power generation over the course of the century, the study said.
Planners were urged to take heed of future constraints as they build new plants, which remain in operation for several decades.
“Considering the increase in impacts of water constraints on power generation and the long design lifetime of power plant infrastructure (∼30–60 years for thermoelectric power and 80 years for hydro power), adaptation options should be included in today’s planning to fulfil the growing electricity demands in the next decades.”"

Several voices were quick however to exploit underspending on flood defences to attack overseas aid commitments. Ironically, estimates of £5-£6bn flood damage costs are more than covered by UK subsidies to fossil fuels – providing a more obvious candidate to switch resources. 
Problematically, many clung to the idea that extreme events would trigger a change of mind on climate change. Yet policy seems untouched.
Unrelenting, bleak and disconnected is no way to start a new year. But what if there was a seasonal subject that could tell the climate story, explain how we might change and adapt and, at least if you live in the UK, provide a little pleasure too? 
Don’t put your glasses raised to new year down yet, the day of the champagne environmentalist may have arrived, in a good way.
The world of wine, and especially the sparkling kind, can seem frivolous. But shifting patterns of global production are becoming a bellwether for climate change. Rising temperatures and shifting rainfall patterns pose particular problems to an industry which is so sensitive to weather that even mild seasonal variations can be tasted in every glass of the final product. Some grapes, like pinot noir, prosper only in a temperature range of 14C-16C.
Increasing extreme weather events like the damaging European heatwave of 2003, revealed an acute vulnerability, for example, of traditional champagne-growing areas. Winemaking literally dried up. Last summer saw fears of a repeat. Wine reveals how a warming world challenges us to find new, more benign production methods and also to rethink our consumption habits.
The UK’s changing climate, with warmer summers and milder winters, has presided over a boom in the production of high-quality sparkling wines and a flourishing of small-scale producers, especially in the southwest, a part of the country hit badly by floods in 2014.
Breaky Bottom vineyard is one example, operating since 1974 at the end of a rough farm track near the town of Lewes and charming wine critics. That counts as well-established compared to its near neighbour the Bluebell vineyard which only began production in 2007 and started winning awards by 2011. 
Though still modest internationally, they are part of a surge of production which has seen the area under production in England double in seven years. A good year in 2014 saw the equivalent of 6.3m bottles produced, nearly 50% more than the previous year, and exports to 14 countries.
The high-quality, but small scale, non-industrial operation typical of wine making in the UK provides a lesson in sustainability according to Julia Stafford, founder of the Wine Pantry, a business set up to sell exclusively English wine. With a background in shipping, she saw the problems of industrial-scale production which is obsessed with cheapness, and the potential for a different approach in the emerging English market.
“People laughed at first. But long summers are good for us. We don’t have the problem of extreme heat. It’s a young industry in the UK, with small areas and experimental,” explains Stafford.
At Sharpham in Devon, award-winning wines are grown by the River Dart near Totnes. A study on whether the town could feed itself found that even with its current small-scale, high-quality production, the Sharpham vineyard produced enough to provide a bottle of wine each month to every one of the area’s 22,000 inhabitants. 
Internationally, says Stafford, “You have all this wine mass produced, an energy intensive industry. But here we tend to do hand picking, and use sheep and cows to graze instead of using herbicides. It’s a lighter footprint.” To get a more sustainable wine industry, she says: “Have one good bottle (that might be more expensive), not two (cheap) bad bottles.”
The UK has, for the moment, won the climate lottery for producing some wines. But success could be short-lived. As temperatures continue to rise, one projection suggests that by 2080 the south-west will only be good for growing raisins.
In the US, the wine industry already faces major challenges. California, for example has been hit by both protracted drought and extremes of rainfall. After a period of denial, growers there say climate change is becoming too obvious to ignore.
“I think that as human beings, until we experience something like real pain, we can generally find a way to rationalise things and pretty much defer tough decisions,” says Randall Grahm of the Bonny Doon Vineyard, a wine maker near Santa Cruz, celebrated for championing terroir and biodynamic growing techniques. “But, wells are running dry. The 2015 vintage is possibly the earliest harvest on record in California, and wild-fire flames are licking at the edge of Napa Valley.”
Rising temperatures are changing the characteristics of the grapes and the wine they produce, he says, and not in a good way. Alcohol content is going up and natural acidities are declining, eroding the wines’ finesse and elegance. In response, makers are trying to find new grape varieties or rootstocks, avoid local regulatory obstacles to planting new vineyards, and respond creatively to climate change.
“We are trying to plant a new vineyard in San Juan Bautista in such a way that will allow, at least for the red grapes, the possibility of dry-farming,” says Grahm, “We’re using more drought-tolerant rootstocks, wider plant spacing, smaller, head-trained vines, and most significantly, using biochar as a means of enhancing the water-holding capacity of the soil.”
Their ploughing technique is designed to avoid rain draining away. As well as adapting to climate change, Grahm is pioneering techniques to reduce the industry’s impact by reducing its more energy intensive infrastructure. He opts for a lower-impact plantation, progressively eschewing wires, end-posts, stakes, irrigation, in favour of a mixed plantation, ecological balance that might make spraying unnecessary and the use of biochar mixed with compost as a way to sequestering carbon in the soil. 
If you want to explain something, they say you should talk to people about what they care about. 
As public spending cuts were voted through in the last UK Coalition government, annual spending on champagne rose in the bars of Westminster to £35,000. Wine could be the ultimately safe subject to communicate climate change where even great deluges fail.
As some in the industry point to ways in which we can both adapt to and minimise warming, in the UK at least you can become a “champagne environmentalist” without it necessarily being an insult, as long as you don’t drink too much."

It's time to upgrade or be overtaken | Richard di Natale";"Businesses around the world are investing in low carbon technology. Political leaders can either seize the opportunity or get left behind";"2016 is promising to be a happy new year. The remarkable achievement of 196 nations signing up to the successor of the Kyoto protocol means the first ever year with a global agreement to end the old ways of pumping heat-trapping carbon pollution into our atmosphere and oceans.
Now the hard and exciting work begins.
Transitioning the economy to ensure a pollution-free future throws up enormous opportunities. Commercialising new technologies, improving our productivity by wasting less energy, building mass-transit networks and providing farmers with new income streams from carbon markets are just a taste. Entrepreneurs can see these opportunities and are already working hard to make these prospects a reality.
It became clear to me during the Paris climate talks that business, local governments and civil society are leading the transition and politicians are playing catch up. This century will belong to those nations whose political leaders display the courage and vision to transition to zero carbon economies. They will do this because they can see that far from simply posing a cost to their economy, it is a pathway to future prosperity.
Political leaders will either deploy the policy settings that unleash these opportunities in the new economy, or they will do nothing for fear of upsetting the dominant industries of today. Doing nothing is always the easiest political option, but it means saying farewell to many of the brightest ideas, jobs and investment that will leave our shores to more supportive commercial environments.
My home state of Victoria is a prime example of how if we choose to do nothing, we miss out on jobs and investment despite being perfectly placed to lead Australia’s transition to a clean economy.
Right now, 85% of Victoria’s homes and businesses are powered by brown coal, the dirtiest form of energy on earth. These power stations are old (their average age is 42 years), inefficient and operating well past their expected life. They are the old polluting Datsun Sunny on a highway of 21st century electric cars.
Victoria’s power stations are not just a drag on our environment, they are holding back jobs in the clean economy. For years governments have been told by the independent energy market experts that there is too much electricity in the system. Despite the assurances made when the Liberals and Labor joined together to slash the renewable energy target, clean energy construction is stagnant because the market is oversupplied with dirty power. Without a price on carbon pollution, brown coal will be the last to exit the market.
Through a staged timeline for Hazelwood’s closure we could remove a massive 13% of the state’s total pollution in one hit. This effect would be to open up space for new clean energy construction while injecting the skills and training that the new economy brings to Victoria’s workforce. If we set down a pipeline of clean tech projects and a detailed transition plan for workers in the coal industry, then much of the hard work is done.
The higher we set our clean energy and climate targets, the more investment and entrepreneurs we attract to help us reach them. It’s just another example of how the environment and the economy are moving in the same direction. The old false dichotomy of “jobs versus the environment” is well and truly redundant.
Attending the climate negotiations in Paris allowed me the opportunity to witness first-hand how this economic shift is unstoppable. The number of people, institutions and investors is huge and growing so the only question left is whether Australia wants to ride this wave or whether we’ll watch from the carpark.
There is a dawning realisation among Australians that responding to catastrophic global warming is no longer a brake on our economy. With the world acknowledging that there is no long-term future for coal and other fossil fuels a carefully planned transition that quarantines risk and protects workers will give us an unshakeable platform to build the jobs-rich clean economy that will define the 21st century. But we need to start now.
As the nation ponders the new year, our political leaders are faced with a momentous choice. If we choose to keep the settings on auto pilot, as we did with last month’s mid-year budget, then Australia will find itself with a 19th century economy bumbling along in a 21st century world. Alternatively we can embrace the change and set Australia up for greater prosperity and wellbeing than ever before. "

But what, if anything, will the landmark Paris agreement do for thousands of species already under threat from global warming?";"The word “biodiversity” is employed once in the Paris agreement’s 32 pages. “Forests” appears a few times, but “oceans”, like biodiversity, scores just a single appearance. There is no mention of extinction. Wildlife, coral reefs, birds, frogs, orchids, polar bears and pikas never show up anywhere in the document.
This is hardly surprising: the landmark agreement in Paris – the boldest yet to tackle climate change (which is saying something, but not nearly enough) – was contrived by one species for the benefit of one species. It was never meant to directly address the undeniable impacts of global warming on the world’s eight million or so other species – most of them still unnamed. But many experts say this doesn’t mean biodiversity won’t benefit from the agreement – especially if the 196 participants actually follow through on their plegdes and up their ambition quickly.
“[The agreement] is critical for people and it is critical for biodiversity,” said Edward Perry, Birdlife’s climate change policy coordinator, who dubbed the passage of the Paris agreement in December “monumental.”
Most biodiversity experts concurred that the Paris agreement was an important step forward, but none thought it would be enough to counter the vast risks posed to biodiversity by global warming. Indeed a recent study in Science found that more than 5% of the world’s species will likely go extinct even if we manage to keep temperatures from rising more than 2C, the uppermost target outlined in Paris. 
“[The Paris agreement] doesn’t go far enough, but that really misses the point,” said Nancy Knowlton, a coral reef expert with the Smithsonian Institution. “It moves us in the right direction, finally, and future efforts can be even more ambitious. To paraphrase Voltaire, we can’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.”
Scientists have identified thousands of species that have already been hit by global warming or will likely be in the near-future. For example, Edward Perry pointed to a recent scientific review by his organisation that found a quarter of the world’s most-researched birds have already been negatively impacted by climate impacts.
“According to climate projections, there will be more than twice as many losers than winners under climate change [for birds],” said Perry, who noted that, to date, scientist have pointed to 2,300 birds with traits that makes them “highly vulnerable” to global warming.
What is pushing them over the edge now, I believe, is a perfect storm of lethal conditions
Already, climate change has disrupted some bird’s food sources, messed with the timing of fledgling and migrations, and shrunk the range of cold-loving species.
Birds are a good example of how climate change is already impacting wildlife because they are the best studied group on the planet. Yet, they aren’t the only ones feeling the heat. Climate change is also likely playing a role in the current amphibian crisis, which has seen around 200 amphibians vanish for good in recent decades.
“Pathogens are always smaller than their hosts, with faster metabolisms, and should therefore be able to acclimate more quickly to temperature shifts,” explained Moore. “This is a phenomenon that will not just affect amphibians!”
Currently, habitat destruction remains the biggest threat to amphibians, making species more vulnerable to even slight climatic changes, according to Moore. 
“Amphibians have survived four mass extinctions associated with major climate disturbances. What is pushing them over the edge now, I believe, is a perfect storm of lethal conditions that we have created.”
Still, no one knows for certain how climate change will impact the majority of the world’s individual species, just as we don’t even know how many species share our planet (pegged at anywhere from 3 to 100 million, though a study in 2011 came up with an estimate of 8.7 million). But we can broaden our view. Just as there are some human communities living on the front lines of climate change – such as low-lying island states or drought-prone countries – there are also particular environments that scientists view as super vulnerable to climate change.
Coral reefs are considered one of the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet, and the most species-rich in the oceans. Their counterpart on land may well be cloud forests, which are high-altitude forests often blanketed in clouds – and also ridiculously rich in biodiversity. Similarly, coral reefs and cloud forests occupy very small slices of the planet: cloud forests make up only around 1% of the world’s forests and coral reefs less than 1% of the ocean’s floor. And both are feeling the heat.
Coral reef expert, Joshua Cinner with James Cook University, said that climate change is delivering three separate punches to coral reefs: hotter oceans lead to higher incidences of coral bleaching, ocean acidification (which, like global warming, is caused by carbon dioxide emissions) makes it more difficult for corals to build and maintain their skeletons, while more powerful storms fueled by climate change can wreck reefs.
It is not like two degrees Celsius, or even 1.5 degrees Celsius, is a threshold whereby everything will be OK.
For reefs, Cinner said, the climate crisis “isn’t something off in the far-flung future. It has already happened, and will continue to happen.”
This year, record high temperatures driven by climate change – and exacerbated by El Niño – has led the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to declare only the third global coral reef bleaching event on record. The key here is global: usually bleaching events are regional or localised.
When it comes to coral reefs, Cinner called the Paris agreement “a step in the right direction,” but also pointed out that even keeping temperatures below rising 1.5C – an aspirational goal in the Paris agreement – would not be enough to avoid further damage to the world’s reefs.
“It is important to understand that it is not like 2C, or even 1.5C, is a threshold whereby everything will be OK...The point is that even with a 1.5 degree rise, we are looking at very serious problems for many coral reefs.”
Amphibian-expert Moore agreed that there was significant uncertainty about biodiversity even with the 1.5 degrees goal in the Paris Agreement.
“It’s impossible to know what a world with temperatures 1.5C above pre-industrial levels will look like...but just talking about it ad nauseam is like debating who should call the fire department whilst watching your house burn down.”
Instead, he said, it’s time for action.
Cloud forests, like coral reefs, have evolved to survive within certain temperature gradients. Already, scientists have documented cloud forests literally migrating upslope to escape warming. But, according to David Lutz, a forest ecologist with Dartmouth, cloud forest species “do not appear to be migrating as fast as they need to be to keep up” with steadily rising temperatures.
“As the world grows warmer – or as periodic heat waves become more fierce – these species literally have nowhere to go but heaven,” said William Laurance, a noted rainforest scientist with James Cook University. “I think we’ll lose more biodiversity from tropical mountains than anywhere else in the world.”
The situation becomes even more complicated by the fact that many of these forests won’t even be able to migrate as far as possible. Instead, as tree seedlings sprout upslope they will run into high-elevation cattle ranching, at least in the Andes.
“As trees attempt to migrate up into this grassland, they will be either eaten by cows, or burned when the pastures are intentionally burned to encourage grass growth,” said Lutz.
If strategies to allow cloud forest to migrate as far as possible aren’t developed many of them are likely to vanish, taking innumerable species found no-where else with them.
The Paris agreement noted “the importance of ensuring the integrity of all ecosystems, including oceans, and the protection of biodiversity,” but went into few details about how individual countries should, or even could, go about safeguarding imperiled species in the face of rising temperatures.
When social change happens it can happen very quickly – this is what gives me hope.
What the agreement did do, however, was acknowledge the importance of conservation in protecting carbon sinks, often referring specifically to forests.
Moore, who called this inclusion “particularly significant,” said “we cannot talk about addressing climate change without stemming the rampant loss of the world’s forests.”
Experts said they hoped the agreement would boost initiatives like REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation), a UN programme that proposes to use funding from rich nations to pay developing countries to keep forests standing. Under negotiation for the better part of a decade, REDD+ projects are just beginning to launch – and the initiative made a number of important appearances at the Paris talks.
Prior to the meeting, the UK, Germany and Norway put down $5bn to reduce deforestation in the tropics, while African nations pledged to restore 100 million hectares of forest across the continent over the next 15 years. If done correctly – and with involvement by locals and indigenous groups – such programmes could go a long way toward preserving biodiversity on land.
But, some experts have become concerned not just about direct impacts on biodiversity from climate change, but how a warmer future could increasingly pit humans against wildlife.
“We have anecdotal evidence that poaching increases when droughts or floods affect food production,” explained Nikhil Advani, WWF’s senior program officer of climate change adaptation, who also noted that when hydroelectric power plants fail during droughts people often turn to forests for fuel.
He added that many of the big mammals that WWF focuses on “will be more affected by these indirect impacts from people than any direct impact of climate change.”
The international group is launching a crowdsource data campaign, WWF Climate Crowd, in order to better understand such threats.
Climate change poses a unique difficulty to biologists as they have to cut through several layers of uncertainty to understand how biodiversity might respond in 10, 20 or even 100 years. But given the rising observable impacts on species – from Arctic ice melt to worsening forest fires to record droughts in the Amazon – the risks are impossible to ignore.
“I just can’t get past the nagging feeling that we’re putting off a lot of tough decisions,” said Laurance, who attended the talks in Paris and pointed to plans by India and China to keep building new coal-fired power plants despite the countries’ climate commitments.
“[We’re] essentially relying on our children and grandchildren to make even bigger sacrifices and bear heavier costs because we weren’t really willing to grapple with these issues ourselves.”
But Knowlton with the Smithsonian Institution is more optimistic.

As aspiring and early career environmental scientists, this was a dismaying welcome, for we are immensely disturbed and angered by the well-documented complicity of these companies in climate denial and disinformation. For example, recent investigative journalism has shed light on the fact that ExxonMobil, informed by their in-house scientists, has known about the devastating global warming effects of fossil fuel burning since the late 1970s, but spent the next decades funding disinformation campaigns to confuse the public, slander scientists, and sabotage science - the very science conducted by thousands of AGU members. Even today, ExxonMobil and Chevron continue to fund the American Legislative Exchange Council, a lobbying group that routinely misrepresents climate science to US state legislators and attempts to block pro-renewable energy policies. 
The impacts of Exxon’s tactics have been devastating. Thanks in part to Exxon, the American public remains confused and polarized about climate change. Thanks in part to Exxon, climate science-denying Republicans in Congress and lobby groups operating at the state level remain a major obstacle to U.S. efforts to mitigate climate change. 
And thanks in no small part to Exxon, climate action has been delayed at the global level; as the international community began to consider curbing greenhouse gas emissions with the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, Exxon orchestrated and funded anti-Kyoto campaigns, including participation in the Global Climate Coalition. The latter was so successful at shifting debate that the George W. Bush administration credited it with playing a key role in its rejection of the Kyoto Protocol.
Yet throughout the week-long conference of Earth scientists, Exxon was promoted as an excellent career option. The geoscience professionals showcase - an “opportunity to talk with featured employers” - proudly included Exxon. In a series of career advice workshops on transitioning beyond academia, our speaker more than once named Exxon as a potential employer in her hypothetical case studies, whereas cigarette company Benson &amp; Hedges was derisively put forward as an example recruiter we’d never dream of accepting.
As the week drew to an end, we were left to wonder why it is that at the largest convergence of Earth and climate scientists, the hosting organization would seemingly engage in a serious conflict of interest by enthusiastically accepting support from companies that actively undermine the work of many of its members. Or why, if it’s now taboo to work for tobacco companies because they deceived the public about the dangers of smoking, the next generation of Earth science scholars still finds encouragement in pursuing careers in the fossil fuel industry, which continues to twist truths about climate change. 
Some may argue that Exxon atones for its wrongdoings in other ways, but its actions are invariably in bad faith. For example, the company has never put its weight behind a carbon tax despite claims of support for the concept. It is the very disingenuousness of Exxon’s ways that makes their greenwashing efforts - like sponsoring AGU - so crucial to their survival. 
AGU states that its mission and core values are to “promote discovery in Earth science for the benefit of humanity” and for “a sustainable future.” But by allowing Exxon to appropriate AGU’s institutional social license to help legitimize the company’s climate disinformation, and by granting it the privilege to recruit from AGU’s own cohort of emerging scholars, AGU is undermining the work of its own members.
The issue of career paths also raises a deeper question that we as a community must address - however uncomfortable - as to why we are still promoting the training and recruitment of the next generation of scientists to develop future technologies and methods for discovering more oil and gas reserves, when science has told us that no more than one third of existing reserves can be burned to avoid dangerous climate change.
When it comes to Earth sciences, AGU has established a long history of scientific excellence with its peer-reviewed publications and conferences, and we’re proud to be included among its members. It is for this very reason we hope that, instead of thanking Exxon, AGU will now say, “No, thank you, Exxon.” This issue has been an elephant in the room for too long. It’s high time AGU protects the integrity of climate science and the message it sends to the public by cutting ties with a climate-denying corporation and by denouncing Exxon for its disinforming ways.

After global heat records were continually broken over the last decade, and as sea levels rose and scientists reported the accelerated melting of polar ice sheets, you might be forgiven for thinking the debate over climate change had shifted.
No more arguing over the science? It’s more about the policy now, right?
Well, wrong. At least according to a new study that has looked at 15 years worth of output from 19 conservative “thinktanks” in the United States.
“We find little support for the claim that ‘the era of science denial is over’ - instead, discussion of climate science has generally increased over the sample period,” the study concludes.
The conservative thinktanks under the microscope are the main cog in the machinery of climate science denial across the globe, pushing a constant stream of material into the public domain.
The study, published in the journal Global Environmental Change, analysed more than 16,000 documents published online between 1998 and 2013 by mainly US groups like the Heartland Institute, the Cato Institute and the American Enterprise Institute.
Contrary to some commentators, the study found attacks on science had increased in later years. At the same time, the thinktanks were focusing less on policy issues.
To come to that conclusion authors Dr Travis Coan, of the University of Exeter, and Dr Constantine Boussalis, of Trinity College Dublin, analysed 8300 articles, 3000 reports, 100 interview transcripts, 680 open letters and press releases and 3400 “scientific” reviews.
So did the result surprise them? Coan told me:
One the one hand, we were aware that many in both the media and academia believed that science denial was on the decline.
However, this didn’t fit with our casual reading of the skeptical literature and thus a major impetus of the paper was to put this idea to the test. 
Though, with that said, we were a bit surprised by the ‘rise’: my prior expectation was that the denial of science and policy, at least on average, has remained relatively constant. This does not appear to be the case.
Not only had the attacks on science increased but thinktanks had also ramped up their climate change output in recent years, the study found.
But was it possible the study’s clear declaration that “the era of climate science denial is not over” might no longer stand, given that the study period ended in August 2013?
After all, since then we have seen the record for the hottest year on record broken twice and, for the first time, more than 190 nations agreeing in Paris to keep global warming to “well below 2C”.
Coan agreed this was “certainly possible”, but “there are also reasons to speculate that the trend has continued.” He said:
We are currently working on a study with John Cook that looks at science and policy related themes (amongst other items) in the top 50 climate skeptic blogs through 2015. The topic structure (i.e. discourse) is very similar, and sometimes identical, to the conservative thinktanks and there is reason to think that these two time series move together. For the blogs, we find that the increase in science-related skepticism continues right through 2015. Again, these results are preliminary, but suggest that the ‘end of science denial’ - at least among these actors - might be wishful thinking.
The study explained these thinktanks “provide a multitude of services to the cause of climate change scepticism”. These included:
Many of the 19 thinktanks analysed in the study have in the past accepted funding from fossil fuel interests, such as oil giant Exxon and the billionaire Koch brothers.
In October 2015 a study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) found thinktanks that had taken corporate funding from the likes of Exxon and the Kochs were more likely to produce material designed to polarise the climate change issue.
Exxon is currently facing an investigation from the New York attorney general into whether it lied to the public and investors about the risks of human-caused climate change.
Dr Justin Farrell, the author of the PNAS study, told me he was pleased to see more research into conservative thinktanks.
“We are still years away from fully understanding the extent of contrarian influence on climate change politics during the last 20 years,” he said.
The latest study seems to show that thinktanks began to concentrate more on attacking the science in around 2003 but it took until about 2010 for science attacks to overtake policy discussions. But why did this happen?
One possible reason, speculates Coan, is the effect of the 2009 illegal hacking of climate scientist’s emails from a server at the University of East Anglia.
While subsequent investigations found no wrongdoing, conservative thinktanks and commentators ran hard with the “scandal” – and some still do – claiming scientists were part of a grand conspiracy to deceive the world.
Dr Aaron McCright, of Michigan State University, who studies climate science denial, said the rising attacks on science appeared to have coincided with the election of Democrat Barack Obama as US president in late 2008. He said:
The Right no longer controlled the Executive Branch or Congress... at least for the first few years of the Obama Administration.. and thus no longer had as much power inside the government to block climate change policy as they did under George W. Bush. So, they - and a considerable part of industry - ramped up denial activism after 2008 to the high levels we have seen since.
McCright said the “denial machine” had since expanded from think tanks to include bloggers and fake grassroots campaigns and was now “more diverse and seemingly ubiquitous.”
He said conservative think tanks had influenced the public’s understanding of climate change and the way policymakers had reacted to it, in two ways. 
First, he said in recent decades US Republicans had used thinktank materials in committee meetings and hearings “to justify inaction on climate change”.
Second, thinktank materials had been taken up as the standard talking points for conservatives.
“Indeed, I would argue that anti-environmentalism - and climate change denial more specifically - has become a central tenet of the current conservative and Republican identity.”
Dr Riley Dunlap, of the Oklahoma State University, and who has partnered with McCright on several influential studies, told me:
While conservative thinktanks were involved in denial from the outset - 1989 at least - we have argued they really moved to the forefront in the late 90s when BP and then other companies pulled out of the industry-led Global Climate Coalition that had arguably been the most powerful force in denial. In fact, the conservative thinktanks were upset that oil companies were ‘caving in’ to the IPCC, and decided to take the lead. This also really shifted the basis of denial from economic self-interest to ideological opposition – the commitment to neoliberalism’s distaste for all government regulations.
McCright added that “knowing what is going on is one thing” but knowing what to do about it was more challenging. I’ll leave you with his thoughts.
Opposing policy is one thing. Undermining, denying, obfuscating, etc. science is another. I wish I had a powerful, simple solution to counter the climate change denial movement, but I don’t. Nevertheless, at the very least, we can continue to drag them from the shadows and into the bright light of day, vigilantly document their activities, and regularly call them out over what they are doing.

The average national temperature in 2015 was 54.4F (12.4C) – 2.4F (4.3C) above the 20th-century average – making it the second-warmest year since record-keeping began in 1895, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) said.
Jake Crouch, a climate scientist with Noaa’s National Centers for Environmental Information, said that the temperature average across the contiguous US was more than six degrees above the previous century’s average. “No state was actually cooler than average during 2015,” Crouch said in a press conference. “Every state had an above-average temperature during the year.”
Last year was the 19th consecutive year where the annual average US temperature exceeded its 20th-century average – only 2012 was warmer, with an average temperature of 55.3F. Although 2.4F doesn’t sound like much, Noaa cautioned that it was an indicator of a global climate imbalance.
“Although on a day-to-day basis it may not be that big a deal, over time it is large, because part of the events that build that 2.4-degree difference are the kinds of things that we saw in the eastern United States this December,” said Deke Arndt, chief of the climate monitoring branch at Noaa’s National Centers for Environmental Information.
Noaa’s data also noted the extreme nature of weather-related natural disasters in 2015. “In 2015, there were 10 weather and climate disaster events in the US, each with losses exceeding $1bn,” said Adam Smith, an applied climatologist at Noaa. “Overall, these resulted in the deaths of 155 people and had significant economic effects.” Smith noted in particular a spree of tornadoes in Texas, record-setting rainfall and flooding in South Carolina, and a western wildfire season which burned more than 10m acres – “the largest area burned since record-keeping began in 1960”.
Released on the heels of a landmark global climate deal that aims to hold nearly 200 nations accountable for greenhouse gas emissions, as well as only weeks after anunseasonably warm holiday season, Noaa scientists cautioned against making any direct links between the record-nearing average temperature and global warming related to climate change.
“Climate is an outcome of many ingredients and many factors to give us the outcome that they do,” said Arndt, who also noted that the particularly strong El Niño weather phenomenon likely contributed to distinct weather events.
El Nino’s presence also contributed to one of the rainiest years in history. “The contiguous US also experienced its third-wettest year on record,” primarily related to the strong presence of El Niño, said Crouch. Not all states benefitted from the rain, however, with California suffering “an exceptional drought throughout all of the year, according to Crouch, making 2015 California’s 13th-driest in 121 years of record-keeping.
Noaa scientists also said that the organization’s September prediction that 2015 would likely shape up to be the world’s hottest on record was still expected to bear fruit. Those data are due for release 20 January."

From natural hazards to natural resources, and from climate change to planetary science, Earth and space scientists serve especially crucial roles. Providing them with the tools they need to effectively communicate the facts of their research so that policymakers, business leaders, and the public can make informed decisions is crucial. 
Despite the important role science plays, we scientists are often stereotyped as uninterested or incapable of translating our work into something the public can understand. To the contrary, many of us who would otherwise be interested in communicating our science to broad audiences often find ourselves lacking the necessary training. 
The absence of formal training opportunities is perplexing problem, as scientists have much to offer society as a whole. Where departments and institutions fall short in providing training, for Earth and space scientists at least, the American Geophysical Union’s (AGU) Sharing Science Program fills that gap. 
AGU is a society with nearly 60,000 members worldwide, devoted to promoting discovery in Earth and space science for the benefit of society. It hosts the world’s largest Earth science meeting, held each December in the USA. In addition to its core mission, AGU is dedicated to the promotion of science to a larger audience. To fill that role, AGU created the Sharing Science program. 
The Sharing Science network is composed of scientists from around the world who are passionate about sharing their science with broad audiences. Members range from undergraduates who are looking for advice on how fit science communication into their career path, to researchers who want to express the value of their work to lawmakers and legislators, to tenured professors who never received formal training in science communication but are now realizing the value of translating their work into plain English. 
The program encompasses all of the resources and opportunities needed to help scientists effectively communicate with broader audiences — including journalists, educators and students, policymakers, and the public — about Earth and space science and its importance. It includes interactive workshops, webinars, toolkits and more to help scientists understand their audience’s needs and to improve their communications skills. 
AGU also creates and facilitates opportunities for scientists to share their knowledge with a variety of audiences through social media, op-eds, connections with local community groups or legislators, public talks, and media interviews. And scientists are offered the opportunity to network with other science communicators, volunteer to serve as experts and resources to reporters, and have their voices heard through our blogging and social media platforms.
I asked Dr. Shane M. Hanlon with the Sharing Science Program at AGU how they help scientists become better communicators. He told me, 
AGU wants to help scientists convey the value of their work to diverse audiences by empowering them to be visible, authoritative, and accessible voices in their community and the world. 
Sharing Science seeks to break down barriers, whether it’s a barrier of not knowing how to find opportunities to engage their audiences, or a barrier imposed by the formalness of scientific training. One small example of such a barrier is the use of jargon. Because it acts as a barrier when communicating science, the program aims to teach scientists how to avoid jargon when speaking with diverse audiences. Non-scientist audience members shut down at the first mention of “geomorphology” or “hydrostatic equilibrium,” but when scientists talk about the origins of landscapes and fluids at rest, the picture is clearer. While jargon is a necessary part of science, reducing its usage is a core part of being a successful science communicator. 
It’s important for scientists to be clear, but also concise. Explaining research in plain English is one thing; not boring the audience to death in the process is another. That’s why AGU provides scientists with the tools to explain years of work in 30 seconds or less. If a scientist can sum up their work in 30 seconds, then giving a 5-minute radio interview, 10-minute talk at a conference, or 1-hour presentation to community group becomes less intimidating.
These are just a few examples of how the program works to eliminate those barriers to successful communication. Scientists don’t have to “dumb down” their research or lesson the intellectual merit or seriousness of their work, they just have to speak in ways that engage their audience’s attention and values.
So, what’s next for this endeavor? Illustrating the importance of science communication is getting easier but there is still a lot of work to do. “It feels like things are different now – that we’re past the point of having to convince people that there’s a need for better science communication, so now we can just get right to helping scientists hone their skills,” said Aaron Huertas, multi-year leader of a “Communicating Climate Science” workshop at the AGU annual meeting and Senior Washington Director with Cater Communications, a bipartisan strategic communications firm. 
The Sharing Science program is only in its third year, but AGU has seen an increase, not only in membership, but also in interest about the program and science communication as a whole. Every year at its annual meeting, AGU runs numerous workshops on science communication, and Sharing Science staff members travel all over the country to train eager scientists in communication techniques. AGU is also partnering with other organizations and societies to provide scientists with communication tools.
What scientists are also learning is that the value of communicating is now becoming acknowledged by their peers. And it isn’t just AGU that’s involved. Other organizations like the Union of Concerned Scientists, The American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the American Meteorological Society either acknowledge excellence in communication or support communication efforts of their members. 
There are also groups whose sole focus is on climate communication (Climate Communication and Climate Nexus are perhaps the best). Five years ago, my colleagues and I even set up a website whose goal is to connect reporters and elected officials with scientists to talk about current climate events (the Climate Science Rapid Response Team).
 Perhaps the most prestigious communication honor is the annual Climate Communication Prize. The past five winners are really the who’s-who among our community. I asked the most recent winner, Dr. Richard Somerville, about the importance of communication, particularly for young scientists. He told me, 
I encourage all scientists, including young scientists, to explore the opportunities for communicating their science and to seek help from professionals. Nobody is born a great communicator, but it involves skills that can be learned. Many universities and research institutions have helpful experts on staff whose job is to translate the science into everyday English for the media and other outlets. I have benefited by working for more than 20 years with a superb communications professional, Susan Joy Hassol. On the website climatecommunication.org, she and I and our colleagues have assembled many valuable resources for communicating climate science.
Young scientists also need to be mentored skillfully in the art of combining communications work with the other aspects of their job, such as research and teaching and service. A word of caution: Different employers will have different expectations, and it may be prudent for a young scientist to establish a strong record in research, for example, before spending much time on communication. I advise young scientists to learn from the senior colleagues who will assess them for promotions and tenure. Keep in mind that these people may judge quality by looking in a mirror.
At the end of the day, the goal is get science out there, from scientists to any audience. "

The huge flood will reverse the seaward flow of the river that feeds into the lake, submerge forests, make a perfect wetland for spawning fish and will replenish soils for a rich rice harvest.
Tonlé Sap is the most intensely-fished inland body of water in the world and as the annual flood subsides, many millions of fish will flow from it and back into the massive Mekong river where they will become the staple food of thousands of villages.
But this extraordinary annual cycle which has fed Cambodia’s 23 million people for centuries is fracturing as first China, and now neighbouring Laos and Thailand, prepare to build a series of great dams across the mighty Mekong and its tributaries to provide electricity for the region’s burgeoning cities. Eleven dams are planned to span the main river and nearly 100 more on its tributaries.
The dam builders and governments cite the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions but what they don’t tell people is that the dams will slow the flow of the Mekong basin rivers and affect food supplies. 
The Tonlé Sap, known as the beating heart of Cambodia, is liable not to flood, says Mark Goichot, a hydro-geologist working with WWF. “Most of Cambodia’s fish spawn is in Tonlé Sap lake, that is fed by the Mekong river. If less water comes downstream because of the dams, the lake will not flood as usual and the fish will not be able to migrate upstream, affecting the food supplies of millions of people. It is an ecological timebomb that threatens the food security of millions.”
Now a paper in the journal Science  from 39 leading aquatic ecologists warns that the Mekong, Amazon and Congo – the world’s three greatest and most biodiverse tropical rivers – all stand to be heavily dammed, possibly resulting in the loss of up to one third of all the freshwater fish in the world.
Tropical rivers are traditionally less dammed than those in temperate regions partly because they are mostly far from large human populations and are in places hard to access. But now, as demand for electricity soars across Africa, Latin America and the south-east Asia, it is increasingly attractive to develop hydropower.
In total, say the authors, over 450 large dams are planned for the three river basins. The consequences for food production is unknown, but it has been calculated that if 11 of the 12 mainstream dams are constructed on the Mekong, the total loss in fish could be between 550,000 and 880,000 tons a year. According to International Rivers, an environmental NGO, more than 100 species of fish in the region could face extinction.
The paper takes as an example of the gap between official promises and reality the Three Gorges dam across the Yangtze river in China. This was finished in 2012 at a cost of around $20bn and was justified by the government as providing 10% of all China’s electricity. In fact it generates under 2%.
On the plus side, the biggest dam in the world has provided flood control, masses of electricity for cities like Shanghai and better river navigation. But on the debit side, it has had a devastating effect on fish populations, and led to increased erosion and landslides, and poorer water quality downstream. Moreover, it has forced over 1 million people to move and has spread disease. Now the Chinese authorities are having to spend up to $26bn over 10 years to mitigate some of the adverse environmental effects.
So are big dams worth it? The unprecedented building boom is widely justified as good for people because dams provide cheap electricity for development, and good for the environment because they are said to provide clean electricity and lower carbon emissions in a warming world. As such, they are likely to become more popular as countries try to meet the targets they set for themselves at the Paris climate summit in December.
The reality is that they are anything but climate-neutral and are responsible for large volumes of CO2 emissions from the concrete needed to build them, and for vast quantities of powerful methane gas emissions from the rotting of vegetation and soils flooded by their large reservoirs. By some calculations, the world’s 33,071 registered large dams may even produce 4% of all climate emissions.
The world is right to seek clean energy, but the unintended consequences of a rush to tropical hydropower may be as dangerous as climate change itself.

The “greening government commitments”, which began when David Cameron declared he would lead the “greenest government ever” in 2010, were intended to deliver big cuts in carbon emissions, domestic flights, waste and water usage. 
Efforts fell short on all counts, though the reductions that were achieved still saved taxpayers £185m in the last year.
Ministers have been heavily criticised for cuts to a swath of green policies, including renewable energy and energy efficiency, and a leaked letter in November revealed the government is not on track the meet the nation’s EU obligation for green energy in 2020.
“Ministers’ failure to hit almost all of these targets means a bigger bill for taxpayers and more damage to the environment,” said Lisa Nandy, Labour’s shadow energy and climate secretary. “If the government can’t even cut its own pollution footprint, how can anyone have confidence they will cut Britain’s?”
“The government has still managed to save £185m in energy, waste and water costs, showing that environmental protection makes economic sense too,” said Craig Bennett, head of Friends of the Earth. “The government must end its relentless attacks on green issues and make the reduction of the nation’s environmental footprint a top priority.”
Ministers had targeted a 25% cut in carbon emissions from government buildings and travel in 2014-15, compared to 2009-10, but achieved 22%. The failure was largely due to the Ministry of Defence, which accounts for half of all government emissions and cut its emissions by 19%.
Emission cuts came largely from improved energy efficiency and accounted for 90% of the money saved. But the government recently cut plans to improve energy efficiency in people’s homes by 80%. George Osborne’s Treasury, often blamed for the government’s anti-green moves, cut its own emissions by 56%, one of the largest savings.
More than 169,000 domestic flights were taken by government officials in 2014-15, unchanged from the year before. This represents an 18% cut compared to 2009-10, but falls short of the 20% target.
Just eight of 22 departments met the target, while domestic flights by environment department staff actually increased and those from the culture department more than doubled. Health department flights plummeted, however, by 62%.
Waste reductions also failed to improve last year, with the overall cut at 22% compared to the 25% target. The Department of Energy and Climate Change’s waste went up by 18%, while that at the Department for Education fell by 62%.
On water use, just six departments managed to meet the good practice benchmark set as a target and 12 of the 22 departments met a target on transparency on the steps they were taking to be greener. But the government slashed its paper use by 38% overall, far above the 10% target.
“While the headline achievements may fall slightly short of the targets set for 2014-15, the picture at department level shows that many departments are meeting and exceeding targets, while others are recording valiant reductions in face of significant operational challenges,” said ministers Oliver Letwin and Rory Stewart in a foreword to the report.
A spokesman for the environment department said: “Following this success we are developing a new set of greening government commitments to see how we can go further, making the UK even greener.”
But Bennett criticised the government for missing its targets. “This says everything about the incompetence of this government when it comes to protecting the environment,” he said. “For months ministers have been systematically undermining national efforts to tackle climate change, and now we learn that they’ve failed to meet a whole range of green targets for their own performance too.”"

Researchers examined 175 satellite photos of giant icebergs in the Southern Ocean which surrounds Antarctica and discovered green plumes stretching up to 1,000km behind them. The greener colour of the plumes is due to blooms of phytoplankton, which thrive on the iron and other nutrients shed by the icebergs.
When these tiny algae - or the many creatures that eat them - die, they fall to the bottom of the ocean. This takes the carbon dioxide they have absorbed from the ocean surface and buries it deep below, thereby curbing the CO2 in the atmosphere and the global warming it causes.
“If giant iceberg calving increases this century as expected, this negative feedback on the carbon cycle may become more important than we previously thought,” said Professor Grant Bigg at the University of Sheffield, who led the study published in the journal Nature Geoscience.
Giant icebergs, defined as greater than 18km in length, make up half the ice floating in the Southern Ocean, with dozens present at any one time. The researchers calculated that the fertilisation effect of the icebergs in the normally iron-poor waters contributes up to 20% of all the carbon buried in the Southern Ocean, which itself contributes about 10% of the global total.
“We detected substantially enhanced chlorophyll levels, typically over a radius of at least four to 10 times the iceberg’s length,” said Bigg. The chlorophyll levels remained 10 times higher than in the surrounding ocean for at least a month and up to 200km behind the iceberg. Some increase in phytoplankton was seen as much as 1,000km behind the iceberg in a few cases.
The discovery was a surprise as previous studies of small icebergs, or using ship-based measurements, has suggested a much smaller fertilisation effect. The largest iceberg analysed in the new study was more than 50km long. 
The impact of global warming on melting ice in Antarctica, much of which is far below 0C, has been widely studied. Biggs and his colleagues note that satellite gravity data show a 5% increase in ice discharge from the continent over the past two decades.
In 2014, two separate teams of scientists found that the collapse of the Western Antarctic ice sheet is already under way and is unstoppable. The loss of this entire ice sheet would cause up to 4m of sea-level rise in coming centuries. In 2015, researchers found the melting of floating ice shelves around Antarctica was faster than thought, potentially unlocking extra sea level rise from larger ice sheets jammed behind them.
Professor Andrew Shepherd, director of the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling at the University of Leeds, said in 2015 that the rates of ice shelf loss were unsustainable and could cause a major collapse. This is already occurring at the massive Pine Island glacier, where ice loss has doubled in speed over the last 20 years as its blocking ice shelf has melted."

In a conference call with reporters, Steyer said the speech on Tuesday offered one of the last high-visibility moments for Obama to make his case to the American public for a transformation of the US energy and climate system.
The last year was a banner year for climate change – with the Paris climate agreement, the rejection of the Keystone XL pipeline, an effective ban on Arctic drilling, and the finalisation of rules cutting carbon pollution from power plants, Steyer told the call.
“This is a great opportunity to make that case and make sure that the moves we made are decisive and irrevocable,” Steyer said. “He is obviously not going to get specific climate legislation through by the end of his administration … This is a chance for him to really address Americans and explain to them what he has been doing, why it still needs to be done, and why it is so important.”
On Monday, Steyer’s NextGen Climate teamed up with fellow activists Van Jones, founder of Green for All and briefly green jobs adviser for Obama; Mona Mangat, board chair of Doctors for America; and Michael Breen, chief executive of the Truman national security project, for the release of a new report casting climate change as a threat to national security and public welfare.
“To truly address poverty, we must address climate change once and for all. The economic burden of climate change will not be shouldered by all families equally,” the report Threat Multiplier: Climate Change and the State of Our Union, said.
The report extends the idea first embraced by the Pentagon nearly a decade ago that global warming deepened existing risks to the international order. (By 2014, the Pentagon had elevated climate change as an “immediate risk” to national security and its infrastructure).
It points out the public health risks posed by air pollution, water shortages and drought – all of which will be exacerbated by climate change, and notes the Pentagon’s concerns about national security.
“It is in America’s best national security interest to take action on climate change,” the report said, noting that the Syrian conflict and refugee crisis were fueled in part by drought and climate change.
Steyer has spent millions from his own fortune backing candidates with strong environmental records in an attempt to elevate the issue of climate change in elections – with mixed results.
The billionaire’s NextGen Climate group is pressing candidates to back his call for powering the country with more than 50% clean energy by 2030 – a far more ambitious target than Obama’s – and 100% clean energy by 2050.
Among potential presidential candidates in 2016, only the struggling Democratic contender, Martin O’Malley, matches Steyer’s level of ambition."

Before his appearance before the liaison committee at 4pm on Tuesday, the prime minister was accused of double standards for abandoning a commitment to hold a competition to encourage the development of carbon capture and storage (CCS), which could lead to decarbonisation of coal and gas, at the same time as professing to be serious about tackling climate change.
Just a year ago, Cameron had told the same group of MPs, made up of select committee chairs, that CCS was “absolutely crucial” for the UK, before funding for a £1bn trial was later scrapped.
Angus MacNeil, the chair of the energy and climate change committee, and Huw Irranca-Davies, the chair of the environmental audit committee, plan to challenge Cameron about the government’s decision, arguing it undermines the commitment to tackling climate change.
“The prime minister said that carbon capture and storage was crucial to meet our climate change targets,” MacNeil said. “Yet the government’s long-promised carbon capture competition has become the latest low-carbon policy to be chucked on the scrapheap.
“The prime minister must acknowledge that building a new generation of gas plants means that we either have to fit power stations with carbon capture technology in the coming decade or potentially bust our carbon budgets.”
The government has said the CCS development competition was always subject to affordability.
Cameron is also likely to be questioned on issues such as the Syria crisis and flood protection."

Technology could share the load";"In the fight against climate change, trees are an ally. They suck in carbon dioxide, reducing the harmful greenhouse gases. But there’s a problem: we’re asking them to work overtime.
Trees can’t absorb enough of the carbon dioxide humanity is throwing at them unless we turn every inch of available land into a dense forest, according to Christophe Jospe, chief strategist at Arizona State’s Center for Negative Carbon Emissions.
But what if trees – or machines modelled after them – had superpowers? Artificial trees with otherworldly abilities are a great hope against climate change, since environmental experts say it’s not realistic to expect humanity to release significantly less carbon into the atmosphere. Our best bet might be to capture the excess carbon and store it or convert it into something useful, such as fuel.
Five years ago, a Boston group recruited two designers to develop artificial city trees. The trees they envisioned offered shade and would absorb carbon dioxide. The thinking was to place the trees where soil was too shallow to host traditional trees.
The group delivered great mock-ups, but little else has come from it so far. Finding funding is a challenge.
“You don’t want to be the first person to pay,” said Kimberly Poliquin, the director of ShiftBoston. “Scientists have figures, but you don’t know if that’s going to be the reality.”
Capturing and storing carbon isn’t yet the type of expense local governments and organisations can slide into their budgets. The cost of the technology is dropping, but not to a point where it’s affordable to install “forests” of these systems. Poliquin estimates an upfront cost of $350,000 for an artificial tree, but she expects prices to come down considerably. She hopes to develop a prototype of such a tree in one or two years.
There’s plenty of interest in removing carbon from the air. One method is to capture carbon directly from the smokestacks of power plants. Another method – which the Boston project targeted – is pulling carbon out of the open air, where it isn’t present in as much density. In theory, one square kilometre of artificial trees could remove 4m tons of carbon a year, according to the Center for Negative Carbon Emissions, which is developing a technology to work in open spaces.
Find me $100m, and I’ll tell you how to put it to a very aggressive research and development agenda
Seven large-scale projects to capture and store carbon at power plants will arrive in 2016 and 20-17. Most are in the US and Canada. But more growth is needed before carbon capture and storage makes an impact on climate change. According to the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute, the 15 large-scale projects operating around the world can capture 28m tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. To keep climate change in check, we’ll need to process 4bn tonnes in 2040 and 6bn in 2050.
The Center for Negative Carbon Emissions is developing technology that it says is 1,000 times as effective as trees, per unit of biomass. The group is located in the desert because its technology responds well to warm, dry air and requires less energy in that environment.
Operating in cooler climates, such as Boston, would add expenses.
Once the technology is fully built out, the group estimates it will be removing carbon dioxide for about $100 a tonne. As is, there’s no resemblance to a tree as scientists – including those at Arizona State – focus on making the carbon-removal process effective and affordable rather than beautiful to look at.
More developments are needed for it to be cost-effective and spread around the world. Since 2007, the Global CCS Institute says, the global investment in carbon capture and storage has been less than $20bn, about one-hundredth of the investment into renewable technologies.
“It needs the likes of Mike Bloomberg, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and Tom Steyer to champion early technology efforts to bring the cost down,” Jospe said. “Find me $100m, and I’ll tell you how to put it to a very aggressive research and development agenda, and five years later you can see some exciting technologies that start to show on the market.”
Gates is one of the investors in Carbon Engineering, a Calgary, Alberta, company that is developing industrial-grade technology to capture carbon and make fuels. It’s a promising case, but not yet something ready to substitute for a tree in a city park.

But 2016 will see the president back in the trenches, fending off law suits and Republican attacks that could undo his climate plan, and scrambling to get to key items on his to-do list before exiting the White House.
In a sign of the battles yet to come, Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said he had invited as his guest a Kentucky coalminer who lost his job when his mine shut down, a gesture intended as a rebuke to Obama.
Administration officials and campaign groups said Obama is unlikely to let up in his final year in the White House: pursuing new rules to cut methane emissions from the oil and gas industry and pressing Congress to increase funding to communities hit hard by flooding, drought and other extreme weather events fuelled by climate change.
2015 was Obama’s biggest year for climate change with the finalisation of the clean power plant rules, rejection of the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, ban on Arctic drilling and, in December, the forging of an historic global agreement in Paris to limit warming below 2C – all of which are expected to get a mention in Obama’s speech.
“Under President Obama’s leadership, the United States has done more to combat climate change than ever before,” the White House said in a fact sheet prepared for the address. 
Administration officials said Obama planned to keep up the pace in the remaining months of his term. “2016 is not going to be a year we slow down. It’s a year we build on the momentum of the historic year that passed,” Gina McCarthy, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, told the Council on Foreign Relations last week. 
Officials said Obama will take centre stage in a signing ceremony for the Paris global warming agreement at the United Nations in April.
 “You can be sure that the United States will be doing what ever we can to get a lot of momentum into early entry into force of this agreement,” Paul Bodnar, senior energy and climate director at the National Security Council, said.
But the president will be racing to the finish line to roll out the remaining items on his climate agenda – which are critical to delivering on the emissions goals he promised in Paris.
In the weeks ahead, Obama is expected to roll out long-awaited rules to cut methane emissions from oil and gas wells and landfills, a rising source of climate pollution.
The White House has spent the last six months on a final review of proposed new rules cutting methane, more than 80 times as warming as carbon dioxide in the 20-year timeframe.
The administration is also expected to tighten curbs on heavy vehicle emissions.
Analysts said that Obama will need to double down to meet the target of cutting emissions 17% on 2005 levels by 2020 set at the start of his presidency in 2009, and even more ambitious goal of 26%-28% cut in emissions by 2025 pledged under the Paris climate agreement.
Some of those targets were based on assumptions that have not materialised - such as rapid growth of hybrid and electric vehicles. In 2011, Obama set a goal of 1m electric cars by 2015, but record low oil prices have sent consumers back to pick-up trucks and SUVs.
The administration said it can find other areas to cut. White House officials told a seminar at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies last week that they hoped to amend the Montreal protocol ozone treaty this year to ban hydrofluorocarbons, which are used in air conditioning and are 10,000 more warming than carbon dioxide. The EPA estimates a ban could shave off 0.5C of warming.
Obama was also counting on an international aviation agreement to help pare emissions. 
But Obama’s main focus will be ensuring that the rules cutting carbon emissions from power plants – the biggest single US climate pledge - survive a legal and political onslaught.
McCarthy told an event at the council on Foreign Relations last week the administration wanted to do all it could to ensure the power plant rules remain “cast in stone”.
She said the administration would spend its remaining months implementing the clean power plant rules, and defending the regulations from legal challenges.
The speech promises Obama one of the last big moments to elevate the climate cause. In his 2015 state of the union address, the president said: “No challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change.”
Obama is unlikely to ease up on climate now.

At times it got rather tetchy, and Andrew Tyrie certainly delivered on his promise to deliver “robust questions”. (See 3.35pm.)
 I’m very happy to do that, I think if people make offers and the churches have made offers, we should try and take them on.
I suppose you could say that means Cameron wants to help more people be like Helen Pidd (a very good ambition for any government.)
You have to be incredibly careful with highly sensitive information, information that if revealed could result in somebody’s death. The source that gave you that information would be, could be, at risk. 
You are asking me should the government have no hold back on the intelligence it gives to the ISC? Instinctively I would be very worried about that because there might be a piece of intelligence so sensitive that its release in anyway could endanger the source of that intelligence. In that case, the government should keep that intelligence as tightly held as possible.
The failure to engage in nation building has created a breeding ground for Isil ([Isis].
Cameron said the Libyans did not want the West to “go in heavy handed with boots on the ground” to help them construct a government. He told Tyrie:
We were involved in nation building. We were there to help the Libyan people. We tried to do it in a way that was more remote than what had happened in Iraq. On this occasion, clearly it didn’t work.
They are not all the sort of people you would bump into at a Liberal Democrat party conference.
I totally disagree with anyone who says that on the one hand Britain has helped to pioneer this climate change agreement and on the other hand is somehow backsliding on its green commitments. It’s total and utter nonsense ...
Whether you look at solar or offshore wind - where we have the biggest offshore wind market anywhere in the world - whether you look at the Green Investment Bank, which is the first in the world, whether you look at the fact that we are reinvesting in our nuclear programme, whether you look at the fact that we are the first developed country to say that we are going to phase out coal-fired power stations, on any reasonable assessment, you would say that Britain is more than fulfilling its green commitments.
That’s all from me for today.
Thanks for the comments.
Andrew Tyrie goes next.
Q: A civil servant called Iain Mansfied wrote a prize-winning report on what Brexit might look like. But he is not allowed to give evidence to select committees about this. Will you let him do so, in a personal capacity?
Cameron says he did not know this case would come up. But civil servants are expected to support the government’s position, he says, implying the answer will be no.
And that’s it. The hearing is over. 
I will post a summary soon.
Crispin Blunt takes Cameron back to foreign affairs.
Q: Islamic State (Isis) need to be taken out of the part of Syria where they are in control. One soldier said, if the regional armies did not do this, we should. Isis could be rolled up in weeks, he said. Has planning for this started?
Cameron says he does not agree with that approach.
It would be counterproductive to deploy Western troops in this way, he says. 
He says the action taken in Syria has taken out 25% of their oil revenues, 10% of their revenues overall.
Cameron says he had a constituency case where farmers dredged a stream. They were being taken to court by the Environment Agency. The agency thought they were destroying the habitat for water voles. As they inspected the river, two water voles appeared - making the point that the water voles had not lost their homes.
Neil Parish, the Conservative chair of the environment committee, goes next.
Q: What is your long-term plan on flooding?
Cameron says one part is building capital schemes. Another part is getting partnership funding, so the private sector contributes to the cost of flood defences. 
He also wants all government departments to address flooding issues.
For example, after the Somerset floods, the government asked the Dutch for advice.
People says don’t build on a flood plain. But London is a flood plain, and we need to build there, he says. 
Q: Will farmers be encouraged to take on water and manage it? Farmers need a carrot to do this.
Cameron says that makes a lot of sense.
Q: Why did you scrap the carbon capture and storage investment despite promising to put £1bn into it?
Cameron says the last two governments have poured money into these new technologies.
But at the moment the CCS technology is not working. You could spend £1bn, but the technology would not be competitive in the market. 
The government hoped the costs would come down. But they did not.
The CCS would still cost £170 per megawatt hour. That compares with nuclear energy costing £90, or onshore wind costing £70.
Q: But you are cutting subsidies for onshore wind too.
Cameron says the cost of energy from onshore wind is coming down.
Angus MacNeil, the SNP chair of the energy committee, goes next.
Q: There are claims that RAF airstrikes have resulted in the death of about 80 civilians in Iraq. Are these claims being investiagated?
Cameron says, at the time of the Syria debate, the government’s information was that there had not been any civilian deaths as a result of RAF attacks in Iraq.
Q: Independent monitoring groups think there have been between 72 and 81 deaths.
Cameron says if that is what is being claimed, the government can investigate.
Cameron says the governnment needs to do more. We have seen three “one in 100 year” events since 2007.
We need to get better at everything, he says.
But this time the military got involved more quickly, and money was dispersed more rapidly.
In the past the Environment Agency used to balance protecting homes against protecting the environment. That has changed. Now they have been told to prioritise protecting homes.
Q: You have faced criticism for not pursuing a green agenda in the UK, even though you pushed it in the Paris talks.
Cameron says he totally disagrees.
Let’s take solar, he says.
Q: What about international investment in renewables. On the Ernst &amp; Young analysis, we have tumbled down the ratings.
Cameron says he does not accept that.
98% of solar panels installed in the UK have been installed since he became prime minister.
We are the first developed country to say we will phase out coal-fired power stations.
He says greenhouse gases fell by 8% last year.
Q: There was good British and EU leadership on this. Has this made you rethink your views on an in/out EU referendum?
Cameron says this shows what can be achieved when Britain works with its European partners.
They are now switching to climate change, and Huw Irranca-Davies, the Labour chair of the environmental audit committee, goes next.
Q: What was your verdict on the Paris talks?
Cameron says he thought the outcome was pretty good. At one point it had looked as if 2 degrees would be lost as a target, that there would be no review mechanism, and that the call for progressively increasing ambitions would be taken out.
He says he always knew there would be some deal. But it turned out to be better than it might have been. He praises the role played by Amber Rudd, the energy secretary.
Clive Betts, the Labour chair of the communities committee, goes next.
Q: How are the extra costs on services generated by taking in Syrian refugees going to be paid for?
Cameron says we have a well-funded health service and well-funded education system. It was considerations like this that made him decide taking in 20,000 Syrians would be right.
He says he wanted local authorities to come forward and offer to take refugees, and they did.
Q: In the case of Siddhartha Dhar, he was asked to give up his passport. But it was 36 days before the police followed that up. Mark Rowley, the Met head of counter-terrorism, told my committee this afternoon that bail powers were toothless. He said that there should be immediate handover of passports, and that breach of bail should be a criminal offence.
Cameron says he is happy to look at this. He knew Rowley was going to make these points.
Cameron says for years it was impossible to get information about passengers travelling in the EU. He says Vaz’s committee has done good work on this.
The hearing has resumed. Keith Vaz is asking questions again.
David Cameron says he thinks EU border controls are getting better. But there is a desire to do more. Within the last month there has been a breakthrough on passenger records, he says.
There is a vote in the Commons now, so the sitting has been suspended for 15 minutes.
Cameron says he will be back. Although, judging by his exchange with Andrew Tyrie (see 4.46pm), it wouldn’t be surprising if he decides he has had enough.
(My transcript write-up probably does not do justice to quite how tetchy and bad-tempered this got. Cameron and Tyrie were repeatedly talking over each other, and at some points Cameron’s usual bonhomie vanished. There were moments when it seemed he was losing his temper.)
Keith Vaz, the Labour chair of the home affairs committee, goes next.
Q: Congratulations for reaching the target of taking 1,000 Syrian refugees by Christmas. Why did the numbers go up so quickly just before Christmas?
Cameron says he would like to say it was having an activist prime minister. The government has kept the pressure up on this, he says.
Q: Will you look again at taking up offers from individuals and churches offering to take refugees?
Cameron says he is happy to look at this. But it was right to focus on what local authorities could do first.
Q: Will all relevant information held by ministers be released to the ISC?
Cameron says he will look at this, but his instinctive answer would be no.
Q: We have a committee (the ISC) there to do this job. They are full of intelligent people.
Cameron says you have to be “incredibly careful” with “highly sensitive information”. People’s lives could be at risk, he says. There may be occasions when it is not safe to release information because a source may be at risk.
Cameron says it is his job to be sceptical of requests like this. He could say yes, but he might find he was not able to keep the country safe."

The prime minister also told the liaison committee, made up of MPs who chair select committees, that the government needs to do “more of everything” to deal with the flooding that has repeatedly hit the UK in recent years.
Cameron, who pledged in 2010 to lead the “greenest government ever”, has faced concerted criticism over a series of reversals to green policies, including cuts to renewable energy subsidies and energy efficiency programmes. In November, the government cancelled its £1bn competition for carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, despite the project being in the Conservative party’s election manifesto.
Cameron said that spending on low-carbon energy was set to double to £11bn in this parliament and that there had been an “absolute revolution in renewable energy” during his premiership, with 98% of solar energy installed since 2010. Subsidies for solar power will be slashed this week, but Cameron said: “You do have to think as prime minister that every penny you put in is a penny on energy bills.”
The SNP’s Angus MacNeil, chair of the energy and climate committee, challenged this, saying onshore wind was the cheapest clean energy, but was being drastically restricted by the government. 
Cameron told the liaison committee in December 2014 that CCS, which traps CO2 from coal and gas power plants and buries it, was “absolutely crucial if we are going to decarbonise effectively”. But he defended the scrapping of the £1bn policy, which was designed to help develop commercial-scale CCS, saying, “The economics are not working at the moment.” This was contradicted by US energy secretary Ernest Moniz, on 7 January, who tweeted: “Carbon capture is critical for solving climate change. And it’s working.”
The prime minister highlighted the UK’s pioneering Climate Change Act and the carbon budgets it sets for the nation, and said: “We are more than meeting the targets.” However, a leaked letter in November revealed that the UK was not on track to meet an EU target for green energy in 2020. Furthermore, experts have argued, the government’s renewed dash for gas, including fracking, without CCS will make meeting future carbon targets extremely difficult.
Tidal power has been promoted by chancellor George Osborne, who signalled support for a project in Swansea Bay. But Cameron poured cold water on the technology, saying that the current proposals were too expensive: “We have not seen any proposals coming forward that would would beat the [subsidy] strike price.”
Friends of the Earth chief executive Craig Bennett said: “If dismantling a dozen green policies and putting 19,000 solar workers on notice isn’t ‘backsliding on green commitments’, I don’t know what is.”
Cameron was challenged on flooding by Huw Irranca-Davies, chair of the environment audit committee, who quoted one expert stating that the UK’s “current approach to flooding was not only inadequate, but has no likelihood of ever being adequate”. Cameron cut flood defence spending in 2010, only raising it after floods hit later, and has been repeatedly warned of the UK’s rising risk of floods.
“On flooding, there is no doubt we need to do more,” Cameron said. “We’ve seen what are called one-in-100-year events, or one-in-200-year events, and they happened in 2007, 2013, 2015, and the country wants us to do more, and we will do more.”
The controversial issue of river dredging was raised by Neil Parish, chair of the environment, food and rural affairs committee, who praised Cameron for restarting dredging on the Somerset Levels. 
The government is going to allow farmers to dredge ditches without securing permission from the Environment Agency, but experts have warned of the risk of faster-flowing rivers rising more quickly and increasing the risk of flood to towns and villages downstream.
Mark Lloyd, chief executive of the Angling Trust, said recently: “It is scandalous that the government has hidden from public view the advice of its own experts on the dangers of unregulated dredging and ignored the findings of the study into the pilot dredging projects. The evidence shows that the best way to reduce the risk of flooding is to manage land upstream to reduce the flow of water and soil off fields.”
Cameron said a suggestion from Parish that farmers were given more incentive to store water on their land during periods of high rainfall made “very good sense”.
The prime minister recounted an anecdote from the village of Kelmscott in his constituency when he visited a site where farmers were being sued by the EA for dredging without permission. Cameron said the EA was worried that some of the habitat of the water vole might have been destroyed. “At that moment, two water voles appeared on the river bank, almost in conversation, and in my mind, at that moment, the argument was settled,” he said."

In his final State of the Union address, the US president said he would push for changes to the leasing of public lands for oil, coal and gas leases at cut-rate prices, saying: “Rather than subsidize the past, we should invest in the future.”
The move follows a listening tour last year by Sally Jewell, the interior secretary, during which she explored leasing programmes on public lands and the collapse of the coal mining industry due to low prices.
Environmental groups had planned major campaigns around the government’s leasing programme for 2016, arguing that continued fossil fuel extraction on public lands was undermining Obama’s efforts to fight climate change.
After insisting in his first term on an “all of the above” energy policy that promoted expansion of oil, gas and coal, Obama now appears to agree with scientists who say catastrophic climate change cannot be avoided without strict limits on fossil fuel extraction.
“I’m going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet,” he said in the speech.
The overhaul comes amid collapsing global prices for coal – which have had a big impact on the government’s lease programme. The government had to put off lease sales involving some 2bn tonnes of coal over the last year because companies were unwilling to buy.
The White House said in an email it would provide further details in the coming weeks, adding: “The President underscored the need to accelerate our transition to low-carbon economy by changing how we manage our oil and coal resources.”
Campaign groups have long accused Obama of having a blind spot when it came to the mining of fossil fuels on public lands.
A report by the Center for American Progress found that oil, coal and gas produced on public lands were responsible for more than 20% of all greenhouse gas emissions.
Half of those emissions were from coal – which increasingly is mined in the vast deposits of the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming.
Up until last year, Jewell, the interior secretary, had acknowledged that there was no concrete strategy to address the climate impact of mining for fossil fuel on public lands, saying: “It’s something we need to think about.”
Campaign groups said the move was an encouraging first step – but argued that Obama should really ban all fossil fuel production on public lands to have maximum impact on climate change.
“The issue of fossil fuel extraction on public lands is going to be a key fight over the coming months. Our government needs to get out of the business of climate destruction,” May Boeve, the director of 350.org said.
As expected, Obama did not come with a list of promises for his last year in office – and did not even mention important initiatives that are already in the works, such as new rules for plugging methane leaks from oil and gas wells.
The White House has been sitting on the rules for six months.
But it was significant that, as during other high-visibility moments during the second half of his presidency, Obama took care to thread mention of climate change throughout the State of the Union address.
Once again, he mocked Republicans who continue to reject the science behind climate change, saying: “You’ll be pretty lonely, because you’ll be debating our military, most of America’s business leaders, the majority of the American people, almost the entire scientific community, and 200 nations around the world who agree it’s a problem and intend to solve it.”
Obama also embraced climate change as an issue of national security and global concern – saying it was “one of many issues where our security is linked to the rest of the world”."

Led by the Woodland Trust, 48 conservation and cultural groups have launched a campaign for a new charter in 2017, the 800-year anniversary of the signing of the original Charter of the Forest by Henry III. This protected and restored the right of people to access and use the royal forests - crucial at the time for grazing livestock, collecting firewood and foraging for food.
The coalition says it is time for a new charter, as woods come under “unprecedented threat” from development, pests and disease and climate change and trees risk being “neglected, undervalued and forgotten”. 
Community groups, clubs, councils and committees are being encouraged to feed into the building of the charter. To kickstart the campaign, people across the UK are being urged to share their “tree stories” of treasured or significant moments that would not have been possible without trees.
A new, broader charter would recognise the importance of trees in 21st-century British society, celebrate their enormous contribution to public life, and ensure future generations could benefit from them by ensuring access to nature and protection of ancient woodland and other habitats, its backers argue.
It would also cover forestry, the value of trees and woods in terms of finance and other benefits to people, the importance of new planting and making sure landscapes are resilient to the threats they face, they say. 
Beccy Speight, chief executive of the Woodland Trust, said: “Our collective ambition is for a charter that puts trees back at the heart of our lives, communities and decision-making - where they belong. The charter will provide guidance and inspiration to allow us all to appreciate, preserve and celebrate our trees and woods for what they do for us in so many different ways. 
“Inspired by something that happened 800 years ago, there is no better time than now to shine the spotlight again on the benefits that trees and woods bring to us all today and to future generations.”
Research for the Woodland Trust by Europe Economics in March last year found the total value of woodland to the UK’s economy is around £270bn. Living near of having access to trees also provides invaluable health and wellbeing benefits, research shows. 
But the trust warns that valuable habitats are under threat, the area of new woodland created each year continues to fall and far too few trees are being planted to connect up the landscape. The impact of tree disease such as ash dieback and oak processionary moth will impact this further. 
Reductions in the number of people enrolling in forestry, land management and environmental courses compounds the problem as it means there are not enough skilled and informed people in the sector, the trust warns."

A charge of $30 a tonne on carbon dioxide embedded in international transport fuels could have raised $25 billion in 2014, the influential Washington DC-based body estimates.
In a report released after 195 countries struck a UN climate pact in Paris, it said carbon pricing should be “front and centre” in efforts to curb global warming.
Levies on so-called bunker fuels were “promising”, it said, and a possible source of climate finance – support for developing countries to go green and adapt to shifting weather patterns.
Emissions from planes and ships, around 4% of the global total and rising, were not directly addressed in the Paris agreement.
It is up to the UN-backed authorities, the International Civil Aviation Organization and International Maritime Organization respectively, to regulate the international sectors.
The IMF noted there were “challenges” to imposing a levy, including the need for international coordination and legal issues, “but the practicalities should be manageable”."

But now, protestors can explain themselves | Tim DeChristopher";"In a historic ruling, several environmental campaigners will be able to argue at criminal trial that their political motives are a defense to their illegal acts";"In the face of governmental failure in addressing climate change, the climate movement has seen a dramatic increase of civil disobedience. The threat of jail is real to activists who use these tactics – as I learned first hand. But now activists now have a powerful form of defense: necessity. 
For the very first time, US climate activists have been able to argue the necessity defense – which argues that so-called criminal acts were committed out of necessity – to a jury. The Delta 5, who blockaded an oil train at the Delta rail yard near Seattle in September of 2014, have been been allowed to use the defense in a historic climate change civil disobedience trial being heard this week. They said they acted to prevent the greater harm of climate change and oil train explosions.
Like all civil disobedience, this new wave of climate disobedience is an inherent critique of the moral authority of government. The necessity defense is an opportunity to elaborate that implicit critique into a fully developed legal argument for the responsibility of citizen action in the face of governmental failure. 
 In addition to gaining the permission to openly argue the necessity defense, the Delta 5 defendants have so far been winning the crucial legal maneuvers in the courtroom. The trial started with several motions from the prosecution to limit how the defense could present “sympathetic” evidence or anything related to their backgrounds. These motions were denied. 
The judge has shown himself to be committed to a fully open trial of all the factors that would drive people to risk their bodies to stop fossil fuel expansion. This kind of openness is distressingly rare for civil disobedience cases in American courts. Why this particular judge, Anthony Howard, is breaking ranks in this climate trial is unknown, but I suspect it may have something to do with the fact that he is young enough that he will still be alive in 2050.
 This willingness to weigh deep questions of justice in the courtroom is already paying off with a thought-provoking trial. The jury selection developed into an insightful conversation about civic engagement, protest and how to express one’s disagreement with the government. 
This work of arousing consciences is an essential feature of good civil disobedience. Just by participating in the selection process, 60 potential jurors were pushed into a thoughtful discussion about the role of protest and challenging unjust power. 
 One of the critical dynamics that emerged in the jurors’ discussion on the first day was the difference between protest that uses force to intimidate compared to protest that uses one’s own vulnerability to awaken a community. The Delta 5 clearly fall into the latter category, but the prosecution used references to the Ku Klux Klan and abortion clinic bombers to suggest that the activists were relying on intimidation. This crucial dynamic will probably continue to be developed as the trial progresses. 
 But even as the state tries to paint the defendants as nefarious, the activists are establishing their moral advantage. The prosecution can tell by the media attention and standing-room-only crowd that these activists have power, but like most government officials, this prosecutor seems to only understand coercive power. 
As he tries to put them in a box into which they don’t fit, the principled position of the activists demonstrates the potential of power rooted in love rather than force. The activists bring a vision of justice that shames the mere legalism of the state.
 Around the globe climate movements are trying to build power. Some of those are trying to build power based on an old model from a dying empire. Here, in the trial of the Delta 5, the climate movement is building a new kind of power, grounded in interdependency and wielded through vulnerability. Our rapidly evolving and unstable world demands no less. "

Showing that human activity, via climate change, can alter global processes like ice ages is compelling evidence that the planet has entered a new geological epoch, dubbed the Anthropocene, according to the scientists.
Other recent research listed evidence from plastic pollution to the mass extinction of wildlife to show that the Earth has entered the Anthropocene.
The new research also shows that a major ice age was narrowly missed just before the industrial revolution, probably because the development of agriculture had nudged the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere just above the tipping point.
“The bottom line is we are basically skipping a whole glacial cycle, which is unprecedented,” said Andrey Ganopolski, at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) in Germany and who led the research. “It is mind-boggling that humankind is able to interfere with a mechanism that shaped the world as we know it.” 
The cycle of ice ages created today’s landscapes and much of the world’s fertile soils.
The new research, published in the journal Nature, examined the eight global ice ages over the past 800,000 years and used complex climate models to determine the critical factors that kickstarted the big freezes. 
The result was surprisingly simple. A particular combination of lower sunlight at a latitude of 65 deg N, where snow surviving through the summer leads to ice sheets, and low carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was the signal for a new ice age to dawn. The level of sunlight is very predictable as it varies with cyclical changes in the shape of the Earth’s orbit around the Sun and in the tilt of the Earth’s axis, called Milankovitch cycles.
But the level of CO2 has been drastically altered by human activity, rising from 280ppm at the start of the industrial revolution to 400ppm today. The researchers showed that even if carbon emissions are limited to the amount consistent with a 2C rise in temperatures - the internationally agreed goal - there will be enough CO2 in the atmosphere to avoid future ice ages that could have started 50,000 or 90,000 years from now. 
“This is in principle good news, as ice ages are a great challenge,” said Prof John Schellnhuber, PIK director and part of the research team. Sea levels rise and fall by more than 100 metres during global ice ages, and runaway global warming could add another 70m to that. 
“Like no other force on the planet, ice ages have shaped the global environment and thereby determined the development of human civilisation,” Schellnhuber said. “Now human interference is acting as a huge geological force, so this is a defining paper for the Anthropocene idea.” If carbon emissions are not restricted, he said, they could end the million-year-long period of ice age cycles altogether.
Michel Crucifix, at the Université catholique de Louvain in Belgium and not involved in the new research, said: “It reinforces previous assessments asserting that humanity’s collective footprint on Earth already extends beyond any imaginable future of our society.”
“Such long-term consequences may seem surprising, given that the emissions will occur over a few centuries at most,” he said. “In fact, the mean half-life of CO2 in the atmosphere is of the order of 35,000 years. Consequently, anthropogenic CO2 will still be in the atmosphere in 50,000 years’ time, and even 100,000 years, which is enough to prevent any glaciation.”
“The significance of the study is the definition of a tipping point for glaciation,” said Prof Tim Lenton, at the University of Exeter, UK, who was also not involved in the new study. “This elaborates the classical Milankovitch theory by adding the CO2 component.”
“It is convincing in showing the start of the next ice age will be delayed,” said Lenton. “But I was already expecting this result based on previous studies. What is interesting is how little anthropogenic CO2 is needed to prevent the next [ice age] – 500 gigatonnes of carbon – and we have already emitted that.”
Prof Eric Wolff, at the University of Cambridge, said the research goes much further than earlier work in quantifying the tipping point. “It conforms to what many of us would expect, but it’s always a big step forward when someone shows that one’s intuition is actually backed by solid calculations,” he said. 
“Humans now effectively control the climate of the planet,” said Prof Andrew Watson, at the University of Exeter. “If only we were wise enough to be able to use that power responsibly. Unfortunately, I don’t think we’ve reached that level of wisdom yet.”"

Time for a chief scientific adviser";"Boris Johnson appears to favour the views of friends and associates on issues such as pollution and climate change. The next mayor needs specialist advice";"One of the priorities for the next mayor of London should be to appoint a chief scientific adviser. The current mayor has a range of advisers, but has clearly lacked expert guidance on the scientific aspects of key issues such as local air pollution and climate change. The time has come to seek specialist advice to help deal with the wide variety of risks and opportunities facing those living and working in the capital.
Boris Johnson has, for instance, struggled to come to terms with the findings of researchers at King’s College London, who have estimated that more than 9,000 people die in London each year from dust and nitrogen dioxide in the air. 
 In 2014, Mr Johnson used Twitter to denounce as “B*ll*cks: ludicrous urban myth” a conference presentation by a scientist at King’s College who suggested that average annual levels of nitrogen dioxide measured in Oxford Street may be the highest in the world.
The mayor was later forced to defend his comments in a letter to a Parliamentary committee, admitting that he was “not disputing King’s College data”, but did not accept the scientists’ warnings. It is true that Johnson does have an environment adviser, Matthew Pencharz, but he is a former journalist, not a technical expert.
Throughout his terms as mayor, Mr Johnson has also demonstrated that he is in thrall to friends and associates who reject the evidence that emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from human activities are driving climate change.
As part of the celebrations for the Olympics in 2012, Mr Johnson invited Matt Ridley, the former chairman of Northern Rock bank, rather than an expert, to deliver a lecture on the environment. Ridley dismissed the risks to lives and livelihoods from climate change that have been highlighted by scientists.
And in one of his columns for the Daily Telegraph last month, Johnson claimed that the mild weather in December had nothing to do with global warming, based, it seems, on a phone conversation with a friend, Piers Corbyn, a climate change sceptic who runs a tiny weather forecasting company. Johnson has written about global warming in his Telegraph column four times over the past few years, and on each occasion has referred solely to Piers Corbyn’s views as his source of authority.
In fact, Met Office data show unarguably that London, along with the rest of the UK and world, is warming. Seven of the ten warmest years in south-east England since records began in 1910 have occurred since 2000, and only one winter, in 1985, from the last 30 years ranks among the ten coldest on record. And the capital is facing higher risks of extreme weather events, including heatwaves and heavy downpours.
Although the mayor does not have complete control over all of the laws and policies for managing the risks to Londoners posed by local air pollution and climate change, it is troubling that he apparently ignores inputs about these issues from scientists, including world-class researchers based in the capital.
And while Mr Johnson energetically promotes the abundance of talent in London and its importance as an economic and cultural centre, he rarely mentions the city’s outstanding array of scientific minds and its unique place in the history of science.
The mayor is not alone in neglecting our capital city’s hugely important scientific heritage. It is difficult, for instance, to find statues or other commemorations of the achievements of Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin or any of the other scientific giants who have connections with the city.
Nevertheless, London now hosts some of the world’s most scientifically accomplished universities, including Imperial College and University College, as well as internationally renowned research centres, such as the new Francis Crick Institute.
It seems logical to propose that whoever is elected in May should appoint a chief scientific adviser to devise a strategy for London to retain its leadership as a global centre for science, at a time when many other cities around the world are already aiming to overtake it.
Most importantly, the holder of such a role should help ensure that decisions across a range of key economic, social and cultural issues affecting London are informed by the best knowledge and understanding, including from the city’s own wealth of bright minds.
Of course, an adviser could not guarantee that the new mayor would always take full account of the evidence, but it would undoubtedly be more difficult to ignore.
It’s why the national government and each of its departments have chief scientific advisers. It is surely an anomaly that the mayor of London, who is responsible for a wide range of issues affecting lives and livelihoods in the capital and who oversees an annual budget exceeding that of every national department apart from health, education and defence, does not directly receive expert, independent advice on scientific issues.
Whoever emerges victorious in May must show that the role of London’s mayor is important enough to require expert scientific advice.
Bob Ward is policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science, and sits on the London Climate Change Partnership."

Local MSPs praised the “huge community spirit” as residents of a sheltered housing complex in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire, were evacuated to the village scout hut on Monday afternoon, while the local Asda supermarket supplied food to the makeshift emergency centre.
With a relentless downpour throughout the day adding to already swollen rivers, many threatened to burst their banks again, with the Met Office amber “be prepared” warnings for heavy rain in the Grampian, Central, Tayside and Fife areas extended to midnight on Monday.
Earlier in the day, police named the kayaker who died after getting into difficulties on the river Findhorn, near Inverness, last Wednesday, when Storm Frank first hit, as 54-year-old Laurence Henderson from Aberdeenshire.
The dead man is believed to have been with a group of experienced kayakers who raised the alarm after he fell into the river and his clothing became snagged on branches. A coastguard search had to be called off as weather conditions worsened and Henderson’s body was recovered from the river at 9am the following day.
Rail bosses confirmed on Monday that the west coast mainline between Carlisle and Glasgow would be closed until at least February while repairs to the Lamington viaduct, near Lockerbie, were carried out. Alternative routes will involve a replacement bus or diverted train via Dumfries.
The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) had 35 flood warnings still in place on Monday evening, covering Tayside, Angus, Dundee, Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire. It has also issued four flood alerts, including one for the Scottish Borders.
Police warned that riverside homes in Aberdeen would be at risk on Monday night, when the Dee reaches high tide at about 9pm. West of the city, in the village of Ballater, which suffered some of the worst devastation last week, council workers and volunteers have built a huge sandbag barrier. Braemar, still further west into the Cairngorms, is partially cut off while the council liaises with the army to repair the badly damaged Invercauld Bridge.
Abergeldie castle, near Ballater and close to the Queen’s residence at Balmoral, has been left on the brink of collapse after intense flooding. The owner was forced to evacuate the 16th-century Grade A-listed tower house in Aberdeenshire on Sunday after the river Dee swept away about 60ft (18 metres) of land behind the property, leaving it only a few feet from the water.
As police urged drivers to follow warnings, a 47-year-old woman was charged with careless driving after emergency services were called to free her from her half-submerged vehicle when she allegedly attempted to drive through 4ft deep flood water in Stobo, near Peebles.
While the rain across Scotland is expected to ease through Tuesday, the Met Office forecast another weather front bringing rain from Thursday.
Meanwhile, David Cameron, ministers and the Environment Agency face questioning by MPs and communities in the coming days over their response to flooding across northern England during one of the wettest Decembers on record.
Campaigners said the political fallout of the floods would play out this week and next, as the Met Office warned of possible further flooding with more rainfall likely in many areas in the next 48 hours.
Next Tuesday, the prime minister is due to be questioned on Syria and climate change by the liaison committee, with flooding likely to be on the agenda along with the recent Paris climate agreement. Officials rank flooding as the UK’s number one threat from climate change and Cameron has been accused of ignoring flood warnings from his climate advisers.
The Environment Agency’s chief executive, James Bevan, and its chairman, Philip Dilley, will be questioned by the same committee this Wednesday. Dilley is likely to be asked about criticism that he was holidaying in Barbados while some of the worst flooding was occurring and the agency’s initial refusal to comment on his whereabouts.
A spokeswoman for Kerry McCarthy, the shadow environment secretary, said the government’s response so far had not been commensurate with the scale of the threat from climate change and flooding. She said: “It appears to be very piecemeal and reactive, rather than looking at the problem as a whole.”
Oliver Letwin is chairing a new flood resilience review, which is due to report in the summer, although the MP came under fire over the weekend for sitting on a previous report following the extraordinary floods of early 2014.
“This week will be a crucial test of whether Westminster really understands the flooding that’s devastated the country,” said Guy Shrubsole, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth.
“The prime minister has serious questions to answer about previous warnings that climate change will push up flood risk. He must realise that cuts to flood defence spending are a false economy.”
The Environment Agency has 30 flood warnings in place and 168 flood alerts across large swaths of England and Wales. The Met Office issued yellow “be aware” warnings on Monday for south-west and south-east England and warned people to be alert to the risk of surface flooding in those areas.
A spokesman said that on the western sides of Dartmoor and Exmoor, and possibly Bodmin moor, rainfall could be up to 40mm compared with an average of about 20mm across the south-west. He said the main problem in the south-west was that the ground was already saturated after prolonged rainfall, making the risk of surface flooding more likely.
On Thursday, campaigners at the National Flood Forum will meet with Rory Stewart, under secretary of state for environment and rural affairs, to discuss insurance along with other issues facing flood-hit communities."

 While the climate phenomenon known as El Niño reduced the development of hurricanes in the north Atlantic, storms and floods still caused billions of dollars worth of damage in Europe and North America, the world’s largest reinsurer said in an annual review.
 Munich Re said floods in the UK and Scandinavia caused by Storm Desmond last month may cause about €700m (£515m) in claims. It added that flooding from Storm Eva may cause overall damage of more than €1bn. Climate change may have played a role in the floods, according to the insurer.
 Two tornadoes and flooding also hit the US last month but Munich Re said damage estimates were not yet available.
 The insurance industry lobbied governments to take action to curb climate change in the run-up to the UN climate summit in Paris last year. It cited rising payouts in heavily insured rich country markets and a lack of affordable insurance in developing countries, where it is most needed.
 “The proportion of insured losses for catastrophes in developing and emerging countries remains very low,” said Torsten Jeworrek, a Munich Re board member.
 “The insurance industry is exploring new avenues to close this gap in cover and thus to help people better cope with material losses after a catastrophe,” Jeworrek added.
 
 Insurers and reinsurers may get a push from an  international effort unveiled by the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, to develop company disclosures so that investors can assess companies’ physical, liability and other risks from climate change.
 
The $27bn in insured damage last year was lower than the $31bn registered in 2014 and also below the 10-year average of $56bn, Munich Re said.
 Overall damage, including that not covered by insurance, was $90bn last year, the lowest level since 2009.
 In total, 23,000 people were killed in 2015, including many in the Nepal earthquake in April, compared with 7,700 the previous year, but was well below the 10-year average of 68,000.
 Lower claims payouts boost insurance industry profit but the downside for reinsurers is that their insurance company clients often then demand lower prices for reinsurers’ backing.
 
 Munich Re is due to report its own results on 4 February. "

Last month saw widespread flooding which continued into the new year, with 21 flood alerts in England and Wales and four in Scotland in force on Tuesday morning. 
The record for the warmest December in the UK was also smashed last month, with an average temperature of 7.9C, 4.1C higher than the long-term average.

Climate change has fundamentally changed the UK weather, said Prof Myles Allen, at the University of Oxford: “Normal weather, unchanged over generations, is a thing of the past. You are not meant to beat records by those margins and if you do so, just like in athletics, it is a sign something has changed.”
The Met Office records stretch back to 1910 and, while December saw a record downpour particularly affecting the north of England, Scotland and Wales, 2015 overall was only the sixth wettest year on record.
The high temperatures in December would normally be expected in April or May and there was an almost complete lack of air frost across much of England. The average from 1981-2010 was for 11 days of air frost in December, but last month there were just three days. Across 2015, the average UK temperature was lower than in 2014, though globally 2015 was the hottest year on record.
Allen said it has been predicted as far back as 1990 that global warming would mean warmer, wetter winters for the UK, with more intense rainstorms. The flooding caused by Storm Desmond, centred on Cumbria, is estimated to have been made 40% more likely by climate change.
“If an athlete starts popping pills, it does not guarantee they win every race, but it does change their chances,” he told the BBC. “The physics [of climate change] is relatively simple: as we warm the atmosphere, the weather systems that move in from the Atlantic contain more moisture, so they dump more rain.”
“We have known for a very long time that these signs were likely to be one of the earliest symptoms of climate change and now we are seeing them, it’s not very surprising,” Allen said.
“Temperature and rainfall records will inevitably tumble as climate change intensifies,” said Prof David Reay, at the University of Edinburgh. “It is the increasingly extreme rainfall events, storm surges, heatwaves and droughts that will truly test our resilience to climate change. On the evidence of the past month we are far from prepared.”
The government’s own scientists warned that increased flooding was the greatest risk for the UK from climate change, but annual flood defence budgets were cut in 2011-12 and only recovered to previous levels with emergency funding in 2014-15.
Clare Dinnis, flood risk manager at the Environment Agency, said: “Our work continues into the new year as we offer ongoing support to communities that have been affected by these terrible floods. With more wet weather due this week we are monitoring the situation across the country closely.”
On Tuesday morning there were 21 flood alerts - meaning flooding is expected - across England and Wales, including eight in north-east England. There were also 138 flood warnings, meaning flooding is possible. In Scotland, there were four flood alerts and 32 flood warnings."

The broken well at the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage site has released more than 77,000 metric tons of the powerful climate pollutant methane since the rupture was first detected on 23 October, according to a counter created by the Environmental Defense Fund. 
Methane is a fast-acting climate pollutant – more than 80 times more powerful than carbon dioxide over a 20-year time frame.
Experts believe the breach, which has forced the evacuation of hundreds of residents from the town of Porter Ranch, is the largest ever in the US.
Locals have complained of headaches, sore throats, nosebleeds and nausea, caused by the rotten-egg smell of the odorant added to the gas to aid leak detection by SoCalGas, the utility that operates the natural gas storage site.
About 1,000 people are suing the company. There are also concerns about the leak’s effect on smog and ozone. The company said it was monitoring air quality.
The leak is unlikely to be brought under control before late February – and even that timetable depends on work crews’ success in locating and plugging a 7-inch pipe deep underground.
Campaign groups said the release undercuts Barack Obama’s efforts to slow the rate of global warming to avoid a tipping point and live up to US commitments to a historic climate accord agreed in Paris last month. 
Obama is expected to tout his climate agenda during his State of the Union address on 12 January – one of his last big moments remaining to promote a key presidential priority.
Carbon dioxide is still the biggest driver of climate change. But because methane emissions are on the rise and exercise such a powerful effect in the short-term, they are a growing source of concern as governments try to avoid a climate tipping point.
A byproduct of the oil and gas industry and agriculture, methane accounts for about a quarter of the world’s warming.
The release of methane from the ruptured well has now slowed considerably since its peak in late November, according to Carb.
Back then, the climate impact was equivalent to the daily emissions from 7 million cars – or the equivalent of six coal-fired power plants, or three-quarters of the emissions from the state’s entire oil refining industry, according to EDF.
 But David Clegern, a spokesman for the agency, said the well remained a major source of climate pollution. “It is in California at this point the single largest source point of global warming,” Clegern said.
He also said it was to his knowledge the biggest such natural gas leak ever. “We haven’t been able to see anything anywhere near this size.”
The Aliso Canyon well failure was widely seen as the climate equivalent of the BP disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. The April 2010 blow-out of BP’s well killed 11 and caused vast damage to fisheries and the environment in the three months it took to get under control.
The Aliso Canyon leak is much less visible than BP’s oil disaster, but Mark Brownstein, who heads the climate and energy program at EDF, said it is a serious threat.
“For the planet it is a big deal because methane is a such a powerful greenhouse gas, and the huge amount of gas that is escaping,” he said. 
The rupture at the Aliso Canyon facility has refocused attention on America’s ageing and accident-prone oil and gas infrastructure. Many such leaks go undetected.
The Environmental Protection Agency is due to issue much-anticipated rules to control methane emissions from the oil and gas industry later this year. Gina McCarthy, who heads the EPA, said on Monday that the rules could avoid up to 400,000 metric tons of methane by 2025.
The Aliso Canyon storage site is one of the biggest such facilities in the country, and was originally built for the oil industry about 60 years ago. When the oil fields were exhausted, the well was repurposed as a storage site. 
R Rex Parris, who is suing the gas company on behalf of Porter Ranch residents, said the site should have been shut down long ago.
He faulted the company for removing a blow-out preventer at the bottom of the well in 1979. “They deliberately took the brakes off the car and continued to drive it. That’s the best metaphor I can come up with, he said. “They are saying it’s an accident that they ran into somebody. I’m saying: ‘no, it was inevitable’.”
A company spokeswoman said the well was in compliance with state regulations."

The shadow transport minister, Richard Burden, pledged to table parliamentary questions about the affair, saying that government backing for the project had been derisory. 
The Green Sky project was due to open in 2017 at an ex-oil refinery in Thurrock, Essex, where it would have turned into gas 575,000 tonnes of household waste otherwise destined for landfill sites or incinerators.
Enough green fuel would have been produced to power all BA’s yearly flights from London City airport twice over, with carbon savings equivalent to taking 150,000 cars off the road.
But BA told the Guardian that the project had now been mothballed because of low crude oil prices, jitters among investors, and a lack of policy engagement from 10 Downing Street.
 “The government needs to support innovative aviation biofuels projects such as this if they are to progress,” said Cathy West, a BA spokeswoman. “Aviation fuels are not eligible for incentives that road transport fuels receive, making it difficult to build a business case to invest in UK aviation fuels projects. This affects investor confidence.”
“British Airways’ decision to scrap their green fuels project is immensely disappointing,” Burden said. “The government has questions to answer on why it is not looking to support the industry’s innovative attempts to recycle waste to use as fuel.
 “At a time when the government has delayed a decision on Heathrow and Gatwick partly for environmental reasons, it is ludicrous that the government is not backing the industry’s attempts to deliver cleaner fuels.”
 BA wants jet biofuels brought under the government’s Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation, a move it believes could help trigger the building of a dozen green fuel plants by 2030.
 Without such guarantees, airlines may feel obliged to sign alternative fuel deals at market rates that become less attractive when oil prices suddenly drop.
“The UK is currently losing out to countries that have prioritised and incentivised developments in the sustainable aviation fuels market,” West said.
Some 150 workers were expected to staff the Solena Fuels plant, which BA had committed to pay £35m each year for a decade, in a bid to lower its carbon footprint.
But Solena, a US company, filed for bankruptcy three months ago and BA has now switched its attention to other waste-to-fuels firms where joint projects are thought to be at the due diligence stage.
Chris Malins, the fuels programme manager of the International Council for Clean Transportation, said that commercialising these projects was a challenging process, beset by a lack of EU policy certainty after 2020 and a “valley of death” between R&amp;D tests and market-scale production.
 “Things could have been done on the policy side here to help these plants get built which were not done,” he said. “Investments won’t go to alternative aviation fuels without policy certainty and access to the same incentives as road diesel.
“It is a shame as this project looked like a great opportunity to do something genuinely sustainable on a ground-breaking scale.”
Aviation is the fastest-growing source of carbon dioxide emissions, currently thought to be responsible for around 5% of global warming by scientists at the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
New market mechanisms to green the industry will be debated at an International Civil Aviation Organisation conference later this year. Use of second-generation biofuels to power jets is widely seen as one of the most promising technologies.
A recent study found that BA and Lufthansa were emitting 51% more carbon dioxide than the least polluting airlines. "

The recent effects of both ocean cycles are being amplified by climate change.
A 2014 flip was detected in the sluggish and elusive ocean cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, or PDO, which also goes by other names, including the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation. Despite uncertainty about the fundamental nature of the PDO, leading scientists link its 2014 phase change to a rapid rise in global surface temperatures.
The effects of the PDO on global warming can be likened to a staircase, with warming leveling off for periods, typically of more than a decade, and then bursting upward.
“It seems to me quite likely that we have taken the next step up to a new level,” said Kevin Trenberth, a scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research.
The 2014 flip from the cool PDO phase to the warm phase, which vaguely resembles a long and drawn out El Niño event, contributed to record-breaking surface temperatures across the planet in 2014.
The record warmth set in 2014 was surpassed again in 2015, when global temperatures surged to 1°C (1.8°F) above pre-industrial averages, worsening flooding, heatwaves and storms.
Trenberth is among an informal squadron of scientists that in recent years has toiled to understand the slowdown in surface warming rates that began in the late 1990s, which some nicknamed a global warming “pause” or “hiatus.”
A flurry of recent research papers has indicated that the slowdown was less pronounced than previously thought, leading some scientists to renew claims that those nicknames are inaccurate and should be abandoned.
“The slowdown was not statistically significant, I suppose, if you properly take into account natural variability, which includes the PDO,” Trenberth said. “That’s sort of the argument that people have been making; that even if it was a little bit of a slowdown, or pause, or call it what you will, it’s not out of bounds, and as a result we shouldn’t really put a label on it.”
The approximately 15-year warming slowdown was linked to the negative phase of the PDO, which is also called its cool phase. That phase whips up strong trade winds that bury more heat beneath sea surfaces, contributing to extraordinary levels of warming recorded in the oceans. A similar phase led to a slight cooling of the planet from the 1940s to the 1970s.
“Last time we went from a negative to a positive was in the mid-‘70s,” said Gerald Meehl, a National Center for Atmospheric Research scientist. “Then we had larger rates of global warming from the ‘70s to the late ‘90s, compared to the previous 30 years.”
“It’s not just an upward sloping line,” Meehl said. “Sometimes it’s steeper, sometimes it’s slower.”
The effects of the warm phase of the PDO and the current El Niño may be cumulative in terms of warming the planet. It also seems likely that changes in the ocean cycles are linked, with changes between El Niño and La Niña driving changes in the PDO cycle.
Or, perhaps the PDO doesn’t exist at all, other than as a tidy pile of data points, and it’s simply a manifestation of changes in the shorter-running cycle between El Niño and La Niña.
“There’s some debate about whether there is a low frequency oscillation — is there a distinct interdecadal oscillation?” said Penn State meteorology professor Michael Mann. “Or is what we call a low frequency oscillation just a change over time in the frequency and magnitude of individual El Niño and La Niña events?”
Regardless, “it seems pretty clear that we’ve transitioned from a time period where there was a prevalence for La Niña conditions,” Mann said. “Over the past several years we’ve been in the multi-year El Niño state, and it has culminated with an extremely large El Niño event.”
The future of PDO phases will not slow down or speed up the overall long-term rate of global warming. That will continue to rise with pollution levels. But scientists are expecting more intense heat during the months ahead, which should bring with it more wild weather.
“There are a lot of things in place that have locked us on course to have a really warm start to 2016,” said National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientist Nate Mantua. “I have a hard time seeing how we’re not going to be looking at either record level or near-record level global mean surface temperatures for at least the first half of 2016.”"

Ten weeks after the 23 October breach was detected, Brown ordered state agencies to make sure Southern California Gas Company, which owns the stricken natural gas storage facility, plugs the leak.
“All necessary and viable actions will be taken to ensure Southern California Gas Company: maximizes daily withdrawals of natural gas from the Aliso Canyon Storage Facility for use or storage elsewhere; captures leaking gas and odorants while relief wells are being completed; and identifies how it will stop the gas leak if relief wells fail to seal the leaking well, or if the existing leak worsens,” the order said.
The breach had released “major amounts of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas” and caused widespread disruption to local people in the Porter Ranch area, the statement from Brown noted.
Experts said the break at the natural gas storage reservoir is the largest known occurrence of its kind. 
Methane is dozens of times more warming than carbon dioxide, and the storage facility, which draws on about 100 other wells, is one of the largest in the state. Campaign groups say the broken well has been pumping out the equivalent in carbon dioxide emissions of 7m cars a day.
Thousands of people, including schoolchildren, have been evacuated from Porter Ranch to escape the rotten egg smell of the chemicals added to the gas.
The declaration follows Brown’s visit to Porter Ranch earlier this week, during which he met residents who have suffered nose bleeds, headaches and nausea from the smells. Such chemicals are commonly used to aid in leak detection.
Brown directed his administration to take “all necessary and viable actions” to make sure SoCalGas captures leaking natural gas and odorants. He also asked the company to spell out how it planned to plug the well if its current effort failed.
The order bans SoCalGas from injecting more natural gas into the storage site, and it calls for independent monitoring of air quality. Brown also ordered daily inspections and regular testing of natural gas storage wells in the state for leaks.
Brown has come under intense criticism from campaign groups for his slow response to the leak. On Wednesday, some of those groups now expressed relief. 
“This is a hard-fought win for the residents of Porter Ranch and beyond affected by this noxious blowout,” Alexandra Nagy, an organiser for Food and Water Watch, said in an emailed statement. She called on Brown to shutter the storage facility for good."

The data shows the number of new cars eligible for the government Plug-in Car Grant scheme rose from 14,532 in to 28,188 last year, an increase of 94 per cent.
Zero and low emission vehicles still make up only a fraction of an overall market, with total new vehicle registrations reaching a record 2.6 million.
However, demand for alternative fuelled and low emission vehicles is outperforming the wider market across all categories. The auto market as a whole grew 6.3 per cent, but demand for pure electric vehicles rose 48 per cent to nearly 10,000 vehicles and demand for plug-in hybrids soared 133 per cent year-on-year to over 18,000 vehicles.
Since the Plug-in Car Grant scheme was launched with its promise of up to £5,000 off the cost of electric vehicles, 47,690 eligible cars have been registered.
Conventional hybrids enjoyed a similar strong performance last year with annual demand for petrol hybrids growing 18 per cent to 40,707 registrations and demand for diesel hybrids climbing 36 per cent to over 3,800.
Overall, the market for alternative fuelled vehicles rose 40 per cent to 72,775 units, increasing the sector’s market share from 2.1 per cent in 2014 to 2.8 per cent last year.
In contrast, demand for diesel vehicles rose just three per cent, as the fall-out from the VW scandal no doubt contributed to the technology’s market share slipping to 48.5 per cent."

London mayoral candidate Zac Goldsmith has claimed they will soon make buses in the capital redundant, and the city has launched a £100m project to encourage more people to use electric cars. There is, presumably, a clear case for saying London would be transformed for the better by electric vehicles.
Alas, we struggled to find this case written down anywhere. So we sat down with a blank spreadsheet and tried to work it out from first principles. We began by listing the problems that motor vehicles currently bring to cities. Then, we asked what electricity could do to address each of these.
Perhaps the most obvious reason people get excited about electric vehicles is pollution. Conventional vehicles spew some very noxious stuff into our streets, killing many thousands each year (pdf), including several thousand in London alone. Electric vehicles offer a real advantage in reducing the dangerous nitrogen oxide and particulate matter in urban areas.
But as well as being cleaner, are electric vehicles also greener? That’s a different question – one to which the answer is entirely dependent on how the nation generates its electricity. In 2014, 19.1% of the UK’s electricity (pdf) was generated from renewables compared with 30% for gas and 30% for coal.
This heavy use of fossil fuels means the electric car is not as eco-friendly as it might initially appear. Electric vehicles basically move the fossil-fuel combustion from inside the car to another part of the country (safely outside the purview of any elected mayors). They don’t do much about how we’ll stop our nation emitting greenhouse gases.
The problems of today’s vehicles, however, go far beyond emissions. The hypermobility (pdf) they provide permits suburban sprawl (and thus extra greenhouse gas emissions) as it becomes possible for people to live, work and shop at places distant from one another. And there is another big space problem: a car used for 50 minutes a day is unused 96.5% of the time. Frequently cars are stored on roads and pavements, to the detriment of traffic flow, aesthetics, councils’ finances and the needs of vulnerable road users.
Simply swapping one engine for another does nothing to solve a raft of other problems. The UK has a billion-pound health crisis (pdf) arising from physical inactivity. Shifting shorter journeys – for example, those under two miles – from cars to active travel modes such as walking or cycling is one of the best things (pdf) any developed nation can do to tackle its health problems. Electric vehicles, at best, leave this problem untouched.
Perhaps what electric vehicle champions are really thinking of – especially when they suggest they will replace buses – is self-driving electric cars. Taking the driver out of the picture overcomes some issues, most obviously the problem of collisions – there is a high global and UK death toll from people crashing their vehicles. 
A switch to driverless vehicles gives us an opportunity to rethink our relationship with cars. We could move away from the old idea that everybody should own their own car and have a much smaller number of automated cars, each in frequent use and summoned when people need them.
Self-driving cars might overcome some genuine problems, such as the number of cars on the road and where we store all the unused cars. But this future requires car makers to sell few cars rather than many. This makes it unlikely any real change will happen – especially given the cosy relationship car manufacturers have enjoyed with governments. There is a lack of ambition and vision from the motoring industry which, for all its innovation, avoids addressing underlying issues. 
And even if we did shift to fewer shared vehicles, we are still left with the issues of urban sprawl, and questions about health and wellbeing. Even driverless cars do not address these fundamental problems. We need to stop building towns and cities on the self-fulfilling assumption people will travel by car. There is no future in which humans can sit down all day without paying an enormous health price. If driverless cars appear in streets anything like today’s, we risk falling into the most pathetic of robot uprisings, where they transport us helpfully from place to place while we remain inactive, growing fat and increasing our risk of cancer and diabetes. 
Electric vehicles should not be considered a panacea for sustainable transport but rather a possible part of the puzzle. We need to rethink the journeys we make. Many of our urban journeys are short and we should plan cities with that in mind. Perhaps in the future we will continue to drive to the city, but we won’t drive through the city. Let’s turn cities back into a place for human beings to make their short journeys in a physically active way."

 The Bahrain Royal family, 21st Century Fox America, the company chaired by Rupert Murdoch, and British construction vehicle manufacturers JCB have also been asked to pay up for flights to and from the UK.
The Environment Agency, which is responsible for enforcing the European Union’s emissions trading scheme (ETS) in the UK, has issued over £750,000 in fines to a total of 25 operators for “failure to surrender sufficient allowances to cover annual reportable emissions”.
The ETS requires polluters to surrender a carbon permit for every tonne of carbon pollution emitted, or pay a €100 (£75) per tonne fine. Permits are given to many air operators for free but can be bought if needed for about €8 currently.
Donald Trump faces a £1,610 penalty for a flight to the UK in a plane owned by DJT Operations I LLC, possibly the $100m Boeing 757 he uses as a private jet, complete with master bedroom and gold taps. The 757 is 54m long and usually carries 200-300 passengers. Trump opened his golf course in Aberdeenshire in 2012, the period covered by the fines published on 5 January.
The ETS is intended to limit carbon emissions and reduce climate change. This is unlikely to impress Trump, who has called climate change “bullshit” and a concept “created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive”. Hope Hicks, Trump’s campaign communications manager, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Bahrain royal family have been hit with a heftier fine, £60,698, while 21st Century Fox America was fined £17,463.
The 25 operators fined include a series of private jet operators, insurance giant AIG, Air India and a “MIG Russian Aircraft”, which was not a military plane. JCB Ltd were hit with the biggest fine of £157,596.
“The EU Emissions Trading System is an important means of regulating emissions from aviation operators,” said Liz Parkes, Environment Agency deputy director of climate change and business services. “The Environment Agency’s enforcement activity is part of coordinated action across Europe.” Confidentiality rules mean the EA is unable to disclose whether fines have been paid or not.

Here’s the truth about TTIP”, Business). 
The independent UK Committee on Climate Change supports fracking in the UK, but its chair, Lord Deben, has also stated that his committee would not hesitate to ban fracking if the UK was unable to meet its climate change commitments.
So imagine a scenario in 2030, whereby several US or European-based companies are extracting shale gas and/or shale oil in the UK and Lord Deben’s committee announced that further extraction was incompatible with the Climate Change Act, which requires an 80% reduction in carbon emissions by 2050. I have no doubt that those companies would sue the government under the terms of TTIP, and the result would either be massive compensation or repeal of the Climate Change Act.
It needs to be remembered that the World Trade Organisation has the power to impose punitive fines on governments as well as other public institutions. In contrast, all the climate change agreements reached post-Paris are voluntary and there is no equivalent body to enforce environmental standards. Disputes will be held in secret without any environmental representation, so the planet will lose out every time. 
Dr Robin Russell-JonesStoke PogesBucks 
Contrary to your article, there is little prospect that European trade unions will support the proposed deal.
The GMB’s motion to oppose the TTIP was unanimously approved at the 2014 TUC Congress and the majority of national trade union federations in ETUC, the European-wide body, are also against it.
The reason for our implacable opposition to the TTIP and other similar trade agreements is that they are not really about trade at all, but, rather, a transfer of power and sovereignty from EU member states to unaccountable transnational corporations in whose interests these deals are made.
The figures quoted by your correspondent and used by the European Commission to justify the introduction of the TTIP have long since been discredited as little more than wishful thinking. The commission has since admitted that, in all probability, there would be thousands of job losses as a result of corporate restructuring.
It is simply not true that trade negotiators have “excluded provisions that would have allowed firms to sue governments for the loss of health and public service contracts”. Responding to public pressure, the commission ran a consultation exercise on the inclusion of investor-state dispute settlement and received more than 150,000 replies, the vast majority opposing it, but, like its American counterparts, is still refusing to rule it out, thus also guaranteeing the opposition of unions grouped in the American TUC equivalent, the AFL-CIO.Bert SchouwenburgInternational officerGMBLondon NW1 
In their recent book, called TTIP, Ferdi De Ville and Gabriel Siles-Brugge supply further possible answers to the question: why TTIP? Their research shows that the exaggerated claims about growth and jobs are based on economic models that are no more than “an exercise in managing fictional expectations” and are politically motivated.
The motivation is primarily driven by US and EU fear of losing the dominant position in global power, in the face of competition from China and the other emerging economies. You might say it is the failing neoliberal experiment’s last desperate throw. There is one further fact that sheds some light on the corporate role in the negotiations. Of all the meetings held with the EU trade commissioners, 92% were with corporate lobbyists, leaving just 8% for small businesses, trade unions, NGOs and citizens. John Airs Liverpool"

I was so shocked I looked round for someone to receive the instantaneous and extraordinary tidings: a bumblebee at New Year!
What on Earth can such a sighting mean? I’ll add detail to justify any unease in that question. It was probably one of two common species, buff-tailed or early bumblebee. Based on its small size I might have suggested the latter, but I keep records of spring firsts and my earliest-ever early bumblebee is late March. My earliest-ever bumblebee of any species is 28 January 2012: a whole month later than this one.
In fact I wondered if it were not so much premature as a veteran of last autumn. Whichever is true, it was a bumblebee in a seasonal no-man’s-land, and my strangest record of this insect family in half a century.
I wonder what causal chain I have to invoke to account for such a maladapted vision? Must the moment draw in its wake, if only by implication, all the ecological fallout from 5bn tonnes of carbon, which our species propels, car journey by car journey, flicked switch by flicked switch, into the troposphere every year? Or is it something else?
Is my weird record connected to the weather anomalies generated by exceptional warm-water currents in the western Pacific? To think that there could be a link between that ocean’s habits and my garden’s wildlife is extraordinary enough, but at least a bumblebee because of El Niño is natural and, thus, admissible.
For much of recorded history, “unnatural” events at the point of the year’s renewal were often taken as ominous portents. I suspect little has changed. In our own ecologically informed age, when we understand how everything is linked to everything else, we may no longer resort to supernatural powers or the will of God to explain these freaks. Yet still, we sense instinctively that a midwinter bumblebee can neither be random nor without meaning."

The study from the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment and the ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy at London School of Economics and Political Science argues that applying the tax to all fuels would increase UK consumer prices by up to just 0.9 per cent, assuming all costs were passed along supply chains fully.
However, the report, which was authored by David Grover, Ganga Shreedhar and Dimitri Zenghelis, argues that the true cost impact on consumers is likely to be even lower, given the manner in which the carbon tax would incentivise green behaviour change, drive business innovation, and provide the Treasury with revenues that it could recycle back into the economy.
“In reality [the] impact would likely be still smaller than these estimates suggest because our analysis has not allowed for any of the input substitution, innovation, production method change, or new investment behaviour that industries would exhibit to avoid the cost of carbon pricing,” the paper stated.
Opponents of carbon taxes argue they would impose costs on consumers and undermine the competitiveness of carbon intensive industries. Last year the government moved to ease these concerns, exempting a raft of energy intensive industries such as steel and concrete manufacturing from existing carbon taxes and ‘green levies’.
However, the new paper argues only a handful of industries that together account for around two per cent of UK GDP would face production cost increases that could result in their international competitive position being compromised.
“Carbon policies will provide incentives to increase energy efficiency and resource productivity which could afford UK producers a competitive advantage in the long term, in a world where fossil fuel prices could rise and carbon reduction policies are likely to become more widespread and ambitious,” the paper said.
It added that industries that are disproportionately impacted by carbon taxes should be provided with policy support to help them adapt to carbon pricing measures. “The correct policy response is not to resist this change but to identify vulnerable sectors and buffer labour market participants against its sharpest effects,” the paper said. “Countries and firms that resist enduring change and innovation may not be acting in their long-term interests.”"

But in the meantime, it’s faster and cheaper to save and regrow tropical trees";"There was already dramatic evidence that our planet is undeniably warming before 30 December 2015, when the world heard that the ice at the North Pole was melting. (The temperature on 30 December 2015 was, by some reports, 33ºF [0.7ºC], 50ºF above average).
And yet one immediate, effective way to fight climate change and save polar ice caps is half a world away, in the tropics. Tropical forest conservation and restoration could constitute half of the global warming solution, according to a recent peer reviewed commentary in Nature Climate Change. 
Reducing carbon emissions, as the nations of the world promised to do in Paris last month, is essential, but simultaneously pulling carbon out of the atmosphere (which is what rainforests do) would immediately and significantly reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) at a surprisingly low cost, providing a crucial bridge to a post-fossil fuel era. 
The potential of rainforest conservation to address global warming should be enough to galvanize massive worldwide rainforest conservation efforts. The natural regrowth and subsequent protection of hundreds of millions of acres of degraded rainforest would result in massive absorption of carbon as the trees grow. While it is crucial that we transition away from the use of fossil fuels, the reality is that rainforest protection can happen much more quickly.
But that is only part of the story.
Rainforest conservation is also incredibly economical. One acre of Amazon rainforest in Peru, which stores up to 180 metric tonnes of CO2, can be protected for just a few dollars; the same is true elsewhere in Latin America and Africa. The implications here are astounding and should give us pause: for the cost of a meal – or even a coffee – each of us could save an area of forest about the size of four football pitches and safely store about 725 metric tonnes of CO2. To put this in perspective, the annual emissions of a typical passenger vehicle in the United States is less than 4.5 metric tonnes of CO2. 
Carbon storage, however, is only one benefit of rainforest conservation. Not only do rainforests protect animals such as elephants, tigers and orangutans, they provide a refuge for hundreds and thousands of other lesser-known species. Among other benefits, the medicinal properties of undiscovered and unstudied plants may hold the key to successfully treating cancer and other deadly diseases. 
And rainforests provide the world with a disproportionately high percentage of its oxygen and fresh water – the Amazon River alone contains 20% of the world’s freshwater– and act as natural engines that keep the planet’s tropical ecosystems running smoothly. 
Although wholesale clear-cutting and selective logging have destroyed massive areas of rainforest, vast areas remain intact. And degraded rainforest, if allowed to regenerate, is amazingly resilient. In 10 years, seedlings can grow into 50-foot [15-meter] trees. Diverse wildlife can return and rebound within two to three years. 
Both the remaining pristine rainforest and degraded forest require the world’s attention: a vigorous, concerted effort is needed if we are going to react appropriately to the staggering demands being placed on our planet’s rainforest. 
Deforestation in the name of economic development has occurred routinely over many decades without regard to its devastating consequences. It is completely unsustainable for governments to continue to provide concessions, subsidies and tax breaks to business when logging, oil extraction, mining for minerals, fires, palm oil plantations, large scale commercial agriculture, cattle ranching and road construction continue to diminish the earth’s finite, invaluable rainforests.
The case for rainforest preservation – already overwhelmingly strong – can no longer be cast as a niche effort of conservationists and scientists; it needs to be everyone’s concern. For those wishing to tackle our planet’s greatest environmental challenge, there is no better place to begin than saving our tropical rainforests. "

Last year, Beijing issued two “red alerts” for pollution, the highest level warning which calls for emergency measures such as closing schools and restricting car use. Poor air quality is also having a significant knock-on effect on the country’s tourist trade. 
Some businesses are taking advantage of the air pollution – food delivery services that meet the needs of those staying indoors; bars which push their air purifiers as a marketing tool to get customers in; and beer that gets cheaper as the air quality decreases. But these are not long-term solutions.
According to Ma Jun, one of China’s most prominent environmental voices, China has reached its environmental tipping point. “I think its time to change and balance the environment and growth. If we don’t do that we’re going to suffer a hard landing one day very soon,” says Ma.
From top-down, engineering solutions providing wind turbines and solar panels, to NGOs and citizens forcing local government and industry to act, China’s next steps are going to be closely scrutinised. 
The comments on an article we published last September about Ellie, the machine that can detect depression, ranged widely, from “So CLEVER. My God. Amazing” to “creepy” to “Oh bloody hell, I’m not even fully qualified as a counsellor and already there’s a robot taking my job”.
Ellie is a virtual interviewer, a machine that has been developed to help diagnose depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Like apps for combatting low mood and online cognitive behavioural therapy, she’s an example of the ways that technology can be put to good use by helping improve people’s mental wellbeing.
“We hear a lot about how the rise of technology use, such as smartphones, is harming our mental health, but I believe the same technology can be a real safety net too,” says Sarah Bateup, clinical lead of Ieso Digital Health.
With at least 350 million people worldwide living with depression, the development and adoption of such technology is set to continue.
Industrial farming methods are increasingly coming under scrutiny, especially when it comes to the routine use of antibiotics. 
Although our growing resistance to them can in part be put down to poor prescribing and use, Dr David Wallinga points out that more than 70% of medically important antibiotics sold in the US are used for livestock to promote growth or for routine disease prevention in the “less-than-healthy conditions found on industrial farms”. This is exacerbating antibiotic resistance. 
As a recent Guardian editorial points out, “Antibiotic resistance may not seem as urgent as terrorism or the NHS funding shortfall. But it is actually a threat that could kill many more people and degrade the quality of civilised life much more”.
The Guardian’s investigation into the poultry industry, a key user of antibiotics, has uncovered a catalogue of other disturbing practices. From alleged hygiene failings leading to contaminated chicken to serious concerns about working conditions, the revelations show the heavy price some pay for cheap chicken.
Then there’s pesticide use. Numerous studies have suggested its links with a range of health impacts, including cancers and Parkinson’s disease. The French wine industry, where only 8.4% of vineyards are organic is one sector particularly enamoured with pesticides. However, experts predict that dozens of legal proceedings could be in the pipeline across France related to their health impacts.
Few things are as ridiculous as transporting water around the world in disposable plastic bottles. 
Globally, we now drink as much packaged water as we do milk. Over one fifth of the water in the UK is sourced from overseas, despite the country having abundant sources of water. There have also been trends for water from remote areas, such as Fiji Water, which is sourced from the Fiji Islands, 1,600 miles from the nearest continent.
In the context of a world that is struggling with acute water scarcity in some areas, there are serious questions to be answered about our role as stewards of the Earth. 
Climate change is funded in numerous, often opaque ways, from the issuing of bonds that support the relentless expansion of palm oil plantations to the lobby groups seeking to undermine government action on climate change. 
Some argue that climate change leaders should join forces with fossil fuel companies to put a price on carbon. According to Hunter Lovins and Felix Kramer, for example: “Fossil fuel companies receive $5.3tn [£3.6tn) in worldwide subsidies every year – that’s $10m a minute – exceeding global spending on health. Pricing carbon fuels to reflect their true social and environmental impacts will help to speed up the transition to renewable energy and more energy efficient living standards.”
Other ways to tackle climate change that have risen to prominence over the past year include scaling up the divestment movement and driving more investment into renewables. 
The divestment campaign has had some significant recent successes, including the Church of England divesting from tar sands oil and coal last April and Californian lawmakers passing a bill in September requiring the state’s two largest pension funds to divest from coal.
Last summer, Bill Gates announced that he would invest $2bn in renewable technologies, and in November it was announced that entrepreneurs including Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and Richard Branson were to form the Breakthrough Energy Coalition to support early-stage clean energy companies. "

But when Rachel McCarthy isn’t walking the corridors of Whitehall, on secondment to the Department of Energy and Climate Change, she is to be found polishing her poems.
Despite achieving a double first in physics and chemistry, McCarthy always wanted to write. As the founder of Excite Poetry, the Devon wing of the Poetry Society, and the director of the sell-out Exeter poetry festival, her verse-writing skills are matched only by her ability to draw crowds to big events. 
Strolling through Exeter’s arty West Quarter, blinded by a low winter sun, McCarthy ducks into her favourite junk shop, Otto Retro. “I used to run this open-mic night here,” she says, eyeing up the curiosities that include an Austrian zoological chart and some Czech apothecary jars. “It was such a warm environment. We’d have poetry readings – and people could shop during the break.”
In 2015, the British poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy named McCarthy one of the country’s most exciting new voices, describing her work as bold and mesmerising. Last year also saw the publication of Element, under the Laureate’s Choice imprint, curated by Duffy.
Each of the 19 poems in the volume was inspired by elements from the periodic table, which McCarthy is adamant shouldn’t be dismissed as “a thing stuck on the wall in your GCSE class that you had to memorise”. Everything is made of elements, she says. “You and I. This table. It’s an alphabet of our existence.” 
The collection spans history and tackles subjects from bees (chromium) and butterflies (iridium) to love (yttrium), disaster (osmium) and art history (zinc), via unsung aircraft fitters such as her own father (titanium). Short notes at the end of the booklet explain the significance of each poem’s element. Copper in octopus blood, for example, carries oxygen more efficiently than iron in haemoglobin, helping the octopus survive deep under water. The poet Alice Oswald says of McCarthy’s writing: “strong interesting poems, full of tension and symmetry. They are alive.” 
As you might expect of a scientist, McCarthy did a great deal of research, not only reading “hardcore” chemistry books, but also biographies of Dmitri Mendeleev, who first published the periodic table in 1869, and histories of Russia from the same period. “I became fascinated,not with melting points and boiling points, but with the lives behind the elements. Why they were named as they were – after brothers, wives, stuff in the night sky – and what did they do?” There have even been fraudulent discoveries of fabricated elements.
This week, McCarthy will share this knowledge in Alphabet of Our Universe, part social history lecture, part poetry reading, at Oxford University’s Museum of the History of Science. She says her dual career is often met with surprise, but the two jobs have much in common. “They’re both searching for insight into laws and ideas through particulars. They’re focused on the minutiae.” 
In poetry, those particulars are “words, emotions, ideas and metaphors”, but the best poetry is universal, McCarthy says. “Artistic expression is a search for a truth that looks different on the outside. It’s more concerned with human emotions or experience, but they’re still searching.” Unlike poetry, however, science should be morally neutral, since “that sort of protects science from us as human beings”.
At school in Leyland, near Preston in Lancashire, McCarthy took six A-levels, including all the sciences, maths and English literature. “I had a fantastic English teacher and there was a point when I wondered, ‘Which road do I go down?’ Because that’s the choice you’re presented with now. We’ve lost the renaissance person.” In the end, she decided she could write in her own time, whereas moonlighting as a scientist was less realistic. 
McCarthy feels strongly that art, when tackling scientific subjects, should respect the facts. “If you are influencing the public about a scientific issue, there has to be some responsibility taken by the artist.” Equally, science has a responsibility to artists to properly communicate its findings. Scientific knowledge, McCarthy insists, needn’t dampen one’s wonder at the universe. If anything, it enhances it.
As an example, she riffs on a quote by the American scientist Richard P Feynman printed in the opening pages of Element: “Jupiter, as a mythological figure, to my mind is equally as important as Jupiter the planet. We must engage with both of them.”

If the Earth’s climate is relatively insensitive to rising carbon levels, then it’s somewhat less urgent that we stop burning massive quantities of fossil fuels. However, a new NASA study indicates that’s not the case.
There are a few different ways that climate scientists estimate the Earth’s sensitivity to rising carbon. When they look at climate changes in the distant past (paleoclimate), and at simulations from complex climate models, they get about the same result: if the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere doubles, temperatures will rise between 2°C and 4.5°C, most likely 3°C.
However, a few studies in recent years using a third method have yielded somewhat lower results. This method uses recent measurements of temperature and heat changes, combined with estimates of how “forcings” like the increased greenhouse effect have caused the Earth’s energy balance to change, all input into somewhat simpler climate models. 
These results caused the latest IPCC report to drop its lower estimate of the likely climate sensitivity to double carbon dioxide from 2°C to 1.5°C. Climate scientists were faced with the question, why did this third approach (known as the “energy budget approach”) yield somewhat lower results than others, and which estimate is right?
A new study by Kate Marvel, Gavin Schmidt, Ron Miller, and Larissa Nazarenko at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies appears to have found the answer. They drew upon previous research by Drew Shindell and Kummer &amp; Dessler, who identified a flaw in studies taking the energy budget approach. Those studies had assumed that the Earth’s climate is equally sensitive to all forcings. 
In reality, as world-renowned climate scientist James Hansen noted in a 1997 paper, some forcings are more efficient at causing the Earth’s surface temperature to change than others. Those in which the effects are focused in the northern hemisphere tend to be more efficient, for example. Andrew Dessler explains in the video below.
Drew Shindell first identified this deficiency with these low sensitivity studies in a 2014 paper. Shortly thereafter, Kummer &amp; Dessler published a paper noting that this issue could potentially bring the climate sensitivity estimates from the energy budget method in line with estimates from climate models and paleoclimate studies. This new NASA paper builds upon those previous studies by better quantifying the efficiencies of different forcings over the historical period and the effect this has on energy budget approach climate sensitivity estimates.
The NASA scientists ran climate models using just one forcing at a time – changes in greenhouse gases, aerosol pollution, land use changes, etc. – to see how efficient each is at changing the global surface temperature. As it turns out, forcings that have tended to cause cooling, like increased aerosol pollution, are particularly efficient.
The scientists then repeated the energy budget study approaches incorporating what they learned about the various forcing efficiencies, and found that the previous climate sensitivity estimates were indeed biased low. As the NASA study authors wrote,
Climate sensitivities estimated from recent observations will therefore be biased low in comparison with CO2-only simulations owing to an accident of history
The “accident of history” is that the more efficient forcings happen to be those that have had a cooling effect on temperatures in recent decades, while the less efficient forcings happen to be those that have caused warming. By assuming they were all equally efficient, the previous energy budget studies, for example by Nic Lewis and Judith Curry, biased their climate sensitivity estimates low. The new best estimate puts climate sensitivity right around 3°C warming in response to doubled carbon dioxide levels, in line with estimates from climate models and paleoclimate studies. 
Gavin Schmidt provides more detail at RealClimate. He also notes that conservative media outlets like the Daily Express and Daily Mail, and science denial blogs badly misrepresented their study results, as happens all too often.
It’s also important to note that relying solely on the previous energy budget model results is a clear-cut case of cherry picking. That method was the outlier, yielding lower climate sensitivity estimates than other approaches. In fact, there have been a number of recent studies using observed changes in cloud cover, finding that the climate models with the higher sensitivities are those that reproduce the cloud changes most accurately.
Moreover, it’s worth pointing out that even ‘low’ estimates are not that low. As climate scientist Chris Forest noted, if they were correct, “It might buy us five or ten years” to solve the problem. We’re so far behind the carbon pollution cuts needed to avoid dangerous climate change, that extra decade wouldn’t even be enough. Even if the contrarians were right, we would still need to cut carbon pollution rapidly.
However, the NASA study shows that the previous estimates were indeed biased low, and correcting for that bias brings them into agreement with estimates using other approaches. This result makes it all the more urgent that we ratchet down carbon pollution emissions as quickly as possible to curb the risks associated with rapid climate change."

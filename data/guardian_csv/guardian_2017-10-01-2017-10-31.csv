Well I call New York and London disappearing under water within this century pretty catastrophic wouldn't you?
Hansen does this go back to 1988 and he told this to the media to be published.
 ""By 2028, in New York the West Side Highway [which runs along the Hudson River] will be under water. And there will be tape across the windows across the street because of high winds. And the same birds won’t be there. The trees in the median strip will change.” Then he said, “There will be more police cars.” Why? “Well, you know what happens to crime when the heat goes up.”
Total alarmist bollocks of course but definitely, if it had been true, would be the result of Catastrophic AGW.
Do you think we should go to Hansen and try and make him accountable for his disastrously failed predictions or continue to listen and give credence who has admitted he is prepared to say anything, lie, commit criminal offences because he feels morally obliged to do so.
Mind you he want people putting in jail if they are on the other side of the debate.
You seem to have gone quiet on how science and its scientists can continue to support a consensus rejecting data they suggests otherwise or just keeping quiet in furtherance of their career.
Have you checked whether Jones altered the 1910-1940 blip, in the way Wigley asked him to, when he reprogrammed HADCRUT?
You see in science when actual data and observations contradict your theory you are supposed to re-look at the theory. However, when your whole career and reputation depends on the theory it is better to alter the data instead.

The former period included a major European and a major Eurasian war which caused problems with the provision of reliable temperature data.
""However, there was no real increase in CO2 during this period.""
Atmospheric CO2 increased by around 10ppm from 300 ppm to 310 ppm over the thirty years from 1910 to 1940. 10 ppm is a real increase.

While it is both unethical and illegal to listen to the private conversations or intercept the mail of hardworking individuals neither suspected nor convicted of any crime, the illegally hacked conversations between Tom Wigley and Phil Jones make perfect sense in explaining the 1940s temperature blip in addition to the measurement problems already discussed.

So why isn’t storage, given its critical nature not a mandatory part of any wind or PV installation?
BQEND
Obvious. This is because the financials don't yet stack up. They will - but not for a couple of years (my estimate). People are working today on building batteries into wind turbines.

a great deal of lobbying is done to ensure that renewables can expand without any requirement for storage, even though, we must both agree that this makes no sense at all,
BQEND
You misunderstand this. I am not suggesting, and I don't believe many serious commentators are either, that we transition to 100% wind and solar. We need to have nuclear in the mix - at least for the next few decades, as we build more and more renewables into the generation grid. The important thing is to decarbonise and it is not going to come with a single technology. A whole lot of other elements need to be in place too. V2 smart meters, highly variable tariffs, interconnectors to other countries, smart demand management, hydro storage and increasingly, domestic and grid-scale storage.

It's also much easier to count the four pairs of grasshopper chromosomes than it is to count the 23 pairs of human chromosomes that often get in each other ways in the field of view of the three dimensional cell.
All members of the Hominidae, except Humans, Neanderthals, and Denisovians, have 24 pairs of chromosomes. Humans have only 23 pairs of chromosomes. The closest human relative, the chimpanzee, has near identical DNA sequences to human chromosome 2, but they are found in two separate chromosomes.
 Counting chromosomes is more an exercise in cytology than biochemistry. Painter is thought to have failed to identify chromosome 1 as a single chromosome because of a staining artifact. Chromosome 1 is a large metacentric chromosome with a considerable amount of heterochromatin at its centromere, which failed to take up the iron hemotoxylin stain he was using. The two extra chromosomes pictured in Painter's 1923 ordered display of 24 chromosomes correspond to the two arms of chromosome 1 separated by not visible centromere and heterochromatin.

Production of wind turbines and solar panels is incredibly energy intensive (as well as being quite polluting in general). Hydro electric plants require thousands of tons of concrete and steel (both of which involve CO2 production).
So unfortunately your initial argument against nuclear has equal impact on other ""alternate"" (to coal and gas) means of generating electricity. IMO the only answer to that that I see, is to transition as quickly as possible to electricity generation techniques that don't inherently produce carbon (even if they do currently because of the coal power required to develop them). 
In support of @tryout; my reading suggests that gen II nuclear plants are almost on par with wind power WRT CO2 production and are currently far better than PV solar. Gen III nuclear plants (as currently under construction in US and China) are slated to lower that significantly (I guess the proof will be in the pudding).
Claims that dealing with the radioactive waste is problematic lay in stark contrast to the current scientific consensus that we have safe ways to store it. To believe one scientific consensus (climate change) but not another (the safety of storing nuclear waste) strikes me as cherry picking based on opinion and/or irrational fears, rather than rational consideration of the evidence; and the opinions of the experts in the relevant fields.
Don't get me wrong, I personally prefer using a wide range of sources of energy. ""Renewable"" energy (i.e. doesn't require constant inputs) has got to be better than energy production that constantly requires fuel. But in order to reduce (or hopefully eliminate) the worst potential impacts of climate change, we need to act as fast as possible. To remove the option of nuclear from the table because of an irrational dislike or fear, strikes me as short sighted.
Having said that, it's still completely unclear what impacts removing energy from the atmosphere (i.e. via solar and/or wind) might have in the longer term. I guess that's why I err on the side of using as many different sources of electricity generation as possible.

""or just accepting data that supports an existing meme and rejecting data that doesn't.""
In their day to day work scientists deal with established theories, hypotheses and evidence, whereas memes are virally transmitted ideas in popular media. They don't accept or reject data on face value but instead investigate how it was gathered and if necessary replicate the results and investigate alternatives. It's always a case of show me the evidence.
My old colleague did this with the popular media meme that stomach ulcers were caused by low stomach pH, finding an alternative underlying cause in the form of Helicobacter pyrlori which made the stomach wall vulnerable to the normal low pH of its contents.
""Also if they saw real problems with an existing meme they should stand up and say so.""
They do that. While popular media memes are not their daily bread and butter, today's scientists have responded to problems with the truth of existing memes as they did with the meme that there was widespread lack of acceptance among the scientific community of the evidence support the current anthropogenic global greenhouse warming.

Scientific consensus is based on the quality of the evidence. A scientists reputation and ability to attract grant monies is determined by the quality of their research proposal and the quality of their published work which are based on the evidence they have gathered and the quality of their analysis of that evidence. In fifty years of experience in a range of scientific fields I have found colleagues more concerned about the quality of their work and the evidence it uncovers than about whether their discoveries go against the consensus (in fact they are excited when it does). Academic appointments have followed good quality science based on sound evidence. Scientific authority is also a synonym for quality evidence as in science authority in the sense of being an authority in your field means to know the evidence and what shows about how the world works.
The habits of scientists go against confirmation bias as they continually challenge each others evidence and interpretation thereof.

In climate science there is a problem because of thee 1910 - 1940 period whose warming rate is almost an exact match for the 1970 - 2000 period. However, there was no real increase in CO2 during this period. In public the proponents, kind of hand wave and declare 'oh Solar and Aerosols' it is nonsense but then they don't really expect to be challenged.
In private between themselves though they admit that it is not these factors and it is a problem for the theory.
So Tom Wigley wrote to Phil Jones
""Phil,
Here are some speculations on correcting SSTs to partlyexplain the 1940s warming blip.
If you look at the attached plot you will see that theland also shows the 1940s blip (as I’m sure you know).
So, if we could reduce the ocean blip by, say, 0.15 degC,then this would be significant for the global mean — butwe’d still have to explain the land blip.
I’ve chosen 0.15 here deliberately. This still leaves anocean blip, and i think one needs to have some form ofocean blip to explain the land blip (via either some commonforcing, or ocean forcing land, or vice versa, or all ofthese). When you look at other blips, the land blips are1.5 to 2 times (roughly) the ocean blips — higher sensitivityplus thermal inertia effects. My 0.15 adjustment leaves thingsconsistent with this, so you can see where I am coming from.
Removing ENSO does not affect this.
It would be good to remove at least part of the 1940s blip,but we are still left with “why the blip”.
Let me go further. If you look at NH vs SH and the aerosoleffect (qualitatively or with MAGICC) then with a reducedocean blip we get continuous warming in the SH, and a coolingin the NH — just as one would expect with mainly NH aerosols.
The other interesting thing is (as Foukal et al. note — fromMAGICC) that the 1910-40 warming cannot be solar. The Sun canget at most 10% of this with Wang et al solar, less with Foukalsolar. So this may well be NADW, as Sarah and I noted in 1987(and also Schlesinger later). A reduced SST blip in the 1940smakes the 1910-40 warming larger than the SH (which itcurrently is not) — but not really enough.
So … why was the SH so cold around 1910? Another SST problem?(SH/NH data also attached.)
This stuff is in a report I am writing for EPRI, so I’dappreciate any comments you (and Ben) might have.
Tom.""
So what ethical scientist would write to the keeper of a global data base saying how good it would be for them and the theory if the 1940 blip could be altered, knowing full well he had the power to do that?

I'm not trolling. I genuinely believe that spending lots of money trying to develop enough solar and wind farms to power a national grid may be counter-productive. That's why I think we need to embrace nuclear power. Hydro is great, but it's only suitable in certain geographical conditions. I grew up in New Zealand, where all power is hydro. It doesn't stop dairy farmers from polluting all the rivers with effluent and chemicals though.
Unfortunately we have a tendency to compartmentalise; and sometimes pursue contradictory and potentially harmful aims.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias
Well let's look at a situation in science involving something pretty simple in science compared to the huge complexity of the Earth's climatic processes. Lets look at biochemistry.
Fairly early in the 20th century the distinguished scientist Theophilus Painter produced studies showing there were 24 pairs of chromosomes in a human cell.
This of course was not correct there are actually only 23 pairs.
However, this became the consensus other scientists subsequently did similar peer reviewed 'studies' and all said that they indeed did find 24 also. Of course they couldn't have found this because it was not true.
So were they were all either totally clueless or fraudulent, or did confirmation bias kick in, or did they indeed see 23 but were not prepared to go against authority and consensus?
Chromosomes pairs were held to be 24 pairs until 1956 when a scientist did publish a study showing the correct figure of 23.
 Checking photographs of chromosomes reprinted in textbooks and studies, researchers later found that 23 pairs were clearly shown—and yet captions under the photographs declared the figure to be 24 and the text continued to say humans have 24 pairs of chromosomes.
https://creation.com/great-chromosome-fiasco
Amazing right? Also this was just a relatively simple problem, unlike the hugely complex climate science where it is actually far far more easy to keep your head down hidden by the complexity,

I also believe that their approach is rational, they have succeeded in massively reducing their fossil fuel burn given their economic growth and energy demands. Not only are they the largest market for renewables, they are 50% of the global renewables market.
But vitally, their renewables policy is providing identifiable benefits for their consumers, while promoting a competitive market to deliver renewable energy.
This is the vital difference between their approach and the approach taken by the UK, US, et cetera - in the UK all consumers pay a mandatory tax to provide a subsidy to predominately foreign companies to generate electricity at a guaranteed price unrelated to the spot market.
Suggesting that the transmission network be reengineered to take advantage of wind is great, but who’s going to pay for it? Let me guess, the consumers again?? And given it’s going to take decades to update even if the budgets are available, it simply means a continuation of fossil fuel burn.
And why so pessimistic about energy storage, China already has 23Gw of pumped storage and is planning 40GW by 2020 – they’ll also have 250MW of battery storage online soon both of which are expanding due to private investment.
But apparently our only option is sticking a few batteries in wind turbines to smooth out electrical delivery, and it’s going to take a couple of years?? That’s simply pathetic.
My issue is the UK’s along with other Western nations fixation on wind and solar as if it was some type of panacea and their obsession with subsidising large multinationals to supply it without any obligation to provide energy storage, grid upgrades or anything else your links have identified as critical, when it may impact their profitability.
The UK could be focusing on renewables that provide consumers benefit - solar thermal would provide consumer benefits while dropping fossil fuel consumption, just as combined wind, PV and storage would benefit communities, especially rural communities, and the list goes on.

HadCRUT is a data base of the temperatures of grid squares worldwide, not a program. Neither Phil nor his team programmed a data base.
The satellite record is not a record of land and sea surface temperatures but reflects the temperature of the atmosphere at higher altitudes. When I drive up or climb a sizeable mountain or fly in an unheated light plane, I take a jumper and sometimes a parka. HadCRUT more accurately reflects what happening on the surface of the Earth.
As already explained above, data spanning the period from 2001 to 2014 covers insufficient time to tell you anything about climate.
The El Nino of 2015-16 was of similar magnitude to the El Nino of 1997-98 and smaller than that of 1981-82; but was hotter than both of them. Similar sized El Ninos produce similar sized temperature peaks off the underlying climate temperature. 2015-16 was hotter than 1997-97 because the underlying climate temperature was hotter due to global greenhouse warming produced by increasing atmospheric CO2. So the cause was that extra CO2.

These are typical ENSO variations that can been seen in the global temperature record of the last century. The variation continues around a rising climatetemperature trend as the graph you refer to demonstrates. 
You need 30 years to measure climate temperature. The global climate temperature of 2020 will include the temperature data from 1991 to 2020 including two very large El Ninos.

Production of nuclear electricity is not carbon free, because the production of nuclear fuel for these reactors is significantly energy intensive. While it is true that most nuclear reactors do not emit CO2 at the point of generation, reactors are a small part of the nuclear fuel cycle, which emits large amounts of CO2. These arise from the so-called front end of the fuel cycle - uranium mining, ore milling, uranium hexafluoride conversion, fuel enrichment and, finally, fabrication of the fuel rods. Moreover, nuclear waste management at the ""back end"" is already energy hungry in treatment, conditioning, transportation and final disposal in some future repository (if ministers ever give the green light).

The CRU in HadCRUT stands for Climate Research Unit, which began its production from 1978 onward of its gridded dataset of land air temperature anomalies based on instrumental temperature records held by national meteorological organisations around the world. In 1986 sea temperatures were added to form a synthesis of data which was the first global temperature record, demonstrating unequivocally that the globe had warmed by almost 0.8 degrees C over the last 150 years.
HadCRUT 3, first published in 2006, included a more complete statistical model of uncertainty including estimates of errors, biases due to changing exposure and urbanisation, and uncertainty due to incomplete coverage of the globe by observations of temperature.
HadCRUT 4, introduced in March 2012, included newly digitised measurement data, both over land and sea, new sea surface temperature bias adjustments and a more comprehensive model for describing uncertainties in sea-surface temperature measurements. Overall, the net effect was was an increase in average temperature anomaly, especially around 1950 and 1885, and less significantly around 1925 and 2005.
I'm not sure why you're talking about what Phil did in 2015. The first thing you need to consider in talking about measurements is what it is you are measuring. The afforementioned exposure and urbanisation factors give a false measure of regional temperature over the grid square in question, hence the need for adjustments. Means of measuring sea surface temperatures have improved with the deployment of Argo buoys and past measurements adjusted for the error or bias inherent in their means of measurement of sea surface temperature. When I commenced year 9 high school physics in 1963, the first thing we learnt about was zero error in measurement.

Coastal cities around the world could be devastated by 1.3m of sea level rise this century unless coal-generated electricity is virtually eliminated by 2050, according to a new paper that combines the latest understanding of Antarctica’s contribution to sea level rise and the latest emissions projection scenarios.
It confirms again that significant sea level rise is inevitable and requires rapid adaptation. But, on a more positive note, the work reveals the majority of that rise – driven by newly recognised processes on Antarctica – could be avoided if the world fulfils its commitment made in Paris to keep global warming to “well below 2C”.
In 2016, Robert DeConto from the University of Massachusetts Amherst revealed that Antarctica could contribute to massive sea level rise much earlier than thought, suggesting ice sheet collapse would occur sooner and identifying a new process where huge ice cliffs would disintegrate.
But that paper only examined the impact of Antarctica on sea level rise, ignoring other contributions, and didn’t examine the details of what measures society needed to take to avoid those impacts.
The new paper by Alexander Nauels from the University of Melbourne and colleagues uses simplified physical models that allowed them to explore all known contributions to sea level rise, and pair them with the new generation of emissions scenarios which the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will use in the next set of reports.
Under all scenarios we are going to have to adapt
They found that if nothing is done to limit carbon pollution, then global sea levels will rise by an estimated 1.32m. That is 50% more than was previously thought, with the IPCC’s AR5 report suggesting 85cm was possible by the end of the century.
But the extra contribution from Antarctica would not kick in if warming was kept at less than 1.9C above preindustrial levels, the researchers found. Temperatures above that threshold risked triggering the additional processes in Antarctica identified in the 2016 paper, causing much greater sea level rise.
“The 1.5C limit in the Paris Agreement is a much safer bet to avoid this additional contribution than only achieving 2C,” Nauels said.
The work, published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, showed that the current carbon reduction pledges which governments have made as part of the Paris Agreement by 2030 – their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) – are so weak they would require very deep cuts between 2030 and 2050 to avoid triggering those extra processes in Antarctica.
Since the authors used the next generation of emissions scenarios (the “Shared Socioeconomic Pathways”), which include assumptions about socioeconomic factors that are driving emissions – such as energy demand, energy generation, population growth and GDP – they were able to examine what actions could be taken to avoid the sea level rise.
Those scenarios suggested coal could only make up 5% of the world’s energy mix by 2050 if sea level rise is to be limited to about half a metre.
Similarly, those scenarios suggested a global carbon price would have to be well over US$100 per tonne, since at that cost, sea level would rise by 65cm by 2100.
John Church, a leading sea level rise expert from the University of New South Wales who was co-convening lead author of the chapter on sea level in the third and fifth IPCC Assessment Reports, told the Guardian the work was further confirmation that the world needed to prepare now for substantial sea level rises.
“Under all scenarios we are going to have to adapt,” Church said. “We cannot stop all sea level rise.”
He said the research community was not in consensus yet about the accelerated contribution of Antarctica to sea level rise, identified in the 2016 paper and modelled in this study, but examining the implications of those findings was still important.
DeConto, the lead author of the landmark paper from 2016, said it was important to recognise the good news in his original findings and this extension of that work.
“In the aggressive mitigation pathways, where we assume that the global community gets its act together and we reduce emissions, it’s a much rosier picture. There’s a much reduced risk of dramatic sea level rise from Antarctica,” he told the Guardian. “This study fully reinforces that.”
Nauels said his team’s work assumed that Antarctica would contribute to sea level rise as was suggested by the 2016 paper by DeConto, but more work was needed to confirm those findings.
“We still have to find out what’s going on in Antarctica,” he told the Guardian. “We can’t base all future sea level rise projects on just one paper. And the Antarctic ice sheet community are frantically working on the new insights.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/26/sea-levels-to-rise-13m-unless-coal-power-ends-by-2050-report-says

The new report has raised alarm among scientists and prompted calls for nations to consider more drastic emissions reductions at the upcoming climate negotiations in Bonn.
“Globally averaged concentrations of CO2 reached 403.3 parts per million (ppm) in 2016, up from 400.00 ppm in 2015 because of a combination of human activities and a strong El Niño event,” according to The Greenhouse Gas Bulletin, the UN weather agency’s annual flagship report.
This acceleration occurred despite a slowdown – and perhaps even a plateauing – of emissions because El Niño intensified droughts and weakened the ability of vegetation to absorb carbon dioxide. As the planet warms, El Niños are expected to become more frequent.
The increase of 3.3 ppm is considerably higher than both the 2.3 ppm rise of the previous 12 months and the average annual increase over the past decade of 2.08ppm. It is also well above the previous big El Niño year of 1998, when the rise was 2.7 ppm.
The study, which uses monitoring ships, aircraft and stations on the land to track emissions trends since 1750, said carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is now increasing 100 times faster than at the end of the last ice age due to population growth, intensive agriculture, deforestation and industrialisation.
The last time Earth experienced similar CO2 concentration rates was during the Pliocene era (three to five million years ago), when the sea level was up to 20m higher than now.
The authors urged policymakers to step up countermeasures to reduce the risk of global warming exceeding the Paris climate target of between 1.5C and 2C.
“Without rapid cuts in CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions, we will be heading for dangerous temperature increases by the end of this century, well above the target set by the Paris climate change agreement,” World Meteorological Organisation chief Petteri Taalas said in a statement.
The momentum from the Paris accord in 2015 is faltering due to the failure of national governments to live up to their promises. In a report to be released on Tuesday, UN Environment will show the gap between international goals and domestic commitments leaves the world on course for warming well beyond the 2C target and probably beyond 3C. International efforts to act have also been weakened by US president Donald Trump’s decision to quit the accord.
Prof Dave Reay, professor of carbon management at the University of Edinburgh, said: “This should set alarm bells ringing in the corridors of power. We know that, as climate change intensifies, the ability of the land and oceans to mop up our carbon emissions will weaken. There’s still time to steer these emissions down and so keep some control, but if we wait too long humankind will become a passenger on a one-way street to dangerous climate change.”
“The numbers don’t lie. We are still emitting far too much and this needs to be reversed,” the head of UN Environment Erik Solheim said in reaction to the new report. “What we need now is global political will and a new sense of urgency.”
The report comes amid growing concerns that nature’s ability to deal with CO2 is weakening. Recent studies show forest regions are being cleared and degraded so rapidly that they are now emitting more carbon than they absorb.
“These large increase show it is more important than ever to reduce our emissions to zero – and as soon as possible,” said Piers Forster, director of the Priestley International Centre for Climate at the University of Leeds. “If vegetation can no longer help out absorbing our emissions in these hot years we could be in trouble.”
The World Meteorological Organisation predicted 2017 will again break records for concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane, but the growth rate will not be as fast because there is no El Niño effect.

 The trend of ever later first freezes appears to have started around 1980, according to data from 700 weather stations across the US going back to 1895 and compiled by Ken Kunkel, a meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Centers for Environmental Information.
Kunkel compared the first freeze from each of the 700 stations to the station’s average for the 20th Century. Some parts of the country experience earlier or later freezes every year, but on average freezes are coming later. 
The average first freeze over the last 10 years, from 2007 to 2016, is a week later than the average from 1971 to 1980. 
This year, about 40% of the Lower 48 states have had a freeze as of 23 October, compared to 65% in a normal year, according to Jeff Masters, meteorology director of the private service Weather Underground. 
In Ottawa, Illinois, the average first freeze for the 20th century was 15 October. The normal from 1981 to 2010 based on NOAA computer simulations was 19 October. Since 2010, the average first freeze is on 26 October. Last year, the first freeze in Ottawa came on 12 November. 
Almost certainly, according to a statement issued by the World Meteorological Organization on Tuesday. “Climate change means that when we do have an event like Harvey, the rainfall amounts are likely to be higher than they would have been otherwise,” the UN organisation’s spokeswoman Clare Nullis told a conference. Nobody is arguing that climate change caused the storm, but it is likely to have made it much worse.
Warmer seas evaporate more quickly. Warmer air holds more water vapour. So, as temperatures rise around the world, the skies store more moisture and dump it more intensely. The US National Weather Service has had to introduce a new colour on its graphs to deal with the volume of precipitation. Harvey surpassed the previous US record for rainfall from a tropical system, as 49.2 inches was recorded at Mary’s Creek at Winding Road in Southeast Houston, at 9.20am on Tuesday.
There is a proven link – known as the Clausius-Clapeyron equation – that shows that for every half a degree celsius in warming, there is about a 3% increase in atmospheric moisture content. This was a factor in Texas. The surface temperature in the Gulf of Mexico is currently more than half a degree celsius higher than the recent late summer average, which is in turn more than half a degree higher than 30 years ago, according to Michael Mannof Penn State University. As a result there was more potential for a deluge.
Yes, the storm surge was greater because sea levels have risen 20cm as a result of more than 100 years of human-related global warming. This has melted glaciers and thermally expanded the volume of seawater.
Last year was “way off the charts” nationwide, Kunkel said. The average first freeze was two weeks later than the 20th century average, and the last frost of spring was nine days earlier than normal. 
Overall the United States freeze season of 2016 was more than a month shorter than the freeze season of 1916. It was most extreme in the Pacific Northwest. Oregon’s freeze season was 61 days – two months – shorter than normal. 
Global warming has helped push the first frosts later, Kunkel and other scientists said. Also at play, though, are natural short-term changes in air circulation patterns – but they too may be influenced by man-made climate change, they said. 
This shrinking freeze season is what climate scientists have long predicted, said University of Oklahoma meteorology professor Jason Furtado. 
A shorter freeze season means a longer growing season and less money spent on heat. But it also hurts some plants that require a certain amount of chill, such as Georgia peaches, said Theresa Crimmins, a University of Arizona ecologist. 
Crimmins is assistant director of the National Phenology Network . Phenology is the study of the seasons and how plants and animals adapt to timing changes. 
Pests that attack trees and spread disease aren’t being killed off as early as they normally would be, Crimmins said. 
In New England, many trees aren’t changing colours as vibrantly as they normally do or used to because some take cues for when to turn from temperature, said Boston University biology professor Richard Primack. 
Research, said natural variability, especially an El Nino, made last year exceptional for an early freeze, but “it represents the kind of conditions that will be more routine in a decade or two” because of man-made climate change. 
“The long-term consequences are really negative,” said Primack, because shorter winters and hotter temperatures are also expected to lead to rising seas that cause worse flooding during heavy storms.

That doesn't change anything. Clearly energy per se is not the cause - rather its the uses we put it to - many of which (e.g. water treatment) are easily serviced by intermittent power sources like solar or wind, which are also cheaper to build, especially in developing areas where electricity infrastructure needs to be built for large scale plants to be of any use. In addition to this trends show an increasing decoupling of energy use and emissions (see article below)
Furthermore, the correlation (as you point out) is logarithmic - i.e. there are diminishing returns as power consumption rises, with the vast majority of the effect at very low levels of electricity use. This means that reducing energy use in currently high energy-using nations would (even if directly causative) have little effect on quality of life in those nations and, in fact, would provide the necessary drop in emissions to enable low-use (developing) nations to be able to substantially increase their energy use. Looking at the correlative graphs in the article below, you can see that the development index of the highest energy-using nations is not substantially higher than of nations with 1/5th of the energy use. In fact, the data suggest that the development index might actually peak at ~ 150 GJ per capita and that nations with higher per capita use and emissions (> 300 GJ per capita) sit below the curve.

None of those things (except air conditioning) use large amounts of energy if arranged sensibly. Instead of loads of air conditioning you use passivehouse design (very high insulation/airtightess/active ventilation), so that only a very small amount of energy is needed.
The things that cause excessive consumption is lots of high-carbon travel: mostly flying, shipping and individual vehicles. Those things have to be decarbonised or massively reduced. Everyone can develop to a healthy, 2-or-fewer children, decent housing, enough food, communication access level without blowing the carbon budget.

If you were to cull all Yanks and Aussies (less than 400 million people), we'd be halfway to solving the world's CO2 emissions problem
BQEND
It doesn't work like that. Getting rid of the richest 700 million would halve emissions. The richest 400 million would perhaps be 40%, but they are not all in the US and AU, despite their high average consumption. This graph (Fig E1: http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/ChancelPiketty2015.pdf) shows where the richest 10% live: 40% in the US, 19% EU, 10% china, 7% Russia, 5% MENA, 5% South America, 5% rest of asia, 2% south Africa, 1% india, 6% everywhere else. And of course the current trend is those numbers rising relative to the US and EU.
So the point is that the rich people with the massive carbon footprints are all over now. Lots of Chinese tourists who can afford to fly round the world and so on.
I agree entirely that the excesses of those people have to be reduced somehow otherwise this problem cannot be dealt with. If you split the 1.5C carbon budget across everyone in the world we have 40 tonnes each for our entire lives. Radical action is now necessary to hit even 2C.

Heatwaves are affecting many more vulnerable people and global warming is boosting the transmission of deadly diseases such as dengue fever, the world’s most rapidly spreading disease. Air pollution from fossil fuel burning is also causing millions of early deaths each year, while damage to crops from extreme weather threatens hunger for millions of children.
The findings, published in the Lancet journal, come from researchers at 26 institutions around the world, including many universities, the World Health Organization, World Bank and the UN’s World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The WMO reported on Monday that the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere made a record jump in 2016 to hit a concentration not seen for more than three million years.
“Climate change is happening and it’s a health issue today for millions worldwide,” said Prof Anthony Costello, at the World Health Organization and co-chair of the group behind the new report. It follows a related report in 2009 that warned that climate change was the biggest danger to global health in the 21st century, an assessment repeated in the new report.
But Costello said acting to halt global warming would also deliver a huge benefit for health: “The outlook is challenging, but we still have an opportunity to turn a looming medical emergency into the most significant advance for public health this century.”
“Our scientists have been telling us for some time that we’ve got a bad case of climate change. Now our doctors are telling us it’s bad for our health,” said Christiana Figueres, who as the UN’s climate chief negotiated the Paris climate change agreement and also co-chaired the new report. 
“Hundreds of millions of people are already suffering health impacts as a result of climate change,” she told the Guardian. “Tackling climate change directly, unequivocally, and immediately improves global health. It’s as simple as that.”
One of the most striking of the 40 indicators assessed by the researchers was a huge increase in the number of people over 65 exposed to extreme heat. This rose by 125 million between 2000 and 2016 and worries doctors because older people are especially vulnerable to heat.
“There is no crystal ball gazing here, these are the actual observations,” said Prof Peter Cox, at the University of Exeter, UK. He said the 70,000 deaths that resulted from the 2003 heatwave in Europe looked small compared to the long-term trends: “We were alarmed when we saw this.” 
Most of the increase in exposed people resulted from rising temperatures, but the number of older people is also rising, creating a “perfect storm”, Cox said. The report also found that hotter and more humid weather was increasingly creating conditions in which it is impossible to work outside. In 2016, this caused work equivalent to almost a million people to be lost, half in India alone.
The report also found that climate change has increased the ability of dengue fever to spread, because the mosquitoes and the virus they carry breed more quickly. Dengue is also known as “breakbone fever” due to the pain it causes and infections have doubled in each decade since 1990, now reaching up to 100m infections a year now. Dengue was used as an example in the report and the researchers suggest global warming will also increase the spread of other diseases such as schistosomiasis.
Air pollution is known to cause millions of early deaths every year but the new report highlights the 800,000 annual deaths related solely to coal burning. The good news here, said Prof Paul Wilkinson, is that coal production peaked in 2013 and is now falling. “We are seeing the first turn [in the trend] but we have a long way to go,” he said. “It is a health dividend we are ignoring if we do not act.” 
The impacts of climate change are not limited to poorer nations, said Dr Toby Hillman, at the Royal College of Physicians, but also affect developed nations like the UK. He said air pollution kills about 40,000 in the UK each year and criticised low government funding levels for cycling and walking. Hillman also noted other impacts, such as sharp increases in mental health problems after extreme weather events like flooding.
The new report highlighted imminent threats as well, such as the loss of crops to increasingly hot and extreme weather. “We are going to see millions more undernourished children as a result of that,” said Prof Hugh Montgomery, at University College London (UCL). 
Montgomery said the potential benefits of climate change appeared to be small in comparison to the damages: “We are not ducking the potential benefits, we just find it hard to see what they are.”
Cox said it was not clear that global warming will actually reduce winter cold spells, which cause early deaths in higher latitude countries, because changes happening in the Arctic can exacerbate cold snaps. Prof Georgina Mace, also at UCL, said the evidence for a warmer climate increasing food production was often very localised and short term: ”Overall the overwhelming pattern is negative.”
Clare Goodess, a climate researcher at the University of East Anglia and not part of the Lancet report, said: “The indicators reveal some stark warnings for human health, as well as some glimmers of hope, [and] the key messages appear robust. The attribution of [climate change] temperature trends to human activities is now unequivocal, so the urgency of addressing the issues raised by this report is not in doubt.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/30/climate-change-already-damaging-health-of-millions-globally-report-finds

In Poland, which uses high volumes of coal, electric vehicles produced a quarter less emissions than diesels when put through a full lifecycle modelling study by Belgium’s VUB University.
CO2 reductions on Europe’s cleanest grid in Sweden were a remarkable 85%, falling to around one half for countries such as the UK.
 “On average, electric vehicles will emit half the CO2 emissions of a diesel car by 2030, including the manufacturing emissions,” said Yoann Le Petit, a spokesman for the T&amp;E think tank, which commissioned the study.
“We’ve been facing a lot of fake news in the past year about electrification put out by the fuel industry but in this study you can see that even in Poland today it is more beneficial to the climate to drive an electric vehicle than a diesel.”
The new study uses an EU estimate of Poland’s emissions – at 650gCO2/kWh – which is significantly lower than calculations by the European commission’s Joint Research Centre science wing last year.
But its findings will likely be welcomed in Brussels, where a new emissions standard for 2030 is set to be unveiled in November, along with some potentially more radical proposals. 
Speaking in the European parliament this month, the EU’s climate commissioner, Miguel Canete, said: “One option we’re looking at is a mandate to ensure a minimum share of low – for manufacturers it could be zero – emitting vehicles.”
 Today, just 1.7% of new vehicles sold in Europe are electric, and some EU officials question whether Europe has access to enough lithium to create a 5-10% market share for electric cars anytime soon. Its capacity to scale up construction of battery plants may also be in doubt.
“You can’t have a massive explosion of electric cars as there’s no plants here to build the batteries,” one EU source said. “In any case, when you take into account the emissions from battery manufacture and electricity supply, their GHG emissions are not so attractive.
The VUB study says that while the supply of critical metals – lithium, cobalt, nickel and graphite – and rare earths would have to be closely monitored and diversified, it should not constrain the clean transport transition.
As battery technology improves and more renewables enter the electricity grid, emissions from battery production itself could be cut by 65%, the study found.

You're now even suggesting that I've used ad hominem against you, but somehow don't recognise that accusing me of being a ""danger to the young"" is precisely that! You also described the IPCC as being ""infantilely incompetent"" and the highly respected Peter Hadfield as a ""snake oil salesman""..... and all because they dare to do science the way it's supposed to be done and reached conclusions that contradict your ill-informed point of view.
For the record, I have described a number of your claims as being ""silly"", which they are (very!) and described you as being ""ignorant"" in relation to your knowledge and understanding of the science of climate change, which is self-evident to anyone who has a reasonable grasp of the subject. What you also fail to grasp is that there is an implied insult to the entire scientific community in your attitude; that somehow they have all been incompetent and missed ""obvious"" flaws in their conclusions. Can you not see why it is hard for any of us to take you seriously under such circumstances?
""Every fact I've noted is subject to possible refutation."" and ""I've cited facts which remain undisputed""
No! In science, an assertion requires support from verifiable evidence before it becomes a fact. I've given you detailed explanations as to why your key assertions with reference to climate change are incorrect; you may not like what I've said because it challenges misconceptions on your part that are clearly very deeply ingrained. However, to prove me wrong you need to address not me but the peer-reviewed literature that presents presents the evidence I've described to you.
Also, although some of your ""facts"" may be true, your lack of basic understanding means that you are misapplying them. For example the ""Beer-Lambert Law"" assumes constant concentration across the path length (hence my point about lab-based experiments) and therefore can't be applied to a column of air several miles high where the concentration is gradually falling. Jason Rogers also pointed out that it's actually far more complex than that anyway for atmospheric absorption of CO2.

I'm neither, which is why you and Plumby can't read what I'm saying successfully. Plumby pegged me as a denier in the first post with the word 'entropy'. He and you have tried to view everything I've said through that filter ever since. Every now and again you try the other filter. Neither fit. 
I'm a realist. I say CCS will require a planetary output of energy to make work. Plumby hears CCS is impossible and said ""all impossible and, according to Jason"". Nope, never said that. I said that it was so stupid it burns, but 'impossible' and 'requires planetary output of energy' are two very different things.
I say 'cost 50 billion GBP' and you hear 'will cost 50 billion GBP to construct'. Again, you're not reading, you're filtering. In a discussion of how a country spends its money, the cost to the country is what counts not the cost to the company building the thing you want. If you and your partner are discussing buying a car, and you say ""Well this one costs 20 000 pounds"" and your partner tells you that you're an idiot, the cost of construction of the car is borne by Ford Motor Company and is 5468 pounds and you're a fraud and a fake"", I submit that you'd think your partner had gone barking. 
Try reading what I said, rather than what you think I said because you think I belong to the denial camp, with occasional forays into the alarmist camp. 
I'm not going to bother replying to Plumby again because he's arguing against things I haven't said too. Also, if you want to address things I've actually said, I'll reply to you. I doubt that.

Observations. ""Land & Ocean Temperature Anomaly 1.565C 0.090 (+-) Relative to 1850-1900""http://berkeleyearth.org/temperature-reports/march-2016/
The first goal of the Paris Agreement was to try to limit warming to 1.5 above pre-industrial. Well that's gone, with a reading of 1.565 above 1850-1900.
Second goal was to remain well clear of 2 degrees above pre-industrial. Well 1850-1900 is about 0.2 +/- 0.1 above pre-industrial and so 1.565 +/- 0.09 is 1.575 to 1.955. That's not 'well clear' by any reasonable definition.
The second part that you quoted... The March land temperature was 2.752 +/- 0.162 above 1850-1900. Add in the 0.2 +/- 0.1 and you get a range for the current land temperature of 2.69 to 3.2. The land responds quickly to forcings, the ocean much slower. So the ocean is clearly still lagging and therefore cooling the land below it's final temperature. (note that I'm not talking about the 'at 2100 temperature as used in sensitivity discussions). So we can say with confidence that the final temperature with the *current* atmosphere would be greater than the 2.69-3.2 range. How much greater I don't know. I'm guessing significantly. Beyond that there's the matter of aerosol cooling. It's currently a strong negative forcing, the size of which is debated, but the consensus seems to be condensing in the 1.0-1.2 range. That's inescapable as we either stop now, and bear that warming, or we continue to burn coal and we'll eventually get that warming by adding CO2. So adding that gets us the range of 3.69-4.4 degrees from the current atmosphere minus the current aerosols. Remembering that this range neglects the cooling of the land by the ocean. So that's why the lowest figure in my statement ""near certain catastrophe that 4 to 6 degrees of warming will bring"" is set at '4'. I thought '4' sounded pithier than ""...avoid the near certain catastrophe that some level of warming greater by an amount similar to the current cooling of the land by the ocean, than the range of 3.69-4.4 to 6 degrees of warming will bring"" The ""6 degrees"" assumes in the absence of urgent action some unspecified time and emissions go by before we stop burning coal and the aerosols fall out.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1509929618000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'14534311', u'in_reply_to': u'107794829', u'id': u'107808757', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'jimmww', u'text': u'@paulchevinWhew!

If I cite physical theory, you shout that THIS ISN'T A LABORATORY EXPERIMENT! If I cite data, you shout that that doesn't accord with theory, and besides, other things besides CO2 are at play!
This is getting tedious, and probably unnecessary for the intelligent openminded reader. But I'll pick the low-hanging fruit and point out that Evolution by natural selection is demonstrated by so many disparate facts from so many disparate fields that there literally is no other explanation for the diversity of life except miracles. And we don't believe in those any more.
CO2 controlling climate however - note that you've already agreed that CO2 doesn't control climate - is not only bereft of evidence, but, unlike evolution, there are a myriad of alternative and supplementary reasons for climate change - changes in insolation, or in quality of solar radiation, or changes in cosmic rays, or orbital variations, or precession of axis, or AMO, or PDO, or El Nino, or volcanic activity, or clouds, or... miracles.
The Null Hypothesis for the diversity of life would be... what, that it's unknown? That didn't survive the massive data inflow. The Null Hypothesis for climate change is that a lot of things influence it and different ones at different times, and there's no evident lockstep control. As Dyson pointed out, our understandings are very good at explaining the past and terrible at predicting the future. Feynman told you how science works, but you most unwisely chose to disparage him.
In other words, we can't dial in a nice climate by turning the CO2 control knob.
Your appeal to consensus is amusing. But, hell, it works in sororities.
If you weren't insisting that CO2 controls climate rather than influences it, you wouldn't be in this Trumplike position.

The brochure from clime works has completely changed my mind. You're right, we can continue to burn coal as much as we want and dump the waste into the air. I withdraw all my objections to continued coal burning. All we need is to get the nasty greenies out of the way. No need to supply energy for extraction of diffuse CO2 because I see that the scientists who must be respected, took time out of their busy day to write a great brochure full of exact details, like ""The majority of the energy required to run the direct air capture plant comes from low-grade/waste heat."" so no need to worry about Gibbs and his silly energy of mixing (waaait, was Gibbs a scientist?.... errr never mind). 
It's even being built in 'commercial' levels. So all our problems are over. So to pull our atmospheric CO2 levels back down to safe levels, we just need to remove say twice what we emit. That should get us down to safe levels in 20 years or so. So remove 16 000 million tonnes of carbon a year. That's about 60 000 million tonnes of CO2 every year. Their largest 'commercial' unit removes 5 tonnes a day. So we only need 34 million of them. Thank god for commercial quantities eh.
Oh, while I wrote this Raykalon gave some figures that the scientists must have been too busy sciencing to put in the brochure. 1500 kWh of thermal and 150 kWh of electrical for each tonne of CO2. Ok, so each year we just need 60 000 million times 1500 kWh of thermal. So that's errp, too many millions and billions. I might just change that to reasonable figures. 1.5x10^6 Wh x 6x10^10 comes out at 9x10^16 Wh. Call it 10^17 Wh. Divide by 10^12 to get TWh which is how this is usually expressed. 10^5 TWh per year. Oh, that turns out to be 2/3 of the entire planetary use of *primary* energy (or about equal to the final energy output of the entire world, but since the scientists who took time out from sciencing to write it made it clear that we're only using waste heat, we'll go with the primary rather than final). The maths for the electrical energy is easy, because it's a 10th. So 10^4 TWh. Well world electricity production is 2.4x10^4. So that's only a little under half of the entire planetary output of electricity. 
Then all you have to do is compress it for storage. CO2 is 44 g/mol, so that's 23000 moles per tonne. Times 22.4 (number of litres of gas in a mole at STP) is 515,200 litres.
A Bauer I 28.0-75 compressor compresses 3500 l/min to the required pressure. (that's a very big compressor btw). So it would take 147 minutes to compress that much CO2. It draws 72 kW while doing that, so it would draw 176 kWh. Compressor tech is very mature, and we're not going to see any big improvements on that. 
That's bit more than the separation took. So say 1.2x10^4 TWh/y. Making a total of 2.2x10^4 TWh a year compared to the planetary output of 2.4x10^4.
I think we can call that as near as makes no difference to the entire planetary output of electricity.

In response to me posting two news stories about a report saying HPC may cost 50 billion GBP you said ""No, you said the cost of construction was £50bn which is wrong"" 
Did I? Did I really?
BQENDYup.
I just looked - 
 you said : ""Estimated cost of HInkley Point C is 50 billion GBP. It got the go-ahead in January 2008. It's currently estimated that the start date is going to be 2025. So if we gave the go-ahead today, for something similar, it would cost as much as 20 Tesla Gigafactories. ""
Even your comparison of something ""similar"" betrays a fundamental lack of understanding - Firstly, a Tesla factory is not a source of power, secondly, solar pv has a cf of 10.2% in the UK, thirdly the £50bn your article mentions is a total CFD subsidy over 35 years based on wholesale electricity prices remaining lower than they were when Hinkley was costed.
Why are wholesale electricity prices low?Cheap gas.
What is gas?
Second only to coal as a GHG emitter.
In other words, your method is to install solar Okay, well BEIS give a 2030 price for solar pv as £59-73/MWh https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/566567/BEIS_Electricity_Generation_Cost_Report.pdf
To that we add storage (at circa £200kwh install cost) and gas, at only half the CPO2 as coal.
Not only is your 'solution' vastly more costly for sustainable/dispatchable power, it has a massively higher carbon footprint. - even without all the addons, solar pv is for times as carbon intensive as nuclear - with the add ons, the total CO2 is not much less than unabated gas.
Do you understand that the point is to cut emissions, not simply install renewables and batteries with gas backups and hope the environment isn't affected by the CO2?.Yet you claim utilising CCS to get rid of the CO2 is ""stupid""

Maybe run a few back of the envelope calculations and then you can explain how we can get enough energy to direct capture CO2 from the air (lets assume that you don't scrub *all* the CO2 from the processed air, I'll allow you 100ppm in the exhaust gas
BQENDFirstly this 'question' is really confused.
The level of atmospheric CO₂ ""in the air"" is circa 400ppmFlue gas is considerably higher CO₂ content because CO₂ is a product of combustion so its partial pressure is significantly higher.Also sources like natural gas which have a very high CO₂ content (Google ""partial pressure"" or ""mole fraction"")The same with Cement manufacture which chemically releases CO₂.
So how to build a carbon sink?
Use a sustainable biofuel and attach CCS to the flue gas.
ie.Atmospheric CO₂➯Wood Use the woodchip to produce powerCollect the high partial pressure CO₂ from the flue gas with CCS.Convert that carbon into Concrete.
That's carbon negative power.

The comforting stories that the media and the Guardian in particular have been telling us are counter to everything we know about how the world works.

I wouldn't bother pointing out that despite reducing CO2 output heat continued to rise because it's obvious that decadal changes in emissions don't matter much in the context of the heat content of the oceans. Also it was a reduction in emissions, not a reduction in atmospheric CO2 which was still rising, so what happened should be entirely expected. It's not ""no support for mitigation"".

The more carbon we emit, the faster the permafrost will melt and the bigger the pulse of GHG will be. If we cut emissions *dramatically* right now, we can perhaps have that pulse spread out a bit. The difference between having a stiff whiskey every night for a year, and having 365 stiff whiskeys in one sitting.

I'm sorry, but the work of Dave Burton and Jo Nova (the latter being infamous for misrepresenting the science of climate change) do not constitute peer-reviewed scientific literature and the very fact that you're using such sources rather than reputable ones tells me all I need to know about you!
""you haven't refuted any statement of mine""
I'm going to put my cards on the table here jimmww. I'm a PhD scientist and I can say with good authority that science doesn't work that way! In science, any statement, including yours, has to be supported by VERIFIABLE evidence from a reliable source (ie. one that can be checked). I'm not going to waste my time pointing out the flaws in arbitrary and misleading statements from yourself. However, I will expose the obvious flaws in the rest of your post:
Jason Rogers said this:
""They all neatly side step the fact that the apparent surface (in IR) simply moves higher and higher in the atmosphere (ie, somewhere colder and colder).""
Here's a more complete explanation written by two of the World's top climate scientists:
http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2007/06/a-saturated-gassy-argument/
""So mitigation is futile, you're absolutely right.""
Now you're just being very silly! What I pointed out was that a 30% reduction in human releases does NOT mean that Man has stopped adding CO2 to the atmosphere, so levels will still have been rising, just more slowly. How does this make mitigation futile? As I pointed out, some of the warming during that period was almost certainly due to a small solar forcing...... something we're not seeing now.
""And you say sometimes CO2 is a forcing, and sometimes it's not""
Again, you're just being very silly! CO2 acts as a forcing when its concentration in the atmosphere rises. Yes, you've pointed out that CO2 could not have been responsible for some previous warming periods, but if you can't grasp the simple concept that the present situation is very different and has a different cause (ie. CO2) then you shouldn't be trying to pretend that you have anything constructive to contribute to this discussion.
""Now about that causation question... ante hoc ergo propter hoc won't work, as we noted before. Did you study causation as part of your degree?""
Another very silly comment (and please don't try to patronise me)! Self-evidently, the scientific basis for the ""causation"" dates back over 150 years to the work of Tyndall! If you want a more detailed explanation of the scientific basis I suggest that you read this potted history by a top climate scientist:
https://history.aip.org/climate/summary.htm
""So you agree that if 100 parts of CO2 are added annually, 96 are of non-human origin and 4 from us. And you say that it's only our 4 that are responsible for the increasing levels.""
Yet again you demonstrate your ignorance. The point is that the natural carbon cycle is in balance, which is why (as you have kept pointing out without understanding it) CO2 levels remained fairly stable throughout most of the holocene. The point, which OUGHT to be obvious even to you, is that anthropogenic emissions are adding more that the natural carbon cycle cannot absorb, hence the reason why CO2 levels have been rising steadily since the start of the industrial revolution. It's actually very simple if you can be bothered to THINK about it.', u'recommendation_count': u'4', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1509698789000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'a small solar forcing', u'effect': u""as i pointed out some of the warming during that period was almost certainly something we 're not seeing now""}], u'author_id': u'16473314', u'in_reply_to': u'107707877', u'id': u'107711295', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'ID2310987', u'text': u'BQSTART
So now you clearly agree that my statement is correct, so we can agree that CO2 forcing is sometimes operative and sometimes not, depending on a multitude of other factors, and cannot be considered to be in control. From which it follows, as the night the day, that our pitiful attempts to control CO2 levels in the air are doomed to have no predictable effect whatsoever.

No, the problem here is that you don't have sufficient eye for detail; it is actually YOUR arguments that rely on cherry-picks. In the periods before the Holocene, other factors, which I've already detailed, impacted greatly on CO2 concentrations.
""I am under no obligation to do your work for you. If it's not refuted, it stands.""
The onus is on YOU to provide evidence to support your claim; without verifiable evidence it is an assertion and is NOT science.... period!
""Please state in words what it is you think the video demonstrates. Looks pretty handwavy to me""
There you have your problem in two words (my bold). The video is self-explanatory and links back to the papers it is based on. It explains that the only way ""snowball Earth"" could have ended was by a gradual accumulation of CO2 over millennia with no weathering to remove it. The truth is that you're totally incapable of addressing the evidence presented, so you're looking for an excuse to disqualify it!
""it is possible to get periods of cooling while CO2 is rising if a different forcing, acting in the opposite direction, is operating at the same time."" Excellent. Now you've got it. CO2 is not in control.""
I have to confess that I'm astonished by your stupidity here! It's actually very simple. CO2 is applying a forcing which causes a long term warming trend. However, other factors apply TEMPORARY cooling effects which TEMPORARILY counteract the warming effect of CO2; this does NOT mean the CO2 forcing has gone away.
""Ah, the final revelation. You're a fraud, and your science degree is in sociology.""
Incorrect! The problem here is your own massive misconceptions about the way science really works. I've already told you my area of study and the fact that I have a science-based PhD, so your comment is crass.
""The Null Hypothesis is the starting point for any scientific investigation and must be negated by the weight of observation and experiment.""
Correct, but a theory is based on the findings of multiple independent studies. For example, there is no single experiment that can be done to formally PROVE the theory of evolution, let alone disprove a null hypothesis; rather, the strong consensus is based on an overwhelming preponderance of evidence from different sources, all of which is consistent with the theory, while no rival theory comes close to being able to explain all observations.
""Your posh friend is charming and complacent, excellent attributes for a charlatan, but just another snake oil salesman. I'm reminded of Hillary at the committee interrogation.""
This is just another frankly pathetic attempt to disqualify something that challenges your misconceptions!

You're very fond of accusing people of straw man arguments.

Well yes, I always try to get things right, whereas your reply indicates that you're only thinking within the constraints of your misconceptions.
""You're oblivious to the fact that it DIDN'T have any effect.""
No, the problem here is that YOU are oblivious to the fact that there were several different processes affecting temperature at the same time which may mask or enhance one another, meaning that you can't use the data to draw conclusions about just one. This is the key reason why science has to use a very different approach when studying the science of the real world than lab-based scientists employ.

As Jason Rogers and myself have explained to you more than once, your argument about ""50% GHE at 20 ppm"" is IRRELEVANT; this is NOT a laboratory experiment! The point you're missing is that as the concentration of CO2 rises, it is doing so right across the full height of the atmosphere, so even though absorption of IR will indeed be saturated in the lower layers of the atmosphere, further up, a point will be reached where the concentration is still in the range where adding more will absorb more IR. This is why the radiation absorption for CO2 with concentration in the atmosphere exhibits a LOGARITHMIC relationship rather than the exponential decay you assert:

And ""even if human production of CO2 fell by 30% that does NOT necessarily mean that CO2 levels stopped rising"" is correct. Thank you. So mitigation is futile, you're absolutely right.
And you say sometimes CO2 is a forcing, and sometimes it's not, for reasons that only you are privy to. So, sometimes the physics works, and sometimes it doesn't. Just like magic.
And ""global temperature actually correlates very well with CO2 over the past 500 million years."" Yes indeed. CO2 and global temperature are correlated in the same way as sex and marriage. Now about that causation question... ante hoc ergo propter hoc won't work, as we noted before. Did you study causation as part of your degree?

Oh dear! You use the term triatomic as though to blind me with ""science""! Please take a look at the formula for calculating the forcing for CO2. I can't easily type it here but it is clearly presented here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_forcing
It includes TWO values for CO2 concentration, one being the present concentration and one being the ""reference concentration"" - the latter is the concentration that the gas started at. Have you never stopped to ask yourself why the forcing for CO2 is quoted as 3.7 W/m2 for a doubling of CO2?
Here's a figure from the EPA:
https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-climate-forcing
I quote from the legend: ""This figure shows the amount of radiative forcing caused by various greenhouse gases, based on the change in concentration of these gases in the Earth’s atmosphere since 1750. Radiative forcing is calculated in watts per square meter, which represents the size of the energy imbalance in the atmosphere.', u'recommendation_count': u'5', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1509786337000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'ghg molecules', u'effect': u'the back radiation'}, {u'cause': u'various greenhouse gases', u'effect': u'radiative forcing'}], u'author_id': u'16473314', u'in_reply_to': u'107745687', u'id': u'107750138', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'jimmww', u'text': u'I see you don't get sarcasm.

There is one reason and one reason only why I take the trouble to argue with people such as yourself. Science fits together neatly, a lot like a jigsaw. However, for someone such as yourself, whose entire position is based on fallacies and misconceptions, sooner or later you will always make claims that are mutually exclusive. In fact, you did so very early on in our exchanges, if only you had known it. I suspect that others have gradually dropped out of this exchange because they can see that you've already undermined your own arguments countless times and made yourself look foolish, which means you're not worth bothering with. Arguing the toss with me might make you feel better but your attitude and fallacies will not win you any points with anyone who is still bothering to read this.
However, your other problem is that you THINK you know a lot when you clearly don't - a little knowledge of science is actually more dangerous than no knowledge at all because the devil is always in the detail. I've been following the evolving science in this area ever since I first learned about it as part of my degree almost 40 years ago and in 1982, just a year after I qualified, the scientists at Exxon Mobil, the world's largest oil company, sent a detailed report to the company's board that made predictions strikingly similar to the ones the IPCC make today. In short, this science is NOT in doubt, which is why there is such a strong consensus and why pretty well every major science academy has also endorsed it.

You're repeating the same straw man again. I have never said that CO2 ""controls"" climate. What I have said is that a rise in CO2 concentration in the atmosphere exerts a radiative forcing: THAT is what the theory says.

With this latest post you are just digging yourself in ever deeper. Your confidence and arrogance are actually your weaknesses and although you have accused me more than once of using straw man arguments, your latest post is almost entirely constructed of them! On top of that, you are now ""borrowing"" comments from one point I've made and trying to apply them to others they never applied to - what a load of tosh you write!
""If I cite physical theory"", you shout that THIS ISN'T A LABORATORY EXPERIMENT!
First of all, I tend to use capitals to emphasize something - it's not about shouting! Second, just to be clear (as context is crucial), my comment about lab-based experiments was in response to your fixation with ""50% GHE at 20 ppm"". First of all, I have yet to see a proper peer-reviewed reference from you for this, but even if it's correct it CERTAINLY isn't ""physical theory"" - it is, at best, an observation. My reference to laboratory experiments relates to the fact that while you might well find absorption of IR by CO2 quickly becomes saturated in a tube or tank in a laboratory, this bears little relation to the situation in an atmosphere several miles deep! The point Jason Rogers and myself have made repeatedly is correct and you are completely wrong if you imagine that adding more CO2 to the atmosphere will have a negligible effect.
""If I cite data, you shout that that doesn't accord with theory, and besides, other things besides CO2 are at play!""
This IS an example of a straw man! Greenhouse theory (or whatever else you may choose to call it) does NOT state that global temperatures will always rise in response to a rise in CO2 concentration. It actually states that the rise in CO2 levels will have a warming EFFECT (ie. a forcing). However, it should be self-evident to anyone who has a proper understanding of the science that if other forcings (either positive or negative) are active at the same time, the response of the climate will be the net effect of all of them. The problem here is NOT what I'm telling you but rather your ridiculously simplistic understanding of the science.
""Evolution by natural selection is demonstrated by so many disparate facts from so many disparate fields that there literally is no other explanation for the diversity of life except miracles.""
.... and the scientific consensus in favour of human-induced climate change, which you find inconvenient, has been reached for the same reason! It is just in your mind that the evidence isn't there, because it challenges too many of your misconceptions.
""note that you've already agreed that CO2 doesn't control climate""
This is another straw man! A number of different factors can act as forcings and CO2 is one of them. If you can't grasp this there's no hope for you at all! You're just being very, very silly! ""changes in insolation, or in quality of solar radiation, or changes in cosmic rays, or orbital variations, or precession of axis, or AMO, or PDO, or El Nino, or volcanic activity, or clouds...""
You're just repeating the same tosh as before here. There is a wealth of peer-reviewed scientific literature available that explains why none of the things on your list can explain the present warming trend. For the record, it has yet to be confirmed that cosmic rays can even seed clouds, let alone control climate.... and even if they can, cosmic ray flux has been going in the wrong direction for them to be responsible. Solar insolation has been falling, if anything over the past few decades, while temperatures have been rising. The Milankovitch can also be excluded as they are, if anything, having a slight cooling effect. Finally, although ocean cycles can have a major effect on atmospheric temperatures in the short term, they cannot drive a long term upward (or downward trend) in the longer term - it would defy the law of conservation of energy. So, contrary to your beliefs, scientists have thought about all of these things and excluded them - that's their job, for goodness sake!
""The Null Hypothesis for climate change is that a lot of things influence it and different ones at different times, and there's no evident lockstep.""
I've already explained above why your understanding of the theory of climate change is far too simplistic. There is no null hypothesis, as it is a theory based on observations and facts. Just for the record, here is an excellent article that explains the difference between a hypothesis and a theory:

""Please reply to ""so the next doubling will yield 1.3% of the total greenhouse effect of CO2 which itself is only 20% or so of the total, and which is of course only one of the many physical inputs to climate change.""""
If you can supply a link to a peer-reviewed paper that states this I will happily read it and address your point. Otherwise I could be forgiven for thinking that it is just something you've plucked out of the air. After all, the principal reason why climate scientists state climate sensitivity in terms of so many degrees of warming for a doubling of CO2 is that they expect it to remain broadly the same for each successive doubling of concentration.
""And then consider the years 1929-1931, when human production of CO2 declined by 30%, and temps kept rising to 1940.""
You state these figures but never provide the links to confirm them. However, even if human production of CO2 fell by 30% that does NOT necessarily mean that CO2 levels stopped rising (the devil is always in the detail). More to the point, though, if you had actually bothered to check the scientific literature you would know that during the first half of the 20th century solar activity was still rising and the IPCC openly acknowledges that this accounted for some of the warming during that period. Then, of course, there is also the not-so-small matter of ""thermal inertia"" which means that a lot of the warming effect from any forcing actually takes a long time to work its way through the system.... but why would someone such as yourself, who clearly isn't interested in REAL science, bother about such details?!
""And I did address Rogers.....""
No! Specifically, you addressed what I am more than happy to acknowledge was a generalisation on his part about ""skeptical"" websites. You most certainly did NOT address the technical point he made explaining why your own argument is fatally flawed.
""I neglected to mention that the only known factor capable of causing the current...er, warming... was missing in the emergence from the LGM, the Younger Dryas, the Holocene Optimum... oh, but you've seen all these before and in proper pious devotion ignored them completely as being inconsistent with The Faith.""
No! CO2 wasn't a forcing during the periods you mention, but I've already explained why that is irrelevant to the current situation. I can only conclude that you are either being deliberately obtuse or that you have no understanding of the science at all!
""From ancient data to the most recent, there's nothing to suggest that CO2 is in control of climate change, certainly not at this level and this rate of change.""
Incorrect! Now you have finally confirmed my fear that you didn't bother to watch the videos I linked to. If you had done so you would know that your statement is false. Probably the best single reference to check is one by Royer et al, which confirmed that once the gradual increase in solar intensity over time is taken into account, global temperature actually correlates very well with CO2 over the past 500 million years. Better still, just go and watch the videos and then you'll hopefully stop making the same mistake again!
""Your statements are completely unsupported by historical fact, and you can't even fathom it. For shame!""
My statements are supported by the peer-reviewed scientific literature; yours are just pure fiction!
""And we contribute 4% of the CO2 added annually.""
I studied the carbon cycle as part of my degree. Your claim is best described as a ""cherry-pick"" in that it misleads by only telling part of the story - a lot like politicians abusing statistics!
The natural carbon cycle is more or less in balance, as the CO2 released due to natural processes such as decay and respiration is balanced by the uptake of CO2 by plants during photosynthesis. So although anthropogenic emissions may only be a small proportion of total emissions of CO2, they constitute the vast majority of the NET increase in CO2.', u'recommendation_count': u'3', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1509670777000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'natural processes such as decay and respiration', u'effect': u'as the co2 released'}], u'author_id': u'16473314', u'in_reply_to': u'107698702', u'id': u'107703988', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, ...]",1556123498102.0,1518629663000,1509357653000,Dana Nuccitelli: Global carbon pollution appears to be close to peaking,False,N,"[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions, https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement, https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-21-un-climate-change-conference-paris, https://www.theguardian.com/environment/global-climate-talks, https://www.theguardian.com/environment/windpower, https://www.theguardian.com/environment/solarpower, https://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog]",Dana Nuccitelli: Global carbon pollution appears to be close to peaking,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b984da057b9b0b0d349bede259527145af8fddd/0_16_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=36b8b8c258e678d0f6685b42000f4f70,New data gives hope for meeting the Paris climate targets | Dana Nuccitelli,article,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/oct/30/new-data-gives-hope-for-meeting-the-paris-climate-targets,0,"Over the past half-century, growth in the global economy and carbon pollution have been tied together. When the global economy has been strong, we’ve consumed more energy, which has translated into burning more fossil fuels and releasing more carbon pollution. But over the past four years, economic growth and carbon dioxide emissions have been decoupled. The global economy has continued to grow, while data from the EU Joint Research Centre shows carbon pollution has held fairly steady.
China’s shift away from coal to clean energy has been largely responsible for this decoupling. Due to its large population (1.4 billion) – more than four times that of the USA (323 million) and nearly triple the EU (510 million) – and rapid growth in its economy and coal power supply, China has become the world’s largest net carbon polluter (though still less than half America’s per-person carbon emissions, and on par with those of Europeans). But as with the global total, China’s carbon pollution has flattened out since 2013.
That’s especially remarkable because it puts China about 15 years ahead of schedule. In an agreement with President Obama ahead of the Paris international climate negotiations, Chinese President Xi Jingping pledged that China’s carbon emissions would peak by 2030. Republican Party leaders grossly distorted this agreement at the time, with Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell claiming:
As I read the agreement it requires the Chinese to do nothing at all for 16 years while these carbon emissions regulations are creating havoc in my state and around the country
As the chart above shows, Chinese carbon emissions tripled between 1999 and 2013. To slow that rate of growth to zero as the Chinese economy continues to grow would require a dramatic shift in the country’s energy supply. But that’s exactly what’s happened, with the Chinese government cancelling over 100 planned new coal power plants earlier this year. Chinese coal consumption has in fact fallen since 2013. And China and the EU have pledged to strengthen their efforts to cut carbon pollution.
In 2016, American carbon pollution fell to below 1993 levels. The emissions decline began around 2008, which is also when natural gas, solar, and wind energy began rapidly replacing coal in the power grid.
The Trump administration has done everything in its power to reverse that trend. It began the withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement and the process to repeal the Clean Power Plan, has begun censoring EPA climate scientists and deleting climate change information from government websites, and proposed to prop up the dirty, failing coal industry with taxpayer-funded subsidies.
And yet, while these steps can slow the decline in American carbon pollution, the transition from coal to clean energy will nevertheless persist. Coal simply can no longer compete with cheaper, cleaner sources of energy, and the next American president can quickly reverse many of the Trump administration’s anti-climate orders.
In the meantime, many cities, states, and businesses have declared that they “will continue to support climate action to meet the Paris Agreement.” California has led the way, having passed climate legislation including the implementation of a carbon cap and trade system over a decade ago. The state’s economy has grown rapidly as its carbon pollution has fallen. California now gets over 25% of its electricity from renewables (another 10% from hydroelectric), and just 4% from coal.
To have a realistic chance of meeting the Paris climate target and avoiding 2°C global warming above pre-industrial temperatures, global carbon pollution likely needs to peak by 2020. That goal remains within reach, as we now appear very close to peak global carbon emissions.
That’s just a start – we still need a rapid decline in carbon after we reach the peak – but with the flood of bad climate news over the past year, it’s nice to see that we still have hope to prevent the worst climate change consequences.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/oct/30/new-data-gives-hope-for-meeting-the-paris-climate-targets

That's a common misconception about engineering. It has plenty of shades of grey. Just as many as social science. We tend to concentrate on the hard answers because they ""feel"" nicer. 
There are many, many different designs of bridges that do not fall down. Some of them are better than others for reasons other than whether they fall down or not and often worse as well for different reasons again. Lane widths would be an example. Making them wider allows people to feel more comfortable at higher speeds, but this isn't necessarily ""better"" since when they do crash they are more likely to result in fatalities. You are balancing fatalities against time and there isn't a ""correct"" answer on where that balance should be.
BQEND
You've posted a rebuttal to a point I explicitly didn't make.
I stated that there were often many different solutions to a given problem. But I also stated that any solution which is adopted either is a correct solution or a failing solution. You can design your bridge any way you like from a Roman stone and mortar arch bridge to a very modern cable-stayed bridge but if it falls down shortly after erection, either that design was either inappropriate to the problem, that design was defective, or it was incorrectly constructed (which is somewhat but not entirely orthogonal to its design).
Various designs may have varying attributes: cost, carrying capacity, design lifetime, aesthetics, etc., but they all either stand or fall. And that is a ""hard"" (binary, black-or-white) answer.

Clearly culture and education play a << huge >> role.
BQEND
Genetics also plays a huge role. Look at the split by race Asian, White, Hispanic and Black american. How come Asians out perform Whites in academia? 
Yes. The men's hundred meter lineup at the Olympics is predominantly black. Swimming is predominantly white, (that's true too of the US Olympic team - so it isn't shortage of facilities). There's an excess of Chinese maths professors and a shortage of Chinese premier league football players.
If training and practice can only make 10% difference to your innate natural maximum attainment it won't be enough. 26% of physics Nobel prizes have gone to Jews, 25% of Fields Medal winners, 25% of ACM Turing Award winners and 9 out of the 19 world chess champions. The important point is that it's not all Jews it's disproportionately to Ashkenazi Jews rather than Sephardi Jews or Mizrahi Jews, yet they make up only about 2% of the US population.
The disproportionate representation of Ashkenazi Jews in academia also occurs in Israel (despite the culture being the same). Also note that the Ashkenazi exclusively had the white collar job of money lender for over a 1000 years. Plenty of genealogical records of the time show successful money lenders had more children - the link between intelligence and genetics is hard to ignore.
'Equal' means equal rights in law, it means equal opportunity. It does not mean equal outcome - outcome is determined mostly by genetics, the difference you can make is tiny by comparison, get over it.

When I graduated as an engineer (male) I nearly left the profession because most of the senior engineers I came across were extremely boring people who often took the position of waiting around for ‘interesting’ projects from their business masters. I stayed in engineering but forged my own path that saw me work in fields as diverse as manned space flight and technical journalism and on reflection that path was the correct way to go
Engineers being boring is the main reason people of whatever gender don’t go into engineering. Fortunately there are far more interesting opportunities for engineers, young and old, than when I started and now talented people don’t have to wait years for their betters to give them something half way interesting to do. 
I think a lot of people who take up engineering would be happier doing something very boring like actuarial forecasting or sports commentating and I now try and persuade early career engineers who have some spark in them to go into areas such as energy or aerospace or even wider while seeking to dissuade them from the financial sector.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1509224235000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'most of the senior engineers i came across were extremely boring people who often took the position of waiting around for \u2018 interesting \u2019 projects from their business masters', u'effect': u'i nearly left the profession'}], u'author_id': u'1157519', u'in_reply_to': u'107429580', u'id': u'107469506', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'jjc100', u'text': u'Oooh, touchy!', u'recommendation_count': u'2', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1509223328000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'1157519', u'in_reply_to': u'107465773', u'id': u'107468933', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Mary Anne Holmes', u'text': u'Look at how much better Japanese girls are at math compared to American boys.

My guess for the UK would be that it was down to A levels. The first 'A' in computer science was in 1974 if I recall correctly. Before that time if you wanted to do computer science at university, it was easy to get in. If you failed A level maths by not getting good enough grades, the computer science dept welcomed you. That's the route by which most students got into computer science. That remained the case until increased popularity caused them to slowly raise entry requirements.

It's not counted as anything as it doesn't say who created it. Clascal is not counted either and the technical author of the manual doesn't count. Susan Keohan was in the documentation group. The Clascal Compiler was designed by Larry Tesler, Chris Franklin and Larry Rosenstein. Clascal Compiler extensions were by Chris Franklin, later Ira Rubin and Al Hoffman.

It has plenty of shades of grey. Just as many as social science. We tend to concentrate on the hard answers because they ""feel"" nicer.
There are many, many different designs of bridges that do not fall down. Some of them are better than others for reasons other than whether they fall down or not and often worse as well for different reasons again. Lane widths would be an example. Making them wider allows people to feel more comfortable at higher speeds, but this isn't necessarily ""better"" since when they do crash they are more likely to result in fatalities. You are balancing fatalities against time and there isn't a ""correct"" answer on where that balance should be.
We make tradeoffs all the time. Lots of decisions we make in engineering increase one good thing while increasing another bad thing. Or increase a good thing while decreasing a different good thing. And these things aren't always comparable using a common unit, such as fatalities and time.
In software engineering, we often give very little thought to the interface that the software we write presents to the user. In fact, we often don't even consider that to be part of software engineering at all and hire people with a different job title to do that part, such as Graphic Designer or at better places, UX Designer. And we usually pay these people less than Software Engineers because their jobs are seen as being not as important. Yet I can find you countless examples of cases where a misunderstanding of how a medical device works has caused a death. Probably more than cases where a bug in the software inside the device caused a death. But the use and mis-use of our software is part of the discipline of software engineering. We just ignore that part because it's difficult to measure and doesn't always have firm answers.
Another example would be choosing a language to write your next project in. There are a bunch of languages that can be rejected outright as being ""wrong"" but the decision among the handful of popular languages that are easy to hire for is usually made by which one the decision maker is most comfortable with, not any ""hard"" verifiable calculation on which language is correct. Even years later when the project has failed, it's rarely possible to say whether the language choice was right or wrong.

For instance, when you counted Smalltalk-76, did you count that as unknown because the page only lists the company Xerox PARC or as 1 woman and 4 men because that's the team listed on the Smalltalk page or some other makeup such as 1 man because the leader of the team was male or 1 woman because there was at least one woman on the team or some other estimated number because the team was larger than 5 people but only 5 are named?
For Clascal did you count that as unknown because only Apple Computer Inc is listed on that page or female because Susan Keohan was listed as the author of the reference book on the language?
How many of these languages had female contributors who are not listed because ""woman aren't as assertive as men""? If there is a bias that causes women to not be listed even when they contributed, how would your methodology detect this?
This page says there are thousands of programming languages which makes the other list of 712 a small subset, possibly a biased one. Nearly all of the languages on this page are not listed in that other chronological page, but one is.
Regardless of the flaws in your methodology, is there a trend in however you are counting the ratio of women in designing programming languages? Is the ratio the same for each decade listed or is it somewhat stronger in the '50s than in the 2000s? Are we seeing a change in the number of women in tech?

Oh no you don't! I never saw one single peer reviewed paper predicting global cooling in the 70s. NOT ONE! Fortunately a very detailed search of peer reviewed scientific literature has been done. From 1965 to 1979 there were 42 papers that predicted warming, 7 predicted cooling and 19 predicted no change. The media however universally predicted a catastrophic ice age. The lesson here is don't let media hysteria form your scientific opinion. Science is done by scientist not journalists, sometimes the later are more interested in sensation than the truth. In the case of the Guardian - more interested in political correctness than truth.

I actually mostly agree with this version of your point.
A lot of what James Damore wrote was wrong, or at the very least extremely misguided (/ naive ?), but if your initial response includes ""The 'manifesto' was 10 pages of things he believed without ANY actual evidence ..."" then you should not be surprised when people call you out on that particular claim.
You should not just assume that ""Someone is calling me out on point X"" = ""That person must therefore agree with absolutely everything that James Damore wrote in his 'Google Memo', in exactly the same way that I have decided he 'really meant' when he wrote those things"".

I'm sure we all remember the papers from the '70s that said we were headed for an ice age. There were other papers at the same time in equally respected journals suggesting we were on a warming trend. Andrew Wakefield had a paper published in the Lancet that wasn't retracted until 12 years later which has indirectly caused hundreds of deaths and hundreds of thousands of illnesses. Peer review is the best we have, but it is not a silver bullet.
Even when a paper is 100% accurate and true, it's still possible for lay people to misunderstand the paper or extrapolate unrealistic conclusions for the future from it, especially otherwise smart people with no experience in the field in question. We see people like Anthony Watts, Stephen Milloy, David Rose and James Delingpole doing this all the time with climate papers.

One of the silliest and most offensive claims he made was that in order to hire more women, Google would have to lower its standards. There were implicit assumptions in that claim that were not based on any cited paper or verifiable facts.For instace, this could only be true if Google had a method of ordering all possible candidates with 100% accuracy from most capable to least capable. Despite the considerable effort they have put into improving their hiring practices, Google still can't do this. They regularly reject people who are highly capable and less frequently hire people who are not good enough. (They specifically say that their process is biased against bad hires. They would rather reject a good candidate than hire a bad one.) Their interview process merely ranks candidates into two buckets: good enough and not good enough.It is also only true if Google has already hired all of the possible female candidates in the good enough bucket. If Google needs to hire a thousand new engineers this year and there is a field of 20,000 candidates above their hiring threshold, 10% of whom are female, Google could choose to hire only female engineers for two whole years without lowering their standards at all. It's possible that all 2,000 female engineers would actually be ranked before all the males within that pool of 20,000, but we have no way of knowing that and neither do Google.All that claim of Damore's achieved was belittling and alienating the existing female tech hires at Google.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1509094347000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'which', u'effect': u'hundreds of deaths and hundreds of thousands of illnesses'}], u'author_id': u'16543131', u'in_reply_to': u'107380598', u'id': u'107405896', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'AntonZ', u'text': u'BQSTART

That would be rather difficult because it wasn't - the Guardian makes up the most outrageous lies about this. In 1967, when Cosmo’s “The Computer Girls” article ran, 11 percent of computer science majors were women. In the late 1970s, the percentage of women in the field approached and exceeded the same figure we are applauding today: 25 percent. The portion of women earning computer science degrees continued to rise steadily, reaching its peak — 37 percent — in 1984. Then, over the next two decades, women left computer science in droves — just as their numbers were increasing steadily across all other science, technology, engineering, and math fields. By 2006, the portion of women in computer science had dropped to 20 percent. - Washington Post.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1509117541000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u""it was n't"", u'effect': u'that would be rather difficult'}], u'author_id': u'4199046', u'in_reply_to': u'107406563', u'id': u'107423355', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'DavidKeech', u'text': u'This is what people in the tech industry call their ""supply chain problem"". The gender disparity in tech has existed for long enough that children deciding in the 90s whether they prefered biology or physics knew that working with computers meant working in a male dominated environment, so they didn't choose computers. From that, the assumption probably grew that men are good with computers and women are not which, regardless of whether it's true or not, leads women to choose other careers. The stereotypical computer geek in all popular culture is a man, not a woman, and there are very few counterexamples.
It sounds like a similar thing is happening in your wife's industry. Not that women and men are fundamentally, biologically different but that society has conditioned them from the moment they understand human speech that certain roles are ""for women"" and certain roles are ""for men"".
Most recruiters and CEOs throw up their hands in despair at this problem. Google can only manage to hire 20% of their tech workforce as women and they cite the lack of women applying as the reason for that. To make a difference here you need to improve the perception of your industry among the children of today, then wait 10 to 20 years.
A short term solution might be to offer men more, and make it public that you are doing this so that more will apply. You will get more of the currently available supply of men in this industry and as more people copy your strategy, the industry itself will become more attractive to men, which will mean in 20 years time there will be more men applying and you can go back to paying them the same as women.

I took the IAT on Gender and Science here. I wasn't actually surprised that I seem to have a slight to moderate 'unconscious' association of men and science (might be the fact I'm reading a book about early 20th century physics at the moment), despite believing this is all culturally determined. The stats in general there show a strong bias in most people.
So while that's the case, a list like Prof Abraham provides is good at raising the profile of women who are doing pioneering and crucial work in physics, mathematics, biology, oceanography and science communication.

One more comment about ""egalitarian"" societies like the Nordic countries. They are engaging in the necessary efforts to equalize gender roles. Their efforts are not yet complete. Pushing back against millennia of inequality takes more than 40 years.
BQEND
Kristin Mile the Equal Opportunities Commissioner for Norway is quite clear, all the measure they have taken to address inequality have made no difference ""You get a one ot two year effect and then it falls again"". She is quite adamant that it is not discrimination, nor is it a lack of academic ability. The answer is obvious when you ask people; women prefer jobs which involve interaction with other people, men prefer jobs involving interaction with things or systems, with only 10%-20% going against that general trend.
Camilla Schreiner, studied trend of girls’ technical education in 20 countries from Uganda to Norway and found that Girls in less egalitarian countries were more interested in technical education. Camilla had taken a survey with a set of 108 questions and the she didn’t find any equality in job interests in most egalitarian nations. In fact, she found the reverse, the more modern a country was, more was the divide in job selection.
It even has a name 'The Norwegian Gender Equality Paradox'. This is exactly what you would expect if women in advanced societies are free to choose, they will choose areas involving interaction with people, because you are giving women's psychology freedom to choose its own path.

Nothing. 
That’s the short answer, but it deserves some commentary. In early August, a young Google computer engineer made lots of news in the US when he penned a manifesto that many described as sexist and which led to his firing. The memo was written as a backlash against efforts to improve diversity in the workplace. However, the arguments articulated by the manifesto were rightly described as offensive by Google executives. 
The explosive part in the memo involved comments about how biological differences explain the paucity of women in technology and leadership fields. While there are certainly both physical and mental differences between men and women, the comments about both genders are, in my opinion, misguided and offensive.
This article is not going to focus much on the content of this so-called manifesto. It also won’t focus on the author of this document, except to question the basis for how a very young engineer has the experience, training, or education to make such broad-brush generalizations. I mean, has he for instance managed scores of male and female engineers and been able to assess their quality of work and intellectual capacity? I doubt it. Has he studied this in any detail or published on the topic? I doubt it.
I found this manifesto so ironic because I give a lot of thought to differences between male and female scientists. I am not an expert in the area, certainly not in evolutionary biology. But I am a Full Professor with many years of instructing both undergraduate and graduate students in engineering. I am often struck by how small the female population is in my discipline (perhaps 20%), yet it is higher in other technical fields (biology, mathematics, chemistry, etc.). I am also impressed by how well female students do in technical courses and degree programs. I note a statistically significant performance gap between male and female students in courses; females consistently outperform their male peers.
I also have had the fortune to be a consultant for many different engineering companies from industries such as biomedical, aerospace, manufacturing, clean energy and other fields. In my work, I notice that women team members easily hold their own with male co-workers. I also believe (but I have no evidence) that women think differently than men. 
In my anecdotal experience, women are able to consider problems from a wider range of perspectives. This perspective has real value to design teams, it encourages companies to pay more for female employees (yes, our female engineering graduates tend to make more than their male counterparts). Diverse teams make effective teams. That includes gender diversity. So, in my 15 or so years as a professor, and in my perhaps 50 consulting positions, I have lived an experience very different from the one this young Google engineer articulated.
With all that said, I thought this event provided an excellent opportunity to showcase some female scientists who are either world-known or becoming world-known in the field of climate science. So, here are some short bios of brilliant women climate scientists.
Magdalena A. Balmaseda has been working at ECMWF since 1995. She currently leads the Earth System Predictability Section in the Research Department. 
Dr. Balmaseda has developed her career by helping us understand weather and climate. She has contributed to building bridges between the climate and weather sciences. Her expertise in ocean modelling in general, and in El Niño in particular, greatly contributed to ECMWF’s first steps in seasonal forecasting back in 1995. Now seasonal forecasts are one of the pillars of the EU Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), and the ocean is included in all ECMWF probabilistic forecasting systems, contributing the provision of forecasts of atmospheric conditions from days to months and seasons ahead. 
Equally important have been her contributions to the role of the ocean in a warming climate. The apparent slowing of the global rise in surface temperature in the first decade of the 21st century – the so-called “hiatus” – had puzzled the scientific community. In 2013 Dr. Balmaseda together with other colleagues demonstrated that a fair amount of energy trapped in the Earth system had actually been absorbed by deep ocean waters. This outcome was only possible thanks to a combination of information from ocean models, atmospheric winds, and ocean observations, using similar combination techniques as those employed for weather forecasting. 
Karina von Schuckmann is an oceanographer working in France at Mercator Ocean. She leads the ocean climate monitoring activities of the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service, which includes the development of a regular Ocean State Report with more than 100 authors. She is also a lead author of the upcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special report on ocean and cryosphere.
Her research is focused on the ocean’s role in the Earth energy budget. This means she studies how much heat is stored in and how it flows throughout the ocean waters. Her studies particularly highlight the unique importance of measuring the global ocean as its global heat storage is the most fundamental metric defining the status of global climate change and expectations for continued global warming. With this topic she is also playing a leading role on international scientific collaborations under the framework of the World Climate Research Program.
Dr. von Schuckmann’s résumé reads like a seasoned superstar’s; she has worked at some of the best research labs in France, the USA, Germany. I was so surprised to find she only recently received her PhD (in 2006). I want to know how she has become a leader in the field so quickly. I guess talent will do that. Her dissertation topic was on ocean climate variability in the tropical Atlantic Ocean. 
Dr Jessica Conroy is a faculty member at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign. She holds a dual appointment in the departments of Geology and Plant Biology. Another young and upcoming research scientist, she has been at the forefront of connecting modern climate observations and climate model outputs with long-past climate measurements (paleoclimate data). Her work has helped improve our understanding of past Earth climate. 
In addition, she has developed long paleoclimate records from regions that are very sensitive to climate change. For instance, remote islands across the tropical Pacific and the Tibetan Plateau. She goes where few scientists have gone to make measurements that even fewer can.
Part of her work relies upon lake sediment samples and on the use of stable isotopes (oxygen and hydrogen) to give clues about what past climate was like. Not only does this give information about past temperatures but these data also, perhaps more importantly, tell us what the water cycle was like in the past. She was recently selected as a National Academy of Sciences Kavli Fellow. 
Dr. Myhre is skilled in climate science as well as climate communication. Her area of research is in paleoceanography (the study of past climate and biology through the oceans). Her research requires her team to gather sediment cores from the seafloor, to analyze the chemical compositions and the shells of creatures that are contained within such cores, or to observe deep sea ecosystem using remotely operated submersibles. Her publications have appeared in some of the most prestigious scientific journals.
She may become even better known, however, for her work not only communicating about climate science to the general public but in training other scientists to be communicators. We scientists are often good at talking amongst ourselves, but we are less skilled at explaining why our research is important and how society can use our research to make informed decisions. This is where Dr. Myhre shines. She is a board member of the organization 500 Women Scientists and the Center for Women and Democracy, and is an uncompromising advocate for women’s leadership in science and society.
World-renowned expert in infectious diseases and health, Dr. Colwell has degrees in bacteriology, genetics, and oceanography; her pioneering use of computational tools and DNA sequencing helped lay the foundation for the bioinformatics revolution. This unique background has allowed her to make connections across these disciplines and enhance our understanding of water availability, disease, safe drinking water, and the effects of climate change on waterborne pathogens. 
Dr. Colwell has won numerous national and international awards, such as the 2006 National Medal of Science, the 2010 Stockholm Water Prize, and the 2017 International Prize for Biology, and has and been elected to multiple Halls of Fame. She served as the director of the NSF and has served on numerous advisory roles throughout her career. As with some of the other women discussed here, Dr. Colwell prioritizes scientific communication and engagement with the public, particularly children, and expanding participation of minorities and women in the STEM fields. 
Nasa Goddard Institute for Space Studies is fortunate to employ Dr. Cynthia Rosenzweig. Her technical focus is on climate change impacts – how society will be affected by a changing climate. In addition to her technical research, she has been a tireless service worker in the field, serving as a Coordinating Lead Author on the Fourth IPCC report as well as numerous editing and directorship roles with various climate and adaptation organizations. She also has an appointment at the Center for Climate Systems Research and Columbia University.
Perhaps her most current area of research is on climate and crop productivity. She wants to know how agricultural outputs will change as the climate warms and changes to water availability occur. 
Dr. Lubchenco is well known as a world leader in the field of environmental science. After decades of innovative research at the intersection of climate change and the ocean, President Obama tapped her to lead the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration – the federal agency that keeps the nation’s climate records, produces much of the federal agency climate science, and leads the U.S. National Climate Assessment. She has focused squarely on the intersection between climate change and human well-being, and the opportunities to mitigate and adapt to climate change through smarter coastal and oceanic policies and practices. 
With a technical record extending back more than four decades, it is challenging to find anyone with a stronger pedigree. She has used her prestige to raise the importance of scientific communication amongst her colleagues. In the past, communicating science to the larger public was an afterthought. Dr. Lubchenco made it a critical measure of one’s career. Most recently, she has issued a new call-to-arms for scientists to become more engaged with society to counter the post-truth mentality, enable citizens and leaders to have confidence in evidence and science and work together to solve climate and other urgent environmental changes.
None of these short biographies do the scientists justice, but hopefully they give a sense of how some of our top female scientists are contributing to our understanding of the world in which we live. I know they are making a sexist engineer formally employed at Google look a bit silly.
… we can’t turn away from climate change. The Guardian’s environmental coverage reports the scientific facts, social consequences and political choices that are shaping the fate of our planet. As the world's leaders turn their backs on the environment, we are at a crisis point. Individual consumer choices are important, but we need collective action to achieve the systemic change that will really make a difference. Our pioneering and our fearless reporting on the environment can play a vital role in that. But we need our readers’ support.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as $1 – and it only takes a minute.

The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) also found that only 14% of its sample of 1,073 large companies around the world had “science-based targets” – that is, goals to reduce carbon emissions which are in line with the global agreement to hold warming to no more than 2C, enshrined in the 2015 Paris agreement.
“Targets [from companies] have previously been short in scope and pretty unambitious,” Marcus Norton, chief partnerships officer at CDP, told the Guardian. “That is improving.”
Companies are not bound by the Paris agreement, which requires country governments to take action to hold warming to no more than 2C, with an aspirational goal of keeping warming to even lower levels, of 1.5C. However, many large companies have taken their own steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including investing in renewable energy, cutting down on waste and streamlining their operations.
Paul Simpson, chief executive of CDP, added: “This is great news for those companies seizing the opportunity of the low-carbon economy, but the rest need to pick up the pace or risk losing out. The majority of the large corporations we analysed do not yet appear to have the right science-based targets in place to successfully transition their business in line with the Paris agreement, though many have ambitions to take this step in the next two years.”
These efforts will continue despite the withdrawal of the US, the world’s biggest emitter, from the Paris agreement under President Trump. Governments will meet in Bonn this November under the auspices of the UN, a meeting known as COP23, to discuss the next steps to achieving the aims of the Paris agreement, and the attitude of the US government’s representatives will be keenly watched. Ahead of COP23, many companies and governments below the national level were keen to stress their commitment to fulfilling the aims of the Paris pact.
For instance, mayors of the cities of London, Paris, Los Angeles, Barcelona, Mexico City and Cape Town, along with a few others, announced they would stop buying petrol or diesel-driven buses from 2025 onwards, and that they would ensure that a large area of their city was “zero-emission” by 2030.
These actions are calculated to reduce air pollution, a serious problem in many major cities, as well as cutting down on global greenhouse gases.
Ahead of the Bonn conference, developing countries have also been a key focus. A group called the New Climate Economy has surveyed Africa and found that nations across the continent could benefit from environmentally sustainable economic growth, potentially “leapfrogging” developed countries by bypassing much of the fossil fuel economy in favour of clean technology, including renewable energy.
The report found that the best way to encourage such sustainable economic activity in Africa would be for governments to devise and implement new policies that would make investments in green growth more attractive, for instance by reducing existing subsidies for fossil fuels and removing import tariffs on sustainable technology.
Governments should also encourage entrepreneurship, the report found, by adapting policies to the conditions in their countries and of their economies, taking into account the available natural resources and the need to keep emissions low while lifting people out of poverty. “Africa has the natural resources and the determination to instigate a green industrial revolution,” said Carlos Lopes, a member of the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate, professor at the Graduate School of Development Policy and Practice, University of Cape Town. “Now we need the right policies to unleash economic transformation, green growth and entrepreneurship across the continent. A more prosperous and sustainable future is within Africa’s reach, we just need to seize it.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/25/big-companies-climate-change-targets-are-unambitious-say-analysts

The storm mauled a cherished home that Willis and her family are still unable to return to, five years since it ravaged New York City.
“I’d seen nothing like it in my life, the water was surging above the cars. It was like an out of body experience,” Willis, now a 20-year-old student, said. She lived with her mother, brother and dog in far Rockaway, part of a jawbone-like peninsula that juts out near JFK airport in Queens. 
The stricken home was boarded up, with repairs still not done, as the family was shunted between hotels and relatives. “It’s incredibly frustrating,” Willis said. “I can’t believe it has been five years. It’s like no one was ready for what happened after the storm.”
The lingering anguish of Sandy is shared by several hundred others in New York and New Jersey who have been unable to return home since the storm hit. Their houses lie derelict or in an ossified state of repair, with residents plagued by a confusing tangle of bureaucracy, delays, contractor fraud and the fear that any rebuilding in vulnerable areas will be nullified by another storm.
A program called Build It Back was meant to have restored damaged New York City homes – such as the Willis’s – by the end of 2016, but one in five eligible people still haven’t had their dwellings repaired. 
The water was surging above the cars. It was like an out of body experience
The city’s public housing is in a particularly parlous stasis – of the 33 apartment towers that required repair work on crippled heating and lighting systems, only one property has completed work. Protestors will march on Sandy’s fifth anniversary to highlight those still struggling with the storm’s aftermath. 
“There have definitely been problems along the way, it hasn’t gone smoothly,” said Amy Peterson, the city-appointed head of Build it Back. Peterson predicts the final repairs will take place in 2018. 
Around 300 homes were demolished and more than 1,400 homes have been elevated, by as much as 9ft, which has proved complex work in tightly-packed neighborhoods. “It hasn’t been easy, it’s been incredibly complicated,” Peterson said. “No one anticipated this level of damage.” 
Unnervingly, as New York and New Jersey continue to mop up from Sandy, far stronger hurricanes have recently pummeled Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. Donald Trump’s administration has also taken an axe to measures that address climate change – which is known to amplify hurricanes – as well as tear up federal rules requiring adaption to sea level rise.
“It’s such ridiculous theater, it’s shameful,” said Klaus Jacob, a geophysicist who works on climate change adaptation at Columbia University. “New York has made some progress since Sandy but it’s hard to know if we will recover from the step backwards with the current administration. It will not cost this nation not only in billions, it will cost it trillions of dollars if we don’t turn things around.”
After forming as a tropical depression off the coast off Nicaragua, Sandy mustered enough strength to become a category 1 hurricane, triggering mudslides that killed more than 50 people in Haiti as it roiled the Caribbean. Sandy then turned north, heading parallel to the US east coast before crunching into New Jersey, near Atlantic City, on the evening of 29 October 2012.
By now the hurricane is no longer; Sandy becomes a tropical storm. 
But it is still strong enough to obliterate parts of the Jersey shore and trigger a record storm surge in New York harbor. Bolstered by a high tide, around 14ft of water careens into the southern tip of Manhattan, flooding subway stations and the foundations of the under-construction 9/11 memorial. The electricity in the world’s financial powerhouse flickers and dies.
In parts of New York and New Jersey, power isn’t restored for several weeks. More than 100 people lose their lives, with economic damage of around $75bn.
Rachel Riveria was watching the progress of the storm on TV in her top floor apartment in Brooklyn when she heard a cracking noise. As she checked on her sleeping six-year-old daughter, Riveria witnessed the ceiling caving in on her, only narrowly escaping the room with the child in her arms. “My daughter was terrified, she still cries to this day when it rains,” Riveria, who is now 38-years-old. “They say time heals wounds but this 11-year-old is still hurting. She hasn’t healed.”
Barefoot, the duo fled into the storm and found their way to a shelter. They spent nearly two years being moved to various hotels by charities as Riveria’s landlord gave up on repairing the building. 
Finally, stable accommodation was found for them but not in the same area of Brooklyn. Disaster still looms large – Riveria’s mother was rescued when Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico in September, although her sister is still missing. A family friend was found crushed to death under a car. Back in New York, Riveria frets a storm will revisit her, too. 
“People need to open their eyes,” she said. “Wherever there’s disaster, there needs to be help. The working class are the backbone of this country, we aren’t expendable. And we need to do something about climate change. All this drilling for fossil fuels, all those bad fumes. We need to change that.”
New York’s anti-flooding bulkheads have been strengthened, the subway system has a new mechanism to prevent inundation and new safeguards are in place to ensure the city’s lights stay on and the running water remains clean. Streets have been raised in some places and Rockaway’s five-mile boardwalk, left warped and crumpled by Sandy, has reopened.
A rezoning process has altered rules for buildings in vulnerable areas, such as the southern edge of Brooklyn, the east side of Staten Island and the East Village area of Manhattan. But no areas have been completely barred from development and hard decisions over the viability of increasingly soggy parts of the city have been largely deferred.
“If Sandy happened again this year I think New York would be operationally better prepared, people would follow evacuation orders better,” said Jacob. 
“But the water would still go in the same places, streets and houses would be flooded, there would be havoc in the Rockaways and Coney Island. It’s still the same set up. There’s been fiddling around the margins but no fundamental change.”
The biggest lurch from the status quo has occurred in Staten Island, where residents in the low-lying east shore neighborhoods of Oakwood Beach, Graham Beach and Ocean Breeze have been offered money to sell up and leave. The $200m relocation, overseen by New York State, has seen 495 out of 659 eligible households take the voluntary buy-outs.
Irene put these people back on their heels and Sandy was the knockout punch. It was like ‘boom, we are out’
The area was ravaged by Sandy and several people perished. A lesser blow was struck a year before by Hurricane Irene. Still, Joe Tirone, a local real estate broker, said it was a surprise when he asked who was interested in buy-outs at a community meeting and was faced with a forest of raised hands. “Irene put these people back on their heels and Sandy was the knockout punch,” he said. “Sandy hit and it was like ‘boom, we are out.’”
The east shore of Staten Island is marshy land and most residents – many of them police and fire fighters – have multi-generational roots in the area. But the community-led effort to get buy-outs came after it dawned on householders that climate change would eventually outpace them. “I drove around after the storm, houses were gone and it was just swamp,” said Tirone, who advocated on behalf of the community. “The city was still issuing building permits and I just thought ‘how did these houses ever get built?’”
Jan Nuzzo, now a 37-year-old medical assistant, was recuperating at her Oakwood Beach house in Staten Island following the cesarean section delivery of her son, who arrived a month before Sandy struck. For five hours her house filled with water, forcing her to clamber atop furniture with her infant son and dog. At one point she had to change his diaper while lying him on a sofa that had just floated past. “I was waiting to either die or be rescued,” said Nuzzo.
The national guard reached Nuzzo at 2am and from that moment she vowed never to return. She got a buy-out, moving elsewhere in the borough, and now a vacant lot stands where her house once did.
Large chunks of the eastern part of Staten Island has been effectively handed back to nature - tall reeds sprout from empty plots of land, deer roam and opossums scurry around the houses that remain. A surge in turkey numbers prompted a cull.
“We all know the water is rising now,” Nuzzo said. “People absolutely should not have lived in the area we were. It’s a marsh. Everyone loves an ocean view, but it shouldn’t cost you your life. We just wanted to get out and get on with our lives.” 
A recent survey of 500 New Jersey families affected by Sandy found one in five still have not returned home, with a third admitting it’s now a struggle to meet bills and afford food and fuel. A separate Monmouth University poll revealed than more than half of affected New Jersey residents are unhappy with the state’s recovery effort.
Tricia Campbell McAvoy, 67, has sunk her life savings into repairing her house in Brick, New Jersey, a town riven by waterways near the coast, about 60 miles south of New York City. Sandy brought 3ft of water into her house, forcing McAvoy and her son to flee in a truck and her husband to be rescued by kayak.
McAvoy planted a sign reading “looters will be shot and thrown into the river” outside her house and set about trying to make it habitable again. But a series of misfortunes, bureaucratic dawdling by local, state and federal officials and a botched elevation of the house by a rogue contractor mean she still lives with her 100-year-old father in his small, box-filled apartment. Her husband passed away shortly after the storm.
People here love the ocean. This is where they want to stay. But at some point we will be underwater
“The storm is the easy part – restoring your home and your life is the challenge,” she said, surveying the detritus inside a house that has been unhabitable since 2012. McAvoy has had two stokes, takes around a dozen pills a day and, like Willis, doesn’t like returning to her wrecked home. She shakes and weeps as she surveys it.
“Life was good before this,” she said. “I had a beautiful life, I had a husband. So many people around here have become sick and died because of the stress of this storm.”
Brick’s wealthier neighbor of the east, the town of Mantoloking, is attempting to make nature bend to its will. Sandy caused damage to almost every one of the 524 houses in the seaside town, perched on a narrow barrier island that has a bay on one side and the Atlantic on the other. Around 60 homes were utterly destroyed.
In order to get flood insurance and to avoid a similar fate, multi-million dollar homes have been elevated by up to 14ft. Visitors have to scan upwards to find vertiginous front doors. Diggers are working to mould sand dredged from the seabed into protective beach dunes that will reach 22ft. To the south, in Seaside Heights, a rollercoaster that was washed out into the sea by Sandy has a gleaming new replacement, also placed on a short pier overhanging the waves.
“We are at risk, there’s no doubt about it, but people hope they will lift their home and survive it, for now,” said Lance White, president of New Jersey’s Mantoloking council. “People here love the ocean, they love the beach. This is where they want to stay. But at some point we will be underwater.”
Climate change’s hand in Sandy was identified in a 2013 study that found sea level rise, driven by the melting of glaciers and thermal expansion of a warming ocean, extended the reach of the storm by 27 sq miles, affecting 83,000 additional people. 
Heavy blows like Sandy may soon become quotidian – research released this week by Rutgers University estimated that 8ft floods, which used to occur once every 500 years, will batter New York every five years within the next three decades.
Such scenarios are invoked by Bill de Blasio, New York’s mayor, in his push to cut the city’s greenhouse gas emissions and in his excoriation of Trump for aiming a “dagger straight at the heart of New York City” by pulling the US from the Paris climate agreement.
Things haven’t been perfect but we are moving as fast as we can. We will be at this the rest of our lives
City Hall has thrown its weight behind a coastal defence system, nicknamed the big U, that would hug lower Manhattan in a 10-mile perimeter. Work on the $750m project is set to begin in early 2019 and will take several years to complete.
The big U is vying with other ideas such as a huge barrier that would stretch from New Jersey to the Rockaways and envelop New York harbor, closing it off during a storm. Ostensibly supported by New York governor Andrew Cuomo, the initiative would cost around $25bn.
Neither of these huge projects would be infallible. The big U would provide a buffer from storm surge but should New York suffer the sort of downpour experienced recently by Houston – when the Texan city was drenched in 25 trillion gallons of water during Hurricane Harvey – lower Manhattan would fill like a bathtub. 
A barrier is more ambitious but the continual onslaught of sea level rise – New York City is likely to get a 1-2ft increase by mid century that could balloon to as much as 6ft by 2100 – means the barrier could spend more time closed than open, causing flooding behind it as water piles up from the East and Hudson rivers.
“When we are finished (with the big U) it would be absurd to say everything will be safe but we are reducing vulnerabilities,” said Daniel Zarrilli, New York City’s climate change and resiliencechief.
“We know the threats are out there and growing. Things haven’t been perfect but we are moving as fast as we can. We will be at this the rest of our lives.”
At some point, New York may be forced into what Columbia’s Jacob diplomatically calls “sustainable relocation” – parts of the city are allowed to flood, creating a sort of Venice in places like lower Manhattan where bridges and boats connect skyscrapers. 
“Let Canal Street be a canal, let Water Street be water,” Jacob said. “People may feel temporarily safe behind the big U but it’s like declaring war and then not having a strategy on how to extract yourself from that war. It’s a purely defensive strategy.
“We should move critical assets such as hospitals and schools to higher ground and reduce density at lower ground. With the storms and flooding, some corporations will start to think about it. We will probably make it to mid century but beyond that – it’s all up for grabs.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/27/hurricane-sandy-five-years-later-climate-change

Have you moved on from pretending to support renewables 100% (whilst attacking renewables 100% on the Guardian) to now claiming to be a scientist too?
Fracking is a waste of time and money in the UK, change jobs and start working for renewables instead.
Nuclear is no longer viable in the UK as it can't compete economically with renewables, and now we have ever cheaper storage arriving, plus vast amounts of demand side storage (EV's) that can be 'rented' rather than bought by the supply side.
So your games up. Come over to the light side. You'll no longer have to pretend that PV at a 50d pitch is 'only suitable in the arctic', or 'domestic battery storage doesn't reduce import'.

Incorrect.Scientists and informed people know precisely what will happen when we increase CO2 levels - it will get warmer.
For example, the military-industrial complex who carried out many experiments looking at CO2 in the atmosphere to ensure IR guided missiles work know about how CO2 behaves in the atmosphere. Globally the military would be very upset if the toys from the military-industrial complex did not work, and as they have a history of some 50 odd years using these toys, I think by now the failings would have become apparent.

CO2 is not pollution, it is plant food.
BQEND
Yes, we know this well worn and scientifically redundant claim deniers regurgitate often. The question I have to ask, if it is so great, why aren't they eating their food ?Why are CO2 levels rising ?Is it because plants aren't able to eat this food ?Is it because the concept of carbon sinks have escaped the notice of deniers for decades ?Do they really think we're so gullible as to swallow this plant food nonsense ?
BQSTART
In addition, it is atmosphere CO2 that keeps the average temperature from falling by 33 deg C. Without CO2 in the atmosphere we would soon starve to death if we didn't freeze to death first.
BQEND
This is also well known.So again the question is why do deniers think that no one else has spotted this ?Why do deniers think that increasing CO2 levels by 40% will have no effect on temperatures ?Why do deniers never mention this increase is unprecedented in geological timescales ?

This result is consistent with a survey from last year that also found Americans are willing to pay an average of $15 to $20 per month to combat climate change. Another recent Yale survey found that overall, 78% of registered American voters support taxing and/or regulating carbon pollution, including 67% of Republicans and 60% of conservative Republicans.
This raises the question – with such broad support across the political spectrum, why doesn’t America have a carbon tax in place by now? Study co-author Anthony Leiserowitz noted the similarity to public support for many gun control policies:
Policy elites sometimes have ideological stances quite different than their constituents, even of their own party (e.g., background checks on gun purchases in the US which is overwhelmingly favored by Democrats and Republicans). 
Public support often doesn’t translate into policy. On the issue of gun control, Republican lawmakers are afraid that if they vote for even the most benign policies like requiring background checks for all gun purchases, the NRA will mobilize its supporters against them. In primary races with relatively low turnout, with partisans more likely to vote, Republican lawmakers fear that mobilizing even a relatively small minority of opposition voters could cost them their jobs. On the issue of climate change and carbon taxes, they have the same fear of the Koch network.
In short, the wealthy and powerful have more influence over American policy than average voters. 
The new Yale study also asked survey participants how they would like to use the revenue generated by a carbon tax. Supporting the development of solar and wind energy and funding infrastructure improvements were the two most popular choices (around 80% support), followed by assisting displaced coal workers (73% support) and paying down the national debt (67% support). Interestingly, the option of returning the revenue back to taxpayers was supported by fewer than half of Americans – both Republicans and Democrats.
Basically, Americans support a carbon tax because they want action to address climate change, and they want to spend the revenue on clean energy for the same reason. Or they at least want to spend the money on something they consider important; for conservative Republicans, paying down the national debt was the top choice.
However, we’ve seen that public opinion doesn’t dictate policy, and there are some important reasons why returning all of the carbon tax revenue to households (a.k.a. ‘revenue neutrality’) has widespread support, including among many prominent Republicans.
Perhaps most importantly, Republican Party thought leaders and elder statesmen consider revenue neutrality critical to their support for a carbon tax. For one thing, many Republican policymakers have signed ‘the no tax pledge.’ During Obama’s presidency, Republicans weren’t even willing to accept large budget cuts in exchange for much smaller tax increases. Cutting taxes may become the only significant legislative accomplishment of the current two-year congressional session. If there’s one issue Republican policymakers can agree on, it’s cutting (or at least not increasing) taxes. But as Ronald Reagan’s Secretary of State George Shultz put it, “It’s not a tax if the government doesn’t keep the money.”
Secondly, because poorer households spend a larger proportion of their income on energy bills, a carbon tax would be a regressive policy. However, because wealthier households use more energy and thus have larger net energy bills, returning all the revenue equally to households would be a progressive policy. Studies have found that most households would actually come out ahead, with rebate checks exceeding their increased energy costs, and particularly lower income households. Studies have also shown a revenue-neutral carbon tax policy would grow the economy, largely for this very reason – the rebate checks would give people more disposable income to spend.
Third, returning the revenue to households would allow for a higher carbon pollution tax. If Americans are willing to pay an extra $15 per month to tackle climate change, that would translate to a very modest carbon tax. But if some or all of the revenue is returned to households, net energy costs will be offset by rebate checks, allowing for a higher carbon tax at the same cost to households. And the higher the tax, the more effective it will be at reducing American carbon pollution.
There are major efforts underway to make a revenue-neutral carbon tax policy a reality in the USA. From the grassroots level, the volunteer organization Citizens’ Climate Lobby has been at work for ten years, and the group has grown exponentially. In its annual summary lobbying effort this year, the group sent 1,300 volunteers to lobby every member of congress to support a revenue-neutral carbon tax. 
The policy is also supported by many prominent Republican Party elder statesmen, including cabinet members from the last three Republican administrations; two former Secretaries of State, two former Secretaries of Treasury, and two former chairmen of the President’s Council of Economic Advisors. Their group, called the Climate Leadership Council, has met with the White House to urge support for a revenue-neutral carbon tax.
Although most Republican Party policymakers continue to oppose taxing carbon pollution, it’s inevitable that the USA will implement national climate policy sooner or later. A revenue-neutral carbon tax seems to represent the path of least resistance. The only question is how much longer the GOP will delay the inevitable.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/oct/23/americans-want-a-tax-on-carbon-pollution-but-how-to-get-one

Don't agree about the supposed suppression and restriction of intelligence occurring in parallel with the rise of technology. 
Our intelligence has always been heavily atrophied by our faith, often in religious systems but more recently in the west, now that church-based religions have evaporated, in secular beliefs which we hold with a religious blindness once reserved for said deity-based faiths.
In the past this did not matter, apart from our merry habit of slaughtering people of other faiths in wars where 'God' was, of course, on our side. In short, if you thought you were drinking God's blood, or some low-cost plonk, it did not matter to the penguins in Antarctica, whereas your religious attachment to carbon economics does. 
The reason for this is the significant shift that has occurred from belief in these sorts of essentially mindless fixations on fragments of myth, to belief in secular social systems: e.g. to Communism; then via the Fabians to your local Labour Party; then to socially equitable economics as a widespread dogma; and lately to economic growth per se: all touted as a means to plenty for all. What we have failed to notice is that while we spent huge amounts of energy on trying to make such materialist ideologies more 'reasonable', or ‘logical’, so they 'work better', our blind attachment to them is still as religious as the blind attachment of our antecedents' to their holy deisms.
We have thus come to a totally fixated state of belief in such notions as the goodness of Holy Carbon Economics, based on faith in Holy Infinite Economic Expansion and the dream of growing Holy Material Happiness for all. This is our promised land and everyone has a share, just as Milo Minder Binder said, and now the Neocons declare!
It is not the suppression and restriction of intelligence by technology that is the problem, it is our belief in belief that is our eternal diabolical blind spot. Our present Achilles heal is our belief in the notion that the planet can yield whatever material gewgaw we dream of. We simply have to abandon this adolescent, Gargantuan, materialist, carbon-based fantasy in the same way that we in the west have already abandoned our equally mindless ragbag of dogmatic religious fantasies. 
We have to stop believing in isms and instead start thinking about reality for the very obvious reason that if we don't start thinking about reality soon, we will soon have very little to think about.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1507930647000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'2615602', u'in_reply_to': u'106737930', u'id': u'106759094', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'wascallywabbit', u'text': u'Wow, what a comment!

It is the second time in just four years that such devastation – not previously seen in more than 50 years of observation – has been wrought on the population.
The finding has prompted urgent calls for the establishment of a marine protected area in East Antarctica, at next week’s meeting of 24 nations and the European Union at the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) in Hobart.
In the colony of about 18,000 breeding penguin pairs on Petrels Island, French scientists discovered just two surviving chicks at the start of the year. Thousands of starved chicks and unhatched eggs were found across the island in the region called Adélie Land (“Terre Adélie”).
The colony had experienced a similar event in 2013, when no chicks survived. In a paper about that event, a group of researchers, led by Yan Ropert-Coudert from France’s National Centre for Scientific Research, said it had been caused by a record amount of summer sea ice and an “unprecedented rainy episode”.
The unusual extent of sea ice meant the penguins had to travel an extra 100km to forage for food. And the rainy weather left the chicks, which have poor waterproofing, wet and unable to keep warm.
This year’s event has also been attributed to an unusually large amount of sea ice. Overall, Antarctica has had a record low amount of summer sea ice, but the area around the colony has been an exception.
Ropert-Coudert said the region had been severely affected by the break-up of the Mertz glacier tongue in 2010, when a piece of ice almost the size of Luxembourg – about 80 km long and 40km wide – broke off. That event, which occurred about 250km from Petrels Island, had a big impact on ocean currents and ice formation in the region.
“The Mertz glacier impact on the region sets the scene in 2010 and when unusual meteorological events, driven by large climatic variations, hit in some years this leads to massive failures,” Ropert-Coudert told the Guardian. “In other words, there may still be years when the breeding will be OK, or even good for this colony, but the scene is set for massive impacts to hit on a more or less regular basis.”
The link between climate change and the sea-ice extent around Antarctica is not very clear. Sea ice has been increasing in recent years, which could be attributed to a rise in the amount of freshwater in the ocean around the continent caused by climate change. However, over the long term, climate change is expected to cause the sea ice to shrink dramatically.
“For the moment, sea ice is increasing and this is a problem for this species as it pushes the feeding place – the sea ice edge – farther away from their nesting place,” Ropert-Coudert said. “If it shrinks it would help but if it shrinks too much then the food chain they rely on may be impacted. Basically, as a creature of the sea ice they need an optimum sea-ice cover to thrive.”
Elsewhere, human pressures including climate change have already been having a severe impact on the numbers of Adélie penguins. On the Antarctic Peninsula, which has been badly affected by climate change, populations have been decreasing, and some researchers suggest they may become extinct there.
Ropert-Coudert said there were more anthropogenic threats on the horizon – fishing and possibly tourism – that the penguins needed protection from.
He has called for a marine protected area (MPA) to be established there.
“An MPA will not remedy these changes but it could prevent further impacts that direct anthropogenic pressures, such as tourism and proposed fisheries, could bring,” he said.
Next week, 24 countries and the European Union will meet at the CCAMLR in Hobart to discuss the potential creation of more MPAs around Antarctica.
At last year’s meeting, after years of failed negotiations, the members agreed to create the world’s largest MPA in the Ross Sea, and many expect the group to agree on East Antarctica next. 
This has also been proposed by Australia and has been on the table at the CCAMLR for eight years.
The head of polar programs at WWF, Rod Downie, said: “Adélie penguins are one of the hardiest and most amazing animals on our planet. This devastating event contrasts with the image that many people might have of penguins. It’s more like ‘Tarantino does Happy Feet’, with dead penguin chicks strewn across a beach in Adélie Land.
“The risk of opening up this area to exploratory krill fisheries, which would compete with the Adélie penguins for food as they recover from two catastrophic breeding failures in four years, is unthinkable. So CCAMLR needs to act now by adopting a new Marine Protected Area for the waters off East Antarctica, to protect the home of the penguins.”
Ropert-Coudert and his colleagues are in the process of completing a scientific paper on the breeding failure and plan to submit it to a journal in the coming weeks.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/12/penguin-catastrophe-leads-to-demands-for-protection-in-east-antarctica

Anthropogenic warming by the end of the 21st century will likely cause tropical cyclones globally to be more intense on average (by 2 to 11% according to model projections for an IPCC A1B scenario). This change would imply an even larger percentage increase in the destructive potential per storm, assuming no reduction in storm size. There are better than even odds that anthropogenic warming over the next century will lead to an increase in the occurrence of very intense tropical cyclone in some basins– an increase that would be substantially larger in percentage terms than the 2-11% increase in the average storm intensity. This increase in intense storm occurrence is projected despite a likely decrease (or little change) in the global numbers of all tropical cyclones.  Anthropogenic warming by the end of the 21st century will likely cause tropical cyclones to have substantially higher rainfall rates than present-day ones, with a model-projected increase of about 10-15% for rainfall rates averaged within about 100 km of the storm center.

Fair enough, you can’t read. I post a link to an informed authority on the subject, and that is your response. No, I think what we have here is closed-minded zealotry by you. 
What I don’t accept are alarmist crystal ball predictions that gloss over climatology. There are many statements of impending catastrophe but often times the data shows that nothing in the climate record leads to any conclusion of impending disaster.

The only one in your list that you can say is potentially catastrophic to humans. AND potentially attributable to humans is sea level rise. I do not dispute the seriousness of that. However, the potential for serious consequences on that is decades away, and we have time to adapt. Funny how that’s a topic (sea level rise adaptation) that is difficult to find conversations on in the media? Could it be that’s because it’s not as fun for alarmists to discuss as it is blaming tropical storms on fossil fuel burning etc? Oh.... btw, that’s one of your claims that CANNOT be connected to humans.

Also unprecedented fatal heat waves happened before 1950. Ever hear of the dust bowl and associated heat wave of 1936 where 120 degree temp readings in 12 states afflicted millions? Climate Alarmists would be frothing if that happened today. How about the great “stink” in London in 1858? Or the super oppressive heat event in New York in 1896? These are only examples, not the entire listing.

All of what WG1 work with is abstract. Changes of a Sverdrup for a current in the ocean of the atmosphere could be equal to a micrometer or ""lots of tons"" for the casual reader. Gigatons of mass loss from Greenland - what is that? Potential positive feedback by troposphere clouds and negative feedback-potential from stratospheric vapour? this is all WG1. 
Wg2 and 3 have a mission to fulfil. There will be no surprise from Wg1 in the next cycle of IPCC - because the equations are hundred years old. The fast moving science now is what WG2 and 3 does. It is no longer linear transfer of ""climate"" to ""behaviour"" and ""consequences"" as it used to be in the 90's (sorry for making this a bit shallow - I can because of a lot of my fellow physical scientists had to do it for lack of social scientists doing it back in the days). 
WG2 and 3 now make really complex and worrying and hopeful studies of what it may entail - and what role humans play in this other than being the emitters and cause of what we in WG1 ponder. 
To prepare for half a meter more sea-level by 2050 is different (engineering practicality and cost) to scale up large centres to hide in with massive AC-systems that allows tens of thousands of people to keep cool to save lives (humanity). And we are now needing to build both - as preparation for the future.

However, we can't compare the current situation with anything in history, we need to compare it with geological precedents.
Humans have never experienced the kind of change that's happening over the next century or so.
CO2 has not been this high for several million years, and normally changes happen slowly.
The rate of CO2 output is now faster than the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, which was around 56 million years ago.
The fossil record in rocks formed around the equator during the PETM is really poor, and that may be an indication that life was extremely stressed.
If the tropics become virtually uninhabitable, there will be mass migrations far greater than any seen recently.
Agriculture is basically adapted to the mostly-stable Holocene - that is not going to be the offer from Earth systems as the effects of CO2 continue.
People can't grasp this, because it truly is outside any human experience.
In fact when there have been short, sharp climate shocks, humans have found it very difficult to cope.
In 1815 there was a big eruption in Indonesia.
It caused global temperatures to drop by a degree or so for a few years, and created an event in 1816 called ""The Year Without a Summer"", leading to failed crops and near-famine conditions in many places.
In 1258 there was a European famine across many countries, and this is now linked to a major eruption in 1257 on Lombok in Indonesia - it has a much bigger sulphate peak in the ice cores than Tambora in 1815, so it was a bigger eruption.

The study follows recent unseasonable heat across New South Wales, with Sydney experiencing its hottest ever September day, as well as the doubling of record-breaking summer temperatures in Australia in the past 50 years. This new normal has hospital health professionals particularly bracing for the coming summer.
Public Australian emergency departments are tough places to both work and be a patient. They are hectic, often overwhelmed, not infrequently threatening environments that are emotionally demanding for everyone. And, with ever increasing demand and an ageing population, along with a politically-sensitive health budget, the emergency department is increasingly the public face of a stressed health system.
Every day, sometime around 11am, the ambulances roll in. This is when we see the presentation rate suddenly increase, commonly bringing a new patient every three to four minutes, a rate that will continue until 10-11pm every evening. Generally during this 11 to 12 hour period we see two-thirds of our presentations. This is the time that the department heaves.
During this period, on any given day, the resuscitation area will be full. A delirious elderly patient with septicaemia will be lying alongside someone with chest pain who may be next to a psychotic methamphetamine-intoxicated patient screaming abuse as they are restrained by security and clinical staff, while a full resuscitation of an out of hospital cardiac arrest or a major trauma takes place in a nearby bay. 
Monitor alarms will be going off continuously, the sounds broken by an ambulance priority-one call coming through, while medical and nursing staff will be moving from one patient to the next as quickly as possible, trying to keep on top of the deteriorating patients around them. And soon enough ambulances will be banking up outside the front door as the department exceeds its capacity to deal with the influx, kept from being on the road responding to emergencies as they wait to offload their patients.
While all this is going on, the inpatient units are being pushed to discharge as many patients, as early as possible in the day, to make capacity for the admissions that will come, both as emergency and elective surgical patients. All of this has to happen, has to work to an optimal level to deal with the demand of any usual day in our public health system.
Are we going to take the health of our population and our ecosystem seriously ...?
Now let us add to this day three of a heatwave (defined as three or more days of high maximum temperatures). With climate change causing a gradual increase in average temperatures, we know that heatwaves are more frequent and of increasing severity.
What we also know from the heatwaves we have seen in Australia thus far is that we can expect a very significant impact on our public health system. Increases of up to 25% for ambulance emergency call outs; up to 60% increase in emergency department resuscitation cases, often in the elderly and vulnerable members of our society; an overall increase in presentations to our already overstretched emergency departments; and an increase in overall deaths ranging from 13% to 24%. In the 2014 Melbourne heatwave, that equated to 167 excess deaths.
One hundred and sixty seven deaths. If that had been a fire, or explosion, or heaven forbid a terrorist attack, it would be a national disaster that would be in the public eye for days. Yet it will happen reliably with every major heatwave event, and we barely bat an eyelid.
These issues are discussed in an article in the current edition of the Medical Journal of Australia, which I co-authored with former Australian of the Year, Professor Fiona Stanley, and public health physician, Dr Marion Carey.
And it is not just these direct consequences that are significant. There is always a huge demand on public hospital beds, many hospitals running at or beyond a level of occupancy that allows for efficient systems. What this means is that even without additional burdens such as heatwaves, it is a constant struggle to create capacity for those who need admission. Events such as heatwaves only exacerbate this pressure, resulting in reduced access for all patients, not just those affected by heat-related illness.
So, with the prospect of increasing extreme weather along with the so many other challenges of climate change we have some serious questions to address.
Are we going to take the health of our population and our ecosystem seriously and do everything we can to mitigate the inevitable increase in ambient temperature? How do we minimise the completely unacceptable mortality rates that we are already seeing, and what do we do to invest in our health systems to cope with what will be an ever increasing burden?
These are challenges that require immediate, mid and long-term solutions, challenges that we need to see taken seriously by the government of the day.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/04/a-lack-of-action-on-climate-change-is-putting-peoples-lives-at-risk

Abbott delivered the annual lecture to the London-based Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF), a climate sceptic thinktank on Monday evening. The Guardian and several other media outlets were blocked from attending the event but a copy of the speech was later circulated.
Abbott told the group the ostracisation of those who did not accept climate science was “the spirit of the Inquisition, the thought-police down the ages”. He also reprised his 2009 assertion that the “so-called settled science of climate change” was “absolute crap”. 
Measures to deal with climate change, which Abbott said would damage the economy, were likened to “primitive people once killing goats to appease the volcano gods”.
“At least so far,” he said, “it’s climate change policy that’s doing harm. Climate change itself is probably doing good; or at least, more good than harm.”
“There’s the evidence that higher concentrations of carbon dioxide – which is a plant food after all – are actually greening the planet and helping to lift agricultural yields. In most countries, far more people die in cold snaps than in heatwaves, so a gradual lift in global temperatures, especially if it’s accompanied by more prosperity and more capacity to adapt to change, might even be beneficial.” 
When he was prime minister, Abbott said he took the issue of climate change “very seriously”. But since he was deposed as prime minister by his Liberal party colleague and bête noire Malcolm Turnbull in 2015, Abbott has returned to many hardline views he had tempered as leader.
He told the GWPF Australia needed “evidence-based policy rather than policy-based evidence” and took aim at a 2013 study that showed that 97% of scientists agree humans are driving climate change, “as if scientific truth is determined by votes rather than facts”.
Climate change and energy policy has been a divisive issue in Australia for more than a decade, with Abbott consistently at the centre of the division. From the backbench, Abbott has pushed the Turnbull government to reject policies that would favour renewable energy.
In his speech, Abbott blamed Turnbull’s failure to campaign on energy prices during 2016 for the narrowing of the government’s majority at that year’s election.
“After a net gain of 25 seats at the previous two elections, when we had campaigned on power prices, we had a net loss of 14 when we didn’t. And subsequent events have made the politics of power once more the central battleground between and within the two main parties,” Abbott said.
On Monday the federal energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, indicated the government did not intend to follow its chief scientist’s recommendation that it should implement a clean energy target. Abbott welcomed that news in London, calling it “belated”.
“Even if reducing emissions really is necessary to save the planet, our effort, however Herculean, is barely better than futile; because Australia’s total annual emissions are exceeded by just the annual increase in China’s,” Abbott said.
Recent research from the Australia Institute found the country was the only wealthy nation still breaking energy emissions records.
The GWPF is chaired by Nigel Lawson, who served as Margaret Thatcher’s treasurer. Lawson has been an outspoken critic of climate science and recently incorrectly told the BBC the global temperature had slightly declined in the past decade. The BBC was heavily criticised for leaving his assertions unchallenged.
John Hewson, who led the Liberal party from 1990 to 1994, said Abbott’s speech to Lawson’s group “sees him in like-minded, if disturbingly deluded, company”.
“Tony Abbott has had a long history of playing short-term politics, for his own political benefit, with the existential threat posed by a rapidly changing climate,” Hewson said.
“Abbott was effective in opposition – a man of nope rather than hope. His basic thrust is that if you can’t understand it, don’t believe it, or accept it. When it comes to climate, and the magnitude and urgency of the challenge, Abbott is prepared to deny the undeniable, and to ignore the risks and costs if left to future generations. History will undoubtedly judge Abbott and Howard and their small band of deniers harshly. When they could have acted on climate and emissions they failed as leaders, miserably.”
Abbott’s speech – titled Daring to Doubt – contained echoes of his mentor and prime ministerial predecessor John Howard, who gave the same annual lecture to the GWPF four years ago. In 2013 Howard said climate “zealots” had turned the issue into a “substitute religion”.
Abbott, who trained to be a Catholic priest, called climate change a “post-Christian theology” and said the decline of religion in society had left a hole in which other forms of “dogma” could take root. 
A Lancet study in 2015 supports Abbott’s claim that more people die from cold weather than hot. But the World Health Organisation has found that by 2050, climate change will cause 250,000 extra people to die each year from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat stress.
Abbott went on to deny many of the central findings of the UN’s climate science body and claimed, without providing evidence, that climate records had been “adjusted” and data sets “slanted”.
“Contrary to the breathless assertions that climate change is behind every weather event, in Australia, the floods are not bigger, the bushfires are not worse, the droughts are not deeper or longer, and the cyclones are not more severe than they were in the 1800s,” Abbott said. “Sometimes, they do more damage but that’s because there’s more to destroy, not because their intensity has increased.
“More than 100 years of photography at Manly beach in my electorate does not suggest that sea levels have risen despite frequent reports from climate alarmists that this is imminent.”
Scientists often refrain from linking single weather events to climate change, saying only that they fit with what they expect to see more of because of climate change.
But as the Earth warms and scientist better understand climate change, weather extremes have been shown to have been made more likely due to greenhouse gas pollution. In Australia, the record hot winter just passed was made 60 times more likely by climate change. Researchers have also linked warming sea temperatures to the catastrophic rainfall and flooding that killed 35 people in Australia in 2011.
Sea level rise is one of the least controversial aspects of climate science. It is progressing at 3.4mm per year globally, according to the Australian government’s Ozcoasts website. Perhaps not enough to appear in photographs against other variables, such as daily tides, but over time scientists agree this will cause problems with coastal housing and infrastructure.
The Guardian asked repeatedly for an invitation to attend the event. Abbott’s spokesperson said the speech was “not considered a media event”. The Guardian understands the Times of London was invited to attend and excerpts of the speech were distributed to News Corp newspapers in Australia.

I have read your “Real World Driving Emissions Test Summary Report” found via https://www.realworld.org.au. I approve of the general purpose of real on-road testing of vehicles. This is appropriate for vehicles that operate in essentially the same way all the time. 
However, I was dismayed by the misleading presentation of the results for the one plug-in hybrid that was tested. A plug-in hybrid operates very differently on short urban trips from longer extra-urban trips. Any test that lumps the results together will produce nonsense. It will be no more ‘real world’ that the tests you hope to replace!
Your “THE HYBRID ELECTRIC SHOCK - FOUR TIMES MORE FUEL” box of text on the web site is unfortunate and misleading. I assume the one plug-in hybrid, vehicle 27, was a Mitsubishi PHEV Outlander since that is the only available plug-in hybrid that is an SUV-style vehicle. 
Your report only demonstrates how your single on-road test was just as inappropriate for plug-in series hybrids as standard vehicle tests. Obviously a PHEV's short trip performance will differ from its long trip performance by a far greater margin than for ordinary vehicles that operate much the same way all the time, whether fully fossil fuel burning, which includes non-plug-in hybrids such as the Prius, or fully battery-electric. 
Obviously, a prospective owner of a plug-in hybrid will need to think about their likely mix of short and long trips. They would want to know how the vehicle performs for long trips when an initial battery charge would make a relatively small contribution to the total energy used for the overall trip. They would also want to know how the vehicle performs on short trips where the battery contributes all or most of the energy. They would then need to think about their personal mix of long and short trips - mostly short and only occasionally long, or vice-versa? 
At the very least, any test report should include a prominent disclaimer that such vehicles' performance on a short city cycle should be considered separately from a longer extra-urban cycle. Your web site and report’s presentation of the 'shock' result of 'four-times' more fuel should be put in the context of vehicle's claimed 1.9l/100km. I don't know exactly where the 4x comes from. The ""Fuel consumption compared to official numbers"" table has 166% ('cold start’. Does this mean charged?) and 337% ('warm start’. Does that mean the battery was depleted?). In any case, 4x1.9l/100km=7.6l/100km, which is not bad for an SUV-style vehicle, probably better than the non-PHEV version of the same vehicle, and similar to what my friends report for long trips without recharging their Mitsubishi PHEV Outlander. They also report a ‘real world’ result of using almost no petrol for months on end when they have only short trips for commuting, shopping and other local errands. From mixes of mostly short and occasional long trips, I have several friends who report lifetime fuel consumption from plug-in hybrid that are reasonably close to the sticker value of 1.9l/100km. 
In part the blame perhaps lies with whoever decided to put a single-number claim on the vehicle sticker. That number will easily be wrong (better or worse) in any other test or with different assumptions or in different real worlds as experienced by people with different driving patterns. Since that single number is a fiction, expressing results from different tests as a percentage of that fiction will give numbers that are equally fictional. 
I also wonder whether the tests were done on a vehicle with a depleted battery or starting with a full battery. Either way, the situation should have been prominently specified. What does the table with ‘cold start’ results mean for a plug-in hybrid? Surely a ‘cold start’ in a plug-in hybrid is heading off with a full battery charge and consequently driving purely electric with no tail pipe emissions. 
In summary, any improved testing that purports to be ‘real world’ will need to be more nuanced to say anything useful about vehicles that shift from pure EV mode to series hybrid mode between shorter trips and longer trips.

One is that fuel use is actually increasing. The average economy of the Australian vehicle fleet is actually the same as it was in 1970. In the ensuing 50 years, despite the lies of manufacturers, the fuel efficiency of the internal combustion engine has improved dramatically. However, aside from the higher emissions arising from clogged urban roads, instead of manufacturers taking the fuel efficiency gains as fuel savings, they have translated that into bigger vehicles (note the SUV and dual-cab ute explosion) and larger engines - witness the number of top-end vehicles that have 5 and 6 litre engines. Of course, I read reviews of SUV's and dual-cabs (not because I want one - dual-cabs in particular are all too often the choice of boneheads, and the advertising certainly panders to a specific mentality), and the fuel-economy figures are clearly exaggerated at best and lies at worst. 
While that SUV you drive might now be more fuel-efficient that its predecessor from 20 years ago, the reality is that large cars still use more fuel and even with better emission controls, more fuel burnt generally means more emissions. I went camping recently and a friend generously agreed to do the driving in their SUV (my wife and I don't have an SUV). On the open road, I was watching the fuel economy - even at cruising highway speed, when most cars are achieving their best economy, the economy readout showed around 18 to 20 litres per 100 kms. Around town, I would guess that would have to be consistently over 20 litres per 100 kms. My diesel on the other hand generally delivers around 6 litres per 100 kms around the suburbs - and 5 at sensible cruising speeds. It would thus have to be 4-times worse for emissions to be as bad as the typical SUV overall. 
Driving styles certainly make a difference (my wife generally gets about 10% worse economy in my car than I do and I get better economy when I drive her car), but most of the time I watch SUV's and dual-cabs, the drivers are driving them as though they are small cars, so even if the manufacturers were truthful (which they are not) those cars will deliver economy much worse than stated. Of course, the people who drive those vehicles are not likely to be worried about economy - there is a different psychology being exploited by the manufacturers in encouraging people to want such vehicles and while we all moan about fuel prices, for most the only question is whether the fuel cost is affordable (and some regard the ownership of a ""gas-guzzler"" as sending a signal about their wealth and status - ""I don't care about fuel prices""). 
All that points to it being long overdue for governments to introduce far stricter emission's standards and to formulate a policy framework that punishes ""fuel profligacy"". My suggestion is that tax concessions for dual cab utes all be removed and SUV's and dual cabs be treated as commercial vehicles and taxed accordingly and large capacity engines also being taxed punitively.

Bradley said as emissions standards tightened, “the gap between laboratory results and real-world results is widening, meaning consumers and the environment are increasingly being ripped off.""
I've been closely involved in efforts to reduce vehicle emissions for many years, in industry and government, and to put the nicest possible slant on Bradley's comments, they're a pack of lies. Take ""more fuel than advertised."" Legislation forces manufacturers to ""advertise"" fuel consumption (report is more accurate) achieved over a road trip, simulated on a laboratory ""rolling road,"" specified by the government for such tests. If the simulated trip isn't representative of typical car use, it's not car makers fault.
""Seven times the legal limit"" is another lie. It's as stupid as saying 100 centimetres is further than 95 inches - it must be because the number is bigger. As with fuel consumption testing, car manufactures drive over a cycle set by legislation and have to pass emissions limits SET FOR THAT TEST. Nobody is being ripped off and Bradley should be sued for his comments.So does the standard drive cycle adequately simulate typical driving conditions? Almost certainly not, but that's the fault of legislators, not car makers. Does it matter? Not nearly as much as Bradley would have us believe. Each time more stringent emissions standards have been introduced in Australia, designers have had to work hard to meet them. Vehicles made after each new standard, have had much lower emissions than those made earlier, when tested over the same cycle. Sydney's photochemical smog problem, headed for disastrous levels in the seventies, doesn't rate a mention today, so clearly emissions under real conditions have been dramatically reduced. By exactly the same margin as the reductions achieved in the laboratory test? Who knows, who cares? The intended results have been achieved.
The suggestion that some manufactures might be cheating, that is, designing systems that work in the laboratory but not on the road, is an entirely separate issue to what Bradley is talking about.

Yes. Australia should adopt higher standards. Pollution from vehicles is detrimental to human health and the environment.
The following are the major pollutants from motor vehicles:
Particulate matter (PM). These particles of soot and metals give smog its murky color. Fine particles — less than one-tenth the diameter of a human hair — pose the most serious threat to human health, as they can penetrate deep into lungs. PM is a direct (primary) pollution and a secondary pollution from hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and sulfer dioxides. Diesel exhaust is a major contributor to PM pollution.
Hydrocarbons (HC). These pollutants react with nitrogen oxides in the presence of sunlight to form ground level ozone, a primary ingredient in smog. Though beneficial in the upper atmosphere, at the ground level this gas irritates the respiratory system, causing coughing, choking, and reduced lung capacity.
Nitrogen oxides (NOx). These pollutants cause lung irritation and weaken the body's defenses against respiratory infections such as pneumonia and influenza. In addition, they assist in the formation of ground level ozone and particulate matter.
Carbon monoxide (CO). This odorless, colorless, and poisonous gas is formed by the combustion of fossil fuels such as gasoline and is emitted primarily from cars and trucks. When inhaled, CO blocks oxygen from the brain, heart, and other vital organs. Fetuses, newborn children, and people with chronic illnesses are especially susceptible to the effects of CO.
Sulfur dioxide (SO2). Power plants and motor vehicles create this pollutant by burning sulfur-containing fuels, especially diesel. Sulfur dioxide can react in the atmosphere to form fine particles and poses the largest health risk to young children and asthmatics.
Hazardous air pollutants (toxics). These chemical compounds have been linked to birth defects, cancer, and other serious illnesses. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that the air toxics emitted from cars and trucks — which include Benzene, acetaldehyde, and 1,3-butadiene — account for half of all cancers caused by air pollution.
Greenhouse gases. Motor vehicles also emit pollutants, such as carbon dioxide, that contribute to global climate change. In fact, cars and trucks account for over one-fifth of the United States' total global warming pollution; transportation, which includes freight, trains, and airplanes, accounts for around thirty percent of all heat-trapping gas emissions.

The Australian Automobile Association will on Monday release results from emissions and fuel consumption tests on 30 passenger and light commercial vehicles showing discrepancies between real world and official fuel consumption established in laboratory testing.
But the environment movement is preparing a campaign of its own, with the Australian Conservation Foundation urging its supporters to contact their state car clubs to demand groups like the RACV, NRMA, RACQ, RAA, RAC, RACT and AANT, support strong pollution standards for cars.
Green groups say the latest testing push by the motoring lobby is a delaying tactic.
The skirmish signposts the next big battle in energy policy, with the Turnbull government considering whether to introduce new vehicle pollution standards as part of measures to reduce emissions in sectors of the economy beyond the electricity sector.
While the government unveiled its electricity strategy last week, it is still mulling its approach to the rest of the economy with a review of current climate policy, and the vehicles process, which is in gestation through a ministerial forum.
Now that the government has determined that electricity should reduce its emissions by 26% on 2005 levels by 2030 as a pro-rata share to meet Australia’s commitments under the Paris target – the next challenge will be to set up emissions reductions measures for the rest of the economy, and do that at a time when emissions are rising in industrial energy, transport, industrial heat and agriculture.
Emissions projections from the Department of Environment and Energy show transport emissions increased 52% between 1990 to 2015, and they are projected to rise a further 9% above the 2015 levels to 2030.
Earlier this year, the government released a series of proposed targets for vehicles in discussion papers to seeking input from industry. Under the strongest target considered, new cars would have to cut their CO2 emissions by 45% below current levels by 2025 – from 192g of CO2 a kilometre to 105g.
The AAA claims a “clear link” between more stringent vehicle standards and increasing fuel consumption discrepancy. The AAA’s report says as CO2 standards in Europe are becoming “more and more stringent” manufacturers are deploying technologies that are optimised for the laboratory drive cycle.
The motoring body says current vehicle testing, which happens in laboratories, has led to consumers being given inaccurate information about fuel consumption and environmental performance in popular models.
“Popular cars on the Australian market are using up to 59% more fuel than advertised and emitting more than seven times the legal limit of some noxious emissions,” said the AAA’s chief executive, Michael Bradley.
Bradley said as emissions standards tightened, “the gap between laboratory results and real-world results is widening, meaning consumers and the environment are increasingly being ripped off.”
The AAA says it wants a “real world” emissions test program for new cars, which would be modelled on the European standard, but modified slightly to take account of Australian conditions.
It says more stringent emissions laws are meant to reduce pollution and drive down fuel use, but real world testing suggests “such benefits largely occur only in the laboratory.”
However, the project manager of ClimateWorks Australia, Claire Painter said Australian motoring bodies were “misleading consumers” by seeking to delay the introduction of standards until there was a better national emissions testing regime.
“The Australian Automobile Association continues to highlight discrepancies between on-road and in-lab performance of vehicles as a means of stymying attempts to improve the overall efficiency of Australian cars,” Painter said.
“While it is important to improve emissions testing to provide greater clarity to consumers, it should not be used as a pretext for delaying the introduction of vehicle emissions standards which deliver real fuel savings to motorists.”
ClimateWorks says if the government introduced the most stringent vehicle standard currently in contemplation, motorists would benefit from annual additional fuel savings of up to $519 for an average passenger vehicle driver or $666 for a light commercial vehicle driver.
As part of efforts to counter the lobbying by the motoring sector, the chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation, Kelly O’Shanassy, has already written to the heads of the state motoring clubs asking whether the AAA’s position on climate pollution standards represent their own.
“I reckon Australians will be shocked that the organisations they trust to get them out of a jam when their car breaks down now appear to be trying to undermine the implementation of the toughest climate pollution standards,” O’Shanassy said.
“Of course we need rigorous testing of cars to make sure they are not polluting more than they should and the federal government is looking to introduce more accurate testing standards already being deployed in Europe,” she said.
“But this isn’t an excuse to stall the introduction of strong pollution and carbon emissions standards, in fact it’s a reason to go ahead without delay.”
A spokeswoman for the minister for urban infrastructure, Paul Fletcher, said the government would look at the AAA’s data through the ministerial forum on vehicle emissions “which will work systemically through a range of issues and offers an opportunity to assess the merits of real-world testing”.
She said Australia currently operated within an international testing system, and introducing an Australia specific real-world emissions tests would increase costs for motorists.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/23/call-for-vehicle-testing-overhaul-as-australias-emissions-fight-moves-to-roads

Correct.
I have better things to do with my time than to feed trolls.
If you're actually curious, look up the effects of current acidification on oyster beds and coral reefs. Oyster farmers already need to dump alkaline materials into their bays to counter the acidification that is making their oysters fail to thrive.
The effects of a reduced pH are complex, vary from species to species (helping some and harming others), and vary depending on the life stage -- gametes, zygotes, embryos, larvae, juveniles, etc.

James Hansen is a great scientist, with an illustrious track record and a truly impressive background in research on climate. Thus far we are agreed.
But that is in his professional “business” life.
As a person, Hansen is a climate activist with quite extreme views on risk - or perhaps he believes that exaggeration is necessary to convince others of at least some of what he believes the future holds. His activism is sufficient for him to have been arrested for taking part in a demonstration, and he feels that this level of activism is right. Observing the inner man, one does have to ask oneself about objectivity, given the nature of his views.
In addition, as you are aware, he has a view that we are severely underestimating potential sea level rise, but has failed to get anything published that would see this get past peer review.

Typically deniers will attack scientists, since they can't attack the clear science, so let me remind you of who Hansen is.
He ran what is arguably the planet's most prestigious Earth science organization on the planet for over 3 decades, NASA's GISS.
Please note the following from a New Yorker article by the Pulitzer-Prize winning author Elizabeth Kolbert about James Hansen:
BQSTART
From early on, the significance of Hansen’s insights was recognized by the scientific community. “The work that he did in the seventies, eighties, and nineties was absolutely groundbreaking,” Spencer Weart, a physicist turned historian who has studied the efforts to understand climate change, told me. He added, “It does help to be right.” 
“I have a whole folder in my drawer labelled ‘Canonical Papers, ’ Michael Oppenheimer, a climate scientist at Princeton, said. “About half of them are Jim’s.”

“James Hansen spoke to this in the Guardian in April, 2016.”
BQENDEric, I read that article and was amused at how other media might have received it, and potentially altered the title.
The Private Eye would have been likely to have had a headline that said something like “I Am NOT An Alarmist, says noted Alarmist”. Having subsequently failed to get a paper that claimed multi-metre sea level rise by 2100 past peer review, he instead took advantage of the subsequent media interviews to make it clear what he meant by “non-linear” sea level rise, which you subsequently picked up on in the related comment thread.', u'recommendation_count': u'2', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1508948320000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'13022945', u'in_reply_to': u'107278133', u'id': u'107327074', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'AvMichelCroz', u'text': u'Fiona, it has been hard work tracking down any fundamental research papers. There is layer after layer of meta-research, with the fundamental stuff requiring a lot of patience to dig through to. In the layer after layer of re-quoting, worrying opinions are repeated and amplified, but their basis becomes increasingly obscure.
For example, there is mention of shells dissolving, and identification of species at risk. The reader is drawn to the conclusion that this is a problem of acidity, and is general. Then one looks at the species concerned and realises that there is an issue of their location. Then one looks at where the problems of “dissolution” are occurring, and it turns out that this is a rather more complex issue than acidity - it is related to the extent to which particular volumes of water are saturated with aragonite (a particular form of mineralisation of calcium carbonate). The key link with climate change, in this phenomenon, is the change in wind patterns that may be varying the amount of upwelling volumes of water unsaturated in aragonite and also changing their locations - potentially affecting species that are sensitive to such changes. 
Obviously there is a link to warming, but I have found difficulty in tracking down any papers that directly report research that shows shell dissolution due to acid corrosion. Other than some older research that made the convenient choice of HCl to acidity the water, and dropped the pH well below anything that might reasonably be expected to generally apply. Many papers report this information in ways that suggests that acidity is actually the issue. I had intended to provide a long list of the relevant papers, but now the uni library computer appears to be down for maintenance and I am out of patience.
Other than that - definitely agreed that there is a problem with persistent plastics in our oceans. Yet another unfortunate consequence of lack of foresight and a lack of a suitably responsible overview. The makers of the bottles and plastic bags, etc presumably couldn’t care less where they end up. The supermarkets who have found them more profitable than recycleable glass or more degradable alternatives, obviously did not care enough to do anything about it. Similarly the overly-robust wipes and other paper and fabric products that are resistant to breakdown. Amongst other things, I am desperately concerned that it is only the likes of the EU that sets a priority on dealing with issues of this nature, and that the UK will be slower to take any suitable corrective action once Brexit has occurred.
The effects of a variety of other persistent chemicals, for example endocrine disrupters (hormone mimics) must not be underestimated, and we are perhaps yet to see what the accumulation of persistent glycophosphates may be capable of doing in larger bodies of water - it would not be a surprise to see them accumulating & concentrating in some as yet unsuspected food chain. Our garden has still not recovered from the use of some horse manure from animals that had eaten pasture that had been sprayed - it sterilised the vegetable bed that we put it on & it would not even grow a decent weed.
If only we were able to concentrate our efforts in ways that achieve proportionate and realistic responses. Sadly, on reading articles with titles like this one, the layperson could be forgiven for thinking that shutting down the coal fired power station will deal with all our ills. A combination of “bad news fatigue” and lack of understanding means that people lack the patience to even worry about the consequences when one more plastic bag would make carrying the veggies to the car that bit easier.

BQENDI agree that we are having some pretty devastating effects on the planet. But, the fact that you have made this comment on a thread relating to CO2 suggests that you are attributing these worrying rates of species decline to climate change.
Do you have any facts that would clarify that, please? It would be a shame to take urgent action to fix climate only to find that this was not the cause.
Indeed, only just in the last couple of days, The Guardian has published several stories about the damage we are doing with pesticides. Also the (hopefully imminent) action the EU is intending to take against persistent herbicides of the glycophosphate type. These both appear to have been devastating - but they are not actually climate. Nicotinamides appear to be linked to devastating damage to bee numbers. But again not actually climate. Similarly the damage to the Amazon, deforestation everywhere, intensive irrigation and the growing of thoroughly unsuitable crops that require far more water than naturally available - same comment.
So please provide any evidence you have that what you call the “6th extinction” is in any way related to climate change that has already occurred.

“Your continued ignorance is astounding, I have read many science text books over many years of study at school and university, including chemistry. I learned that in a neutralisation reaction an acid and a base react quantitatively with each other, in water a neutralization reaction results in no excess hydrogen or hydroxide ions in the solution.”
BQENDReinhard, it is unusual to see this sort of “trash talk” as part of a sensible discussion on a very simple point on chemistry. I will not say that the point is a simple one, because of course Haber was awarded a Nobel prize for his work on acidity.
I am presuming that you are not first language English, and so will keep this simple.

If % change in concentration were genuinely meaningful, why is it not in normal scientific use - and the reason is that the standard (and accepted) measurement is pH.

What does pH mean?
It stands for ""potential of hydrogen"".
pH is defined as the decimal logarithm of the reciprocal of the hydrogen ion activity, aH+, in a solution.

My layman estimation.4. The idea that all men are equal and have the same rights is Western European.5. The scientific method which is so strange even now in religious civilizations.6. The protection of environment, care for wild nature, I think is a feature of the Western civilization which, in my stupid view, is not only different from other civilizations but is also better!The Chinese, Arabs, Indians I’ve met in Africa were only trying to hunt on my farm and around, to fish even the small fish, to hunt for any rabbits they can see, to throw all the garbage in the nature, to be ready to apply the worst pesticides on their agricultural endeavors and generally to see the nature as having less rights and secondary to them, the MEN. The African population sees no problem do throw the garbage, to litter. I talked to the chiefs and elders many,many, many times and I said:” Why don’t you do a hole in the ground, put there the garbage and burn it one time a month?”. “ Why don’t you clean the sewage from time to time?

Ocean acidification is progressing rapidly around the world, new research has found, and its combination with the other threats to marine life is proving deadly. Many organisms that could withstand a certain amount of acidification are at risk of losing this adaptive ability owing to pollution from plastics, and the extra stress from global warming.
The conclusions come from an eight-year study into the effects of ocean acidification which found our increasingly acid seas – a byproduct of burning fossil fuels – are becoming more hostile to vital marine life.
“Since ocean acidification happens extremely fast compared to natural processes, only organisms with short generation times, such as micro-organisms, are able to keep up,” the authors of the study Exploring Ocean Change: Biological Impacts of Ocean Acidification found.
Marine life such as crustaceans and organisms that create calcified shelters for themselves in the oceans were thought to be most at risk, because acid seas would hinder them forming shells. However, the research shows that while these are in danger, perhaps surprisingly, some – such as barnacles – are often unaffected, while the damage from acidification is also felt much higher up the food chain, into big food fish species.
Ocean acidification can reduce the survival prospects of some species early in their lives, with knock-on effects. For instance, the scientists found that by the end of the century, the size of Atlantic cod in the Baltic and Barents Sea might be reduced to only a quarter of the size they are today, because of acidification.
Peter Thomson, UN ambassador for the oceans and a diplomat from Fiji, which is hosting this year’s UN climate change conference in Bonn, urged people to think of the oceans in the same terms as they do the climate. “We are all aware of climate change, but we need to talk more about ocean change, and the effects of acidification, warming, plastic pollution, dead zones and so on,” he said. “The world must know that we have a plan to save the ocean. What is required over the next three years is concerted action.”
The eight-year study was carried out by the Biological Impacts of Ocean Acidification group (known as Bioacid), a German network of researchers, with the support of the German government, and involved more than 250 scientists investigating how marine life is responding to acidification, and examining research from around the world. The study was initiated well before governmentssigned a global agreement on climate change at Paris in 2015, and highlights how the Paris agreement to hold warming to no more than 2C may not be enough to prevent further acidification of the world’s seas.
Governments will meet in Bonn in November to discuss the next steps on the road to fulfilling the requirements of the Paris agreement, and the researchers are hoping to persuade attendees to take action on ocean acidification as well.
Ocean acidification is another effect of pouring carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, as the gas dissolves in seawater to produce weak carbonic acid. Since the industrial revolution, the average pH of the ocean has been found to have fallen from 8.2 to 8.1, which may seem small but corresponds to an increase in acidity of about 26%. Measures to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide reaching the atmosphere can help to slow down this process, but only measures that actively remove carbon already in the atmosphere will halt it, because of the huge stock of carbon already in the air from the burning of fossil fuels.
Worse still, the effects of acidification can intensify the effects of global warming, in a dangerous feedback loop. The researchers pointed to a form of planktonic alga known as Emiliania huxleyi, which in laboratory experiments was able to adapt to some extent to counter the negative effects acidification had upon it. But in a field experiment, the results were quite different as the extra stresses present at sea meant it was not able to form the extensive blooms it naturally develops. As these blooms help to transport carbon dioxide from the surface to the deep ocean, and produce the gas dimethyl sulfide that can help suppress global warming, a downturn in this species “will therefore severely feed back on the climate system”.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/23/ocean-acidification-deadly-threat-to-marine-life-finds-eight-year-study

Now liberals would like to argue...why don’t we give a legal status to all entrants to the US surely that would solve the problem of having people falling into the shadow economy. 
If the US was to give legal status to all people entering the US it would create the biggest population tsunami with half of Central America and South America trying to enter the US overnight.

Actually, the state of Yucatan formed its own republic, and the states of Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas formed the Republic of Rio Grande, albeit both of these only briefly as Santa Anna quickly and brutally cracked down. Texans also formed their own republic (both those of Anglo and those of Hispanic descent). The former republics were brought down by Santa Anna almost immediately, but in Texas, he was defeated and Texas remained independent until its petition for annexation.

Historical revisionism. Slavery was an issue, but not the issue.

In case you forgot your history, in 1835 Santa Anna dissolved the Mexican Congress and established what was, essentially, a military dictatorship. Santa Anna's response was brutal. In Zacatecas, after putting down the local rebellion, he permitted his troops to burn, rape and pillage for two days after. Next on the list of rebellious states to be put down was Coahuila y Tejas, where he met his match.

They didn’t have a particular destination, other than street corners and parking lots. They were looking for day laborers and construction workers, a workforce often seen in Houston but rarely felt. They were driving to places where these workers gathered each morning in search of work to rebuild the city after Hurricane Harvey.
As the car wound through streets lined with mountains of furniture, countertops, and ruined clothing, someone would occasionally spot small groups who looked like they might be waiting for work. Many spoke only Spanish, and the organizers knew that these men and women could soon face dangerous and even deadly working conditions in homes and businesses across the city. The car pulled over so organizers could talk, listen and educate them on their labor rights.
They spoke to men using shopping carts to haul sheetrock debris out of ruined homes and apartment complexes with their bare hands. Others were demolishing rotted, moldy structures without respirators or safety equipment.
At one apartment complex, they learned residents were in the process of being evicted because they could not pay rent in the wake of the devastation. Jose Oriames, a worker removing debris from the complex, said his boss refused to pay him or his crew for that day until they came back tomorrow to throw away more debris.
After navigating 150 miles of Houston streets over three days, the organizers had talked to more than a hundred men and women, but they knew larger challenges loomed for Houston’s construction workforce.
Even before Harvey, it was already tough being a construction worker in Houston. A construction worker dies on the job in Texas every three days. Those who survive often endure dangerous working conditions, and are denied overtime pay for poverty level wages. A recent study done with the University of Illinois found 40% of Houston construction workers do not have access to any form of benefits such as health care, paid sick leave, or even workers’ compensation. 
Nationally, construction workers are facing new challenges: Donald Trump’s Department of Labor has already established troubling ties to the construction industry, with opponents of worker protections gaining a louder voice. 
Even pre-Harvey, it was tough in the Houston construction industry – a worker dies on the job in Texas every three days
In Texas, however, the industry’s successful drive to dismantle such protections has been a reality for decades. There’s a reason Texas is the only state that doesn’t require any form of workers’ compensation insurance coverage, and it’s not because working families want it that way.
Undocumented immigrant families are especially exposed. Roughly half of Texas construction workers are undocumented, and these individuals often have no choice but to accept the industry’s worst abuses silently. Working men and women who attempt to recover their wages or request safety equipment from their bosses are routinely fired or threatened with deportation.
While industry leaders in Texas are the first to say they need undocumented workers to build our homes, roads, and cities, their support depends on maintaining poverty wages and bare-bones regulations.
The already dire working conditions in the Texas construction industry have worsened since Trump’s recent immigration crackdown, and since the state’s governor, Greg Abbott, signed senate bill 4 into law this spring. SB4, as it is known, turns police officers and sheriffs into an arm of Trump’s deportation force. Although it’s in legal limbo, the law has already had a chilling effect, leading many construction workers to leave for other states.
There is a better path. We opened our first Houston office earlier this year, and we are identifying and developing worker leaders to build power and win collective change. Since Harvey, working men and women have already reached out for help. 
One woman contacted us when she and her crew, after spending more than 90 hours clearing out a Holiday Inn, were turned away without pay. Using flood maps and news articles, we are surveying the ground to find out where more construction workers are doing demolition and rebuilding.
There was a time in Texas when progress was out of reach. But in recent years, this kind of painstaking work has helped win wage and safety protections for hundreds of thousands of Texans. For example, in 2015 construction workers in Dallas joined together to win the right to a rest break that would have been unheard of years earlier.
Organizers will continue tohighlight the stories of immigrant construction workers, and advocate for new policies that ensure good, safe jobs with living wages and lead to careers in construction.
As Harvey’s floodwaters recede, Houston will either become a poster child for the construction industry’s worst abuses, or it will emerge as a model for construction work as it could be. Until then, we plan on putting a lot more miles on our cars.

The scientists were expected to discuss in Providence on Monday a report on the health of Narragansett Bay, New England’s largest estuary. The EPA did not explain exactly why the scientists were told not to.
“EPA supports the Narragansett Bay Estuary and just this month provided the program a $600,000 grant,” EPA spokeswoman Nancy Grantham said in a statement on Monday. “EPA scientists are attending, they simply are not presenting. It is not an EPA conference.”
Thomas Borden, program director of the Narragansett Bay Estuary Program, which published the report, said Wayne Munns, director of the EPA’s Atlantic Ecology Division, called him on Friday afternoon to say two staffers who work out of its research lab in the town of Narragansett had been advised that they could not attend on Monday. 
Munns did not give him an explanation, but Borden said he understood that the decision came from EPA headquarters in Washington.
One of the staffers, Autumn Oczkowski, was scheduled to give the keynote speech at an afternoon workshop. Another, Rose Martin, was scheduled to speak on a panel.
“We’ve been working with more than five researchers in that lab who have contributed substantial elements to our report,” Borden said.
After Munns’ call, he said, he checked with a third researcher who consults for the EPA, Emily Shumchenia, and who was scheduled to participate in Monday’s event.
“I advised her, you should check with your folks and see if you should attend,” Borden said. “She was advised by EPA region one that she should not attend.”
The report finds that climate change is affecting air and water temperatures, precipitation, sea level and fish.
Borden said scientists from a variety of agencies and institutions had been working for years on the 500-page technical document, the purpose of which is to examine the condition of the bay and the trends with data on 24 environmental indicators. Those include stressors such as population, and also climate change, such as warming temperatures, increased precipitation and increased sea level rise.
“It’s a comprehensive scientific update of the status of the bay,” he said. “It’s not a policy document. It’s a scientific report. It doesn’t propose policy changes.”
All four members of Rhode Island’s congressional delegation were scheduled to attend a news conference on the report on Monday morning. Democratic senator Jack Reed criticized the EPA move, which was first reported by the New York Times.
“Muzzling EPA scientists won’t do anything to address climate change,” Reed said. “While the Trump administration tries to suppress the facts, the American people are seeing and feeling the real world impacts. 
“We need to work on a bipartisan basis to reduce pollution and emissions, and this type of hostility toward science inhibits rather than furthers discussion and action.”
The estuary program gets all its funding from the EPA.
John King, a University of Rhode Island professor of oceanography who chairs the science advisory committee of the Narragansett Bay Estuary Program, told the Times: “It’s definitely a blatant example of the scientific censorship we all suspected was going to start being enforced at EPA. 
“They don’t believe in climate change, so I think what they’re trying to do is stifle discussions of the impacts of climate change.”
Scott Pruitt, the former Oklahoma attorney general made EPA administrator by Donald Trump, has questioned accepted climate change science. 
Trump, who has among other actions has withdrawn the US from the Paris climate accord and scrapped Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan, famously said climate change was a “hoax” invented by China.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/23/epa-kept-scientists-from-speaking-about-climate-change-at-rhode-island-event

Uncertainty is often used by deniers to argue for business-as-usual energy policy.
But uncertainty cuts against us, as noted below from a conversation held a few months ago with Michael Mann and Richard Alley. A few comments by Alley below.

If we don’t change our ways we’re expecting something like 3 feet of sea level rise in the next century, and it could be 2 and it could be 4 and it could be 20. 
The chance that we will cross thresholds that commit us to loss of big chunks of West Antarctica and huge sea level rise is real.
So when you start doing “Well you’re not sure,” but there’s a chance of really bad things and the uncertainties are mostly on the bad side, could be a little better or a little worse or a lot worse, but we’ll be breaking things.

Some things do change gradually because of the inertia system. The global average temperature, if you average it over several years, is going up pretty smoothly, since the middle 1970s. January/February of this year, global temperature is now 1.3 degrees above the 1950-1980 average, but that was just two months. Averaged over the year, it’s going to be about 0.9 degrees Celsius, and that’s pretty much on this almost linear increase over the last four decades. 
Locally and regionally you get abrupt events, which are the ones that have the biggest impact on people. The frequency and severity of extreme events increase as the planet continues to get warmer. Sea level and ice-sheet disintegration is also a very nonlinear process. It’s going to lead to rapid change within the next several decades.
The other thing we point out is that the fresh water coming off of Greenland and Antarctica is affecting the ocean circulation. Normally in the winter at the polar regions, it gets cold, the salt in the ocean water gets dense, and will sink toward ocean bottom, and that drives this overturning ocean circulation or conveyor belt. I think there’s a danger that if we keep adding greenhouse gases, that we will get shutdown in the AMOC, Atlantic Meridian Overturning Circulation, sooner than the model indicates. It’s very interesting scientifically, but it’s very threatening.

For the most recent 10-year period, U.S. emissions declined by 622 million tons. This represents a 10% decline in carbon dioxide emissions over that time period. Once more, the UK was in 2nd place for this time period with a decline of 139 million tons (down 24% over the decade). China led all countries with an increase of 3.1 billion tons, which represented a 51% increase in China's carbon dioxide emissions over the past decade.

Nicaragua has already presented the relevant documents at the United Nations, Murillo, who is also first lady, said on local radio on Monday.
 “It is the only instrument we have in the world that allows the unity of intentions and efforts to face up to climate change and natural disasters,” Murillo said.
Donald Trump said in June he would withdraw the United States from the accord, and Nicaragua’s decision to enter the pact means only two countries will now be outside it – the world’s No 1 economy and war-torn Syria.
 Nicaragua, which is often threatened by hurricanes, was the only country to reject the agreement in 2015, and has argued for far more drastic action to limit rising temperatures.
 The Paris accord, agreed by nearly 200 countries two years ago, seeks to limit planetary warming by curbing global emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that scientists believe drive global warming.
 The administration of the former US president Barack Obama had pledged deep emissions cuts as part of the deal, but his successor, Trump, has said the accord would cost America trillions of dollars, kill jobs, and hinder the oil, gas, coal and manufacturing industries.
The island country of Fiji will preside over the next round of UN climate talks, from 6-17 November in Bonn, Germany, where environment ministers from around the world will work on a set of international guidelines for the Paris accord.
 The latest round of negotiations take place after a string of powerful hurricanes ravaged Caribbean island nations and caused billions of dollars in damage along the Texas and Florida coastlines.
 Climate scientists have said warmer air and water resulting from climate change may have contributed to the severity of the storms. The US Environmental Protection Agency has disputed such claims as an attempt to “politicize” natural disasters.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/23/nicaragua-joins-paris-climate-accord-us-trump-syria

The comments were made at the end of a speech at the Australian Council of Social Services conference in Melbourne on Tuesday. Asked how he saw the union movement surviving in the future, the Greens leader said unions functioned best when they were “independent.”
“It’s not for me to outline a future for the union movement except to say I think the union movement is strongest when it’s independent, making decisions that are in the interests of people and not in the interests of one side of politics or the other,” Di Natale said. 
“Some people will argue against that but I have always believed that the union movement is strongest when it is organising, collectively, to advance the interests of workers, and I don’t think that dedicating resources to robocalling constituents actually does much to advance that.”
The 2017 Acoss conference is themed around a vision of Australia in 2030, which Di Natale said would see a country that had begun to dismantle its current political system in order to better address the challenges posed by growing inequality and climate change. 
“We’re not going to be able to tackle climate change, tackle inequality, unless we start to dismantle the model that we have right now, neoliberal capitalism, and to really confront the assumptions that are built into it,” he said. 
Di Natale said the assumption that environmental concerns must always come at a personal cost to people should be debunked, particularly around renewable power generation.
“They’re heading in the same direction,” he said. “People are putting solar panels on their roofs, not because they want to help the environment – although that is often a fringe benefit – but ... because it brings the power prices down.”
He also addresed the need for greater diversity in parliament, saying he was proud disability advocate Jordon Steele-John was set to replace the WA senator Scott Ludlam in parliament, after Ludlam quit during the dual citizenship saga that also claimed Queensland senator Larissa Waters.
“We lost Scott and Larissa earlier this year but we’re going to see such an impressive young man, a young man living with cerebral palsy, who’s going to come into parliament to replace Scott soon,” he said. “And I tell you what, I can’t wait until I hear the sound of those saws and hammers in the Senate chamber because they have to install disability ramps.”
The Acoss conference will run for two days and issued speaking invitations to all three major political parties. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, will address the conference on Wednesday.
Earlier on Tuesday, the economist Saul Eslake warned of a looming crisis in retiree incomes as a greater proportion of people enter retirement either with a mortgage or living in rented accommodation.
“It’s a longstanding assumption of Australia’s retirement income system that the vast majority of retirees will have close to zero housing costs, either because they own their own homes outright, as historically more than 80% of retirees have done, or if they don’t then they will be accommodated in social or community housing where rents are fixed as a proportion of their relatively low income,” Eslake said. 
“That assumption has in turn allowed Australia to spend less on aged pensions than other countries with similar standards of living.”
Eslake said the next 15 years would see a continued decline in home ownership, combined with a projected increase in the number of people who still owe money on their mortgage.
“It will be rational for them to use what superannuation they have to pay off their mortgage, thus defeating the whole point of the tax-supported superannuation system.”
Eslake said tax reforms that make the property market less attractive to investors, such as removing negative gearing and winding back the capital gains discount, would allow more first home owners into the market and reduce pressure on rental accommodation.
He also advocated for removing the principal residence exemption from the pension assets test to encourage “more sensible use of land and discouraging overconsumption of owner-occupied housing by people in the final years of their life”.
Eslake said intergenerational inequality was one of the biggest issues facing Australia and was driven in large part by declining home ownership among people under the age of 55.
According to the 2016 census, rates of home ownership have declined to 65.5%, lower than any time since the census began in 1954. Since 1991, the rate of home ownership among households of people aged 25-34 has fallen 11 percentage points, while home ownership among households aged 35-44 has fallen 10 percentage points and home ownership among households of people aged 45-54 has fallen 9 percentage points.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/24/di-natale-tells-acoss-conference-unions-should-be-politically-independent

You're talking about letting people starve right? But it's actually your argument that makes no sense because food is a global commodity so there is no need for people to starve. 
However, what the World Bank is suggesting is that we divert some of our resources to using the water we have more effectively. This will increase global food production, and as they point out, women in drought areas have more children will actually help avoid over population.

In a new study, it said, the “shockingly large and often hidden” consequences of prolonged periods without rain threatened to stunt the growth of children and condemn them to a lifetime of poverty.
The report said the lost food production related to drought would feed more than 80 million people every day for a year, adding that while floods and storm surges had an immediate impact, droughts were “misery in slow motion”. 
The World Bank said women that were born in droughts bore the marks for their entire lives, growing up mentally and physically stunted, undernourished and unwell.
New data shows that women born during droughts had less access to education, had more children and were more likely to suffer from domestic violence. Problems caused by droughts were passed on to the next generation, leading to a vicious cycle of poverty.
Droughts reduce crop yields, forcing farmers to expand into nearby forests, the Bank said, adding: “Since forests act as a climate stabiliser and help regulate water supplies, deforestation decreases water supply and exacerbates climate change.” For firms, the economic cost of a drought was four times as big as a flood, it said.
Guangzhe Chen, senior director of the World Bank’s water global practice, said: “These impacts demonstrate why it is increasingly important that we treat water like the valuable, exhaustible, and degradable resource that it is. We need to better understand the impacts of water scarcity, which will become more severe due to growing populations and a changing climate.”
The World Bank said that many of the countries affected by drought overlapped with areas already facing large food deficits and that were classified as fragile, heightening the need to tackle the problem.
Its report recommended constructing new water storage and management infrastructure, coupled with a strategy to control the demand for water. It urged tougher regulation of utility companies operating in cities so that they are given incentives to invest and improve their performance. Safety nets should also be put in place to help families cope when droughts turned into economic shocks.
“If we don’t take deepening water deficits and the bigger and more frequent storms that climate change will bring seriously, we will find water scarcity spreading to new regions of the world, potentially exacerbating issues of violence, suffering, and migration,” said the report’s author Richard Damania. “Current methods for managing water are not up to the challenge. This sea-change will require a portfolio of policies that acknowledge the economic incentives involved in managing water from its source, to the tap, and back to its source.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/24/food-ruined-by-drought-could-feed-more-than-80m-a-day-says-world-bank

BBC Radio 4’s flagship news programme Today ran the item in August in which Lawson, interviewed by presenter Justin Webb, made the claim. The last three years have in fact seen successive global heat records broken.
The Today programme rejected initial complaints from listeners, arguing that Lawson’s stance was “reflected by the current US administration” and that offering space to “dissenting voices” was an important aspect of impartiality.
However, some listeners escalated their complaint and, in a letter seen by the Guardian, the BBC’s executive complaints unit now accepts the interview breached its guidelines on accuracy and impartiality.
The complaint centred on two statements by Lawson: that the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change “has confirmed that there has been no increase in extreme weather events” and “according to the official figures, during this past 10 years, if anything, mean global temperature, average world temperature, has slightly declined”.
The BBC complaints unit accepted that these statements “were, at the least, contestable and should have been challenged”. In fact the Global Warming Policy Forum itself, the campaign group chaired by Lawson, acknowledged on 13 August that the temperature data he was referring to was “erroneous” and not official. Senior scientists also declared that Lawson’s statement about extreme weather was wrong.
It is not the first time the Today programme has been censured by the BBC complaints unit for an interview with Lawson. A broadcast in February 2014 was judged to have “given undue weight to Lord Lawson’s views, and had conveyed a misleading impression of the scientific evidence on the matter”.
“I really thought the climate change debate had finished and that these voices of the very rich and well connected had lost relevance in the whole argument,” said Dr Tim Thornton, a recently retired GP from Yorkshire who made one of the complaints. “It’s fine that they don’t like the idea of climate change but they are on a par with flat-earthers.”
Thornton highlighted the claim that global temperatures had not risen: “Even a sixth-former would be able to tell you that wasn’t so. So the BBC interviewer, if they are talking about climate change, should have done a little bit of homework.”
In his letter to Thornton, Colin Tregear, the BBC complaints director, said: “I hope you’ll accept my apologies, on behalf of the BBC, for the breach of editorial standards you identified.” 
Bob Ward, the policy director of the Grantham research institute on climate change at the London School of Economics, welcomed the upholding of the complaint but said: “There needs to be a shift in BBC policy so that these news programmes value due accuracy as much as due impartiality.
“As well as taking account of the rights of marginal voices like Lord Lawson to be heard, the BBC should also take account of the harm that its audiences can experience from the broadcast of inaccurate information,” said Ward. “His inaccurate assertion that there has been no change in extreme weather was harmful to the programme’s listeners because they may have been misled into believing that they do not need to take precautions against the increasing risk of heatwaves and flooding from heavy rainfall in the UK.”
Lawson did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment. 
Neither the Global Warming Policy Forum or its charitable arm, the Global Warming Policy Foundation, disclose the source of their funding. On their websites, the groups state: “In order to make clear its complete independence, it does not accept gifts from either energy companies or anyone with a significant interest in an energy company.”
The programme in August featuring the interview with Lawson also included an interview with Al Gore, the former US vice-president and climate campaigner, who discussed his new film An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power, and another interview with the director Fisher Stevens, who made Before the Flood, also about climate change, starring Leonardo DiCaprio.
The BBC complaints team told Thornton that “the BBC accepts there is broad scientific agreement on climate change” and that “the global climate is changing and the change is predominantly manmade”. The complaints unit said a 2011 review by the BBC Trust had made clear “the requirement to avoid the impression a minority view stands on the same footing as the views of climate scientists”.
Simon Bullock of Friends of the Earth said: “It was a real choke-on-cornflakes interview, with Lord Lawson’s misleading climate denial views given undue weight and passing unchallenged. After this ruling hopefully the BBC will now move the climate debate on to how to stop our planet warming, not denying that it is happening.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/24/bbc-apologises-over-interview-climate-sceptic-lord-nigel-lawson

the global warming narrative that is simply a lie

The World Meteorological Organisation presents average global temperatures per decade, calculated from all the major datasets:
""The Global Climate 2001-2010, a decade of climate extremes"".
From that report -
2001-2010 14.47 deg C1991-2000 14.26 deg C1981-1990 14.12 deg C1971-1980 13.95 deg C1961-1970 13.93 deg C1951-1960 13.92 deg C1941-1950 13.95 deg C1931-1940 13.89 deg C1921-1930 13.76 deg C
The decadal chart is on P4 of the pdf, so you can read off the earlier decades.
It stops at 2010 because it was a report on the decade 2001-2010, published in 2011 - but the five warmest years of the modern record have all occurred since 2010.
In fact, all 16 years of the 21st century so far rank among the seventeen warmest on record (adding 1998 makes up the full 17)
What of 2017?
The Jan-Sept period of 2017 has been the second warmest J-S period in the modern record, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) - 0.87°C above the 20th century average for J-S of 14.1°C.

On Tuesday the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV) said it expected an 8% decrease in global wine production to 247m hectolitres for 2017.
The international producer group’s forecast foretells the worst global harvest since 1961, with the weather to blame, after vines in key wine-producing countries such as Italy and France were ravaged by both freakishly hot and cold weather.
A hectolitre is the equivalent to 133 standard wine bottles, so the fall in output predicted by the OIV equates to about 2.9bn fewer bottles in 2017. 
The headline figure is pulled down by an “annus horribilis” in western Europe, which is on track for its worst harvest in 36 years after vineyards were exposed to adverse weather conditions that included spring frosts and a summer heatwave.
The OIV blamed “extreme weather” conditions for a disastrous year for the world’s top three producers: Italy, France and Spain. Jean-Marie Aurand, director-general of the Paris-based OIV, said its projections showed world wine production in 2017 was on course for its lowest levels for several decades.
“This drop is the consequence of climate hazards,” said Aurand. “In the European Union extreme weather events – from frost to drought – significantly impacted 2017 wine production, which was historically low.”
The news is worse for fans of chianti and prosecco, with Italy the worst hit of the big three growers. Its output is predicted to slump 23% to 39.3m hectolitres this year. Its vineyards baked in temperatures of more than 40C in a summer heatwave nicknamed Lucifer. Important growing regions such as Tuscany, Sicily, Puglia and Umbria were among those affected by the searing temperatures.
There is also pain in store for French wine buffs as the OIV predicts a 19% fall in France’s output to 36.7m hectolitres. In Spain production is also expected to fall – by 15%, to 33.5m hectolitres.
In April sharp spring frosts, which also hit British growers, damaged production in some of France’s most famous winemaking regions, including Champagne, Bordeaux and Burgundy. The bad weather dealt a fresh blow to the French industry, which had also endured a difficult 2016, with output falling 10% on the back of adverse weather conditions.
The shortfall is bad news for British oenophiles who regularly drop bottles of wine in their shopping trolley as inflation bites into living standards. “Prices for consumers will inevitably rise,” said Miles Beale, chief executive of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association (WSTA).
“It’s a keen reminder that wine production remains at the mercy of the weather. As the biggest per capita importer of wine in an international market, the UK is bound to feel the effects of an increasingly challenging market.”
Wine lovers are already experiencing a Brexit-related hangover, with the price of the average bottle pushed up by the weakness of sterling since last year’s vote, as well as this year’s 3.9% duty hike. As a result the average price of a bottle of wine sold in the UK is now £5.58, up 4% on 2016, with the WSTA calling on the chancellor to freeze wine duty in next month’s budget.
“UK wine businesses have already had to contend with the sharp devaluation in sterling, rising inflation and uncertainty following the Brexit vote – all of which add cost to companies making wine available to the UK’s 30 million consumers,” said Beale. “The last thing UK wine businesses or British consumers need now is another rise in excise duty.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/24/global-wine-production-predicted-to-slump-to-50-year-low

I lived in NZ during the time Howard was prime minister.
Living abroad and looking back towards Australia provided a very startling perspective. Australia is a regional bully frankly. 
And if we were regional bullies then, we need to acknowledge just what we are now. Our human rights record and treatment of asylum seekers and refugees is criminal. We have our offshore GULAGS which have sponsored rapes, murders, suicides and violence. The majority of Australians refuse to acknowledge that.
And we are treating our nearest international neighbour extremely badly - destroying a relationship that has very few parallels globally.
We should note that the LNP IPA again have a hand in that. Julie Bishop's intemperate comments as a foreign minister set the scene and given the beginnings of push-back from NZ we will see a deterioration in this relationship.

Jacinda Ardern, due to be sworn in as prime minister on Thursday, said visiting Australia “as soon as possible” would be a priority for her, after tensions between the New Zealand Labour party and the Australian government emerged during the campaign.
Previous New Zealand prime ministers John Key and Bill English described the trans-Tasman relationship as “like family” and “cousins”, but Ardern has been cooler in her descriptions and hinted she is ready to stand up to New Zealand’s bigger, brasher and richer neighbour. Here we take a look at how new policies announced by the New Zealand government yesterday may have an impact on relations across the ditch. 
The fiery New Zealand First leader, Winston Peters, has been rewarded with the deputy prime ministership and foreign affairs portfolios for throwing his weight behind Labour to form a government, despite them winning less seats than National.
Peters served as foreign minister in a confidence-and-supply deal with the 2005 Labour government, and caused waves on the international scene with his frequently undiplomatic and acerbic comments. “I think we can’t deny it, in 2017 and our relationship is not what it should be,” Peters said on Wednesday. New Zealand and Australia needed to put their “cards on the table, and being honest would be a good start”. 
In August Bishop, the Australian foreign minister, accused the New Zealand Labour party of colluding with the Australian Labor party and digging up information on the dual citizenship of deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce.
At the time Bishop said she would find it “very difficult to build trust” with a Labour-led government, and Ardern hit back, accusing the Australian government of spreading lies. She said she had discussed with the Australian high commissioner her “disappointment” with the accusations, and criticised Bishop’s “false claims”.
After Labour’s win, Bishop said Ardern had offered an explanation “about the conduct of one of her colleagues whom I had criticised and she said [it] was wrong and inappropriate … I have accepted her explanation”. Malcolm Turnbull said there was no need for Bishop to apologise. Most of Ardern’s negotiations will be with Turnbull and the two have already spoken. But Bishop and Ardern are bound to meet soon and that will be … interesting.
Winston Peters has frequently been charged with racism, and has called New Zealand “the last Asian colony”. Peters said it was New Zealand’s lax border controls that had allowed so many migrants to enter Australia through the back door of New Zealand in the 1990s and early 2000s and that the country deserved an apology to help get relations back on track.
On the other hand, Labour has pledged to challenge Australia over its “draconian” detention of New Zealanders, with the Labour deputy leader and new corrections minister, Kelvin Davis, particularly passionate about the treatment and detention of New Zealanders on Christmas Island. He visited the facility in 2015 to advocate for the release of New Zealand detainees and called their detention “nonsense”, saying they suffered from beatings and food shortages. 
 “Those fences and gates that are keeping people in are also keeping real scrutiny out,” he said at the time. 
Davis told Radio New Zealand last month that a Labour government planned to hold “upfront and honest” conversations with Australia regarding its tough and “inhumane” immigration policies. “Where their laws contravene any sorts of human rights, we need to have those discussions with them,” he said.
“It needs to be out there. It needs to brought up again. It’s a big thing and it needs to be talked about. It needs to be sorted. But we really do have to have those strong conversations with them to make sure New Zealanders in Australia aren’t being abused by draconian laws.”
Currently there are more than 150 New Zealanders detained in Australian under its 501 immigration laws.
Ever since the Tampa crisis when New Zealand – led by Labour’s Helen Clark – accepted 150 refugees who Australia refused, New Zealand has been quietly critical of Australia’s refugee policies. The new Labour government plans to double its refugee quota to 1,500 in three years.
Australia can also expect Greens MP Golriz Ghahraman to be an active advocate for refugee rights in Australia and New Zealand, as she is the first refugee to be elected to New Zealand parliament.
Plans by Australia to triple the cost of tertiary study for New Zealanders studying in Australian institutions have been met with a hard line by Ardern, who said if Australia implemented those changes, Australian students wishing to study in New Zealand could expect the same treatment. “If we do find New Zealanders aren’t able to access tertiary education the same way as Australians currently do, there will be flow-on effects here,” Ardern said on Sunday. 
Under the new government, New Zealand students will receive NZ$50-a-week boost to their student allowance, and three years’ free tertiary study or training will be phased in from 2018. If there are no tit-for-tat measures, Australians will be eligible for the above conditions as well as social benefits and healthcare if they choose to study in New Zealand.
The new Labour government has made battling climate change a priority, with Ardern calling it her generation’s “nuclear-free moment”. That could contrast with Australia’s grindingly slow progress. The new government has pledged to set a target of net zero for greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, establish a climate change commission, restore the emissions trading scheme, significantly boost funding for the department of conservation and plant 100 million trees.
The Green party, with eight MPs elected to parliament, have a confidence-and-supply agreement with Labour. The Green party will manage the climate change, conservation and women portfolios. It is the first time the Greens have been in government in New Zealand.
The new New Zealand government wants to remain part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership but plans to introduce a ban on foreign buyers purchasing existing New Zealand homes. Foreigners – including Australians – who already have rights to live in New Zealand, would be excluded from the ban.
Ardern said her government wished to remain part of the TPP but cooling the housing market was a priority. Peters is on the record as opposing the TPP but it is not mentioned in the formal agreement between Labour and New Zealand First.
One of Ardern’s first overseas trips as prime minister will be to Vietnam in November to attend the Apec leaders forum in which she will be aiming to renegotiate some details of the proposed TPP. 
“I refuse to accept they’re mutually exclusive,” she told the Q+A program on Sunday. “Our view is that it will be possible to balance our desire to make sure that we provide housing within our domestic housing market that’s affordable by easing demand and banning foreign speculators from buying domestic homes, whilst meeting our trade goals as well.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/25/australian-new-zealand-divisions-exposed-as-ardern-takes-tougher-stance

“If we don’t address these issues... we will be moving to a dark future” in 50 years, she told a major economic conference in the Saudi capital Riyadh on Tuesday.
Lagarde said that “we will be toasted, roasted and grilled” if the world fails to take “critical decisions” on climate change.
In 2015, around 195 nations signed the Paris climate agreement which set out goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, so as to prevent temperatures rising by more than two degrees in around 50 years.
But US President Donald Trump announced in June the start of a three-year process to pull out of the pact, arguing that it would put the US at an economic disadvantage.
His move faced fierce criticism from world leaders and activists, with former UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon accusing Trump of “standing on the wrong side of history”.
Lagarde also called for tackling inequality between men and women and countries that are “haves” and those that are “have nots”.
If the world wants a future that “looks like utopia and not dystopia”, it needs to address such concerns, Lagarde said. She predicted that in 50 years’ time, oil will be a secondary commodity.
In a statement following her visit, Lagarde praised Saudi reform efforts and moves to address the economic effects of persistently low oil prices.
“Saudi Arabia is also undertaking reforms to reduce constraints to women entering the workforce,” Lagarde said in the statement, pointing to a recent decision to allow women to drive.
Female entrepreneurship could be boosted through fiscal incentives and other policies, she added.

""The likely cool greenhouse in which about half of Antarctica is still ice-covered means devastation from the tens of meters sea level is likely to rise (e.g., Ward, 2010), and poleward shifting of warm climate belts.""
So the appropriate term for what's likely to happen is a 'cool greenhouse', which sounds harmless, but is not.
It's a very interesting paper.
How quickly?
Another quote:
""a cool greenhouse seems imminent within perhaps a century or two.""
However, although those conditions could set in within that time, the process of melting half of the ice on Antarctica would take around 1000 years.
Meanwhile the
""poleward shifting of warm climate belts.""
means that the equatorial regions will become increasingly inhospitable.
Humans rely on just five grain species for a lot of their calories.

we are in approaching an interglacial maximum
BQEND
No, that was thousands of years ago.
The Earth warmed out of the last glacial stage until around 9,000 years ago.
Then the temperature was (nearly) stable for about 4,000 years - this is called the Mid-Holocene Climatic Optimum, or Mid-Holocene Warm Period.
Then, about 5,000 years ago, it began to cool very very slowly - until humans began to add lots of CO2 to the air as the Industrial Revolution developed.
Then it started to warm quickly, reversing the cooling trend.
Temperatures at points in the Mid-Holocene Climatic Optimum might have been (just about) as warm as in the later 20th century, but only in the summer and only in the northern hemisphere.
Now, in the early 21st century, the Earth is quite possibly warmer than any time since the Eemian interglacial over 115,000 years ago.
The Eemian was warmer than the Holocene because of higher insolation conditions.
Glacial inception requires summer temperatures in the northern hemisphere to be low enough for snow to build up year on year, starting mainly on north-facing slopes of mountain ranges.
""Determining the natural length of the current interglacial"" - Tzedakis et al, 2012
reports that the end of the current interglacial would occur within the next 1500 years, if atmospheric CO2 concentrations did not exceed 240±5 ppmv.
But CO2 was already above 240 ppm before the Industrial Revolution (which may be related to the development of agriculture, which disrupted the carbon cycle)
It's most unlikely that we are facing a glacial readvance at any time in the near future* - the current level of CO2 has taken us out of that kind of situation.

I'm not sure why this relates to any of my comments.
The Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age were concepts introduced about 50 years ago by early climate researchers, particularly Hubert Lamb, based on evidence available at that time, but the more they are investigated the more ephemeral they become.
Various sources give different dates for the start and end of the LIA, for example, and it's increasingly disputed that it was a global event.
Many researchers now think the whole concept of the 'Little Ice Age' is misleading as the changes were small-scale and seasonal.
For example, true ice ages involve snow remaining throughout summers across large areas, which didn't happen during the so-called Little Ice Age.
Glacial inception requires summer temperatures in the northern hemisphere to be low enough for snow to build up year on year, starting mainly on north-facing slopes of mountain ranges.
As for the MWP -

""The Medieval Warm Period was certainly not a global event and probably didn't even span the entire North Atlantic region,"" said Nicolás Young, a glacial geologist at Columbia University who was the lead author of the study, in an interview about that research. 
""These glaciers were almost just as big during the Medieval Warm Period as they were during the Little Ice Age in the Baffin Bay and Labrador Sea region,"" Young said. ""It probably wasn't all that warm during the Medieval Warm Period.""

No. I would not be gloating and besides, a 2C fall would not be anything to celebrate.
My position is that we are in approaching an interglacial maximum and temperatures will rise - and fall - for anything up to 10 000 years, give or take a few ka.
I have no real interest in the so-called 'climate change industries' but what I will say, is that that the attention given to so-called AGW deflects from other, much more pressing concerns of global environmental degradation. CO2 is just one component of the whole biosphere which we are light-years away from understanding.
It's quite possible that humanity is on the brink of extinction. That's where I'm coming from.

The model-based method suggested at least a 13-fold increase (with 90% confidence) due to human influences on the climate, whilst the observation-based approach suggested at least a 22-fold increase in the probability of very warm years in the climate of today compared with the climate of a century ago (again with 90% confidence). 
""Both of our approaches showed that there is a significant and substantial increase in the likelihood of very warm years occurring in central England,"" Dr King Continued.
According to the CET, 2014 was the warmest year on record in central England. It has been reported that during the last 60 years there has been rapid warming in the CET in line with the anthropogenic influence on the climate, with the highest average annual temperature of 10.93 °C recorded in 2014.

If anything could prove AGW, it would have happened by now, don't you think? The mountain of evidence is largely circumstantial. 
For example; did CO2 increase with temperatures during the MWP or fall with the Little Ice Age?

Some of the so-called climate sceptics do keep demanding evidence, but ignore over 200 years of published research.
They are not actually sceptics looking for evidence.
Real sceptics have carried out a full investigation of climate change.
They set up a project called Berkeley Earth in 2010.
They found independent funding, including from sceptics in the business community.
Many so-called climate sceptics said this was exactly what they wanted, and they would accept what BE reported.
The first phase of the project took about 2 years.
When BE then reported that their research agreed with other researchers that:
- the Earth is warming;
- has been since the 19th century;
- and that greenhouse gases produced by human activity are the cause....
- suddenly the so-called climate sceptic websites rejected BE, and never mention it.
When I mention BE to so-called climate sceptics in discussions like this, they generally don't reply.
The sceptical scientists, of course, now accepted that their check on other scientists' work had confirmed that the science published on this matter is good science - because those sceptical scientists were real sceptics.
Going back even further, when Exxon got its own scientists to investigate climate change in the 1970s, those scientists found that CO2 from burning fossil fuels was causing global temperatures to rise.
Exxon didn't tell anyone of course.
Not their shareholders, for example.

As a child, he remembers “feeling as if I was enveloped in something whenever I played on the street. You could sense it in the air, you felt it and saw it, whatever was emanating from the huge chimneys. We were being poisoned as we played, but no one spoke about it. The conversations in the pub tended to be about football rather than carbon monoxide poisoning.”
Fifty years on, the local has become the global. Akomfrah’s latest art work, Purple, is an immersive, six-channel video installation that attempts to evoke the incremental effects of climate change on our planet. Shot in 10 countries and drawing on archive footage, spoken word and music alongside often epic shots of contemporary landscapes that have been altered by global warming and rising temperatures, Purple eschews a linear narrative for an almost overwhelming montage of imagery and sound.
Like all of Akomfrah’s work, it requires the viewer to surrender to sensory overload, while remaining alert to the often oblique connections being made throughout. “I kept thinking back, while making this work, to the local, working-class community I grew up in and how innocent we were in terms of trusting authority. One of the complex questions I am asking is about the relationship between our locality and the bigger issue of how we belong on the planet. Who can we trust with our collective future?”
Akomfrah’s ambition is nothing less than epic, the timespan of Purple stretching from the industrial age (images of factories, mills, machines and mass employment) to the digital revolution and beyond (the possibilities promised by biotech research, artificial intelligence and genetics). The looming threat of ecological disaster is implicit throughout, most ominously in the recurring appearance of lone, white-coated, hooded figures who gaze silently at landscapes threatened or already blighted by human progress.
“The kind of work I make is essentially time-based,” says Akomfrah, who is working on a new film project in New Orleans. “For that reason alone, I felt I had to widen my focus to take in the bigger narrative we are now all caught up in. Once you become aware of the implications of climate change for future generations, it is almost as if you have to respond. But I’m not a scientist or a campaigner, I’m an artist. I’m interested in the philosophy of climate change rather than the hard science.”
More than once, Akomfrah describes Purple as “a response to Anthropocene”, the term coined by scientists for the geological age in which we are now living, a period defined by the influence of manmade activity on climate and the environment. A major source of inspiration for Purple is a 2013 book called Hyperobjects: Philosophy and Ecology After the End of the World. Written by Timothy Morton, an English academic, it posits the idea that global warming is the most dramatic illustration of a “hyperobject” – an entity of such vast temporal and spatial dimensions that it baffles our traditional ways of thinking about it and, by extension, doing something about it.
In a perhaps unconscious way, Akomfrah’s overwhelming film evokes that very dilemma: our apparent helplessness as individuals in the face of rising sea levels and temperatures, droughts and melting icecaps. Against a stirring contemporary classical soundtrack, his film begins by summoning up the momentum of industrial England, a world of mass production that signals – but is utterly unlike – the hyper-reality of contemporary globalism and digital interconnectivity.
“I’m fascinated by the strange interregnum that stretches from the post-industrial to the digital present,” Akomfrah explains. “Right now, as I speak to you, I am looking at the outlines of oil refineries and sugar factories on the horizon. They are still there, still pumping out their poisons, but they seem to belong to a different age. Their numbers have dwindled, but they still have an impact on the environment and they still speak of a history of technology and exploitation. They cast a long shadow.”
This notion of the past – and, in particular, the colonial past – haunting the present is another recurring theme in Akomfrah’s work. It is there in the raw, turbulent montage of images and sound that marked his debut film, Handsworth Songs, which he made in 1986 as part of the Black Audio Film Collective. Its subject was the race riots in London and Birmingham the previous year and, in its blending of archive footage, still photos and newsreel, it set the tone for much of what was to follow, creating a formal signature known as bricolage, the creation of a new work from the layering and juxtaposition of various existing sources.
Akomfrah, who is of Ghanaian parentage, grew up in Britain and was influenced by the late Stuart Hall, arguably this country’s most influential black academic and cultural theorist. Hall’s writings on memory, time and identity in the wake of colonialism inform Akomfrah’s earlier films and he remains an abiding, if not so obvious, presence on Purple. “In a way, this is a person of colour’s response to the Anthropocene and climate change, which is not just a white, European fixation, though it is often presented that way. When I stand on a street in Accra, I can feel that it is a city that is literally at boiling point. It is way hotter than it was in the 1960s or even the 1980s. We need to start looking at climate change in radically different ways, not just as part of a western-based development narrative. It’s a pan-African concern of great urgency, but how long it will take people to see it as such is a whole other problem.”
In 1989, Akomfrah had what he calls “a major turning point”, when he travelled to Alaska to make a documentary for the BBC about the Exxon Valdez oil spill and its disastrous impact on the Alaskan ecosystem. “The destruction of the livelihoods of the Inuit community immediately resounded with me because it recalled the worst excesses of colonial exploitation. It felt like I was in a post-colonial space that was very much haunted by the past.”
In 2015, Akomfrah’s three-screen film installation, Vertigo Sea, marked another turning point, a shift in tone and scale that signalled the grand ambition of Purple. In contrasting the brutality of the whaling industry with the experience of generations of migrants who crossed the sea out of necessity in search of a better life, he was struck, he says, “by the realisation that everything overlaps at some profound level, that the great shifts in human progress that are made possible by technology can also cause the profoundest destruction and suffering”.
All these big themes are embedded in Purple, but may remain elusive to those unfamiliar with the tropes of conceptual art and experimental, non-narrative film-making. I was baffled, for instance, by recurring appearances of those mysterious silent figures who stand mute before often elemental landscapes on Alaska, Greenland and Skye. “In a very real way, I’m present in the film. I’m the figure in the brown shirt who gets rained on,” says Akomfrah, laughing. “It sounds a bit mystical, but for me everything starts with place. Wherever we filmed, it began with me asking the landscape the same question: ‘What can you tell me about the nature of climate change?’ As an artist and film-maker, I’m dependent on the responses I get from the environment.”
Is he aware, given the often bitterly contested nature of the public climate change debate, that a multiscreen, non-narrative conceptual art film that provides no answers may be greeted by a degree of scepticism, if not outright dismissal, from those on both sides demanding hard facts and evidence? “Well, I’m an artist. I make work for a gallery. I’m not attempting to make a science documentary. I’m coming at it from a different perspective by asking the question: what is philosophically, ethically and morally at stake here if we continue on this course? I don’t think you need to be licensed by the scientific community to ask that sort of question about the times we live in or to reflect on the anxiety many of us feel about the future of the planet. My son is old enough to become a father. On a purely personal level, it certainly felt like the right time for me as an artist to be asking these questions.”

""Assuming that all the signatories reported their credentials accurately, credentialed climate experts on the list are very few."" The problem is made worse, Lahsen notes, because critics ""added bogus names to illustrate the lack of accountability the petition involved"".[20] Approved names on the list included fictional characters from the television show M*A*S*H,[21] the movie Star Wars,[20] Spice Girls group member Geri Halliwell, English naturalist Charles Darwin (d. 1882) and prank names such as ""I. C. Ewe"".

BQSTART
Of the 26 we were able to identify in various databases, 11 said they still agreed with the petition —- one was an active climate researcher, two others had relevant expertise, and eight signed based on an informal evaluation. Six said they would not sign the petition today, three did not remember any such petition, one had died, and five did not answer repeated messages.
BQEND
This was back in 2001 and already six out of 26 had changed their minds. That was of the people they were able to identify. Since then fifteen of the warmest years on record have happened and we have just had the three warmest in a row.
 So that's the ones they were able to identify, which is another problem. From wiki again...

A cursory examination by Todd Shelly of the Hawaii Reporter revealed duplicate entries, single names lacking any initial, and even corporate names. ""These examples underscore a major weakness of the list: there is no way to check the authenticity of the names. Names are given, but no identifying information (e.g., institutional affiliation) is provided.""

I know there's a lot of scientific literature about those particular issues, but what this site would be about is the consensus among scientists, which of course is based on research, but the problem is that people are not aware of the consensus and distrust the current research on the consensus-issue.

If the consensus is so important to convey the message and get people into thinking differently (I think it is as well), then I think it's worth gathering the views of a lot of the actual scientists on one site, and through participation of a lot of them build up a general and trustworthy view of the consensus over time.
If you think ""read my and all the rest of the peer-revied research for yourself!"" is helping to sway public opinion on the consensus, then this is what's already happening and this doesn't seem to be a very successful strategy.

1. What is the name of the scientific model that predicts global warming?
BQEND
Quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, radiative physics. QM says that gas molecules will selectively transmit or absorb differing frequencies of photons. Thermodynamics tells us that if we trap energy below the top of the atmosphere by adding more CO2 molecules to intercept escaping photons, the region below will heat up. Radiative physics throws in a bit more nuance to explain in more detail how this plays out, and provides some important equations that limit how bad things can get. Unless you demonstrate that one of those three theories is flawed, the conclusion that extra CO2 will have a heating effect on the planet is inescapable. Without some comparably large counter-balancing effect that has never been seen, that unbalanced effect will dominate and actually heat the planet, as we have seen.
That basic model gives you the essential story -- more than enough to drive any policy considerations. You need to add some extra information to model clouds, ice, plant growth, etc. to fill in third or fourth level details, but that's more of an academic concern that anything we need to understand the crucial questions. (Those details could help with things like hurricane predictions, though, so they are not entirely academic -- just not needed to know we're in trouble if we keep dumping CO2.)
BQSTART
2. How long has the model existed? When was it first published?
BQEND
Various pieces were developed over the past two centuries. The first solid observation of global warming was published in the 1820's. The role of CO2 was established in the 1850's. A quantitative law was published in the 1890's. As with many sciences, the theoretical underpinnings took many decades after that to come with explanations for those observations, but the basic scientific models were essentially completed by the 1930's to 1950's.
BQSTART
3. What is the model's track record?
BQEND
Near perfection. Microwave ovens work pretty much exactly as expected. Same with car engines and heat-seeking missiles. Parts of QM have been verified to 18 decimal places! AGW (a vastly more complex system than the above) has progressed almost exactly as was predicted for the scenarios that described the actual course of forcing events. (The climate models do not attempt to predict forcing events such as solar activity, economic activity, volcanic eruptions, etc. but rather say what will happen for any given combination of such things. Each alternative is a scenario, with its own prediction of how much AGW there will be. So there is some uncertainty in predictions, but if we assume that the gross behavior of the sun and volcanos is relatively stable on the scale of centuries then virtually all of the uncertainty is due to our inability to predict how quickly we will stop our production of CO2.)
BQSTART
4. Are the data for the model publicly available?
BQEND
Of course they are. You could start chasing links from here, and let everyone know if there's something missing: http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/data-sources/
BQSTART
5. Is the model's methodology publicly available? Has the methodology been public since it was first published? Has the methodology remained consistent?
BQEND
Yes. Yes. Yes. See above. It's pretty much all exquisitely documented in painstaking detail in the scientific literature. You really can't get past peer-review without doing that.

""Assuming that all the signatories reported their credentials accurately, credentialed climate experts on the list are very few."" The problem is made worse, Lahsen notes, because critics ""added bogus names to illustrate the lack of accountability the petition involved"".[20] Approved names on the list included fictional characters from the television show M*A*S*H,[21] the movie Star Wars,[20] Spice Girls group member Geri Halliwell, English naturalist Charles Darwin (d. 1882) and prank names such as ""I. C. Ewe"".

Of the 26 we were able to identify in various databases, 11 said they still agreed with the petition —- one was an active climate researcher, two others had relevant expertise, and eight signed based on an informal evaluation. Six said they would not sign the petition today, three did not remember any such petition, one had died, and five did not answer repeated messages.

This was back in 2001 and already six out of 26 had changed their minds. That was of the people they were able to identify. Since then fifteen of the warmest years on record have happened and we have just had the three warmest in a row.

Not true. It's already (just) over a generation since the first IPCC assessment report. At that time nuclear power generated something like 18% of the world's electricity.

Just to forestall any objections about sustainability and running out of uranium, by that stage a fully closed fuel cycle had already been demonstrated with the Integral Fast Reactor Project at Argonne National Laboratory.

So it seems that a lot of kids from engineering (or lower-grade physics) do not exactly know how the SB has a meaning for a rotating planet with an atmosphere.

I mean - if any silly kid tried to calculate AGW with SB alone - this planet would be around minus 18 degrees, and that is a bit off? 
So the SB solution would be very stupid to introduce alone. As kind of the whole point is to see what is captured in gas - rather than a solid/liquid with a certain albedo.

But people have found ways to overcome our individual limitations through social intelligence, for example by developing and paying special attention to the consensus of experts. Modern societies have developed entire institutions to distill and communicate expert consensus, ranging from national academies of science to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Assessments of scientific consensus help us tap the collective wisdom of a crowd of experts. In short, people value expert consensus as a guide to help them navigate an increasingly complex and risk-filled world.
More generally, consensus is an important process in society. Human cooperation, from small groups to entire nations, requires some degree of consensus, for example on shared goals and the best means to achieve those goals. Indeed, some biologists have argued that “human societies are unable to function without consensus.” Neurological evidence even suggests that when people learn that they are in agreement with experts, reward signals are produced in the brain. Importantly, establishing consensus in one domain (e.g. climate science) can serve as a stepping stone to establishing consensus in other domains (e.g. need for climate policy).
The value of consensus is well understood by the opponents of climate action, like the fossil fuel industry. In the early 1990s, despite the fact that an international scientific consensus was already forming, the fossil fuel industry invested in misinformation campaigns to confuse the public about the level of scientific agreement that human-caused global warming is happening. As has been well-documented, fossil fuel companies learned this strategy from the tobacco industry, which invested enormous sums in marketing and public relations campaigns to sow doubt in the public mind about the causal link between smoking and lung cancer.
However, some academics have recently argued that communicators and educators should not inform the public about the strong scientific consensus on climate change. UK sociologist Warren Pearce and his colleagues recently published a commentary (and corresponding Guardian op-ed) arguing that communicating the scientific consensus is actually counter-productive. John Cook published a reply, which we summarize here.
By the late 1990s, political strategists recognized the importance of perceived scientific consensus. Market researcher Frank Luntz advised Republicans and then-president George W. Bush to cast doubt on expert agreement in order to reduce public support for climate policy. To stall climate policy, he argued, the Bush Administration should seek to convince the public that scientists were still arguing whether climate change is real or human-caused.
Luntz was ahead of his time. It was over a decade before social scientists began studying this phenomenon and converged on the same result. A 2011 study found that support for climate policy was linked to perceptions about scientific agreement on climate change. This finding has since been independently replicated by other research, as well as randomized experiments conducted in Australia and the United States. Still other research confirmed these results using John Oliver’s viral TV segment illustrating the issue of “false balance” to the public. 
Conversely, telling people that experts disagree was found to decrease their support for environmental policy and other actions, such as vaccinations. 
Opponents of climate action may reject scientific evidence supporting the reality of human-caused climate change, but they have diligently applied the social scientific evidence indicating how to reduce public support for climate action. An analysis of conservative op-eds found their most common claim was “there is no consensus.” An analysis of a six-month period in 2016 found that the most-shared climate article on social media was about an online petition designed to cast doubt on the scientific consensus. It’s why the Trump administration wants to televise a Red Team/Blue Team climate debate.
To push back against the decades-long disinformation campaign, numerous scientists have made efforts to quantify and communicate the scientific consensus. Meanwhile, disinformers have doubled down on their efforts to confuse the public about the consensus. The commentary by Pearce and company plays into their hands by arguing the climate community should surrender this argument to the misinformers.
In the Guardian, Pearce argued:
the public have already heard enough about the scientific evidence to make up their mind, without being fed increasingly esoteric information about levels of scientific agreement … valuable media and political attention has been expended on boosting the 97% meme, crowding out deeper conversations about policy framing
However, in the United States, only 70% of Americans understand that global warming is happening, and only 58% understand it is human-caused. Further, only 13% of Americans realize the expert consensus on human-caused global warming exceeds 90%. 
And multiple empirical studies, conducted in different countries, have found that informing people of the scientific consensus has a small but significant influence on their own subsequent judgements about the reality of human-caused global warming. While discussion about climate policy is urgently needed, establishing and communicating the scientific consensus about human-caused climate change is not a competitor to policy discussion; it is a complement. 
No one argues that the scientific consensus is the one and only message that needs to be communicated - public responses to climate change are often as complex as society itself. But informing the public about the scientific consensus that the problem actually exists can support the discussion on how to best solve the problem. The argument that we have to choose between debunking the climate policy opponent’s disinformation about the scientific consensus or engage in meaningful policy dialogue is a false choice. 
Disinformation about the scientific consensus that human-caused climate change is happening has been used to delay serious conversations about climate policy in the United States and a few other countries. Moreover, the argument that communicators should not talk about a scientific consensus when one exists is deeply troubling. In the history of science, it is relatively rare that such strong agreement emerges about basic scientific facts. When it comes to issues such as the future of our planet, recommending that we withhold this information from the public is unethical. 
American policymakers have struggled to implement national climate policies, but not for lack of policy discussion “crowded out” by consensus messaging. Carbon tax and cap and trade bills have been introduced regularly, including by Republicans like Senator John McCain, and in the current session by Democratic Senators Whitehouse and Schatz. One climate bill even passed the House of Representatives in 2009 before failing in the Senate.
Those climate policy proposals failed in large part because they were opposed by most Republican members of Congress, many of whom continue to deny the very existence of human-caused climate change. Denial of the scientific consensus has long been one of the primary arguments used to justify their rejection of climate policy. Likewise, many members of the public don’t yet understand that climate scientists have reached near-unanimous agreement that climate change is real and human-caused, and thus are either uncertain or doubtful about whether this is a real and urgent problem. Consensus messaging is one tool (of many) to help people understand the reality and importance of the issue.
Moreover, what happens if we follow Pearce’s recommendations and stop communicating the fact of the scientific consensus, while opponents of climate policy continue to misinform? Two recent independent experimental studies (by the US and Australian authors of this article) found that when disinformation is not countered, people’s misunderstanding of the consensus increases, while decreasing their acceptance of the reality of human-caused climate change.A growing body of empirical research across different fields has established that perceived scientific consensus is an important influence on action (or inaction). Opponents of climate action have understood this for decades. 
It is unfortunate that Pearce ignores this body of empirical research, thus making recommendations that play into the hands of those who deny climate science and seek to maintain the status quo. To be sure, science includes doubt, healthy skepticism, and disagreement, but that does not mean that efforts to quantify and communicate scientific consensus should have no place in society or policy development. Advocating such a stance is counterproductive and would keep the public uninformed about this important consensus of experts.

That would need a good deal of research to demonstrate conclusively either way, but I'm not alone in being sceptical.

Perhaps it is you who are manifesting historical and scientific ignorance. Why not begin by reading this elementary article-see below-and go from there:
""The relationship between the Roman Catholic Church and science is a widely debated subject. Historically, the Church has often been a patron of sciences. It has been prolific in the foundation of schools, universities and hospitals, and many clergy have been active in the sciences. Historians of science such as Pierre Duhem credit medieval Catholic mathematicians and philosophers such as John Buridan, Nicole Oresme, and Roger Bacon as the founders of modern science.[1] Duhem found ""the mechanics and physics, of which modern times are justifiably proud, to proceed by an uninterrupted series of scarcely perceptible improvements from doctrines professed in the heart of the medieval schools.""[2] Yet, the conflict thesis and other critiques emphasize historical or contemporary conflict between the Catholic Church and science, citing in particular the trial of Galileo as evidence. For its part, the Catholic Church teaches that science and the Christian faith are complementary, as can be seen from the Catechism of the Catholic Church which states in regards to faith and science:Though faith is above reason, there can never be any real discrepancy between faith and reason. Since the same God who reveals mysteries and infuses faith has bestowed the light of reason on the human mind, God cannot deny himself, nor can truth ever contradict truth. ... Consequently, methodical research in all branches of knowledge, provided it is carried out in a truly scientific manner and does not override moral laws, can never conflict with the faith, because the things of the world and the things of faith derive from the same God. The humble and persevering investigator of the secrets of nature is being led, as it were, by the hand of God in spite of himself, for it is God, the conserver of all things, who made them what they are.[3]Catholic scientists, both religious and lay, have led scientific discovery in many fields.[4] From ancient times, Christian emphasis on practical charity gave rise to the development of systematic nursing and hospitals and the Church remains the single largest private provider of medical care and research facilities in the world.[5] Following the Fall of Rome, monasteries and convents remained bastions of scholarship in Western Europe and clergymen were the leading scholars of the age – studying nature, mathematics, and the motion of the stars (largely for religious purposes).[6] During the Middle Ages, the Church founded Europe's first universities, producing scholars like Robert Grosseteste, Albert the Great, Roger Bacon, and Thomas Aquinas, who helped establish the scientific method.[7] During this period, the Church was also a great patron of engineering for the construction of elaborate cathedrals. Since the Renaissance, Catholic scientists have been credited as fathers of a diverse range of scientific fields: Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744-1829) prefigured the theory of evolution with Lamarckism, Friar Gregor Mendel (1822-1884) pioneered genetics, and Fr Georges Lemaitre (1894-1966) proposed the Big Bang cosmological model.[8] The Jesuits have been particularly active, notably in astronomy. Church patronage of sciences continues through elite institutions like the Pontifical Academy of Sciences and Vatican Observatory.[9]', u'recommendation_count': u'5', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1507053188000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'the things of the world and the things of faith derive from the same god', u'effect': u'can never conflict with the faith'}, {u'cause': u'christian emphasis on practical charity', u'effect': u'the development of systematic nursing and hospitals'}], u'author_id': u'3807132', u'in_reply_to': u'106218331', u'id': u'106219195', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'jjc100', u'text': u'What, you voted in the enclave?', u'recommendation_count': u'6', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1507066159000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'1157519', u'in_reply_to': u'106227080', u'id': u'106227900', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'jobi258', u'text': u'solar-powered popemobile', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1507065526000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'2019489', u'id': u'106227500', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Eddiel899', u'text': u'BQSTART

The seven atmospheric scientists predict a global warming of ''almost unprecedented magnitude'' in the next century. It might even be sufficient to melt and dislodge the ice cover of West Antarctica, they say, eventually leading to a worldwide rise of 15 to 20 feet in the sea level. In that case, they say, it would ''flood 25 percent of Louisiana and Florida, 10 percent of New Jersey and many other lowlands throughout the world'' within a century or less.
BQEND
From a conversation held a few months ago with Michael Mann and Richard Alley. A few comments by Alley below.
BQSTART
If we don’t change our ways we’re expecting something like 3 feet of sea level rise in the next century, and it could be 2 and it could be 4 and it could be 20. 
The chance that we will cross thresholds that commit us to loss of big chunks of West Antarctica and huge sea level rise is real.
So when you start doing “Well you’re not sure,” but there’s a chance of really bad things and the uncertainties are mostly on the bad side, could be a little better or a little worse or a lot worse, but we’ll be breaking things.

The sum involved has not been disclosed but the volume of divesting groups is four times higher than a previous church record, and adds to a global divestment movement, led by investors worth $5.5tn.
Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief who helped negotiate the Paris climate agreement, hailed Tuesday’s move as “a further sign we are on the way to achieving our collective mission”.
She said: “I hope we will see more leaders like these 40 Catholic institutions commit, because while this decision makes smart financial sense, acting collectively to deliver a better future for everybody is also our moral imperative.”
Church institutions joining the action include the Archdiocese of Cape Town, the Episcopal Conference of Belgium and the diocese of Assisi-Nocera Umbra-Gualdo Tadino, the spiritual home of the world’s Franciscan brothers.
A spokesman for the €4.5bn German Church bank and Catholic relief organisation Caritas said that it was committing to divest from coal, tar sands and shale oil. 
In a symbolically charged move, the Italian town of Assisi will also shed all oil, coal and gas holdings the day before a visit by the Italian prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, to mark St Francis’s feast day.
Assisi’s mayor, Stefania Proietti – a former climate mitigation professor – told the Guardian: “When we pay attention to the environment, we pay attention to poor people, who are the first victims of climate change. 
“When we invest in fossil fuels, we stray very far from social justice. But when we disinvest and invest in renewable and energy efficiency instead, we can mitigate climate change, create a sustainable new economic deal and, most importantly, help the poor.”

Meteorologist Clement Wragge, in an 1886 report (Wragge, C. L. 1886. Meteorological Inspection and Proposals for a New Meteorological Organisation, Report to the Colonial Secretary, Brisbane, presented to the Queensland Parliament, 14 pp.), pointed out that some thermometers: 
… are hung under verandahs and over wooden floors; others are placed against stone walls and fences. Such exposures (not to mention the several remarkable instances of thermometers being placed and observed indoors) give results which are not only not intercomparable and so valueless to meteorology, but which are affected by artificial and secondary conditions, giving misleading values.
Wragge convinced the Queensland government to introduce the Stevenson Screen as the standard method for housing thermometers, but failed to convince meteorologists in the other Australian colonies. So for much of the country, temperatures continued to be recorded on what was known as a Greenwich (or Glaisher) Stand, or even just mounted on a wall, leaving the thermometers exposed to radiation from the ground and their surrounds. 
...summer daytime temperatures measured using the Glaisher Stand are, on average, 1C warmer than in the Stevenson Screen. And this was at a well-maintained station – if a Glaisher Stand is not used properly, direct sunshine can fall on the thermometers, dramatically increasing the warm bias

That's progress.
Now, we also have a ton of evidence that the earth's temperature is moving into a dangerous realm for us. To my (admittedly incomplete) knowledge, no one anywhere has published any scientific paper to the contrary for several years now.
So, if the goal is to avoid that rather obvious and generally agreed upon danger (or at least to mitigate it), what other options do we have except to tune the one knob we have control over?
Even if we completely ignore all history of how we got to the current situation, it is still obvious that if we want to lower the future temperature trajectory our most effective strategy to reduce the amount of CO2 we put into the air.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1507161790000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'10053869', u'in_reply_to': u'106237768', u'id': u'106292058', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'JamesCA', u'text': u'The only way to make sense of your comments is to assume you are talking about precision, not accuracy. (Precision means all your arrows hit the target in a tight cluster. Accuracy means that, on average, the arrows are centered around the bulls-eye. Ideally you want both.)
Granting you that assumption, an average can be arbitrarily more precise than the values it summarizes. Given enough measurements with 1C precision you can compute an average with as small as 0.0001C precision. (Granted, we probably don't have that many measurements, but it is possible.)
A caveat is that in most measurement situations there is a concern that some unknown systematic bias is making an extremely precise value very inaccurate. (E.g. your one million electronic thermometers, each precise to 0.001C, are all mis-calibrated 3C too high.) But that concern dissipates when you are measuring anomalies. Almost any plausible systematic bias would increase or decrease both the starting and ending values, leaving the delta unchanged. (In the example above, the differences measured by those thermometers would be accurate to 0.001C even though the start and end values were both 3C too high.) 
So a relevant systematic bias would need to somehow distort the derivative of the measuring system, amplifying changes. Offhand, I can't think of any plausible mechanisms that would do that in any significant way to any kind of temperature measuring system (thermometer, proxy, or whatever). Can you?

In other words, the linear scale of temperature remind us that we are comfortable in a very narrow span of temperatures. And it affects us surprisingly (not?) non-linearly when it moves up and down in this very narrow corridor. We who experience weather coming in that moves the C-scale from 20-30 feel 10 degrees of bliss. When it does 30-40 (same 10 degrees) it become less bliss. 
In addition - global mean temperatures as reported are surprisingly biased towards marine life, when we think about it. We should probably give ""land-based"" trends instead of ""global mean"" trends to the public - even though ocean trends are much more robust as scientific signal because of capacity and area/volume and such things - and has a huge saying to the energy-balance and primary production we live off. 
Land-temperature-trends have separated from the global mean and ocean a lot over the decades after science really started to worn about AGW in the 1960's and 70's. 2 degree targets does not mean 2 degrees mean for anything that exist on land. And as we know - land temperatures produce much more amplitude of weather and seasons than ocean - because of that dampening effect 70% of our surface have.

Do us a favour and stop insulting our intelligence with idiotic slurs on Tim Flannery, here is his quote in full and in context. Interview with Professor Tim Flannery Reporter: Sally Sara: ABC 11/02/2007 ""SALLY SARA: What will it mean for Australian farmers if the predictions of climate change are correct and little is done to stop it? What will that mean for a farmer? PROFESSOR TIM FLANNERY: We're already seeing the initial impacts and they include a decline in the winter rainfall zone across southern Australia, which is clearly an impact of climate change, but also a decrease in run-off. Although we're getting say a 20 per cent decrease in rainfall in some areas of Australia, that's translating to a 60 per cent decrease in the run-off into the dams and rivers. That's because the soil is warmer because of global warming and the plants are under more stress and therefore using more moisture. So even the rain that falls isn't actually going to fill our dams and our river systems, and that's a real worry for the people in the bush. If that trend continues then I think we're going to have serious problems, particularly for irrigation."" http://www.abc.net.au/landline/content/2006/s1844398.htm

It does not matter, in the slightest, that CO2 is a ""trace"" gas. The relative concentration of CO2 has almost zero relevance to the amount of heat it traps. To a a first (and second and third) approximation, the ONLY thing that matters is the absolute concentration of CO2.
For a good analogy, think of how a mirror works. You might have a kilogram of glass backed by a layer of silver one atom thick. Even though the silver amounts to something like 0.0000000001% (or whatever) of the mass of the mirror it can account for virtually ALL of the reflective properties of the mirror. 
CO2, H2O and a few other trace gases work the same way. Because N2 and O2 are transparent to long-wave radiation, CO2 is the dominant non-condensing gas that traps and redirect escaping long-wave radiation.
H2O then adds to that effect, but since it is a condensing gas (which means it quickly adjusts to an equilibrium), the amount of H2O is determined by the initial conditions set by the non-condensing gases. H2O acts as a feedback and amplifier, not a forcing or control. 
To elaborate just a bit more about the condensing/non-condensing distinction: if you add more H2O to the air, more will condense out, and if you remove H2O from the air, more will evaporate to replace it. In both cases the atmospheric concentration of H2O will almost immediately return to its previous level. That is not at all true for non-condensing gases such as O2, N2, CO2, CH4, etc. -- when you add or remove them from the atmosphere the effect persists for decades to millions of years.

You are entirely correct that there is currently more water vapour in the atmosphere than previously, and the global warming of recent decades is due in large part to that increased water vapour.
But here's the critical thing - the point you refuse to acknowledge. That extra water vapour would not be there if it wasn't for increased CO2. 
Increased CO2 (caused by human activity) causes warming; the warming causes increased water vapour; and the increased water vapour causes yet more warming.
That is what I have been telling you all along, and your own link says exactly the same:
""rising water vapor in the upper troposphere cannot be explained by natural forces, ... but can be explained by increased greenhouse gases, such as CO2.
Greenhouse gases raise temperatures by trapping the Earth's radiant heat inside the atmosphere. This warming also increases the accumulation of atmospheric water vapor, the most abundant greenhouse gas. The atmospheric moistening traps additional radiant heat and further increases temperatures.""
See? Increased atmospheric CO2 is the culprit here. Without it, we wouldn't have a global warming problem at all. I don't know why you can't see that. Possibly you are handicapped by this ""trace gas"" meme. 
Remember this: the greenhouse properties of CO2 don't change just because you add non-GH gases like nitrogen and oxygen to the system. Add as much of those as you like - even so much that the CO2 becomes a ""trace gas"" - and the CO2 will keep doing the same greenhouse thing.

Researchers led by the Australian National University in Canberra used observational data and simulated climate models to assess future extreme weather events in New South Wales and Victoria. They examined what these weather extremes might look like even if the Paris agreement target of limiting climate change to a 2C increase is met. 
The lead author of the study, the climate scientist Dr Sophie Lewis, said Sydney and Melbourne could expect unprecedented summer temperatures of 50C under two degrees of global warming.
The researchers concluded this could be avoided by limiting global warming to 1.5C, the best-case scenario target set under the Paris agreement, though the researchers did not project what temperatures could be expected under this reduced global target.
“What previous studies have done is look at changes in the frequency of record-breaking temperatures so, for example, how much more common 40-degree days might be in future,” Lewis said.
“Our study wanted to look at what the maximum temperatures in an extreme summer of the future would be. That is what we need to know to plan for the future. We know that two degrees of global warming doesn’t sound like much of an increase but it in fact will lead to extreme weather events becoming more severe.”
Governments needed to start thinking about how the public transport system would cope during peak hour in extreme temperatures, how emergency departments would respond to increased demand from elderly people and others vulnerable to heatstroke, and how energy requirements would be met during peak temperatures, she said.
“The only thing we can do to prevent these extremes is to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions as quickly and deeply as we can, though some warming is already locked in the system so we will see some increase in the extremity of temperatures regardless,” Lewis said.
The research was published in the science journal Geophysical Research Letters.
The Environment Victoria chief executive, Mark Wakeham, described the findings as “alarming”.
“It’s preposterous that in the face of these warnings and clear signals that we don’t have a plan to cut emissions,” he told Guardian Australia. “Beyond that we must dramatically improve our built environment to cope.”
Housing standards needed to be improved, including retrofitting older homes to make them more energy efficient and cooler, and more shade needed to be incorporated into cities and towns, he said.
“We also need updated emergency management plans for extreme heatwaves,” he said. “This study by respected researchers confirms that climate change is not just an environmental disaster but it presents an enormous challenge to human health and the economy. 
“I don’t think we have any plans in place that would be adequate to withstand days of 50 degrees and it is another urgent warning to our leaders and all levels of government that we need a strong plan to cut commissions and deal with climate change.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/04/australian-cities-to-have-50c-summer-days-by-2040-study-says

2015 total emissions GHG 80.2 Mt . The net emissions figure is 56.4 Mt. That means that a total of 23.8 Mt CO2e is ""offset"" by all processes. These offsets come from ""Land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF)"", which in the NZ context means primarily managed forestry.Take the 80.2 Mt and multiply that by .48 (being the percentage of agricultural emissions) you come to 38.49Mt CO2e emissions from agriculture. Therefore means that even if all CO2e offsets were to be ""credited"" back into agriculture (which doesn't appear to be the way it is analysed anywhere in world, but for the sake of the discussion we'll take it as a given), it remains a net emitter of CO2e to the tune of 14.69 Mt

I'm not even sure this is true.
The reasoning if it isn't is that they already get the lion's share of the 'green' vote either directly or via Green's preferences anyway. Soooo ... why not play both sides and get as much of the swinging/mindless/redneck vote as possible by being only marginally better than the LNP. Palaszczuk obviously thinks so and federal Labor aren't exactly leaping in to widen the point of difference.
So they won't try, and I think this is a huge mistake, not just on the blindingly obvious policies required but it passes up the chance to truly wedge the LNP as the party of the past not fit to be even considered for government for at least 2 or 3 terms - by which time there will be no appetite to wind back popular achievements in the face of an obviously worsening global crisis.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1507090529000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'3333597', u'in_reply_to': u'106234425', u'id': u'106235670', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'PDGFD1', u'text': u'Watch them use America as an excuse now.

Key findings
New Zealand’s net GHG emissions have increased since 1990 but are lower than their peak in 2006. In 2013, our net emissions were 42.4 percent higher than in 1990 (54.2 Mt CO2-e compared with 38.0 Mt CO2-e) (megatonnes equivalent carbon dioxide).In 2013, the land use, land-use change, and forestry sector (LULUCF) reduced emissions by 26.8 Mt CO2-e.Total GHG emissions in 2013 (excluding removals) were 81.0 Mt CO2-e. This is a 21.3 percent increase on the 1990 levels of 66.7 Mt CO2-e.Agriculture, with 48 percent, was the largest-contributing sector to total GHG emissions, followed by the energy sector, with 39 percent.

It lasted only two years, and was repealed amid much fanfare by the Abbott government in July 2014.
During its time, Australian companies and industries exposed to the carbon pricing mechanism took a long hard look at the emissions liabilities embedded within their supply chains and worked to reduce them.
Barely three years later, Australia is in danger of being the kid that gets picked last for the soccer team. With China set to launch its national emissions trading scheme (ETS) before the end of the year, and several other Asia-Pacific nations either doing the same or already in the game, so-called ‘carbon clubs’ are forming and Australia isn’t invited.
So what will it mean for Australian companies when our biggest trading partner – China – introduces their ETS?
“Our energy-intensive exports sit directly in the supply chain of the world’s largest carbon market, where their customers are going to have a liability around the carbon price,” says Peter Castellas, chief executive of the Carbon Market Institute. “That will send a market signal of real significance.”
Supply chain emissions – known as Scope 3 emissions under the Greenhouse Gas Protocol – refers to those generated outside the direct control of a business. These could be from the extraction and production of products purchased by the business, third-party transport and distribution, and the  end use of its products. 
For many companies, these Scope 3 emissions are likely to be the largest part of their carbon emissions, compared to those generated by the company itself. For example, US company Kraft Foods found its Scope 3 emissions represented more than 90% of its total emissions (pdf).
Supply chain emissions are already being targeted by many multinationals around the world; US retail giant Walmart recently asked its suppliers to help it achieve their goal of removing one gigatonne of carbon dioxide from its Scope 3 supply chain sources by 2030. 
Chinese companies operating under an ETS may well undertake similar initiatives to reduce their carbon footprint, which could put Australian companies in that supply chain under pressure.
The recent announcement has added a few more details to the scope of the scheme. 
Chinese government adviser Zhang Xiliang from Tsinghua University told the AFR that it will begin with power generators and expand to encompass eight key sectors by 2020, including steel making and aluminium.
The national scheme was first announced by Chinese president Xi Jinping in September 2015, during a visit by then-US president Barack Obama. At that time, China had been testing the waters since 2013 with pilot schemes in seven cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong and Shenzen.
Incorporating power generation into the scheme is another step in China’s ongoing shift to a low carbon energy mix. It also raises further questions over the future of Australia’s coal exports to China, worth $4.2bn in 2015.
“Anyone exporting coal to China needs to be worried; they should simply expect that China will not import coal,” says Prof Frank Jotzo, director of the Centre for Climate Economics and Policy at the Australian National University.
However Tom Luckock, partner in law firm Norton Rose Fulbright’s Beijing office, says China has been moving away from coal-fired power long before the national ETS was announced.
“China has and uses a number of tools to control emissions and it has done so very successfully for a number of years, and in many cases they will have a much larger impact than a carbon market,” Luckock says.
“If you combine an ETS plus this very clear policy in terms of shutting down coal-fired power stations, plus you add in unofficial restrictions on new bank lending for coal fired power stations, plus you add renewables targets for power companies and local officials, together with tax incentives and high tariffs for renewables; all of this will have an impact back in Australia,” he says.
Coal is a small part of the many goods and services that Australia exports to China. That export market, worth $93bn in 2016, includes metals and metal ores – iron, gold, aluminium and zinc, for example – as well as a huge range of other products, from wool and wheat to medicines and machinery parts. 
Elisa de Wit, partner and head of climate change at Norton Rose Fulbright, says any Australian business that deals with China could be affected. 
“Our sense though is that … perhaps there hasn’t been sufficient attention directed towards the impacts for that supply chain arrangement, and particularly for Australian business,” de Wit says. 
The launch of China’s national carbon market could also harm the competitiveness of Australian products. 
Jotzo suggests one effect of the scheme will be to encourage Chinese firms to invest in newer, more efficient production facilities, and pressure out the older, less efficient installations. This could be helped by incentives, like those built into the European Union ETS, which shield domestic industries from competitive disadvantage abroad because of the additional impositions of the carbon pricing mechanisms.
“So once that all works its way through, China will have a more efficient heavy industrial sector as a result of this, and in the longer term will be able to better compete with international competitors,” he says. 
China is not the only nation in the Asia-Pacific region to take steps towards emissions trading schemes. South Korea launched one in 2015, Japan has a cap-and-trade program for Tokyo, New Zealand launched an ETS in 2008, and Taiwan, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam are looking at reducing emissions through a pricing and trading schemes. 
Australia’s lack of a carbon pricing mechanism could see it lag behind in the region, says Castellas, as countries that do have them begin to link their carbon trading markets. 
“When you have Japan, [South] Korea and China having discussions around a north Asian carbon club; when you’ve got China and Korea having discussions around how do we treat emissions across borders and what’s the lowest cost to our economies to meet our emissions targets; when you have China and New Zealand having those conversations about establishing direct engagement because they both have a functioning carbon market with a price; those conversations and those emerging what’s being called ‘carbon clubs’ is something that Australia should be participating in,” he says. 
Jotzo also warns Australia could be more subtly frozen out as a trading partner with China. 
“Quite irrespective of the specific provisions for shielding Chinese industries and all the rest of it, China will then tend to say ‘well hang on …we’re doing the right thing for the global climate, why should we accept imports from countries like Australia or the US where industries are not under any similar obligation’, and that will be an argument in favour of trade restrictions of one form or another,” he says. 
A Chinese national ETS is not all bad news. Despite our lack of a national carbon pricing mechanism, de Wit says Australia still has something to offer countries that implement them. 
“We do see that there’s the potential opportunity for the learnings that have come out of our own offsets market, which has now been in operation for over six years, for some of that expertise to be exported as well into China,” she says. 
It is also possible China might exhaust its domestic carbon offset credits, and Australia could find an opportunity in exporting those to China. 
“It’s an interesting dynamic in terms of thinking about what happens under the Paris agreement, and once the emissions reduction opportunities have been completely extinguished, how you then look at offsetting and where those offsetting opportunities are actually going to come from,” de Wit says. 
One thing is certain: there are more questions than answers about China’s ETS, and the details are eagerly awaited. A spokesperson for the department of foreign affairs and trade said it will be paying close attention to the effects of policy developments on Australian business.
“Once the details of the scheme are made available, we will continue to engage closely with Australian exporters to ensure our advocacy with the Chinese authorities is targeted and appropriate.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/oct/04/chinas-emissions-trading-scheme-puts-australian-companies-on-notice

Wind and solar cannot even fill current gaps and a system run mainly on green power would fail to provide guaranteed supply over a winter fortnight, it says.

Great idea. 
I assume you would support also removing all subsidies from fossil fuels as well - including the hidden cost to the country of pollution, impact on health, end of life mine/generator remediation remediation etc etc. For example a carbon tax is one mechanism often used to reflect the real cost of fossil fuel. 
The cost of clean energy would rise and so would fossil fuel generated power. With no subsidies for any fuel the government will be in surplus and can reduce taxes thus offsetting the increases to bills. 
The consumer can then choose between different fuel sources and pay the true cost....I suspect off-grid solar/battery could get very popular very quickly as the power bills rise dramatically.', u'recommendation_count': u'8', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1507166777000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'3008405', u'in_reply_to': u'106293148', u'id': u'106293299', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'ildfluer', u'text': u'I believe we could emulate the Norwegians and nationalise our mineral wealth - and channel profits to a sovereign wealth fund to pay for social services.

The council found there was agreement among a series of major independent reports that there were no technological or economic barriers to a clean, secure, affordable and reliable grid.
The Climate Council report coincides with international law firm Pinsent Masons’ release of research findings that 90% of energy utility companies around the world are actively seeking acquisitions or joint ventures with companies that implement smart energy technologies like batteries, vehicle-to-grid technology and smart meters, but policy uncertainty is limiting investment in Australia.
Within a decade, more than one-third of Australia’s coal plants in the national electricity market will be more than 50 years old – after which the vast majority of coal plants fail to operate.
Reports by the independent operator of the grid, Aemo, CSIRO and the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, found there were no technical barriers to modernising the grid, the Climate Council report found.
“Combining low-cost wind and solar PV [photovoltaic] with other renewable energy technologies, such as solar thermal, hydro and biomass plants, can provide round-the-clock or on-demand power, as well as meeting technical requirements for grid stability,” said the report, authored by Andrew Stock, a Climate Council councillor who previously spent four decades in the energy industry.
The report said combining those technologies with grid-scale batteries, pumped hydro and heat storage would would increase the reliability of the system, as well as add competition to the market.
There was also a large degree of consensus among the surveyed reports that modernising the system in that way would increase reliability in the face of climate change and increased extreme weather.
Relying on a large number of smaller distributed renewable generators, rather than a small number of massive fossil-fuel generators, meant single outages in the system caused by wild weather would be less disruptive.
“Generating and storing power closer to where it is needed – for example, using solar and storage technologies – can reduce risks of grid failure for critical infrastructure,” the Climate Council report said.
The surveyed reports also found renewable energy would push down energy prices for consumers. One CSIRO report this year concluded a zero-emissions grid by 2050 would save the average household $414 a year compared with a business-as-usual approach.
“There’s no disputing it – fossil-fuel technology is obsolete, expensive and unreliable,” Stock said. “It’s time to look to the future with an energy system fit for the 21st century.” 
The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and the minister for the environment and energy, Josh Frydenberg, have been unable to get a climate and energy policy through the party room, leaving the industry in limbo.
This means businesses have been discouraged from investing in new electricity generation because the federal government can give them no confidence about future policy that would affect their investments.
The Climate Council chief executive, Amanda McKenzie, said the lack of a bipartisan policy was the only barrier remaining. 
“The nation’s leading energy experts, scientists and major authorities are all in agreement – Australia is ready to switch to a modern grid, powered by renewables and storage,” she said. “However, the only thing stopping this is political will.”
The vast majority of large energy companies globally also appear keen to invest millions in smart-grid technologies that would enable the transition. Pinsent Masons surveyed 250 senior-level executives from 200 energy generation and distribution companies (and investors in those markets) with revenues over US$1bn across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the Asia Pacific.
The firm found 90% of the utility companies in the survey were planning a joint venture with, or an acquisition of, a smart-grid technology company.
Australia was among the top five countries that the surveyed businesses were targeting for investment, but was being limited by lack of policy clarity.
Uncertainty and lack of legislation were highlighted as the biggest investment blockers for 13% of utilities in the survey. 
Nordic countries took the top place for attractiveness for investment, partly because energy policies there were clear.
“The Nordics are not only ahead in the technology bit, but their policies are also the best,” said one investor quoted in the report. “They have gradually changed their energy consumption and have successfully achieved their transformation targets, which are just increasing year-on-year as their policies are in favour of consumers. Businesses are benefiting either way with growth and rising interests of new consumers.”
A chief financial officer of an Australian utility was quoted as saying: “Countries without a cohesive energy policy are usually in turmoil when it comes to issues around energy distribution and management. For an investor looking to enter that market with smart energy solutions, it means a lot of uncertainty.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/05/australias-politics-only-barrier-to-clean-energy-system-report-finds

As always, particular weather events caused the records to be broken. But in a special climate statement, the Bureau of Meteorology said climate change also played a role, and earlier research has shown global warming has massively increased the chance of these records being broken.
On 22 September 2017 Australia experienced its hottest September day since records began more than a century ago, reaching an average maximum temperature across the continent of 33.47C – breaking the previous record set 19 years ago. 
NSW reached a record September temperature of 35.81C on 23 September – almost 15C above the average September temperature and more than 1.6C above the record set in 2003.
But in some locations, records tumbled multiple times in September. NSW recorded a September temperature above 40C for the first time in Wilcannia, setting a record measurement of 40.5C on 23 September. That record lasted just four days, with Wanaaring breaking it on 27 September, reaching 41.4C.
Queensland also experienced its hottest day over the whole state on 27 September, reaching 42.5C in Birdsville, and Victoria recorded a new September temperature record, measuring 37.7C for the first time at Mildura.
The average temperature for the month was not a record temperature, with that record being set by a highly unusual spring in 2013. Research conducted in 2014 by Sophie Lewis from the Australian National University found if greenhouse gases in the atmosphere were at pre-industrial levels, Australia would break that September record just once every 704 years. But current levels of greenhouse gases make that 16 times more likely.
Lewis said that estimate was now considered conservative, with actual extreme weather being seen as almost impossible without the influence of greenhouse gases.
 The Bureau of Meteorology said: “While all exceptional climate events have proximate causes in antecedent and concurrent weather conditions, long-term trends now also play a role. 
“Studies undertaken by the bureau and other scientific institutions have shown that climate change has contributed to the severity and frequency of recent heat events, including spring warmth.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/05/sweltering-september-smashes-australias-temperature-records

The order by a judge in San Francisco came as the Interior Department moved to delay the rule until 2019, saying it was too burdensome to industry. The action followed an earlier effort by the department to postpone part of the rule set to take effect next year.
US Magistrate Judge Elizabeth Laporte of the northern district of California said the department had failed to give a “reasoned explanation” for the changes and had not offered details why an earlier analysis by the Obama administration was faulty. She ordered the entire rule reinstated immediately.
The rule, finalized last November, forces energy companies to capture methane that’s burnt off or “flared” at drilling sites on public lands during production because it pollutes the environment. An estimated $330m a year in methane is wasted through leaks or intentional releases on federal lands, enough to power about 5m homes a year.
Methane, the primary component of natural gas, is a leading contributor to global warming. It is far more potent at trapping heat than carbon dioxide but does not stay in the air as long.
“It’s a good thing the courts are protecting Americans from oil and gas industry pollution, because the Trump administration has completely abdicated that responsibility,” said Michael Saul, a senior attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity, one of the groups that challenged the Trump rule along with California and New Mexico.
“The methane rule puts modest constraints on a dirty practice that endangers public health and wastes billions of taxpayer dollars,” Saul said. President Donald Trump and the interior secretrary, Ryan Zinke, “are not above the law and the court has made it clear they have to stop putting polluters above the people they were sworn to protect,” Saul said.
The court ruling follows a defeat in Congress, when the Senate unexpectedly turned back a bid to overturn the methane rule after three Republicans joined Democrats in voting to uphold it. The vote prompted Interior Department officials to promise to suspend, revise or rescind the regulation as part of a wider effort by the Trump administration to unravel what it considers burdensome regulations imposed by former president Barack Obama.
The methane rule imposes a “significant regulatory burden that encumbers American energy production, economic growth and job creation,” especially in North Dakota, Colorado and New Mexico, the department said.
Environmental groups sharply disagreed.
Rolling back the methane waste rule “makes no sense and is yet another example of the lengths this administration will go to sell out our public lands,” said Jenny Kordick, an energy policy expert for The Wilderness Society.
Democratic senator Tom Udall from New Mexico said the methane rule provides badly needed revenue to states such as New Mexico for public education and other services.
Prior to the rule, an estimated $100m in taxpayer-owned natural gas was wasted each year from oil and gas wells operating on public lands in New Mexico, Udall said, adding that the rule has helped to reduce dangerous air pollution across the west, including a methane cloud the size of Delaware that hangs over the Four Corners region of New Mexico, Utah, Arizona and Colorado.
“This rule is simply good policy good for taxpayers, good for the economy and good for the environment,” Udall said. He and other Democrats encouraged the public to speak out to defend the rule during a 30-day public comment period that begins on Thursday.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/05/court-orders-trump-administration-reinstate-obama-emissions-rule

Tim stressed the role of humans in those late Pleistocene extinctions in Australia.
The sedimentary history of the Lake Eyre basin provides a record of late Pleistocene and Holocene wet and dry periods reflected in the lakes levels and whether it was ephemeral or perennial.

Those time frames actually coincide perfectly with humanity causing it. There is some (good evidence) that the increasing aridity in parts of Australia (as well as increasing fires) was caused by the human hunting of diptodrons and other large animals - as they were the species that grazed on the undergrowth - when they went the area became more prone to fires - this then begun to favour plant species that coped better with fire and the forests started to turn to drier pastures and scrubland. 
20,000 - 30,000 years is about the amount of time it would take hunters of that level of technology and n the numbers at the time to cause the diptotron to go extinct. There was some really interesting research into this exact topic (I can't remember what it is called but it is referenced and outlined in the book the 6th extinction).

Figures released on Thursday showed a 33% rise in clearing to almost 400,000 hectares in 2015-16, meaning Queensland now has two-thirds the annual rate of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon.
The latest Statewide Landcover and Trees Study (Slats) report showed a 45% jump in clearing in reef catchments, where 40% of all clearing took place.
The deputy premier, Jackie Trad, said the rise of 100,000 hectares to 395,000 hectares cleared was “incredibly alarming”.
“We know that the current rates of land clearing in Queensland are unsustainable. Australia has become one of the deforestation hotspots in the world – the only advanced economy to be named in the 12 deforestation hotspots in the world. 
“[It’s] because Queensland has returned to the bad old days of bulldozing hundreds of thousands of hectares of woody and remnant vegetations in order to make way particularly for pasture for cows,” she said.
Rates of clearing surged when Campbell Newman promised to scrap restrictions, which his Liberal National party (LNP) government did in December 2013. Rates then reached a plateau of about 300,000 hectares for several years.
The minority Labor government tried to reverse the legislation last year, but was blocked at the 11th hour in August 2016 when its former MP turned crossbencher Billy Gordon sided with the LNP.
The Newman changes included wiping out protections for high conservation value regrowth, which made up about a third of clearing in 2015-16. The resurgence of clearing shown in the latest figures raises concerns about a fresh bout of “panic clearing” by rural landholders – primarily graziers – in anticipation of Labor’s changes going through.
Labor has promised to push through protections if returned to office with a majority at the upcoming election, while the LNP and One Nation – which could hold the balance of power – have said they will scotch reforms.
The environment minister, Steven Miles, said the latest report was “nothing short of devastating” because of the effects on wildlife, reef waters and coral, and Australia’s carbon emissions.
“It’s even worse than my worst fears for this next round of land clearing data,” he said. 
Miles said that “most concerningly” 35% of clearing was of remnant bushland, “138kha of old growth native forest, the most important habitat for native species”.
“We know that each year in Queensland 900,000 mammals lose their lives due to this loss of habitat.”
Miles said 40% of clearing was driving “more sediment into the Great Barrier Reef, literally suffocating our coral”.
“That’s not to mention the 45m tonnes of additional greenhouse gas emissions caused by this clearing.”
Deforestation in Queensland represents a hurdle not only to Australia’s priority goal of lifting water quality for the ailing reef but also its Paris climate commitments because it represents about 90% of the nation’s carbon emissions from land use.
Recent clearing for suburban development in the state’s south-east has also been linked to escalating pressure on koala populations from habitat destruction.
 “We need a parliament in Queensland that recognises this is an unsustainable problem that needs urgent redress,” Trad said.
Tree protections in Queensland were the critical factor in Australia meeting its Kyoto commitments on emissions cuts before the LNP wound them back after years of disquiet in the state’s rural areas.
Previous protections had brought clearing rates down from 500,000 hectares a year to 50,000. But Trad said they had subsequently “quadrupled” since the year before the Newman LNP government took office.
Conservation groups said the renewed surge belied claims from the LNP and the farm lobby that opposition to deregulation amounted to scaremongering.
Gemma Plesman, from the Wilderness Society Queensland, said the “shocking” figures showed a “hidden environmental crisis” that put Queensland “up there with the world’s worst offenders for forest destruction”.
Queensland Conservation Council coordinator Tim Seelig said the state’s “tree clearing crisis just got a whole load worse”. He called it “a catastrophe for wildlife and a catastrophe for the reef”.
Miles said the figures showed the state was “still suffering the devastating effects of decisions made by [LNP leader] Tim Nicholls and the LNP both when in government and since then in opposition, blocking our responsible legislation”.
He said the federal government had stalled after initially launching investigations into allegations of illegal clearing in north Queensland, and the National party had responded “so violently”. 
He stated: “The Turnbull government since then have failed to have any interest in assisting Queensland to protect our forests [or] to implement our long term sustainability plan for the Great Barrier Reef, which of course is incredibly disappointing.” 
Miles said clearing statewide was the “single biggest threat” to koala populations and that a ban on developer donations, promised by Labor on the recommendation of the corruption watchdog, would help conservation efforts.
According to deputy premier Trad, most land cleared statewide was for pastoral land, with a spike in “fodder harvesting” and “tree thinning”.
Protections would remove landholders’ scope for “self-assessment” and apply the “rigour of science” to clearing applications, she said, and the surge in clearing ahead of Labor’s touted reforms last year showed it was “landholders doing the wrong thing”.
Asked if a tree clearing ban was a “vote-winner” in rural Queensland, Trad replied: “This is the right thing to do, whether it’s in the bush or whether it’s in the southeast Queensland corner.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/05/alarming-rise-in-queensland-tree-clearing-as-400000-hectares-stripped

It's not just 'Climate Change'. It's not just 'Plastic Pollution'. It's not just the 'Greenhouse Effect'. I'm waiting for an actual encompassing description of what we humans are doing to ourselves and miracle planet Earth, our only home.
I call it 'Carbon Pollution' for the time being. I came to this term because it is vital to open our awareness to what else we've done to the oceans. We've caused the mass extinction of coral and molluscs around the planet through the creation of increased concentrations of CO2 in the air and therefore the water. This has resulted in the creation of carbonic acid, due to its equilibrium with CO2 in water. As a result, natural biological systems that fix calcium out of the water for the production of shells and skeletal support have been unable to work effectively resulting in the death of the animals that require calcium shell and skeletal support for their survival. 
This problem has been demonstrated all over the world within ocean environments from the arctic and antarctic to the equatorial oceans. The most dramatic and visual result has been coral bleaching and the subsequent death of vast coral reefs all over the world. At this time, the effect is being demonstrated across The Great Barrier Reef of Australia.
I personally had witnessed in 1978 healthy, productive and diverse coral reefs in the Caribbean. What I witness now are vast grey and algae covered plains of dead coral, not just in the Caribbean, but all over the world. The amount of coral reef death that has occurred over the past 40 years is beyond my comprehension. It is blatant and universal throughout the oceans.
There are many human created pollutants contributing to our destruction of planet Earth. That pollution is resulting in far more than 'Climate Change'. That phrase covers only a small part of the damage we humans, everywhere, do to our world every day.

Prince Charles said it had taken years for the enormity of the problem to emerge, but promised to make it a key priority of his campaigning, alongside rainforests. 
But he also confessed to mounting despair over how little has been achieved in his four decades of environmental campaigning, fearing we are “no longer a rational civilisation” but are driven by economic ideology.
He pointedly chose not to mention President Trump, who has denied climate change, but warned: “If the unprecedented ferocity of recent catastrophic hurricanes is not the supreme wake-up call that it needs to be, to address the vast and accumulating threat of climate change and ocean warming, then we – let alone the global insurance and financial sectors – can surely no longer consider ourselves part of a rational, sensible civilisation.”
He blamed “some strange, ideological urge to test the world to destruction”.
The prince, who has long been a campaigner on rainforests, told a marine conference that oceans were now a twin passion for him. “While we should be relieved that the health of the ocean is now understood, alongside rainforests, to be one of the essential prerequisites for our physical and economic survival, I wonder if the ocean’s fragility is yet truly grasped and how susceptible it is to the impacts of our economic activities … We must never mistake [the oceans] for a new frontier for endless economic exploitation.”
At the Our Ocean conference, the EU also announced plans to devote more than €550m to protecting the health of oceans, with more than 30 initiatives including efforts to combat piracy and illegal fishing, a satellite monitoring system, and a new plastics strategy for the bloc.
Federica Mogherini, the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, said: “The sea is a global common. We all have a responsibility to preserve it as a treasure and avoid that it turns into a threat. The EU believes that a globalised world needs a more cooperative global governance. It is impossible to imagine global governance without a cooperative oceans governance.”
Mogherini hoped that other countries would come forward with funding to bring the total to more than €1bn.
Karmenu Vella, the Maltese EU environment commissioner, said: “The EU has been a driving force behind the truly global effort [to protect marine life]. We have EU commitments on ocean governance, illegal fishing and the Arctic.”
One new EU initiative is to establish the first marine-protected area in the Adriatic. About 90% of fish stocks in the Mediterranean are currently over-exploited.
Another initiative announced at the conference to reduce the impact of plastic pollution was the consumer goods group Procter and Gamble’s plan to produce a new Fairy Liquid bottle made entirely of recycled plastic, including some retrieved from the ocean.
Sky announced it would remove all single-use plastic products from its operations and supply chains by 2020. The company will also invest £25m in a fund for startups and other businesses working on technology to solve the plastic problem.
In the Pacific, the small island of Niue, with the help of National Geographic and the UN development programme, is creating a marine-protected area covering approximately 127,000 sq km, more than 40% of its sea area. The island, a self-governing community in free association with New Zealand, is one of the world’s biggest raised coral atolls.

It takes 20-30 years for forest to reestablish, assuming it doesn't go saline or the beef growers just keep it cleared. I'd assume either or both, on past experience. So no recovery, worst case.
In 50 years at that rate, 40% of the Qld forest estate would be cleared. Effects of land clearing tend to be exponential so that's a glass well less than half full in real terms.
There's an old picture I've seen of some farmers developing the first bores in the Great Artesian Basin. They are recorded to have commented appreciatively that the water would last 100 years. That was 100 years ago, and the reality now is that the GAB is critically endangered in Queensland, so they were right but it doesn't help us.

Coal capital, One Nation on the rise and now once again a world beater at clearing the bush.
For 30 years, Queensland was my home. I left for love and to start a family but my heart stayed in the state. The beauty of the rainforests, the splendour of the reef, the vast forested wildness of Cape York and the expanses of the outback all left an indelible impact. I also miss the honesty, directness and the no nonsense approach of Queenslanders.
For a generation, Queenslanders from all walks of life sought to create a new and vibrant Queensland after the repressive nothingness of the long Bjelke-Petersen era.
We were sick to death of being called the police state, of being the place where creativity was mocked, where race relations resembled apartheid-era South Africa and where the natural environment was under constant siege from all manner of state-sanctioned exploitation.
As a young “greenie” in Brisbane in the 1990s, one of the hardest things about being a Queenslander was the knowledge that massive amounts of forests and bushlands clearing was going on up and down the coast and throughout the vast rangelands of the interior.
All through the 1990s, hundreds of thousands of hectares of bush were levelled by enormous bulldozers and massive metal chains each and every year. In the year 2000, almost 800,000 hectares of forests and bushlands were lost. The cost to wildlife was massive with conservative estimates of tens of millions of animals killed each and every year.
And then after 30 years of unabated destruction, Queenslanders from all walks of life came together to say enough was enough. 
Across the state, communities convinced the government of Peter Beattie to step in and stop the chop. After a few missteps, in 2004, Beattie included tough new laws to dramatically decrease deforestation. These laws passed with the support of the Queensland Liberals, then in one of their periods of independence from the Queensland Nationals.
Even the peak farm body, Agforce, provided muted support for the new laws. It appeared Queensland had turned the page on a new chapter, one in which protecting the environment and building a sustainable economy was paramount. 
In Canberra, the Howard government supported the laws – reducing the rates of deforestation in Queensland meant a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and meant Howard could claim that Australia was on track to meet emissions reduction targets required under the Kyoto protocol.
And the laws worked. By 2010, clearing had reduced to 78,000 hectares, still a lot but substantially less than the bad old days. But then the tide turned.
In 2012, the newly-elected government of Campbell Newman broke an explicit election promise and gutted the land clearing laws. The old school Nationals were jubilant and the dozers were back into the bush en masse.
The legacy of Newman’s folly is written large in destroyed forests, soaring greenhouse gas emissions and further stress on an already critically ill Great Barrier Reef.
The release on Thursday of the 2015/16 annual land clearing data is heart breaking. Incredibly, 396,000 hectares of forests and bushlands were cleared, a 33% increase on clearing from the previous year of 2014/15. In total, a staggering 1.25m hectares of bush have been cleared since Newman took the axe to the laws.
Attempts by the new Queensland government to strengthen the laws in 2016 were defeated by the LNP and the cross benches.
The cost to wildlife is staggering with a recent report by CSIRO estimating that 50 million mammals, birds and reptiles are killed every year due to deforestation in Queensland and New South Wales.
Soaring emissions from deforestation, conservatively estimated by the Australian government as releasing 49m tonnes of greenhouse gases per year (9% of all Australian emissions), have almost completely cancelled out reductions in emissions delivered through the federal $2.24bn Emissions Reduction Fund.
And finally, massive amounts of clearing in the catchments that feed that Great Barrier Reef make a mockery of iron clad guarantees to reduce clearing made by the Australian and Queensland governments as part of the multi-billion-dollar Reef 2050 plan which saved Australia from the embarrassment of having the reef listed as “world heritage site in danger”. 
Queensland has a brighter future than this and Queenslanders, when confronted with the awful reality of what is happening, will again demand action and leadership. 
It is time for the LNP to recognise the folly of their actions in 2012, it is time for the Australian government to be firm and demand change on climate, reef protection and environmental grounds, and it is time for the Queensland parliament to commit to strong laws to end deforestation in Queensland.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/06/for-the-love-of-queensland-this-land-clearing-has-got-to-stop

BQSTART
The Woods Hole Research Center, citing two 2015 studies on permafrost carbon says there may be a self-reinforcing tipping point where an estimated equivalent of 205 gigatons of carbon dioxide in the form of methane could cause up to 0.5 °C (up to 0.9 °F) warming by the end of the century, which would trigger more warming. Permafrost contains almost twice as much carbon as is present in the atmosphere. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change does not adequately account for arctic methane in permafrost.
BQEND
Here, 'tipping point' refers to the inability of the system to return to its prior state after being forced a certain distance. It's a kind of non-linear effect, like bending a spring so far that it is incapable of ever springing back to its original shape.
In contrast, feedbacks (both positive and negative) either amplify or dampen, respectively, the ability of the system to move in any given direction - for example, air resistance is a negative feedback on the velocity of a projectile; the CO2 emissions from melting permafrost are a positive feedback on the rising amounts of CO2 in the atmosphere.

What's the explanation for the rise in methane ever since? It seems to be coming from tropical sources and Arctic sources, perhaps a combination of tropical soils and wetland releasing methane along with melting Arctic permafrost doing the same. 
If so, this means we hit the ""tipping point"" back in 2008 and even a complete halt in fossil fuel combustion over the next few decades will do little to prevent greenhouse gases from slowly rising, simply due to the biogeochemical feedbacks.

Not at all, the latter (high emisions) will ensure the former (low population) is inevitable. It just won't be pleasant but it's the defacto choice we've made. Yes, I have reduced my emisions to about 2.5t per annum, had a vasectomy and have no children before folk say 'you first'
If the worlds population were ONLY 500 Million and they emitted like the USA , you would still have a problem, just delayed by a few more decades. This is NOT a population problem. The estimated carrying capacity of the planet with USA level consumption and subsequent emsisions is about 200 Million.

The soil balance is a function of biodiversity, which has suffered severely in the last century. It's partially what is taken out of the soil and put back in, but also the bacterial colonies (hundreds, sometimes thousands, of species of bacteria per species of plant), as these alter the chemical composition as well.
Living vegetation alters the atmosphere and the climate. Therefore it influences the mean and variation of temperature.
There are many such factors and their interaction is highly complex. That, and chaos theory, is why we have probabilistic models and can use shotgun techniques to calculate likely scenarios.

Yet there is a problem in the meaning of the term 'complacent'.
Over 30 years the Guardian has been reporting on AGW, and most of its staff doubtless wouldn't consider themselves complacent - yet the reporting has never yet described the threat posed by the widely documented scale and rate of acceleration of the eight Major Interactive Feedbacks [MIFs] that scientific research reports, nor their implication of our inevitable reliance on both the Carbon Recovery and Albedo Restoration modes of geo-engineering alongside Emissions Control to achieve the essential global cooling.
The 8 MIFs can be listed roughly in order of senority as:- Ocean Heating & Acidification;- Increased airborne Water Vapour;- Declining Polar Ice Albedo;- Rising Permafrost Melt;- Fertilized Peatbog Decay;- Rising Forest Loss;- Rising Soil-carbon Outgassing;- Rising Methane Hydrates' Melt.
The basics of most of these phenomena have been discussed in Guardian articles, but rarely with anything more than a passing reference to their feedback 'potential', when in reality they have been up and running for periods ranging from centuries to at least a decade. 
No attempt has been made to publish an article describing their combined action - the present article is the best yet in mentioning 3 MIFs in passing - despite the basic science on them having been widely available for decades. (I first learnt of the potential of 7 out of 8 of them in Dr John Gribben's 1989 book ""Hothouse Earth"").
What needs to be very widely understood is that the MIFs are not only interactive in the longer term - by the warming each one causes not only reinforcing its own warming output but also reinforcing all other MIFs' warming outputs after the 35-yr timelag on GHGs' warming effects due to the oceans' thermal inertia -but they are also interactive currently - by very diverse 'direct coupling mechanisms' between MIFs whereby physical changes caused by one drive the acceleration of another, which in turn drives the acceleration of others.
A commonly cited example of such a chain of 'direct coupling mechanisms' is that of Ocean Heating & Acidification driving the Polar Albedo Loss by melting ice - which yields warmer air masses above the Arctic Ocean that then move inland - where their signature has been recorded in accelerated rates of Permafrost Melt - which then contributes to Forest Loss with its further carbon output. And so on . . . 
The key observation is that none of the MIFs can reliably be evaluated in isolation since all are subject to acceleration by others and impose acceleration on others. They should instead be considered as a single organic system which has the potential to impose very abrupt warming on the planet - particularly under the present unprecedented rates of increase of anthropogenic airborne CO2, CH4 and other GHGs.
For the Guardian to get beyond complacency and instead become a part of the solution its reporters need to step away from the comfortable 30-yr position of the tacit 'Denial of Urgency' - such as underlay its total lack of critique of the grossly ambiguous and complacent UK goal for Paris that was agreed by Milliband, Cameron & Clegg as ""Net-zero global emissions in the second half of the century"" -and instead start to inform the readership of the existential threat that Climate Destabilization now poses to our society, against which we currently lack the political will to regulate emissions and to apply extant technologies at the maximum rate and also to develop the additional geo-engineering technologies that will be critical to society's survival.
No doubt there are Guardian journalists who think they're doing their best - they need to understand that they won't know what their best is until after they've tried far far harder.

The rest of the material, is 2 ply blog roll and op ed pieces that feel like the shiny toilet roll used in underfunded state institutions in the 70's and 80's.

So it's a useless blog roll posting that only deniers would be gullible enough to actually use as Evidence(TM).
Once again it does afford an opportunity to point out that the deniers still have not conducted their own peer reviewed papers, surveying the available literature in a scientific manner and shown a different conclusion.
For over a decade.
This leads normal people to conclude that other than baseless assertions, the deniers are: lazy; wrong; or just plain mad.

It is in fact amazingly stable. 
We have tested this over the last 2.4 million years - by observing ""resetting/perturbation"" of the global climate around 40 times. The glacial cycles. If it was deeply chaotic - this would have given some fascinating and random stuff happening. Instead we see the same patterns repeat themselves to very narrow values - even as the frequency change from 40,000 to 100,000 main cycles over time - with associated change in amplitude (as volume). 
Now - what the ice-age experiment also show us is that climate is non-linear of course. With the addition of huge self-enhancing feedback mechanisms. They also showed us the first truly bi-stable behaviour of the climate system - the Dansgaard-Oeschger events, linking bistability of atmosphere and ocean circulation. 
That discovery in the early 90's introduced some ideas that were taken straight out of physics (as UO explain) - leading to ideas of ""reversed"" ocean circulation (in simple terms - the ocean ""Gulf Stream"" rapidly start to flow in the other direction) - ""flip-flopping"". It also came out of ""toy-models"" and ""box-models"" of old - because this behaviour is built into physics itself. 
Now we know that this is not the case - it is general circulation that gets perturbed along thresholds - that actually are rather well understood (though the complete picture involving all sub-systems and chain of events are still discussed). 
I understand this can be confusing - because one do discuss different stable states. But these states are not ""flip-flops"" - they are more like ""twins with different personalities"" - or two ""gears"". 
This is of course a bit technical - and it is good to be aware of climate having different - let us call it ""expressions"" that can switch extremely rapidly under certain conditions. 
But it is wrong to say that climate simply want to ""bite"" us in ""flipping"" randomly. 
Non-linearity is in fact a continuum that one can slide a lever through. But it is still reversible. Even the DO-events that cause massive 10-degrees changes in Greenland and shift the entire Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation - is reversibel (taking around 1000 years to recover). 
So from a pure physical perspective - these things are not what many people think of as ""flip-flopping"" - they are continuum of each other. In other words in principle - reversible. ""The rubber band is stretched but not broken"". 
Positive feedback is as such not implying ""run-away"". Pretty much all positive feedbacks we see in the climate system is lovely (spring is a positive feedback). 
These are all principles and simplified concepts. 
And, this is important, they do not really tackle what we experience as surface dwellers. As again demonstrated by the ice-age experiment. The involved external forcing is really really low - pacing a whole suit of positive feedbacks into ice-ages. 
Not chaotic - not irreversible, not in physical sense ""flip-flopping"". Even if we follow RCP 8.5 emissions until year 2300, it is estimated to be back to normal by year 95,000 or around that time. 
This will obviously be copy-pasted by deniers - as it strongly indicate that AGW is perfectly linear and will go back to normal in less that 25,000 generations after small hickups last only for 250 generations according to the Ice-age experiment. 
So it is worthwhile to point out that when we discuss AGW we look at the future of the world that geologically is as short as - say the time from the Romans to present (rapid climate change in geology). But we also discuss something else - We are actually not performing a ""natural"" experiment (like ice-ages externally paced) - but more like a man-made supervolcano experiment that dig deep into the geological carbon cycle. Associated with mass extinctions. So it is more than physics at play. It is ecosystems at play. And we do not predict ecosystems from pure physical principles and they clearly behave very different during hyper-thermals than the pure physical climate system behave. 
As such - the breaking points are not so much in the physics of climate calculated as energy energy-transfer/volume transport/vectors and stuff. That simply respond physically. Life however - that follow different rules, with different thresholds. And humans, last time i checked is considered as ""life"" - not as some Q in physics. 
Finally - rate of change. It is not so stressfull for the pure physical side of the Earth system. That is more a question of getting phase-changes and the delays of feedback right.

What maths ? The paper doesn't put a numerical value on the feedback, it just states that it is positive. That doesn't rule out the possibility that it would be a runaway, but doesn't imply that it is. ""Necessary, but not sufficient"" as the lawyers would say.
However, it is somewhat academic anyway. As I pointed out, the paper is concerned with mid-latitude forest soils, which form only a part of the soils of the world.

The increased production of carbon comes from the microbes within soils, according to a report in the peer-review journal Science, published on Friday. 
The 26-year study is one of the biggest of its kind, and is a groundbreaking addition to our scant knowledge of exactly how warming will affect natural systems.
Potential feedback loops, or tipping points, have long been suspected to exist by scientists, and there is some evidence for them in the geological record. What appears to happen is that once warming reaches a certain point, these natural biological factors kick in and can lead to a runaway, and potentially unstoppable, increase in warming. 
Other tipping points posited by scientists include the disappearance of ice in the Arctic, which creates areas of dark water that absorb more heat, and the release of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, from thawing permafrost.
In the Science study, researchers examined plots of soil in the Harvard Forest in Massachusetts, a mixed hardwood forest in the US. They experimented by heating some of the plots with underground cables to 5C above normal levels, leaving others as a control. 
The long-term study revealed that in the first 10 years there was a strong increase in the carbon released from the heated plots, then a period of about seven years when the carbon release abated. But after this second calmer period, which the scientists attribute to the adjustment of the soil microbes to the warmer conditions, the release of carbon resumed its upward path.
In the last three years, the release of carbon has once again dropped back, which scientists attribute to another reorganisation of the microbes present. They suggest an increase in the number of microbes that can feast on the hard-to-digest organic matter, such as plant-based lignin, which gives clues to the possible cyclical nature of the process.
From 1991, when the experiment began, the plots subjected to 5C warming lost about 17% of the carbon that had been stored in the top 60cm of the soil, where the greatest concentration of organic matter is to be found.
Scientific understanding of the complexities of soil microbial activity is still limited, but the long-term nature of the study provides valuable insights into what might be happening, and is likely to happen in future, to vast swaths of forest soils across the world.
While deforestation has been the focus of most research into forests’ effects on climate change, with a recent study suggesting tropical forests are turning into carbon sources rather than carbon stores as a result, the impact of warming soils has remained much of a mystery. Soils are one of the world’s biggest natural carbon sinks, along with trees and the oceans.
Daniel Metcalfe, of Sweden’s Lund University, said: “If these findings hold more widely across major terrestrial ecosystems, then a much greater portion of the global soil carbon store could be vulnerable to decomposition and release of carbon dioxide under global warming than previously thought.”
The study was carried out by scientists at the US Marine Biological Laboratory, led by Jerry Melillo, with contributions from the universities of Massachusetts and New Hampshire. 
Melillo, who holds the position of distinguished scientist at the MBL, said: “Each year, mostly from fossil fuel burning, we are releasing about 10bn metric tons of carbon into the atmosphere. The world’s soils contain about 3,500bn tons of carbon. If a significant amount of that is added to the atmosphere, due to microbial activity, that will accelerate the global warming process. Once this self-reinforcing feedback begins, there is no easy way to turn it off. There is no switch to flip.”
He added: “The future is warmer. How much warmer is the issue.” While emissions from fossil fuels can be cut back, the reactions of the natural world to a warming climate may be impossible to control.
Some recent work has suggested that the warming of the globe may be progressing at a slightly slower rate than the upper range of previous studies estimated. However, feedback loops and tipping points have the potential to create sudden disruptions that are hard to take account of in standard climate modelling, and these could mean much greater changes and far higher rates of warming in the future.
Separately, research from Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, and other institutions, published in the Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution and Systematics, and Global Change Biology, called for more work on how soil could be used as a carbon store. When agricultural soils are well-managed, they can store more carbon than they emit, which would allow them to be used as potential carbon sinks.
But the scientists warn that “we still don’t have a strong understanding of the interactions among biological, chemical and physical processes regulating carbon in soils”. They say much more research is needed, particularly as there are dangers in soils in Siberia that are rapidly warning, and could release vast quantities of carbon. They also warn that there may be 25-30% less organic matter in some soils than previously estimated. 
“Soil has changed under our feet,” said Jennifer Harden, a visiting scholar at Stanford. “We can’t use the soil maps made 80 years ago and expect to find the same answers.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/05/carbon-emissions-warming-soils-higher-than-estimated-signalling-tipping-points

Most are red admirals, a large, dark and powerful presence sailing through autumnal skies or feeding on rotten fruit in orchards.
It has been a vintage red admiral year, with numbers up by 75% on 2016 in Butterfly Conservation’s Big Butterfly Count. But sadly it has not been a vintage butterfly summer.
With much of southern Britain enjoying a sunny May and June it once looked as if it might turn out to be the best season for a decade. But a wet July and August put a dampener on most species, which do emerge midsummer. 
Heavy summer rains can wipe out whole generations. One butterfly recorder I spoke to reported seeing scores of speckled woods on his transect but, after a heavy rainfall, suddenly there were none.
It was not a disaster like 2016, when a glorious late summer arrived too late for the butterflies; nor was it like the sodden summer of 2012. Not bad, is most butterfly lovers’ grudging verdict on 2017, and that may be as good as it gets.
Our butterflies are well-adapted to the vicissitudes of the British summer but the long-term decline in two-thirds of our 59 native species shows they are less equipped to deal with rapid climatic changes or the dousing of farmland and gardens with pesticides.
Milder winters in particular appear to be disastrous for many butterfly species, though not the red admiral. Half a century ago it appeared unable to survive British winters and most individuals made the reverse migration to the continent. Now it is not only a successful hibernator, but the most commonly spotted butterfly throughout the winter months. Keep a lookout for this Christmas-coloured insect if Christmas Day is sunny.

The results also point again to apparent holes in the federal government’s greenhouse gas accounting, as its official figures maintain that land clearing in Queensland is reducing, and that changes in land use across the whole country are cutting emissions rather than adding to them.
About 40% of the clearing in the state identified in the latest figures occurred in catchments that drain water into the Great Barrier Reef, which will increase pollution affecting the struggling coral, sparking further calls for the environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, to use his powers under federal law to stop some of the clearing.
On Thursday the Queensland government released figures showing 395,000 hectares of bush had been cleared in 2015-16, according to its statewide landcover and tree study (Slats). That was up a third compared with the previous year and almost 50% compared with two years earlier.
The state environment minister, Steven Miles, said the clearing in one year in Queensland alone caused 45m tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions.
The centrepiece of the federal government’s Direct Action policy on climate change is its $2.55bn Emissions Reduction Fund, under which it pays companies to pollute less.
In the last auction of the ERF, the government paid an average of $11.82 for each tonne of carbon abated, meaning the emissions from Queensland’s land clearing cancelled out more than half a billion dollars of abatement paid for by the taxpayer – a fifth of the total fund in one year.
“Deforestation has a major impact on climate change,” said Lyndon Schneiders, national director of the Wilderness Society. “Ending deforestation would be a fast, cheap and effective way to cut Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions.”
Meanwhile, the federal government’s national greenhouse gas inventory, which is the country’s official source of climate change accounting, continues to find that across the whole country, changes in land use – which includes land clearing – amount to a carbon sink rather than a source.
In the latest federal government figures, for the year to March 2017, changes in land use are counted as an abatement of 0.1% of Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions. The report on the figures says Queensland’s land sector emissions have been “reducing over time”.
Changes in the way the federal government measures greenhouse gas emissions have led to revisions of historical reports, with significant amounts of emissions disappearing. Explanations given for the revisions do not fully explain the reduced emissions.
The environment department said in a statement Queensland data was used to prepare the national figures and informed the national inventories.
“Each year, we update land clearing estimates based on latest satellite data. Where applicable, we also revise estimates to reflect improvements in remote sensing and estimation methods,” a spokesperson said.
The large amount of clearing occurring in the Great Barrier Reef catchments has led to renewed calls for Frydenberg to use his powers under the federal Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to stop some of the clearing.
Frydenberg has previously stated that clearing activities require approval under the act if they “have, will have or are likely to have a significant impact on a matter of national environmental significance under federal environment law”.
He told the ABC in July the government had powers to enforce those laws and would continue to do so.
But a WWF report from July found 99.2% of properties where land had been cleared that appeared to need approval under the act, had failed to gain it. The only time the federal government forced a property owner to gain approval, it led to fighting within the federal Coalition.
“The amount of clearing in reef catchments should be ringing alarm bells with minister Frydenberg,” said Martin Taylor, a conservation scientist at WWF-Australia.
“When the Queensland parliament rejected tougher laws the commonwealth was the last line of defence. Minister Frydenberg’s department has the power under the EPBC Act to rein this in. But the EPBC protections only work if they’re used and that’s not happening,” Taylor said.
Frydenberg’s office did not respond to questions about the matter.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/06/queensland-tree-clearing-wipes-out-federal-emissions-gains

Speaking ahead of key climate talks in Bonn next month she urged politicians to recognise that indigenous communities around the world were the most effective custodians of millions of hectares of forest “which act as the world’s lungs”.
“Indigenous people’s rights need to be protected in the best way possible, not just for them but because they are also able to provide solutions to many of the world’s problems from climate change to biological diversity. 
“It is in the self interest of states and even corporations in the medium and long term to protect and listen to these people – the question is, will they realise this in time?” said Tauli-Corpuz.
A recent study found that a quarter of the carbon stored above ground in the world’s tropical forests is found in the collectively managed territories of indigenous peoples and local communities.
In Brazil, deforestation in indigenous community forests from 2000 to 2012 was less than 1%, compared to 7% outside those areas.
“They are the most effective stewards of these key areas,” said Tauli-Corpuz. “The needs of these indigenous people are converging with the wider environmental needs to protect these areas.”
Indigenous people are locked in fierce conflicts with mining, logging and agricultural companies and their private security firms in hundreds of places from Indonesia to Brazil. 2016 was the deadliest year on record for land rights defenders with about 200 people killed in conflicts in Latin America, Africa and Asia. In addition, thousands more community activists were threatened or harassed. A Guardian project working with Global Witness is highlighting the pressure many of these groups face and has identified at least 134 people who have been killed so far this year.
Tauli-Corpuz, who was speaking at the launch of a new global institution dedicated to securing the land rights of tens of millions of indigenous people, said there was an atmosphere of fear and intimidation in many of these communities.
The event in Stockholm was the official launch of the International Land and Forest Tenure Facility which aims to help communities protect their land resources as well as combat climate change.
Funded by Sweden, Norway and the Ford Foundation, a US charity, the Tenure Facility, has already provided grants and guidance for pilot projects in six nations.
The Ford Foundation president Darren Walker said it was an important development in the fight against climate change and inequality. “Creating mechanisms that allow indigenous peoples and local communities to gain tenure over their land or forests is a way to tackle both these problems.”
The Ford Foundation has pledged $5m, and Norway has announced a grant of $20m over the coming years. Sweden pitched in $10m during the pilot phase and will fund future projects. Walker said he expects donations to rise to $100m overall within a year.
The project aims to boost forestland properly titled to indigenous peoples by 40m hectares, an area twice the size of Spain, within a decade. Organisers say this would prevent deforestation of 1m hectares and the release of 500m tonnes of CO2, more than the annual emissions of Britain or Brazil.
Indigenous leaders representing tens of millions of people involved in land disputes in Asia, Africa and South America attended the conference. They said the tenure programme was an important step towards stopping the persecution of indigenous communities – but warned more needs to be done.
Rukka Sombolinggi, the first female secretary-general of the world’s largest indigenous organisation, Aman, which represents 17 million people in Indonesia, said: “Our houses are being burnt down, people are being killed, tortured, and sent to jail as we speak.”
Sombolinggi said some progress had been made, with much of the forests where indigenous communities live in Indonesia mapped for the first time. And she said “dominant communities” would benefit, not only environmentally from more rights for indigenous people, but argued they could also learn important lessons from the way many of these groups lived.
“If we want to see the beautiful centuries ahead … we need to shift our paradigm of what constitutes wealth or prosperity because too many people see happiness only in terms of material goods and achievements and it is having a devastating impact. Many of us have lost our ability to connect with natural things and no longer seem able to live in harmony with the simple happiness around us.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/06/protect-lives-indigenous-people-can-limit-climate-change-says-un

In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, one of two category five storms to batter the eastern Caribbean in just a week, three words resonate in my mind.
The first word is “unfamiliar”. Scientific analysis shows that the climate of the Caribbean region is already changing in ways that seem to signal the emergence of a new climate regime. Irma and Maria fit this pattern all too well. At no point in the historical records dating back to the late 1800s have two category five storms made landfall in the small Caribbean island chain of the eastern Antilles in a single year. 
The intensification almost overnight from a tropical storm to a category five hurricane and the devastating intensity that lingered for several days are also unfamiliar, even to a region that is used to seeing hurricanes. Alongside other emerging climate patterns, there is a strong case to be made that there is something unfamiliar about the Caribbean’s climate today. We are seeing repeated and prolonged droughts, an increase in the number of very hot days, intense rainfall events causing repeated localised flooding, and rising sea levels that are consuming the beautiful beaches on which tourism in our region depends.
The problem with unfamiliarity is that daily existence in the Caribbean is built on familiar patterns of climate. Our economies are premised on industries and sectors that are extremely sensitive to climate variations, such as tourism and agriculture. In a year that follows expected patterns and pulls no surprises, we see favourable economic growth and improvements in our quality of life. Even when we’ve seen bad weather, we have always had a certain familiarity with the limits of how bad it can be. Until now, newer infrastructure in the Caribbean has largely withstood the ravages of hurricanes and tropical storms, as their design has accounted for the upper bounds of extreme weather experienced in the past.
Irma and Maria threw out the notion of planning and preparedness based on the expected and the familiar. Their ferocity destroyed even the strongest evacuation shelters and brought devastation of catastrophic proportions to our tiny islands. Just as climate change is heralding in an era marked by the unfamiliar, we need a paradigm shift in our approach to development planning in highly vulnerable regions. 
The second word that comes to mind is “unprecedented”. A business-as-usual scenario without global action suggests that by the end of the current century, the Caribbean region will warm a further 2-3C over the 1C already seen in the last century. We project annual rainfall amounts will decrease by up to 40%, posing a significant challenge to already water stressed islands. Projections also show sea levels rising by 1-2 metres, far exceeding the rise already recorded. 
Most frighteningly, given our experience in the last few weeks, is the expectation that we will see more of the strongest tropical Atlantic hurricanes (though not necessarily more overall). Cumulatively, the science of projections suggests that the region’s climate will be altered beyond recognition. This is to say, it will be outside the bounds of our lived experience to date. It will not just be unfamiliar at times, it may be unprecedented all the time. 
The stocktaking is hardly complete from Irma and Maria. Yet for Barbuda and Dominica at least, the setback to their economies will be measured in years. The initial estimates for rebuilding are staggering. Perhaps even more heartbreaking is the loss of those things that are economically unquantifiable. The drastic reductions in living standards, especially for the most vulnerable, that will continue for months to come. The loss of irreplaceable culture and cultural assets, the mental anguish and loss of lives, the loss of biodiversity, and the destruction of “island life” as we know it.
The small island of Barbuda, for the first time in 300 years, has no human inhabitants. They were all evacuated after the devastation wreaked by Irma and in anticipation of Jose and Maria. This seems to portend the challenge that climate change represents for the Caribbean region – a challenge that becomes more acute as the era of the unprecedented is ushered in faster than the region can prepare for its onset.
Finally, the third word that comes to mind is “urgent”. Admirably, although the Caribbean islands are minuscule emitters of greenhouse gases, they have made bold commitments regarding future use. But in the end, the future viability of the region is premised on collective global action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It is for this reason that the Caribbean and other small island and developing states have argued for a limit to global warming of 1.5C. It is this message that must reach the global community when they see the images of Irma and Maria. For those in the Caribbean, the lessons are all too clear.

In the rest of his article he mixed unrelated science from all over the globe with the peculiar claims of noted eccentrics, and suggested that we should plough unsuitable land to grow soya, which will not grow in this climate, to produce artificial meat in urban factories.
He didn’t mention inconvenient features of the British ruminant livestock industry, such as the fact that most feed that animals get other than grass is made up of byproducts of the human food industry such as brewers’ grains, sugar beet and fruit-juice pulp, most of which would have to go to landfill if cows and sheep did not recycle it. Without the income from this form of recycling, the price of food in the shop would increase. We do need to moderate excessive meat consumption, and we do need to act on climate change, but this article sows confusion that will delay necessary change.Huw JonesSt Clears, Carmarthenshire
• Livestock has long formed part of the warp and weft of our countryside, and the issue of its potent role in greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of pollution cannot be ducked. Compared to other sectors, farming has done poorly. Emissions have risen since 2010, despite the increasing urgency to act. That does not mean that we should get rid of all livestock. The issues are complex. Even the Food Climate Research Network, cited by George Monbiot, concludes that grazing livestock has a limited place in a sustainable food system.
For us, this limited place means people in the UK should eat less but better-quality animal produce, whether dairy, eggs or meat. It also requires eating many more plants and challenging rising demand for animal-based proteins. The challenge for the farming sector is to make the shift to more sustainable and resilient systems, much less dependent on fossil fuels and set up to support a healthier population. We know this is possible because some farmers are doing this already, and very successfully too.Graeme WillisFood and farming campaigner, Campaign to Protect Rural England
• On this occasion George Monbiot’s evangelical zeal obscures some fundamental practicalities. First, much grazing land is simply unsuitable for growing crops. For example, an organic farmer friend on Dartmoor tells me his land will successfully grow only grass. He farms organically and the manure allows insects to flourish, encouraging a high number and variety of farmland birds. Many arable farms, with their vast acres of monoculture, are often deserts where wildlife is concerned.
Second, the implication that livestock farming is cruel is unfair and insulting. Like many farmers, my friend cares greatly about both the natural environment and the welfare of his animals. Third, would rewilding always be such a good idea? It would most likely produce impenetrable scrubland. We have a profound love of our farmed landscape, shaped in large measure by livestock grazing. Surely few of the 99% who are not vegans would consider veganism a price worth paying for its destruction.
In any case, replacing meat with vegetables is a second-order priority beside the existential issues of population growth and global warming. And, yes, I am a meat-eater and the vast majority of people are firmly of the opinion that the tastiest dishes are those based on meat.David ThomasHereford
• Our dependence on meat is mirrored by the Vikings who colonised Greenland during the Middle Ages. Although fish was readily available, they continued to raise cattle as this conferred social status. When the climate turned colder they perished. By contrast, the inhabitants of Tikopia, a small Pacific island, abandoned pig-rearing in the 17th century as they were rooting up vegetables and competing for food. This may be the only example of a society voluntarily abandoning meat consumption, and it allowed the Tikopians to maintain a population of 400 inhabitants per square mile without any recourse to modern agricultural technology. The question posed in my book The Gilgamesh Gene is whether humanity is behaving like the Vikings or the Tikopians.Dr Robin Russell-JonesStoke Poges, Buckinghamshire
• This is another stimulating article, but I wonder why George Monbiot does not make the point that the essential reason for not eating animal products is that the breeding, rearing and killing of sentient and intelligent animals is cruel and brutal, and unnecessary for human beings to survive and thrive. Of course, the supplementary point that the evidence shows that it is also potentially damaging to the future wellbeing of humanity is also relevant, but it is not the essential reason for avoiding animal products.Roger GibbsLoughton, Essex

A myth. 
1. Banks are forced to buy. It's not a choice. 2. Insurers are forced to buy. It's not a free choice3. The biggest buyer has been the state via QE. Look at the accounts. Do you need a link? 
That is because QE, which creates money, simultaneously takes bonds out of circulation. It does not flood the market with new bonds. Instead it reduces the supply of bonds because the new money created is either used to repurchase bonds already in existence or it could (if we do Brexit and so leave EU law behind) avoid the need for the issuance of bonds altogether with the Bank of England then lending money direct to the Treasury instead.
Very roughly, QE purchases have been the same as new issuance since QE started. He's talking bollocks. 
It’s the mix of debt that we have that is causing the crisis.
And the biggest debt is pensions.

And your views on Jeremy Corbyn delivering such a reform, should he win the next election?
BQENDIf Labour win the next election in a traditional sense, ie. they have a single party majority, no matter how slim, I believe effective voting reform will remain out of reach - a fudge of some description will be arrived at, meaning the reform will be once again, kicked into the long Westminster grass.
If, however another balanced Parliament ensues, something like the following; • Labour - 300 seats• Conservatives - 280 seats• Lib Dems - 20 seats• SNP - 30 seats• Greens - 1 seat• Northern Ireland - 18 seats• Speaker - 1 seatthat outcome would require both SNP and LibDem collaboration with Labour in some form or another to create a working administration - their input would mean any Constitutional Convention process would necessarily have to include both serious voting reform and serious dispersal of politcal power away from Westminster. 
The potential for introducing Single Transferable Vote in multi-member constituencies and moving towards the creation of a Federal British state would be very real - remember that the deliberations of the Convention would be in public - radical ideas would quickly become tangible possibilities rather than the ususal dream like proposals never ever likely to see the light of day - as that realisation dawned with Jo Public I believe interest in and support for real change would quickly develop an unstoppable momentum (pun intended)!

The disingenuousness of the ""Left"" (again, not the appropriate term, as I am sure you will agree) indicates the essential tendentiousness of their reasoning: it is preposterous to argue that Euro-scepticism repelled most voters given the referendum result, and it is extremely dubious to argue that pro-Brexit is a minority opinion, as you do. Now, it may or may not be true that Brexit is going to be economically disruptive to an extreme degree, or that Brexit will mean the loss of some or all employment and environmental protections as TruthSeeker79 claims (in fact we had both before we entered the EEC as it then was, and the Common Agricultural Policy in particular had a disastrous effect on nature in the UK and elsewhere in Europe, and there is nothing guaranteeing that the EU will always and everywhere be pro-worker and pro-environment), but when is the ""Left"" (sorry) going to ask itself how we got to Brexit as a serious question rather than resorting incessantly to laughable ""rescue hypotheses"" such as claiming that Brexit is unpopular (as this article does) or that only stupid and evil people are in favour of it?This is how we got here: Ted Heath took us in without a referendum and, I believe, no mandate from the prior Conservative manifesto. The ""old Left"" of the Labour Party wanted to come out when Harold Wilson came to power so he seized on the idea of a Referendum in order to prevent a split in the Labour Party. During the 1975 Referendum campaign the (much wealthier) ""Yes"" (Remain) camp ridiculed ""No"" (Leave) claims that the EEC was the thin end of a wedge the thick end of which was a USE.In the intervening (till 2016) years British governments signed a sequence of treaties bringing Britain ever closer (!) to immersion within a USE. Sometimes this was explicit (Maastricht and Lisbon), sometimes implicit (the laughable ""four freedoms""), but whichever it was it was increasingly clear that they were disregarding British public opinion in doing so. What-on-earth the movers behind this thought would be the end-game is difficult to fathom. Did they think that people were as impressionable as geese and forget they had been manipulated into the EU? Probably. Well unfortunately for them it turned out that either people are not so dumb, or if they are stupid they nevertheless dislike being treated as stupid...I agree it's a terrible mess, but you have got to face up to the fact that there was never any mandate for the creation of the EU. Treaties popped up out of the Council and the Commission ""out of the blue"" and the public had no idea what was going on; for instance (and I take some risk in admitting this) I take some interest in politics, but I had no idea that the British government had renounced its right to control migration from the EU until about 2004.""You"" blew it, the ""Left"" or whatever you want to call yourselves; you know, the Left that likes labour-flows.

We had peace and prosperity in Europe; what did ""you"" need the Euro for? Or the ""four freedoms""? What have they, really, got to do with peace and security? Why did ""you"" destroy Europe?

The Tories are currently is a bad place, floundering around trying to make sense of something they don't deal very well with - something anathema to their very raison d'etre - it's called change! However we underestimate their tenacity to cling to the reins of power at our collective peril - and FPTP lies at the core of their obduracy, because it continues to provide them with mechanisms/avenues allowing them to wield virtually 100% of political power in the UK, on the basis of clear minority (and shrinking) support through the ballot box.
Labour (or at least a majority among the party, although their superior numbers are shrinking) are of course tarred with the same brush but it's not wholly unreasonable to imagine a scenario that might emerge capable of delivering radical (for the UK) constitutional change. 
If the Tories do actually implode, driven by a variety of factors such as a growing public realisation that Brexit is a ""pig in a poke"" economic disaster of ballooning proportions, compounded by the ""ferrets in a sack"" in-fighting currently being witnessed - end result, a fresh general election - but this time the fortunes of Labour and Conservatives are reversed, ie. a balanced (hung) Parliament with Labour as the single largest party - that means, constitutionally speaking, Corbyn has first dibs at forming a goverment but to do that he would need cooperation in some form or another from both LibDems and SNP (and the Greens would probably pitch in as well).
The price of such LibDem collaboration, even if it's only confidence and supply, is almost certain to include making good on a Labour Party manifesto pledge, which you can see here (something very similar is also in the LibDem counterpart) - namely the establishment of a, hopefully citizen focused and driven, UK Constitutional Convention - see here for a some outline ideas about how to set up and implement this body.
Such a body would take time but once in motion, I believe the public would begin to sit up and take notice of its public utterances and deliberations - for precisely the same reasons Labour's ideas, voiced through Corbyn, gained traction during the 2017 General Election campaign - and it's a racing certainty that profound voting reform would feature very higly on its agenda.

Not only was the election an unnecessary fight for Mrs May to have picked, she has emerged a diminished figure. Her cabinet is united – but mainly in their desire to succeed her. On the day of Mrs May’s big speech at the Conservative party conference this week, everything that could go wrong, did. Then Grant Shapps, a former party chairman who once led a double life as a “multimillionaire” web guru, was unmasked as a parliamentary general aiming to topple Mrs May for her shortcomings. Despite boasting the backing of 30 MPs, none of Mr Shapps’ troops were prepared to follow their commanding officer over the top. Mrs May is hurt and the consensus is that she will stagger on. But the crisis in the Conservative party is here to stay: a toxic brew of personal ambition, ideological visions and electoral panic.
This at a time when Britain’s productive forces are stagnating and the biggest foreign policy issue of our times – leaving the European Union – is met with the political posturing of a clown wearing the mask of a roaring lion. The Conservative party was once steeped in pragmatism, dominated by the wish to win elections and to be in power. There always were differences of opinion. These differences in dispositions have now curdled into doctrinal differences.
The Brexit vote has helped widen gulfs in the party, intensifying the cultural nationalism on the right of the party. This group, who since the days of John Major have put forward anti-EU arguments with a burning passion, repelled the electorate to such an extent that the Tories could not win a majority for more than two decades. The bad news for Mrs May is that they are back. The result is that the Tories lost their parliamentary advantage this year. Yet those who profess this anti-European nationalist creed are feted in the current Tory party. It was their speakers who drew the crowds and cheers at conference, not the cabinet’s. That Mrs May relies on the votes of the anti-gay, anti-abortion climate-change deniers of the evangelical Democratic Unionist party to carry her through will mean MPs on the cultural nationalist right will be emboldened.
It speaks volumes about the mess the party is in that Jacob Rees-Mogg, the MP for the last century, who is against gay marriage and anti-abortion on the grounds of his faith, is such a star. Young people, having grown up in a culturally permissive era, are not aroused by the holy anger of the right. They are moved by issues such as climate change and education, where an egalitarian view of humankind prevails. Conservatives have in the past been able to accept social change and adapt to it. They have anticipated society’s needs and changed their policies to meet them. Now the party’s anti-Europeanism means they risk losing a section of voters for ever.
The Conservatives have also long been deaf to issues affecting the under-40s. Not only are these voters seeing their wages squeezed, they are unable to save for homes and pensions while the prices race away. Mrs May will find it difficult to sell capitalism to those with no capital. The last election threw into sharp relief the cracks in the Tory party’s support. Its voters are dying off faster than it can win over new ones. That is why Mrs May has accepted that there is a cost-of-living crisis and lifted policies from Ed Miliband, a man once derided as Marxist. The Tory leadership seems to think it does not require new ideas. It is content to make do with old ones. Mrs May needed to bring her party’s thinking in line with an environment it does not like. Replacing the leader will only work if the party understands that it needs to change too.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/06/the-guardian-view-on-tory-splits-doctrinal-differences

Your theory suggests that over time, as overall ""wealth"" increases, so does happiness.
BQEND
No, that's not what I'm saying at all. I am saying that progress, not absolute wealth, contributes to happiness. That someone who sees their life improving over the years is far more likely to be happy than someone who sees no progress at all, or even a decline. 
Human history is one of improvement. People work to make their lives better. A neolithic farmer who chopped down trees to provide more land to farm could see progress. Building a better round hut to live in is progress. Growing more grain, building a bigger herd, a wooden bridge across a river to open up new farmland. He would still have been living in absolute poverty by modern standards, but to him life would be better than it ever had been before.

Without that, then your ideas are mere speculation. I would suggest that it is very unlikely that we are significantly happier than people in the past. Your theory suggests that over time, as overall ""wealth"" increases, so does happiness. But what is the relationship?

See how silly this gets when you try to quantify it? What you are talking about is people's perception of how their economic position compares to those around them. This has nothing to do with the overall wealth of a society and how it has changed. It is about how their position in society has changed.

As someone with a Harvard MBA, I think that capitalism can help with solving sustainability, as it allows the pricing of scarce resources most efficiently. The problem is that above capitalism (dealing in money), we are meant to have a political process (dealing in votes) that sets the rules for the society. What has happened, especially in the Anglosphere (US, UK, Australia & Canada) is that a lack of rules (or enforcement) on political donations meant we have allowed the corporations to 'capture' the regulators. It is always going to be 'cheaper' for dirty utilities and fossil fuel firms to 'bribe' politicians, than to comply with environmental rules.
If a revolution against poor government could elect only candidates sworn to outlaw ALL political donations, we could see the necessary change. We would get publicly-spirited people (instead of carpet-baggers) running for office. Then we can address the clear problems posed by global warming and do what is necessary to meet the Paris climate agreement. Americans may be the last to join the effort, due to corporate control over so much of their media, but if the rest of the world pushes forwards on solar, wind and electric cars, then we will so much further along the cost-curve that the USA will join.

Take lessons from Costa Rica,article,http://www.theguardian.com/working-in-development/2017/oct/07/how-to-avert-the-apocalypse-take-lessons-from-costa-rica,0,"Earlier this summer, a paper published in the journal Nature captured headlines with a rather bleak forecast. Our chances of keeping global warming below the 2C danger threshold are very, very small: only about 5%. The reason, according to the paper’s authors, is that the cuts we’re making to greenhouse gas emissions are being cancelled out by economic growth.
In the coming decades, we’ll be able to reduce the carbon intensity of the global economy by about 1.9% per year, if we make heavy investments in clean energy and efficient technology. That’s a lot. But as long as the economy keeps growing by more than that, total emissions are still going to rise. Right now we’re ratcheting up global GDP by 3% per year, which means we’re headed for trouble.
If we want to have any hope of averting catastrophe, we’re going to have to do something about our addiction to growth. This is tricky, because GDP growth is the main policy objective of virtually every government on the planet. It lies at the heart of everything we’ve been told to believe about how the economy should work: that GDP growth is good, that it’s essential to progress, and that if we want to improve human wellbeing and eradicate poverty around the world, we need more of it. It’s a powerful narrative. But is it true?
Maybe not. Take Costa Rica. A beautiful Central American country known for its lush rainforests and stunning beaches, Costa Rica proves that achieving high levels of human wellbeing has very little to do with GDP and almost everything to do with something very different.
Every few years the New Economics Foundation publishes the Happy Planet Index – a measure of progress that looks at life expectancy, wellbeing and equality rather than the narrow metric of GDP, and plots these measures against ecological impact. Costa Rica tops the list of countries every time. With a life expectancy of 79.1 years and levels of wellbeing in the top 7% of the world, Costa Rica matches many Scandinavian nations in these areas and neatly outperforms the United States. And it manages all of this with a GDP per capita of only $10,000 (£7,640), less than one fifth that of the US. 
In this sense, Costa Rica is the most efficient economy on earth: it produces high standards of living with low GDP and minimal pressure on the environment. 
How do they do it? Professors Martínez-Franzoni and Sánchez-Ancochea argue that it’s all down to Costa Rica’s commitment to universalism: the principle that everyone – regardless of income – should have equal access to generous, high-quality social services as a basic right. A series of progressive governments started rolling out healthcare, education and social security in the 1940s and expanded these to the whole population from the 50s onward, after abolishing the military and freeing up more resources for social spending. 
Costa Rica wasn’t alone in this effort, of course. Progressive governments elsewhere in Latin America made similar moves, but in nearly every case the US violently intervened to stop them for fear that “communist” ideas might scupper American interests in the region. Costa Rica escaped this fate by outwardly claiming to be anti-communist and – horribly – allowing US-backed forces to use the country as a base in the contra war against Nicaragua. 
The upshot is that Costa Rica is one of only a few countries in the global south that enjoys robust universalism. It’s not perfect, however. Relatively high levels of income inequality make the economy less efficient than it otherwise might be. But the country’s achievements are still impressive. On the back of universal social policy, Costa Rica surpassed the US in life expectancy in the late 80s, when its GDP per capita was a mere tenth of America’s.
Today, Costa Rica is a thorn in the side of orthodox economics. The conventional wisdom holds that high GDP is essential for longevity: “wealthier is healthier”, as former World Bank chief economist Larry Summers put it in a famous paper. But Costa Rica shows that we can achieve human progress without much GDP at all, and therefore without triggering ecological collapse. In fact, the part of Costa Rica where people live the longest, happiest lives – the Nicoya Peninsula – is also the poorest, in terms of GDP per capita. Researchers have concluded that Nicoyans do so well not in spite of their “poverty”, but because of it – because their communities, environment and relationships haven’t been ploughed over by industrial expansion. 
All of this turns the usual growth narrative on its head. Henry Wallich, a former member of the US Federal Reserve Board, once pointed out that “growth is a substitute for redistribution”. And it’s true: most politicians would rather try to rev up the GDP and hope it trickles down than raise taxes on the rich and redistribute income into social goods. But a new generation of thinkers is ready to flip Wallich’s quip around: if growth is a substitute for redistribution, then redistribution can be a substitute for growth. 
Costa Rica provides a hopeful model for any country that wants to chart its way out of poverty. But it also holds an important lesson for rich countries. Scientists tell us that if we want to avert dangerous climate change, high-consuming nations – like Britain and the US – are going to have to scale down their bloated economies to get back in sync with the planet’s ecology, and fast. A widely-cited paper by scientists at the University of Manchester estimates it’s going to require downscaling of 4-6% per year. 
This is what ecologists call “de-growth”. This calls for redistributing existing resources and investing in social goods in order to render growth unnecessary. Decommoditising and universalising healthcare, education and even housing would be a step in the right direction. Another would be a universal basic income – perhaps funded by taxes on carbon, land, resource extraction and financial transactions. 
The opposite of growth isn’t austerity, or depression, or voluntary poverty. It is sharing what we already have, so we won’t need to plunder the earth for more.
Costa Rica proves that rich countries could theoretically ease their consumption by half or more while maintaining or even increasing their human development indicators. Of course, getting there would require that we devise a new economic system that doesn’t require endless growth just to stay afloat. That’s a challenge, to be sure, but it’s possible.
After all, once we have excellent healthcare, education, and affordable housing, what will endlessly more income growth gain us? Maybe bigger TVs, flashier cars, and expensive holidays. But not more happiness, or stronger communities, or more time with our families and friends. Not more peace or more stability, fresher air or cleaner rivers.

You did – in some numbers. These generous contributions form the heart of the latest edition of We Need to Talk About …, our podcast featuring supporters’ voices, in which your concerns are addressed by a panel of Guardian journalists and experts.
As a starting point, we used a Guardian article with an arresting headline: Want to fight climate change? Have fewer children. In the podcast, we hear from one of the academics who produced the research which this article refers to, but equally interesting were your responses to this issue, and the discussions they prompted in our studio. 
That’s why we’ve decided to publish some of them here. While we aim to hear from lots of voices and include differing points of view on the podcast, a lack of time means we sometimes have to cut people short, or use one person to represent the views of several who have contacted us making similar points. Here, we can give members a bit more space to air their views.
You can listen to the panel respond to them – our line-up is Damian Carrington, the Guardian’s environment editor; Lucy Lamble, the Guardian’s executive editor for global development, who often writes on and takes part in debates on global inequality; John Vidal, the multi-award winning former Guardian environment editor and Afua Hirsch, a writer and broadcaster for the Guardian and SkyNews among others, who has also worked in international development and the law. 
But first gain a flavour of the concerns of your fellow readers below. Many of these questions appear in the podcast, while others influenced the direction in which we headed.
The issue isn’t overpopulation – it’s poor resource allocation. We do not live in a world of lack, but of extreme waste and inefficiency. This is true of food, energy, land use and the financial system. The overpopulation argument is a way to once again deflect from real societal change that is needed, and instead focuses the discussion on families, usually poor families, having too many children.
While it is likely that the Earth does have some sort of maximum carrying capacity, even that is not guaranteed with recent technological advancements such as vertical farming. The question is whether those technological advancements will be put to use to raise the standard of living for every human being on the planet, or are put towards continuing to line the pockets of the wealthiest individuals and their investors.
To my mind, it is not the countries in Africa, or groups with a more traditional and much simpler way of life – such as Native people in North and South America, for instance – that have caused so many environmental problems, but the irrationality and consumerism of our western society. It is the fact that we consume without truly asking ourselves where all these goods come from, how they were produced, what the environmental impact is of producting all these mostly useless things. Unless we seriously address these questions, I cannot see any significant change or serious solution to climate change.
I‘ve often noticed that some westerners, who have no agenda at all on any environmental question, are keen to invoke “overpopulation” as the main and only threat to survival on Earth. Is overpopulation just a convenient way for westerners to put the blame on Africans for the environmental threats we face?
How can those with the largest carbon footprint be encouraged not to reproduce, when they are ones who make the greatest impact and have the greatest sense of entitlement?
Pope Francis recently condemned climate change sceptics. He is passionate about protecting the planet and has called on everyone to care for creation, particularly as climate change disproportionately impacts the poor. 
The Catholic church runs 25% of health and education systems worldwide and therefore, through its direct teaching and management, significantly reduces safe access to contraception for millions of women. No debate on controlling population growth and subsequent pollution can therefore exist without tackling this institutional barrier to action. Last year over 170 theologians issued a statement saying there was no reason for the Catholic church’s position against “artificial” contraception. 
How does the panel feel the church can continue to do great work on this issue, yet continue to block safe access to contraception for some of the world’s poorest women?
I am a gynaecologist working in Hong Kong, occasionally counselling women considering having another child. If someone is ambivalent about doing so, I add into the decision-making the idea that having more children impacts climate change.
Since I was a teenager in the 1970s, I have believed it is a woman’s right to choose whether to continue a pregnancy. Working as a volunteer in an African country where abortion is illegal, I have seen women saved from death after trying to procure an abortion themselves. They were lucky – the hospital was nearby, there were good doctors, antibiotics, surgery, and blood transfusion.
In African countries where abortion is often illegal, an unmet need for contraception is also common. I applied for a volunteer job in northern Uganda where women having five to six children is the norm; when asked, they say they would have preferred three or four . 
Donald Trump’s global gag rule which removes US aid from any NGO providing contraceptive advice, is a huge problem. Not only because maternal mortality due to abortion deaths will rise in Africa, but also because the UNFPA [UN population fund] will stop training midwives, and the resulting reduction in maternal mortality will diminish. In addition, there will be greater unmet need for contraception. 
Do you think our society can reach the point where choosing to have fewer children as an essential carbon-cutting strategy is as widely understood as conserving energy?
As a parent I would take a bullet for either of my two children. I’m certain almost all parents would do just about anything to ensure their kids have a decent life. Knowing this, I cannot help but feel that if young couples around the world have good information they will do the right thing. If they understand the ramifications of their family-size decisions on the quality of life – chance of survival even – of their children, then they will make the most loving, compassionate decision possible: to conceive no more than one child.
I joined Population Matters, an organisation that promotes smaller family size and reduced consumption, to find like-minded people and put my energies into a worthwhile organisation. I appreciate the impact we are having on the environment, and am mindful of that. However, I have found people around me such as family, friends and colleagues are largely not interested, or suggest they should have the freedom to do as they please.
How do we start making a difference? Also we seem to have failed with high-profile individuals, royals and celebrities in particular. So what happens now?
We have to reduce the population, hopefully not by severe climate change, war or disease. China’s one-child solution would not be accepted by most people. What do experts suggest? It seems money has the only power over most people. Should we pay people not to have children?
How do we get politicians to talk seriously about the links between population and climate change? The last three elections in the UK have barely mentioned the environment. Is there an agreement between the political parties to avoid this discussion?

I like children, but have never felt that I would like to have my own. 
I am very regularly treated as odd for this decision, and feel that if we don’t open up the discussion about not having children, people will never consider this decision thoroughly, whether for the environment or other reasons.
In the past three years, I have made a number of lifestyle changes in order to reduce my carbon footprint – which has only further cemented my feeling that I don’t want children. I often feel like I need to keep having what can be sometimes difficult conversations with people about this choice, so as to build conversation momentum around the subject. Alternative lifestyles need to be promoted. I would like to focus on supporting and improving the lives of people already on the planet. 
I have made the decision to be childfree, largely due to environmental reasons. As a childfree person, I am constantly surprised how this decision is commonly questioned by others as being a poor or “selfish” choice when the evidence suggests that it is anything but. 
Given the evidence that having fewer children isthe greatest decision one can make to combat climate change, do the panel think that society can switch from having a pro-reproduction stance, where policies promote reproduction and society views having children as the “correct” choice, to a neutral stance, where having children is considered optional and policies are made to promote other means of having a fulfilled life?

If people haven't been harmed by nuclear waste it's not because it is safe.
BQEND
How true. And in theory it's quite dangerous. But it's interesting to review some of the basics of that theory. Humanity's nuclear power plants contain around 50,000 tonnes of uranium oxide. The continents contain 35,000,000,000,000 tonnes of it, and so, even though the stuff in the reactors has a lot of man-made radioactivity, it is minor compared to the natural radioactivity underfoot.
Although the ocean, too, famously contains much more uranium than we have ever handled, it contains only thousands of times more, not tens of millions. So if, without extinguishing them, we could somehow disperse all our reactors through the ocean, its radioactivity would be increased about 500-fold. Still weak compared to natural land radioactivity.
If the Fukushima meltdowns had been deliberate — and the intervention of the Japanese prime minister's office did make them a great deal worse than they would have been, to the great financial benefit, in later years, of the Japanese government — they would have been an attempt to ocean-disperse a small fraction of the world's reactors.
Had complete dispersion been achieved, with fission continuing unabated, ocean radioactivity would have been increased about fourfold. The health of us land creatures, immersed in natural radioactivity at thousands of times marine levels, suggests no sea life would have been harmed by a mere fourfold increase.
However, two more small fractions came into play: the radioactivity of a demolished reactor, a few years after demolition, is reduced ten thousand-fold, and when seawater percolates ruined nuclear fuel, very little of it dissolves. (It's rock.)

Germany set to widely miss climate targets, env ministry warns Clean Energy Wire, 11 Oct 2017 
Germany’s environment ministry fears high emissions from coal-fired power plants and transport will make the country miss its 2020 climate targets by a wider margin than previously anticipated.
Without further action, Germany's CO₂ emissions will only be 31.7 to 32.5 percent below 1990 levels, an internal environment ministry paper seen by the Clean Energy Wire shows. Given the official target of cutting emissions by 40 percent, the ministry warns that a failure of this magnitude would constitute a “significant blow to Germany’s climate policy”, and would amount to “a disaster for Germany’s international reputation as a climate leader.”

One particularly relevant quote:
BQSTART
Thanks, Germany When the definitive history of the energy transition is written, the taxpayers of Germany will deserve their own chapter. They bankrolled the green energy revolution known as the Energiewende, pioneering generous subsidies nearly 20 years ago that helped drive renewables up from 9 per cent of Germany’s electricity mix in 2004 to 32 per cent last year. 
As other European nations — and some US states — boarded the green power wagon, it kindled a wave of demand for wind turbines and solar panels that helped drive costs down worldwide. Solar’s price fall was especially steep after a Chinese manufacturing boom spurred global over-supply.

No, one problem with Germany's 2050 goal is that it is far too late - a policy to remove all coal by 2030 is required. I've pointed this out to you before. It seems irrelevant to you.
BQENDNo, I agree that it's far too late. My main point is simply that dismissing a policy as an unmitigated failure because it hasn't met intermediate targets is not a reasonable thing to do.

A second problem is that 2050 is so far into the future that it has no significant impact on current policy.
BQENDI disagree with that, however. Indeed I would argue the opposite. Focusing only on short term targets is the bigger problem.

I don't necessarily agree with this. Having a coherent strategy for the long term (and I don't claim that the Energiewende is particularly coherent, just marginally more coherent than most other strategies, or lack of them, are) seems more important than pursuing short term goals. A combination of both is obviously best, but I believe the long term strategy should be the overriding policy goal.

BQENDIt isn't. But there are some positive signs, with the more rapid development and deployment of renewable energy technologies than most expected, and it's not unreasonable to suggest this is at least in part driven by Germany's policy.

It's a much safer strategy to take the easy wins first and reduce overall emissions
BQENDI don't necessarily agree with this. Having a coherent strategy for the long term (and I don't claim that the Energiewende is particularly coherent, just marginally more coherent than most other strategies, or lack of them, are) seems more important than pursuing short term goals.

It's a much safer strategy to take the easy wins first and reduce overall emissions, because that gives you significantly more time if there are problem later because now you are running your carbon budget down at half the speed (say). Shooting for late-success is a great way of using the budget up fast and ultimately failing.
The UK has done a _much_ better job of decarbonising the grid, from a similar starting point.
The energiewende _has_ helped show other countries that wind and solar really do work, I agree with you there. But the nuclear shutdown is unarguably completely stupid and a massive setback to actual decarbonisation. You can make a case for not building any more (although even that remains tricky for high-latitude countries) but shutting down working ones is completely counter to actually solving the problem, and Germany's behavour here is unforgivable. The US is doing a better job than Germany despite its obvious political problems, and at the same time Germany makes a fuss over how forward-thinking it is.
I am not at all impressed. You are right that it's not impossible for this all to come out OK in the end, but given the urgency, I am very worried that Germany is indeed going to fail.

We are going towards 2xC02, 3xCO2 and 4XCO2 forcing from now until 2100 - give or take a decade of two. And since fast equilibrium response and feedbacks takes a few decades - and slow equilibrium responses and feedbacks can take a few thousand years - let us just forget about the 3 degree target. We will have committed that as we go through 2040 - similar to how we lost the 1.5 degree target around 1990. 
We can discuss exactly what decade and the exact decimal of response (more when we talk about access to predictable rain or lack thereof). But remember - science has advanced rapidly since the first coupled model-results became available in the 1980's. Including that the hind-casting is becoming better. And in this case - blogs, newspapers, political documents become historical evidence - and climate science becomes as important as DNA became important for cold-case forensic science back in the days. 
Why? Well - somebody will be paying for what caused to 1.5 degree target that one could hope for as the cold war ended - and someone is going to pay for why we are now loosing the 3-degree target. 
We are also aware of bankrupt companies changing names when faced with lawsuits. AMOCO is of course not named any longer. Now they are BP. People by know understand how deniability works - and how the ""mother-ships"" work. And while the lobbying money are exempt from public knowledge - in a smaller time-frame than the cost of building a coal-plant takes to make numbers go from red to black - those papers will be public and traced home. 
Just look at how these companies change logo and have ""environmental statements"" on their web-pages - in hope to escape liability in a few decades. Look at the big investment-funds on this planet being busy going all ratty and swimming to better and more sustainable islands. They know better. Just look at how one attacked the mob a few decades ago. Separation of accounts as deniability by spreading the impact stopped working so well. These days even Swiss banks must be a bit more transparent - even on the past. 
Sure - invest your cash in this planet destroying business to make sure your kids and grandkids will have no problems paying for tuition. It will not help - because there is no cash in the world that will make that cheap for them - as you give them 1000 ppm. And your savings are sued into oblivion. 
Since all denialists now use arguments that are so stupid that they can claim ""lack of understanding"" as their go-to proof of stupidity - I would not be so sure that it actually will float in 20 years. As the favourite argument is that ""the chinese are so many"". 
This will be excellent for kids who can obviously claim parents house and money by placing so amazingly stupid people under care. People who did not understand basic science in 2015 should clearly not be in charge of own economy in 2050. 
Stupidity will be a problem - not a source of deniability.

Because the final target is predicated upon the current policy which states that the intermediate policies will be met. A failure to meet your gatekeepers at 2020, 2030, 2040 will mean that 2050 will not be met.

In April, Secretary of Energy Rick Perry announced that he was requesting a study about whether today's electricity markets are doing an adequate job in terms of providing grid reliability, reliance and stability. Under most circumstances, an announcement of such a proposed study would cause everyone to fall asleep. Nowadays, though, this proposed study was considered revolutionary and perhaps obscene. 
The general weltanschauung (German used quite deliberately) of studies under the last administration did not encourage looking at questions of mere grid reliability. The only allowable questions seemed to be: ""How can we get more renewables (and gas backup) on the grid?"" When Secretary Perry asked for a reliability study, he set the natural gas industry into a state of shock. They had a pretty good idea of what such a study would show. They didn't like it one bit.

Germany and China have been the poster children for a movement that insists that “renewables” (as in wind, and possibly some solar, but mostly wind - please don’t confuse us by talking about hydro that most of them don’t like (drowned valleys)) are the answer. Who generally hate nuclear with a passion. But the reality is that Germany is not reducing CO2 emissions - it is pacifying the Green vote. China is actually building new coal power stations, burns more coal than the rest of the world put together, and has a vanishingly small proportion of its energy coming from wind and solar. It has more coming from hydro, but comments about that are notably always missing from the Green eulogies.

In systems blessed with significant hydro, for example the developing system in China, certain parts of the USA, perhaps France and potentially Switzerland, greater amounts of a feed as variable as wind can potentially be useful. Of course if there is an excess of water, additional wind capacity will simply see a diminishing return on either the hydro or wind installation.
Of course, this situation may change in the future, if battery-powered (or other form of energy-storage-reliant) transport actually takes off, but this is off the current horizon.
David MacKay’s 2009 paper on energy alternatives for the UK “Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air” provides a nice summary of a range of alternative solutions for a country with limited hydro capacity. Only one of the options he proposes has any significant amount of wind power, and he notes on the one that does that 100 major lakes will required to be converted to pumped storage in order to make it work. Australia - particularly South Australia - is a worse case
In my view, what we are observing during this phase of the energy transition is far too much faith and far too little genuine analysis. Otherwise the South Australia situation (massive over expenditure on wind capacity, given the current and foreseeable complementary generation & storage capacity available to them) should never have arisen. And perhaps Germany could be further along the track to decarbonisation if that were their genuine priority. Realpolitik dictated that Germany appease their Greens, and so some of the decisions and the resultant mis-spending is no doubt the cost of Merkel remaining in power. Given her contribution to creating conditions that encouraged Brexit, I wonder if this is a cost that anyone could consider reasonable under the circumstances.

Trump’s Energy Secretary Rick Perry recently provided a stark example of this philosophical flexibility when he proposed to effectively pull the failing coal industry out of the marketplace and instead prop it up with taxpayer-funded subsidies.
The Trump administration has made no secret of its love for the coal industry. However, that industry has been losing badly in the free market, due largely to its inability to compete with cheaper natural gas and renewables. That was in fact the finding of Perry’s own Energy Department’s report, published just 3 months ago. The report also concluded:
Most of the common metrics for grid reliability suggest that the grid is in good shape despite the retirement of many baseload power plants … The power system is more reliable today due to better planning, market discipline, and better operating rules and standards
Perry’s new proposed rules directly contradict his department’s report, claiming “the resiliency of the electric grid is threatened by the premature retirements of these fuel-secure traditional baseload resources.” Perry tried to shift the goalposts from reliability to “resiliency” of the electric grid, essentially arguing that we need power plants that can store 90 days’ worth of fuel (i.e. huge piles of coal) to ensure that the grid remains “resilient.”
However, Perry also made the mistake of referencing the 2014 Polar Vortex to try and support this argument. The cold temperatures associated with that weather pattern caused electricity demand to spike, but as experts have noted, while wind energy produced above expectations during the Polar Vortex, coal power failed (emphasis added):
However, [Perry’s proposal] conveniently fails to mention that nearly 14 gigawatts (GW) of coal capacity was forced offline during the Polar Vortex, roughly 25 percent of all coal capacity in [the region]. 1.4 GW of nuclear was forced offline as well. Most of these generator outages were due to temperatures below the operating limit of power plant equipment ... Additional coal capacity was unavailable due to frozen coal piles.
Perry’s argument is so ludicrous that it bears repeating. He claims that we need to subsidize huge coal piles to ensure grid resiliency to extreme events like the Polar Vortex. But during the Polar Vortex, coal plants were shut down because they couldn’t operate at such low temperatures, and because their big coal piles were frozen. And this isn’t the only example of grid resiliency without coal – during Hurricane Harvey, coal piles were too wet to be transported to power plant boilers. During record heat waves this summer, California’s grid proved reliable as a result of factors like renewables and energy storage, not coal.
It’s abundantly clear that the Trump administration is looking for an excuse to prop up the failing coal industry, because they’ve made it a cog in their culture wars. And so Rick Perry ignored the findings of his own department’s grid reliability report and made up some nonsense about how we need huge piles of coal to justify giving the industry a bailout in the form of taxpayer-funded subsidies.
Along similar lines, a new study published in Nature Energy found that at current oil prices of $50 per barrel, about half of not-yet-developed oil fields are only profitable if the industry receives subsidies to pay for them. Worse yet, the oil industry pockets most taxpayer subsidy dollars in the form of profits:
At the price of US$50 per barrel, we find that a bit more than half (53%) of subsidy value (in net present value terms) goes to projects that would have proceeded anyway. That fraction rises to nearly all (98%) of subsidy value at US$100 per barrel. As others have found, regardless of the oil price, the majority of taxpayer resources provided to the industry end up as company profits.
Oil would obviously only be extracted from a given field if doing so would yield a profit; otherwise it would stay in the ground until something changed to make its extraction profitable (like taxpayer subsidies or higher oil market prices). 
To meet the Paris climate target in a cost-effective way, the U.S. would produce oil equivalent to 30 to 45 billion tons of carbon dioxide pollution allowed by 2050. At the current price of $50 per barrel, the oil industry subsidies would make an additional 17 billion barrels’ worth of oil reserves profitable, resulting in another 6 billion tons of carbon dioxide pollution. That would eat up 13 to 20% of America’s carbon budget for oil.
Another report by Oil Change International found that American taxpayers are footing the bill for $20 billion in direct fossil fuel industry subsidies every year. That’s about $80 per year per American taxpayer.
The purpose of subsidies is to keep a product’s prices low and competitive, usually because it somehow benefits society. Some people object that renewables are subsidized, but at least they produce low-carbon energy that also result in cleaner air and water and improved public health. Those are clear societal benefits.
So what is the benefit of subsidizing coal and oil? They have been the dominant fuels for over a century; do they really still need taxpayer money to keep them competitive with newer, cleaner fuel sources and energy technologies? If they do (as the Trump administration admits is the case for coal), why should taxpayers continue to prop them up? The subsidies will help keep gasoline prices low, but only because Americans are paying for it up-front in the form of taxes.
They result in dirtier air and water, worse public health, increased mortality, and accelerated climate change, the latter of which results in additional taxpayer costs. America has been battered by those expensive climate costs over the past few months with numerous intensified hurricanes, floods, heatwaves, wildfires, and droughts. Those climate costs likely amount to several hundred dollars per American taxpayer per year. And as the Nature Energy study lead author Peter Erickson pointed out to me,
by Congress’ own Joint Committee on Taxation analysis (post-Trump), the tax subsidies to oil and gas outweigh the tax subsidies for all charitable giving to health and education.
Each American taxpayer is giving the fossil fuel industry $80 per year, most of which is pocketed as profit. The rest goes to digging more coal and oil out of the ground, which increases air and water pollution, degrades public health, and accelerates climate change and the damages it causes. Failing to make polluters pay for that fossil fuel carbon pollution is effectively another $5 tn annual subsidy, globally.
But rather than working to eliminate this wasteful spending, the Trump administration is coming up with bogus excuses to dramatically increase fossil fuel subsidies to keep the failing coal industry afloat, proposing increased government regulations and spending taxpayer dollars to undermine the free market. It could not be a more perverse and counter-productive proposal that would use American taxpayer money to hurt us, to the exclusive benefit of the fossil fuel industry and the politicians in their pockets.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/oct/09/trumps-plan-to-bail-out-failing-fossil-fuels-with-taxpayer-subsidies-is-perverse

Ships now can sail straight through in the summer, even if they choose to ignore any satellite information of any kind. 
And plankton species are also now drifting through for the first time in 800,000 years. They freely moved from the North Pacific to the North Atlantic for about two million years, then stopped about 800,000 years ago when the Arctic Ocean froze over, and then resumed in 2005. 
Whales are also now migrating through the Arctic Ocean for the first time in at least 400 years. Again, because the passages are wide open and they don't need to work their way under ice from polynya to polynya.
The volume of Arctic sea ice in September has now dropped to about 1/5 to 1/4 of what it was just 30 years ago.

Why do you feel compelled to disparage a 0.85C rise as something we can ignore? 
Do you have some special expertise that trumps the combined wisdom of the world's scientific community? Because they say that a rise of 0.85C (heading towards 1.5C and probably beyond) presents an existential threat to human civilization. 
Also note that the rise is accelerating. It might have been 0.85C / century for the past century, but it's currently rising at 2C / century.
Think of it this way. If that rate of temperature rise had started when Oxford University was founded, current temperatures would reach lethal levels for humans several days a year on most of the globe. Summer temperatures would be maxing out around 140F, not 105F. If it had started during the Roman Empire (not really that long ago) summer temperatures would be reaching 170F now, hot enough to literally cook you.
Also note that CO2 we emit now commits us to temperature rises that will continue for centuries. And LONG before we reach the doomsday scenarios above, mass migrations, wars over water supplies, exotic diseases, etc. could well decimate us.

“The war on coal is over,” EPA administrator Scott Pruitt declared in the coal mining state of Kentucky, at an event with one of the state’s US senators, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell. 
For Pruitt, getting rid of the Clean Power Plan will mark the culmination of a long fight he began as the elected attorney general of Oklahoma. Pruitt was among about two dozen attorney generals who sued to stop Barack Obama’s push to limit carbon emissions.
Closely tied to the oil and gas industry in his home state, Pruitt rejects the consensus of scientists that emissions from burning fossil fuels are the primary driver of global climate change.
Donald Trump, who appointed Pruitt and shares his skepticism of established climate science, promised to kill the clean power plan during the 2016 campaign as part of his broader pledge to revive the nation’s struggling coal mines.
In his order on Tuesday, Pruitt is expected to declare that the Obama-era rule exceeded federal law by setting emissions standards that power plants could not reasonably meet. 
Appearing at Whayne Supply, a Hazard, Kentucky, company that sells coal mining supplies, Pruitt said: “The EPA and no federal agency should ever use its authority to say to you: we are going to declare war on any sector of our economy.”
Whayne Supply has laid off about 60% of its workers in recent years. While cheering the demise of the clean power plan as a way to stop the bleeding, McConnell conceded most of those lost jobs are never coming back. 
“A lot of damage has been done,” said McConnell. “This doesn’t immediately bring everything back, but we think it stops further decline of coal-fired plants in the United States and that means there will still be some market here.” 
Obama’s plan was designed to cut US carbon dioxide emissions to 32% below 2005 levels by 2030. The rule dictated specific emission targets for states based on power-plant emissions and gave officials broad latitude to decide how to achieve reductions.
The supreme court put the plan on hold last year following legal challenges by industry and coal-friendly states.
Even so, the plan helped drive a recent wave of retirements of coal-fired plants, which also are being squeezed by lower costs for natural gas and renewable power, as well as state mandates promoting energy conservation.
The withdrawal of the clean power plan is the latest in a series of moves by Trump and Pruitt to dismantle Obama’s legacy on fighting climate change, including the delay or roll back of rules limiting levels of toxic pollution in smokestack emissions and wastewater discharges from coal-burning power plants.
The president announced earlier this year that he would pull the US out of the landmark Paris climate agreement. Nearly 200 countries have committed to combat global warming by reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming.
“This president has tremendous courage,” Pruitt said. “He put America first and said to the rest of the world: we are going to say no and exit the Paris accord. That was the right thing to do.”
Environmental groups and public health advocates quickly derided the decision as shortsighted. 
“Trump is not just ignoring the deadly cost of pollution, he’s ignoring the clean energy deployment that is rapidly creating jobs across the country,” said Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club.

Remember - 90% of all scientists who ever worked are alive now. None can claim to be Einstein or Fourier or the few who really made some theoretical findings more than a century ago. But a lot of attention is payed to that math. 
What science has now is however a unique viewpoint of watching a planet that change temperature on a rate that as of now change by almost 3 degrees per decade. 
So AGW is a really cool experiment. Here we are on a planet that is more than 4 billion years old - and we can study how it behaves while changing energy balance above equal to 0.03 degrees in temperature per year. 
In light of that 4.5 billion year old age - or even 1000 years - or even 100 years - that is rather spectacular, especially when studying life itself. As the physics is same all over the universe - but life being cause and effect - as far as we know - we choose to do that experiment on the only planet we know life exist on. 
The physics is the same everywhere, of course. But what it does with life - now that is something that can only be observed on this planet. So deniers are the gift that keeps giving for science - in checking out where life starts to hurt. Really interesting, since past hyper-thermals has over the last 3 decades provided science a lot of information of consequences - but not really the details to know exactly why 70% of life can die out. 
It is really interesting to be allowed to live in such interesting times. And Science Denial is the gift that keeps giving. 
And still all scientists beg for the experiment to stop.

Ice shelves are the floating terminations of glaciers at the ocean and they act as buttresses for the glaciers behind which drain the ice sheets by adding friction to glacial flow rates.
When the Rhode Island-sized Larsen B ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula collapsed over five weeks the glaciers behind sped up by a factor of 3-8--luckily the Peninsula isn’t big--and are still flowing at that accelerated rate today because the cork was removed.
Increased glacial flow rates have been observed hundreds of kilometers inland, so what happens at the coast doesn’t stay at the coast, but impacts the whole ice sheet.
So when we destroy ice shelves, the whole ice sheet responds, quickly. (1)
If we sped up all of Antarctica’s glaciers by a factor of 6.5, the rate of sea level rise would be 4m per century, the same rate which occurred for 4 centuries around 15,000 years ago.
There were larger ice sheets then, but that rate indicates that the ice sheets can do dramatic things when they retreat.
1 When the tide rises it slows glacial flow rates. When the tide goes out glacial flow rates increase, as measured by high time-resolution GPS devices placed on glaciers. It only takes a few hours to observe the effects of rising and falling tides on glacial flow rates 80 km inland so the ice responds quickly over long distances.', u'recommendation_count': u'14', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1507589997000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'the cork was removed', u'effect': u'are still flowing at that accelerated rate today'}], u'author_id': u'15131989', u'id': u'106533195', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'ethelfrida', u'text': u'Posting this in reply to every other comment rather dilutes your message.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1507624353000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'13620487', u'in_reply_to': u'106544705', u'id': u'106545333', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Silgen', u'text': u'Yeah, just like it's pure luck that Houston has had three ""1 in 500 years"" events in the last 18 months.

In July, the iceberg known as A68 broke off the shelf, leaving the area at its lowest recorded extent. Researchers are now hoping the event may lead to novel revelations from their investigations of the area opened up, which had been hidden under ice for up to 120,000 years. 
Scientists from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) will embark on the research ship RRS James Clark Ross in February 2018 to take the first look at the newly exposed ecosystems under the ice – if the conditions work in their favour.
“You can never predict the ice,” said mission leader Dr Katrin Linse. “There are still several hundred kilometres covered in sea ice which has to move and melt. Fortunately this often happens now during the Antarctic summer, so that is why we are hopeful for February.” 
If everything works out, the scientists will have the chance to look at 5,800 sq km of sea floor that had been shielded for tens of thousands of years. Planning for such expeditions normally takes several years, but urgent funding schemes are available during such unpredictable natural events, like the volcanic activity over Iceland in 2010.
It is not the first time that scientists have been given the chance to take a look at these hidden marine worlds. After a similar iceberg broke off from the Larsen B shelf in 2002, a team of scientists set out to Antarctica, although it took much longer to get there. 
Prof Dr Julian Gutt, a marine ecologist at the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven, Germany, was the first to lead a vessel to the area. He said: “We went to the area five years after it broke off. We had to try and learn what lived under the ice shelf when it still existed, so were never absolutely sure if our interpretation was correct.”
This presents a unique opportunity for the BAS team: “The Larsen C break-off is recent, so if the British scientists are successful – under the difficult conditions they are facing – they could really encounter a pristine situation,” says Gutt.
The BAS team expect to find organisms resembling those in deep-sea environments because of the areas’ similar conditions: a lack of nutrients, sunlight and wind. 
A short timespan between the breakoff and research is crucial, says Linse. 
“What Julian Gutt’s team found there five years after were already pioneer species, which slowly colonise the area. When we go this February, organisms will not have had enough time to settle down and adapt to their new environment,” she said. 
The final decision on whether the project goes ahead will be made at the end of the year.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/09/scientists-hope-damage-to-larsen-c-ice-shelf-will-reveal-ecosystems

Abbott cannot credibly claim to be ill-informed: a powerful information network has been set up for him. He has an office, staff, privileged access to departmental resources, a directory for technical advice. The LNP use their information privileges to play dumb.

SO the theory is that Abbott has spent his entire career gradually worming his way into the LNP leadership with the sole intention of destroying them with their own weapons - hypocrisy, political rat-cunning, extreme conservatism, drawing in a critical mass of dupes who believe that rubbish and pushing them so far beyond the pale that the electorate will have no choice but to destroy them completely.

The actions of Tony Abbott, Cory Bernardi clearly define them as fundamentalists, as knowledgeable and dangerous as any ISIS recruit. When Tony Abbott states that changes to the Marriage Act will threaten religious freedom, he means the freedom of religion to impose its cultural standards and values on all members of society. These Christian political elites whose role is to advance Australian society in every aspect want to impose old testament laws and this fixation and their reasoning identifies them as fundamentalists. Theologically and scripturally the basis for their arguments are not biblical within the context of the New Testament position, nor from the old Testament societal roles and responsibilities.
The bible has long been misrepresented and misunderstood by literalists and detractors to its core fundamental truths. The overarching message of the bible is a relationship with God. The New Testament, through the teachings of Jesus, is about the individual creating and building a personal relationship with God. No longer are the Priests required to intercede. The Old Testament is the story of a society’s relationship with their God and there are two main protagonists, the Priests who hold and wield the political power, concerned with the implementation of the law to the smallest detail of a person’s life. The prophets are a wide-ranging list of individuals, from manifesting the power of God to the less likely candidates who were somewhat begrudging and aware of the potential consequences of upsetting management. Their prophesies are about identifying the roadblocks necessary to improve the society’s relationship with God and challenging the status quo. The prophets looked to improving outcomes and the priests were about implementing processes and aligning the populace to the law.  In organisational culture terms the Priests, the political elites are a calculative culture, primary concern being processes and procedures and demonstrating that the letter of the law is being met as opposed to a generative culture where people genuinely care for one another. As Christian fundamentalists, these political elites want to impose an old testament based rules culture and standards whereas a New Testament Christian society the concern and focus is with the individual’s relationship with their God. So as members of the fundamentalist Christian political class how does Cory Bernardi and Tony Abbott measure against the Old Testament standards they quote as being the social construct of our Christian society.As God said to Ezekiel in a time of turmoil and upheaval.“The word of the Lord came to me: “Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel( that is the political elites); ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Woe to you shepherds of Israel who only take care of yourselves! Should not shepherds take care of the flock? You eat the curds, clothe yourselves with the wool and slaughter the choice animals, but you do not take care of the flock. You have not strengthened the weak or healed the sick or bound up the injured. You have not brought back the strays or searched for the lost. You have ruled them harshly and brutally. So they were scattered because there was no shepherd, and when they were scattered they became food for all the wild animals.  My sheep wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill. They were scattered over the whole earth, and no one searched or looked for them. Encapsulating the lack of true Christianity of those fundamentalists who are influencing the future direction of our nation. God is very clear the political rulers have abrogated their responsibility to the people in their role as leaders. The question that needs to be answered is what does God require of Bernardi and Abbott and their self righteousness? And in Christian and Jewish tradition to call out the failings of the Church and those with a leadership function I must therefore be a prophet of the Christian God. One step ahead of a discourse and you’re a teacher, two steps, a prophet and three one ends up a martyr. Our Christian political leaders must be therefore challenged on the primacy of scripture and scrutinised on that basis, and from an Old Testament perspective are found wanting.As the prophet, Jeremiah  said “Thus says the LORD, ""Do justice and righteousness, and deliver the one who has been robbed from the power of his oppressor.

and of course being 100% renewable power would not do a thing for the planet, great logic.

Other than massively decreasing the greenhouse-causing CO2 emissions, reducing illness-causing particulate matter in the atmosphere, and avoiding the inevitable pollution caused by mine runoff. Other than that, you might have a point but I cannot see what it is.

We could go down the SA model and have a battery plant that will only work if there is enough wind for the wind farm to supply it
BQEND
You seem to not understand what a battery is. 
BQSTART
not too much wind as it won't work, too much wind they shut down
BQEND
Please name a real incident where this ever happened, that battery storage couldn't overcome. How long, for example, do you imagine high wind conditions last? Weeks? Months? Years?
BQSTART
not enough they rely on the national grid.
BQEND
Again, you seem to not understand the function of batteries. And if you have a national grid supplied by diverse forms of renewables in different locations, it's highly unlikely that any specific local incident would cause grid-level problems.
Besides, a large part of the solution is extremely granular, domestic level generation & storage, further mitigating the risks you are so afraid of.
BQSTART
The battery plant will only give back up in peak times for 1 hour. 
BQEND
If you say so. I get better performance from AA & AAA rechargeables and from the modern tiny batteries they use inside phones but you know better. Only one hour.
BQSTART
We could stop supplying China, Japan and India however they will just buy from another supplier.
BQEND
The good old drug dealer argument. We might as well use child labour in our manufacturing also, by your logic.
BQSTART
The facts are China, Japan, Germany, and India are building new coal fired power plants, why because they need power for their people.
BQEND
They are also building far more renewables, for the same reason.

The London outing is more strange and sad, and the strangeness and the sadness manifests itself on multiple fronts.
Let’s start with strange.
The bloke who hobnobbed with the climate sceptics at Global Warming Policy Foundation is the same bloke who took a decision as prime minister to sign Australia up to the Paris international climate agreement.
He’s also the same bloke who produced a set of initiatives in government which was badged as a policy to incentivise emissions reductions.
That policy still exists and it’s called Direct Action.
He’s also the same bloke who kept Australia’s renewable energy target, while abolishing the mechanism designed to give the market certainty to make future investments in baseload power generation.
Abbott has a whole lot of feelings, and some loyal media megaphones to help him spread his singular insights, but these are basic facts he can’t escape.
Abbott’s record in government points to him being a “warmist” (as Andrew Bolt is fond of characterising the modest band of weirdos who don’t think they know better than the world’s most eminent climate scientists).
London’s hardcore climate sceptics, frankly, should have laughed him out of the room.
Now let’s get to sad. Abbott’s climate frolic isn’t about a substantive issue. It’s about politics, because Australians haven’t had quite enough of politics, right?
Abbott wants to cause a ruckus. He wants to make enough ruckus to constrain Malcolm Turnbull from producing a sensible energy policy.
The lightbulb moment he’s trying to manufacture for colleagues is simple: the Abbott rationale is we can win the next election like I won the election in 2013 – by belting Labor on climate and energy policy.
The country, the national interest, actually needs the major parties to come to terms and settle the climate wars which have generated the current problems we are all experiencing in the energy market, and settle them in sensible fashion.
But politicians behind in the polls like to win elections.
Put simply, Abbott’s pitch is an appeal to baser instincts – a pitch that prolonged polarisation serves the Coalition’s immediate interests.
The former prime minister has also positioned himself in the public domain as a critical player in Turnbull’s ultimate settlement of energy policy, when the truth is all the heavy lifting on the new policy is happening completely outside Abbott’s orbit.
The actual decision makers in the government are heads down bums up on the new investment framework, swerving around the many obstacles, trying to land something vaguely credible, which doesn’t blow up the Coalition.
That’s the objective. Whether the government can produce something credible, given one of the core objectives has to be not blowing up the Coalition, is at this point seriously moot.
Meanwhile, Abbott’s persistent wrecking tactics allow Labor to claim with a veneer of truth and credibility that the former prime minister is driving the government’s energy policy rather than Turnbull – elevating his status from fringe agitprop activist to centre-stage.
In politics that sort of caper is called frontrunning, but I struggle for a word to adequately characterise that behaviour.
Perhaps we can just keep it nice, and say cynical?",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/10/tony-abbotts-climate-frolic-is-strange-and-sad-and-all-about-politics

(a) it is not happening and
(b) it is a natural event and
(c) it is a good thing

Others say ""It's all a hoax"".

Others say ""There's an Ice Age coming"".
Or ""It's all caused by volcanoes.""
And so on and so on.
Some say there is no such thing as a greenhouse effect (there is), others say the rise in CO2 is natural (it isn't).

Since the LNP is proposing to build a coal fired power station it will put carbon into the atmosphere. To off set that carbon going into the atmosphere from coal fired power stations Australia pays a foreign country not to cut down trees (international Permit). That makes the coal fired power station carbon neutral.
Now under Julia Gillard a number of businesses had to cut their carbon emissions or buy an off set carbon credit, like farmers not cutting down trees, or buy carbon credits that are generated with domestic solar systems because domestic solar systems make electricity without producing carbon emissions.

The irony is that scientists are concerned the UK climate may get colder, matching that of the Scandinavian countries. I won’t try to explain the science. Suffice to say that when I undertook environmental studies about fifteen years ago, it was a talking point then. Uneducated people who have not studied science, sometimes have little understanding of how geography, ocean temperatures etc create weather patterns. 
Abbott should stop making up “science” as he goes. He has no idea what he is talking about.

The deputy Labor leader Tanya Plibersek said on Tuesday Abbott’s speech to a group of climate sceptics in London was “actually just weird stuff from the former prime minister” at a time when the government was trying to settle its energy policy. 
While Abbott’s London outburst forced government colleagues into various acts of public diplomacy on Tuesday, one fellow conservative, the Sydney Liberal MP Craig Kelly, and chairman of the backbench committee on climate and energy, defended Abbott’s rationale.
“The point that Tony makes is 100% correct, and the chief scientist has actually confirmed this, the chief scientist has said, no matter what we do here in Australia with our emissions, it’s not going to change the weather, it’s not going to change the temperature of the globe, it’s not going to prevent bad storms,” Kelly told Sky News.
The government this week has continued to signal that it will not pursue the clean energy target modelled by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, in his review of the national electricity market published mid-year.
Abbott has opposed the Finkel recommendation from the outset, branding further subsidies for renewables “unconscionable”, and, alongside fellow government conservative George Christensen, has threatened to cross the floor in the event the government attempts to legislate it.
With the government working to finalise its policy and present it during the final parliamentary sitting weeks before the summer break, the energy minister Josh Frydenberg used an energy summit on Monday to argue low emissions technologies may not need further subsidies once the current renewable energy target winds down after 2020.
That signal has rattled industry players, who had assumed the government was working on a modified version of the Finkel recommendation.
As industry alarm about the government’s policy direction intensified, the chief scientist publicly defended his mechanism as being important to provide investor certainty.
While the clean energy target has broad ranging support from industry, the energy sector and state governments, the heavily contested internal dynamics of the Coalition renders the Finkel recommendation hard to deliver.
The government’s new energy policy is expected to include an overhaul of the national electricity market rules to provide incentives to bring more dispatchable power in the market.
While Finkel’s target has clearly hit an internal roadblock, the policy is expected to include mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including the use of international permits, which the government first signalled when it launched a review of its Direct Action policy.
Industry sources also expect the existing Emissions Reduction Fund, which is the Coalition’s voluntary scheme that gives incentives for farmers and landholders to reduce emissions, to be given renewed funding.
A range of groups, from the business lobby to environmentalists, want the major parties to reach a bipartisan agreement on energy and climate policy and end a wretched decade of partisan argument.
As the government is moving to finalise its policy, Labor has increased its public overtures that it is prepared to deal with the Coalition in the event it can produce a credible policy.
But Labor has also grabbed Abbott’s public frolic to argue Malcolm Turnbull is not in charge of the Coalition’s policy formulation.
Labor’s treasury spokesman, Chris Bowen, said on Tuesday Abbott’s intervention underscored the “catastrophic failure” of Turnbull “to stand up to the climate deniers in his party”.
Bowen said Abbott was “an effective handbrake on the elected prime minister, stopping any sensible policy progress when it comes to climate change and energy”.
He said Labor has not given the chief scientist the task of drafting a policy settlement for climate and energy, that request had come from the government.
“Alan Finkel has delivered a very good report which says here’s a way forward,” Bowen said. “We’ve got this remarkable circumstance with the opposition of the day willing to be bipartisan but the government can’t reach an internal partisan position.
“We can’t negotiate with a puff of smoke.
“We need the government to have a position so that we can reach that policy certainty. We don’t have that because frankly Malcolm Turnbull is just not up to it.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/10/tony-abbotts-climate-change-speech-loopy-says-labor

Few people in the world had such personal experience as Tony de Brum of the realities of sea level rises and storm surges, of warmer seas, receding beaches and abandoned land. Fewer still have been able to turn that experience into international action to save the islands, and the rest of the planet with them.
De Brum, who has died aged 72, acted as ambassador on climate change for the Marshall Islands, a sparsely populated group of more than 1,000 tiny islands spread out over nearly 30 coral atolls. In 2015, he was instrumental in securing the Paris agreement on climate change, by which the world’s governments collectively agreed, for the first time, to hold global warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, which scientists say is the limit of safety, and with an aspiration to ensure warming does not exceed 1.5C.
The 1.5C provision was crucial for the low-lying Pacific island states: scientists estimate that, at 2C of warming, the atolls would be overswept by sea level rises and frequent storm surges. Only a lower limit would give them a lifeline, but the challenge of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in line with such a goal is immense, and while small developing countries were keen, many big economies balked at it. In the tense final days of the negotiations, De Brum helped to lead a coalition of developing and developed countries to forge a compromise and carry the day, resulting in the historic accord. He was hailed as “a real hero, a giant of history, a custodian of our shared future” by the Marshall Islands’ president, Hilda Heine, and by the former UN climate chief, Christiana Figueres, as “an inspiring leader, a pillar of determination”.
De Brum’s work on climate change, while it will form perhaps his most lasting global legacy, was only the third of the great causes he espoused in a five-decade career of public service, during which he served as foreign minister of the Marshall Islands for three separate terms, interspersed with periods as minister of finance, of health and the environment, and as assistant to the president.
De Brum was born on Tuvalu, a former British colony 700 miles north of Fiji, as the war in the Pacific was nearing its final deadly stages. The family later moved to Likiep, in the Marshall Islands, at that time a trust territory of the US, which had wrested control from Japan. His father, Joe, became manager of Majuro airport; his mother, Cecilia, was a teacher.
When hostilities ended, the US began 12 years of nuclear testing in the area, with close to 70 blasts by 1958. As a boy, De Brum witnessed one of the consequences from a fishing boat. He later recalled: “I was fishing with my grandfather. He was throwing the net and suddenly the silent bright flash, and then a force, the shockwave. Everything turned red: the ocean, the fish, the sky, and my grandfather’s net. And we were 200 miles away from ground zero.” This was the Bravo Shot, the largest of the US nuclear tests carried out on Bikini Atoll, more than a thousand times as powerful as the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.
The Marshall Islanders’ campaign for freedom from the US lasted through the 1970s, with independence coming in 1979. After studying at Chaminade University, then the University of Hawaii – he was one of the first Marshall Islanders to attend university, according to Heine – De Brum took part in the negotiations, and in the independent governments that followed.
His experience of nuclear testing led to a lifelong crusade for nuclear disarmament, culminating in filing lawsuits against all nine nuclear-armed countries in the international court of justice in 2014. “Nuclear weapons are a senseless threat to essential survival. There are basic human and ethical norms, not to mention longstanding treaties, which compel those who possess them to pursue and achieve their elimination,” he said. The legal bid failed.
Unassuming in manner, grey-haired and grey-suited, De Brum could have been indistinguishable from the hundreds of other functionaries milling through the halls of UN meetings. There was nothing grey about his personality, however: affable and friendly, he was always ready with a quip or a wink for journalists, and shared stories about his beloved islands, his childhood and his family. He was as happy to greet groups of schoolchildren, or students dressed as polar bears, as to mingle with world leaders.
De Brum’s work at the two-week-long Paris talks was a masterclass in diplomacy. The debate over whether the 1.5C target should be included had the potential to wreck the talks – it had wrecked the previous attempt, eight years earlier in Copenhagen. By agreeing a compromise, he showed a pragmatism often absent from the negotiations, and helped lead his fellow small island states and least developed countries in joining with the EU and various others in the “coalition of high ambition”.
Some dismissed the 1.5C aspirational target as unachievable, but De Brum’s faith was borne out by a new study, published soon after his death in Nature Geoscience, a prestigious peer-review journal. It concluded that keeping within 1.5C was possible, though it required effort.
De Brum is survived by his wife, Rosalie (nee Maddison), whom he married in 1969, three children, 10 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren, and by his father.

Given that Australia is well-placed to replace the use of coal with solar/wind/hydro/tidal in generating electricity within its jurisdiction, yes... it is entirely possible that Australia could be an exporter of fossil-fuels whilst 'banning' their use for such purposes itself.

Posted a day ago. His column has two comments only. 
So Bolt tried another angle a little later and this time got 160 comments...
THE SCREAMS AND ABUSE TELL US TONY ABBOTT WAS RIGHT 
Its the ""conservatives don't have a voice cause the lefties are screaming... angle"" That always works on the weak minded. 
BQSTART
Tony Abbott has given an explosive speech saying there’s basically nothing Australians can do to change the climate, and a little warming may actually be good. You know it was a good speech because you can hear the screaming and the abuse.
BQEND No Bolt... it's because Abbott is a flat earth nutter and this time he is way off his rocker.
From the link in the above article - 
BQSTART
At one point, Abbott said that because he had seen historical photographs of Manly Beach near Sydney, he thought reports of dangerous sea level rise “from climate alarmists” might be wrong. 
Sherwood said of all the false claims, this was Abbott’s “funniest.”
“A few photographs of the beach taken from his neighbourhood are a more accurate record of global sea-level than the global network of tide gauges and satellite altimeters! In a way, that says it all.”
BQEND You have got to ask, will you replace science based methods with the words of a bloke who has this kind of research credibility?

Go on, I dare you.
Throughout his speech, the former Australian prime minister urged listeners to think that dismissing decades of research backed by the world’s leading scientific institutions required bravery and fortitude, rather than other less celebrated human attributes.
But what would constitute bravery for a conservative politician like Abbott? Changing your mind when the evidence tells you you’re dead wrong, or saying what you’ve always said, using the logical fallacies that you’ve always used? One step is brave, the other is cowardly.
Abbott was giving the Global Warming Policy Foundation’s annual lecture – an “honour” previously bestowed on his spiritual and political mentors John Howard and Cardinal George Pell. 
Nobody should be surprised that what we got was an absolute crap speech from a man who confessed he still thinks climate science is “absolute crap”.
Abbott went for the whole canon of tired climate science denial talking points – carbon dioxide is just food for plants, the climate has always changed, it’s the sun – in what constituted a warmed-up meal of misinformation with a side order of supercilious gravy.
Several leading Australian climate scientists have hit back. How tired they must get of debunking this stuff.
Abbott’s speech was also chock-full of internal contradictions.
He suggested a conspiracy to tamper with temperature readings, but admitted the globe was warming. He described carbon dioxide as a “trace gas” and dismissed its role in warming, but elsewhere thought warming (which might not be happening) would be good. And the “trace gas” is insignificant, but not when it comes to its ability to “green the planet” and help plants grow. 
Professor Steve Sherwood, deputy director of the University of New South Wales Climate Change Research Centre, read the speech and said it was “the usual mix of misdirection, falsehoods and tirades against ‘brigades’ who supposedly say this and that but are never clearly identified”.
The @thegwpfcom wouldn't let me attend @TonyAbbottMHR's speech. But here's what he said https://t.co/cutUHcZZ4L pic.twitter.com/peDjtdveC4
Abbott told the thinktank – which had denied requests from seasoned climate reporters to attend – that past climate changes that occurred millions of years ago showed there was nothing to worry about now.
“Abbott is trying to hide the fact that it is the scientists themselves – who know more about past climate changes than he does – who are sounding the alarm,” said Sherwood.
The former prime minister confined his scientific missteps to seven or eight paragraphs in the middle of his speech. 
Abbott presents an absurdly and intentionally distorted viewpoint, reminiscent of a conspiracy theorist
Professor Mark Howden, director of the ANU Climate Change Institute, said Abbott’s claim that other factors, such as sunspots cycles or wobbles in the Earth’s orbit could be just as important as carbon dioxide, was simply false.
“The evidence that our climate is changing due to human activity is overwhelming,” said Howden. “2016 was globally the hottest year on record, surpassing the 2015 record, surpassing the 2014 record. There is 99.999% certainty that humans are driving the observed temperature rises via greenhouse gas emissions.”
Abbott’s claim that “no big change has accompanied the increase in carbon dioxide concentration” was “problematic”, said Howden, given “research shows that the world has already warmed by approximately 1C since pre-industrial times”.
“We are already experiencing changed patterns of rainfall, more and more days with extreme temperatures, increasingly intense natural disasters and rising sea levels, impacting on almost all facets of life in Australia.”
Professor Andrew Pitman, director of the Australian Research Council’s Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes, said while it was true that CO2 is essential to life, “life also requires many trace elements that at higher concentrations are toxic”.
“It is a myth to imply that because CO2 is essential to life, more of it is good.”
Abbott also deployed another favourite talking point from climate science misinformers – that warming (which, remember, he thinks might not be happening) will cut the number of people dying of cold. 
Pitman said this argument, too, was misleading, saying: “It is true that in rich countries which tend to be in the mid to higher latitudes, some warming might help reduce deaths from cold. In the lower latitude countries – the subtropics and tropics – people rarely die of cold. In contrast they die of heat and lack of clean water. 
“So, countries responsible for global warming might gain a minor benefit from warming while those least responsible will wear the consequences.” 
Dr Liz Hanna, an expert on the impacts of climate change on human health, said human-caused warming was already implicated in the deaths of many thousands.
“In 2003, 70,000 people died in western Europe, and in 2010 a further 55,000 people died in Russia and eastern Europe. These figures far exceed deaths from cold snaps. The decade 2001-2010 saw a 2,300% increase in heat deaths above the previous decade. Mr Abbott’s assertions don’t tell the whole story, as they’re based on what has happened in the past rather than what is projected to happen in future. While more people die from cold than heat in Melbourne at the moment, this will reverse as more summer days reach the high 40s.”
Away from his errors on the evidence, Abbott tried to characterise climate science and environmentalism as being hamstrung by a religious-type fervour that gets in the way of “common sense”. Abbott said:
Environmentalism has managed to combine a post-socialist instinct for big government with a post-Christian nostalgia for making sacrifices in a good cause. Primitive people once killed goats to appease the volcano gods. We’re more sophisticated now but are still sacrificing our industries and our living standards to the climate gods to little more effect.
Beware the pronouncement, ‘the science is settled’. It’s the spirit of the Inquisition, the thought-police down the ages. Almost as bad is the claim that ‘99% of scientists believe’ as if scientific truth is determined by votes rather than facts.
As a Roman Catholic libertarian free market ideologue, Abbott is, presumably, immune to such group think.
Climate scientist Ben Henley, of the University of Melbourne, also spots Abbott’s facile argument. In an email he told me:
“By implication, Abbott superstitiously questions the foundations of science, and in doing so, he questions the same scientific method which discovered wifi and penicillin, and proved the Earth was not flat.
“Abbott presents an absurdly and intentionally distorted viewpoint, reminiscent of a conspiracy theorist.”
Abbott’s attitude to climate change seems to rest on a Boy’s Own “who dares wins” approach to policy that’s neither brave or daring. It’s stupid.

On Tuesday, Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), signed an order to scrap the Clean Power Plan, a Barack Obama-era initiative to curb pollution from US power plants. 
“The war against coal is over,” Pruitt declared. “We are committed to righting the wrongs of the Obama administration by cleaning the regulatory slate.”
The move has provoked a furious reaction from states, businesses and environmental groups that warn that the world’s second-largest carbon polluter is risking its population’s health and the future livability of parts of the planet. 
New York’s attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, said he would sue the Trump administration to prevent its “irresponsible and illegal efforts to turn the clock back on public health”.
More than a dozen other states are likely to follow, backed by green groups. Xavier Becerra, California’s attorney general, said he would do “everything in my power to defend the Clean Power Plan”. Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, said the organization would fight Trump and Pruitt “in the courts, in the streets, and at the state and local level across America to protect the health of every community”.
Several large companies have stated their support for the Clean Power Plan. In a joint statement, Apple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft said: “Climate change is one of our most significant global challenges and strong action is critical to meeting the serious threat posed by greenhouse gas emissions.
 “We believe that strong clean energy and climate policies, like the Clean Power Plan, can make renewable energy supplies more robust and address the serious threat of climate change while also supporting American competitiveness, innovation, and job growth.”
A spokeswoman for food manufacturer Mars said: “Mars has been outspoken about the need for business and government to step up and address critical global challenges, like climate change. We are disappointed by the decision.”
The absence of any major national climate policy has placed greater onus on states, cities and businesses, such as those that formed the We Are Still In coalition after Trump announced his intention to withdraw from the Paris climate accord. Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York, tweeted: “The EPA can repeal the Clean Power Plan but not the laws of economics. This won’t revive coal or stop the US from reaching our Paris goal.”
Courtroom battles may take several years to unspool, meaning the Trump administration may not be able to scrap the climate plan and craft some sort of watered-down replacement before 2020.
The repeal proposal states the Clean Power Plan “exceeds the EPA’s statutory authority”, adding that the agency has not determined whether it will replace the plan with anything. Instead, it has opened a comment period for the public. Pruitt said the EPA will “assess whether further regulatory action is warranted”.
Some conservative groups want the EPA to provide no replacement and reverse its 2009 “endangerment finding” that climate change poses a risk to human health. It is more likely the regulator will simply put forward an industry friendly alternative that requires coal-fired plants to improve some internal practices rather than switch to cleaner sources such as solar and wind. 
“What is especially laudable about the Trump EPA analysis is that Scott Pruitt and his team are intent on restoring legality to the regulatory process,” said Myron Ebell, who headed the EPA transition team for Trump and directs environment policy at the conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute. “CEI has petitioned EPA to reopen and rescind the endangerment finding, so we would obviously prefer no rule. However, if the endangerment finding is not rescinded, then a legal inside-the-fenceline rule would be acceptable.”
The Clean Power Plan was unveiled by Obama in 2015 but was immediately challenged by industry groups and 27 states, including Oklahoma when Pruitt was attorney general of the state. Last year, the supreme court froze the plan pending legal challenges. 
“Legally the Trump administration is on very firm ground, but if they don’t issue a replacement rule they will face lawsuits,” said Jeff Holmstead, a senior EPA official under George W Bush and part of the legal team that attempted to halt the Clean Power Plan. “I think the business community doesn’t want this heavy-handed sort of regulation but they do want a replacement plan. They do want some sort of regulatory certainty.”
The Obama administration set the Clean Power Plan a goal of reducing emissions from the energy sector 32% by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. Electricity generation accounts for nearly a third of US emissions.
The country is more than halfway to that target, largely due to a shift from coal to cheap and abundant natural gas which has lower carbon output. Even with the repeal of the Clean Power Plan, emissions from energy generation may still come close to the original target. But the US will probably fall short of its international pledge to help avoid highly dangerous levels of global warming.
The EPA previously estimated that the Clean Power Plan would prevent about 90,000 child asthma attacks and 3,600 premature deaths a year by 2030. These gains would largely be made in disadvantaged communities and among people of color who disproportionately live next to sources of toxic pollution.
“Unfortunately our most vulnerable communities will face the brunt of this irresponsible decision, including disproportionate health impacts, while rich corporations that have control over the EPA will reap the profits,” said Mustafa Santiago Ali, a former senior official at the EPA’s office of environmental justice.
Pruitt – who is currently under investigation over his use of taxpayer-funded flights – has said he would ideally “do away” with tax credits for wind and solar so they can “stand on their own and compete against coal and natural gas and other sources”.
He made no mention of axing subsidies enjoyed for decades by oil, coal and gas producers. This month, researchers at Oil Change International estimated that the US provides around $20bn a year in subsidies to fossil fuels, through incentives, credits, low royalty rates and other measures.
With the US pulling away from the effort to address climate change, other governments face a stiff challenge. Scientists have linked warming temperatures to increasingly ferocious hurricanes and wildfires. In recent months, parts of Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico have been battered by hurricanes. California’s Napa valley region is experiencing some of the worst fires in the state’s history.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/10/trump-climate-change-clean-power-plan-fightback

Thousands of human beings have suffered and died as a result of Catholic anti-science policies. 
Claiming that condoms can't prevent the spread of diseases like HIV, and convincing governments to allow them to spread their anti-science sex and genital obsessed perversions kills human beings. 
The science (and simple reasoning) clearly indicates that homosexuality is simply a variation in genetics, just like height and eye color. The Catholic church rejects science and reason and teaches that homosexuality angers their gods and that there is something ""wrong' with gays and lesbians, resulting in hundreds/thousands of kids attempting or committing suicide. 
The Catholic church is so anti-science that harm to and deaths of human beings is secondary to their multiple anti-science crusades. 
As for their divestment, you are being played for a fool.
At this late date, companies are not divesting from fossil fuels because of principles, they are divesting from fossil fuels because fossil fuel companies are having to make more and more expensive investments and take bigger and bigger risks to extract what remains of the oil. All the easy to get to, high profit margin oil is gone. It's a thing of the past. The stocks will decline, especially since all the oil companies faked their proven reserves claims to begin with, and now they exaggerate even more with shale oil reserves.
The Catholic church is divesting from fossil fuels because fossil fuel stocks are not growth stocks. It's that simple. 
If the Catholics were actually taking a science based stand, why have they waited for so many years? Even Tutu was calling for divestment on moral grounds 5 years ago. This was two years ago: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/exxon-knew-about-climate-change-almost-40-years-ago/
The Catholic church is one of the biggest practitioners of the old political adage: ""When they're running you out of town, get in front and call it a parade""
They rode out the high profits to the end then now dump high risk declining stocks while slapping a ""Look We're All Environmentalist And Sciency And Shit!"" bumper sticker on their SUV and drive off into the sunset. 
The Catholics should be well ahead of the science If the gods speak directly and clearly to the pope on matters of genitals, sex, gender, sexual orientation, procreation, condoms, masturbation, circumcision, birth control, sex education and all the rest, why couldn't those gods have taken 10 seconds of the pope's precious time 100 years ago to say ""Psst!

BTW it's not hard to be in disagreement with the Catholic church. Anyone who is pro science has to look at the Vatican claims that condoms cannot prevent the spread of diseases because ""the molecules are too big"" to see that the Catholic church is only pro science when it's convenient for their fund raising goals. 
Any rational and ethical human being who reads the Vatican's ruling that male prostitutes can only use condoms to prevent spreading infection *after* they've been infected with HIV and not to prevent becoming infected in the first place has to be at odds with the church if they want to maintain any sort of credibility. 
The Catholic ruling that gluten free or whole wheat hosts are completely out of the question because the magic incantation performed over the cracker and the wine does not symbolically convert them to the flesh and blood of an ancient victim of human sacrifice, the Catholic church *demands* that they cannot cause food allergies because they are genuinely transubstantiated into the *actual* flesh and the *actual* blood of an ancient victim of human sacrifice, and therefore no one can possibly be allergic to them once the incantation has been performed. 
The list goes on and on and on and it gets stupider and stupider and stupider.

BQSTART
Stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases will require a radical transformation of the global energy system over coming decades. Fiscal instruments (carbon taxes or similar) are the most effective policies for reflecting environmental costs in energy prices and promoting development of cleaner technologies, while also providing a valuable source of revenue (including, not least, for lowering other tax burdens). Fiscal policies also have a key role to play in addressing other challenges, like building resilience to climate change and reducing local air pollution and urban congestion. Getting energy prices right has large fiscal, environmental, and health benefits at the national level, and need not wait for international action. Low energy prices, fiscal pressures, and emissions mitigation pledges made by 197 parties to the 2015 Paris Agreement create an opportune time for reform.

The IMF’s latest World Economic Outlook (WEO), released overnight, has dedicated an entire chapter to the impact of weather shocks and climate change on global economic activity.
It warns coping with climate change will be one of the “fundamental challenges” of the 21st century and it calls on the global community to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions before they create “more irreversible damage”, saying richer countries must help low-income economies adapt to rapidly increasing temperatures.
Directly contradicting one of Abbott’s arguments that Australia’s contribution to global emissions has been so small it is not worth restructuring its economy to change its energy use significantly, the IMF says nations with developed economies such as Australia – one of the highest per capita emitters in the world – have a responsibility to act. 
“Advanced and emerging market economies have contributed the lion’s share to actual and projected climate change,” the report says. “Helping low-income developing countries cope with the consequences of climate change is both a humanitarian imperative and sound global economic policy that helps offset countries’ failure to fully internalise the costs of greenhouse gas emissions.
“Since the turn of the 20th century, the Earth’s average surface temperature has increased significantly. Sizeable swings in global temperatures used to happen over long periods, such as fluctuations in and out of the Ice Ages. However, the speed at which the climate has changed over the past 30-40 years appears to be unprecedented in the past 20,000 years.
“Climate change is a negative global externality of potentially catastrophic proportions and only collective action and multilateral cooperation can effectively address its causes and consequences.”
Overall, the IMF is estimating global output growth will increase from 3.2% in 2016 to 3.6% in 2017 and 3.7% in 2018, after upgrading its growth forecast by 0.1 percentage points for 2017 and 2018.
Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF’s economic counsellor, says the global cyclical upswing that began midway through 2016 is continuing to gather strength and is reaching more broadly than any upswing in a decade – roughly 75% of the world economy, measured by GDP at purchasing power parity, is sharing in the acceleration.
But he has cautioned the recovery may not be sustainable because growth in nominal and real wages remains weak compared with past recoveries, including in Australia.
“In particular, most advanced economies face medium-term growth rates significantly lower than in the decade before the global financial crisis of 2007–09,” he said.
Abbott warned this week, in a speech that was being politely ignored by some of his colleagues on Tuesday, that climate change itself was “probably doing good; or at least, more good than harm,” and measures to deal with climate change would damage Australia’s economy.
“In most countries, far more people die in cold snaps than in heatwaves, so a gradual lift in global temperatures, especially if it’s accompanied by more prosperity and more capacity to adapt to change, might even be beneficial,” he said.
The IMF warns specifically in its report that rising global temperatures could wreak havoc in parts of the world, particularly in hotter climates where people were too poor to migrate.
Obstfeld has called on the global community to exploit the current cyclical global upswing to pursue domestic and international reforms.
“Priorities for mutually beneficial cooperation include strengthening the global trading system, further improving financial regulation, enhancing the global financial safety net, reducing international tax avoidance, fighting famine and infectious diseases, mitigating greenhouse gas emissions before they create more irreversible damage, and helping poorer countries, which are not themselves substantial emitters, adapt to climate change,” he said.
“If the strength of the current upswing makes the moment ideal for domestic reforms, its breadth makes multilateral cooperation opportune. Policymakers should act while the window of opportunity is open.” ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/11/imf-tells-rich-nations-that-greater-urgency-needed-on-climate-change

Asked about Abbott’s provocative speech to a group of climate-change sceptics in London questioning the science of climate change – an outing that has been characterised by Labor as “loopy” – Frydenberg brought up Abbott’s own record in the top job.
“Climate change is real,” the energy minister told reporters. “We take our advice from the scientific experts. We believe we need to reduce our emissions. That is why Tony Abbott signed up to the Paris agreement.”
With the government backing off the clean energy target recommended by the chief scientist, which was opposed vociferously by Abbott and other government conservatives, voices are now marshalling against Australia’s participation in the Paris agreement.
Conservative Eric Abetz on Wednesday backed Abbott’s speech in London questioning climate change and declared Australian pensioners need to be put before “some Paris aspirational climate deal”.
Declaring himself an “agnostic” about the science of climate change, the Tasmanian Liberal senator said Abbott had made some “very valid points” in the speech to a group of climate-change sceptics.
While noting the Paris climate agreement “was at all times aspirational and unenforceable”, Abetz queried why Australia had signed up.
“Why we are supporting Paris in circumstances where the total Australian emissions are being, er, er, emitted in China and India by increasing their emissions each year?” Abetz told Sky News. “One really has to ask what is the benefit of exporting our coal to China and India so they can burn it and we can somehow claim environmental purity when it is costing us jobs and costing us wealth with no environmental dividend.”
Frydenberg flatly dismissed those arguments. 
“I point out that, at the time, Tony Abbott said that the agreement Australia struck at Paris was a definite commitment and that it was economically responsible and environmentally responsible. They were Tony Abbott’s words,” the energy minister said.
“Now the Turnbull government is continuing the work of Coalition governments to reduce carbon emissions, but to do so in a way that doesn’t compromise the affordability and the reliability of our system.”
Frydenberg said Australia’s commitment to the Paris treaty was rock solid. 
“We have firm commitments we agreed to at Paris,” he said. “The government will meet and Australia will meet those commitments, just as we beat our first Kyoto target, just as we’re on track to beat our 2020 target.
“We are doing it through a whole range of different mechanisms across the economy. We take climate change very seriously. We take our emissions reductions targets very seriously. That’s what the government has acted.”
Industry is deeply alarmed that the government has backed off the clean energy target recommended by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, because a number of groups saw that policy as a valid pathway to achieve bipartisan agreement on climate and energy policy.
Industry groups are concerned the government’s energy policy is off the rails. The Business Council of Australia is demanding a seat at the table if the government intends to propose an alternative mechanism to the clean energy target to drive the transformation to low-emissions technology.
The government could unveil its energy policy as soon as next week, when parliament resumes for the final spring session.
Abetz on Wednesday declared Australia was exporting jobs and wealth in the “manic determination to go down the renewable energy path”.
He said the government’s new energy policy needed to encourage the construction of new high-efficiency low-emissions coal power plants and, “further forward”, nuclear energy, to provide reliable base-load energy.
The senator said low-cost energy had made Australia a first-world economy and Australia needed to retain that comparative advantage.
Abetz also backed Abbott’s contention that when the world’s climate has been warmer, people fared better. He said the simple reality “in general terms” was when the world’s climate had been a little bit warmer, humanity had done better.
Abetz said he would prefer neither a heatwave nor a cold snap, but he said people died more often in cold snaps than during heatwaves.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/11/climate-change-is-real-energy-minister-hits-out-at-tony-abbott

 Many new technologies that aim to capture and store carbon emissions, thereby delivering “negative emissions”, are costly, controversial and in the early phase of testing.
 But “if you’re really concerned about coral reefs, biodiversity [and] food production in very poor regions, we’re going to have to deploy negative emission technology at scale,” said Bill Hare of Climate Analytics, a science and policy institute.
 “I don’t think we can have confidence that anything else can do this,” the Berlin-based chief executive told a London climate change conference.
 World leaders agreed in 2015 an aim of holding global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial times. Scientists believe this is key to protecting small island nations from sea level rises, shoring up food production and preventing extreme weather.
 Carbon-sucking technologies may even be needed to hold the planet to a less ambitious two degrees of warming, said scientists at Chatham House, a British thinktank.
 The world has already seen an average of about one degree of warming, they said.
 “It’s something you don’t want to talk about very much but it’s an unaccountable truth: we will need geoengineering by the mid-2030s to have a chance at the [1.5C] goal,” Hare said, referring to efforts to cool the planet through engineering.
 These ideas include planting carbon-absorbing forests across large areas, then harvesting the wood for energy and pumping the emissions produced underground – a process likely to feature in an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report next year.
 Machines might also be developed to capture carbon dioxide directly from the air and pump it underground or otherwise neutralise it.
 But efforts to store captured carbon underground are “showing no progress … and even backwards steps in some cases”, said Corinne Le Quéré, director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at the University of East Anglia.
 Underground carbon storage has been promoted as part of a push by the United States and other countries to develop “clean coal” technology.
 Similarly, planting more forests – a technology known as Beccs, or bioenergy with carbon capture and storage – raises questions about food security and land rights, scientists said.
 Le Quéré said Beccs is “probably essential to take us to zero emissions” although “it’s really difficult to imagine we can use land at the levels required in the models”.
 She called for experts to focus on proven approaches, such as improving energy efficiency, promoting cleaner transport, eating less meat and scaling up renewable energies.
 Many experts fear that launching costly “negative emissions” technologies could reduce the pressure to act swiftly to cut emissions now.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/11/world-will-need-carbon-sucking-technology-by-2030s-scientists-warn

Bigger turbines and higher voltage cables have in recent years sent prices for wind power tumbling. The new prices are on average 47 per cent lower than they were just over two and half years ago when the last competitive auction results were announced.

If the wind industry can not meet their bid they can just pull out.

What would happen to international agreements to cut greenhouse gases? What would happen to funding for climate research? What would happen to the green energy revolution?
In most instances, Trump is worse than we could have imagined. But in one special area, Trump may not matter. That is in the growth of corporate purchasing of renewable energy. It turns out there are factors that even Trump cannot stop that make choosing renewable energy an easy decision for many companies.
New evidence about the unstoppable renewable energy wave recently came out in a report that was released by Apex Clean Energy and the GreenBiz Group. These groups surveyed corporations to determine their future plans on renewable energy installation and adoption. They wanted to know whether these plans had changed in the past few years and what motivated their decisions to implement renewable energy strategies. The outcome of this survey is available here for people who want to read the entire document.
The groups surveyed 153 major corporations (both public and private), whose combined revenue was in excess of $250 million. Among these companies, 84% are “actively pursuing or considering purchasing renewable energy over the next 5-10 years.” Surprisingly, they found that 43% of the corporations intend to be more aggressive in their pursuit of renewable energy in the next two years. 87% of those actively pursuing renewable energy purchases stated that the election of Trump had no impact on their decision. 
In fact, 11% were more inclined to purchase renewable energy. Most surprising to me was that of the 128 companies that are actively pursuing or considering purchase of renewable energy over the next two years, all but 1 responded that they were “positive about either continuing forward or becoming more aggressive in their attempts to pursue renewables.” 
A really important part of the survey addressed what motivated the companies as they made decisions to pursue renewables. Also, the report identified the factors that make companies successful in their pursuit. In terms of motivation to actually purchase renewables, 65% of the corporations report that energy price was the leading criteria. So sure, companies want to do the right thing, they want to create a healthier planet to hand off to future generations; they want to improve their public image. But, the decision to implement clean energy has to be made when the economics are right. It turns out, these companies want a diversified energy portfolio (energy sources and geography). Bringing clean energy, especially wind and solar into their energy supply can be a hedge against rising and variable costs of fossil fuels.
The majority of these companies (57%) have renewable energy targets, and having such targets and champions within the corporation makes it much easier to follow through on renewable energy purchases. The main motivations for creating these targets in the first place were to address climate and emission goals and to demonstrate corporate leadership in their industry. 
What this tells me is that while a majority of companies have aspirations to engage with clean energy, and while those aspirations are driven by corporate responsibility, it is the economics that convert aspirations to actions. 
The survey then reported on the types of renewable energy purchases. The most common was owned renewable energy on site. But the second most common was purchased renewable energy credits, followed by power purchase agreements, leased renewable energy infrastructure, green tariffs, and community solar. Steve Vavrik, Apex’s Chief Commercial Officer told me:
Companies that are seeking to buy renewables aren’t just looking for the easiest way to cut costs. They are making a strategic investment to diversify their energy portfolio and secure long-term sustainability.
For me, this is all a much-needed positive sign that all the work done over the past few decades to improve the quality and reliability of clean energy and to develop various options for individuals and corporations to purchase clean energy is paying dividends. I’ve always thought that when the economics point toward the use of clean energy, we will see an unstoppable trend. We may be seeing that now.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/oct/11/despite-trump-american-companies-are-still-investing-in-renewable-energy

That's because it is an ""island grid"" with a thin connector to the rest of the NEM. Also, the wholesale price is set by the most expensive marginal supplier. Which is gas, not renewables. Everybody knows this, except the Rabid Right. At the margin, renewables are the cheapest source of electricity. 2) $500 million? The battery will cost US$50 million. AGL is building a new gas plant to replace part of the Torrens Island gas power station because the station failed at the last summer heatwave. Alinta is planning a new $450 million/150 MW gas station north of Adelaide. Both privately financed. The government *is* leasing 276 MW of gas/diesel turbines which it may buy, costing $350 million. But the fluctuations these gas generators are needed for are not because of the variability of renewables but because of the massive variability of demand: SA can double its electricity demand on a hot summer afternoon. Coal power stations would be useless in such circumstances.3) The state does not experience any more blackouts than Queensland (which is only just adding renewables to its grid.) Both are more vulnerable to blackouts because they are at the extreme ends of the NEM. The state Labor government's initiatives will reduce that risk.4) Frequency control and auxiliary services (FCAS) can be, and are, provided by wind turbines and will be by the new battery bank. 
When the new Aurora concentrated solar power plant is operational, it will provide 150MW of power into the night, and this will be supplemented by the Cultana pumped Hydro sea water storage system near Port Augusta which will provide between 100 and 250MW for several hours.

Not something to be proud of considering what it's achieved for the suffering folk of the State
1) renewables have delivered the State of SA the highest prices and the least reliable power in the nation 
2) The current Labor State Government has been forced to spend more than $500 million to build a new gas-fire power plant and Australia's largest battery to secure the state's energy supply.
3) The State state experiences regular blackout and load-shedding and this summer it is expected that South Australian's will experience many more such events 
4) When levels of wind and/or solar generation relative to demand are high, frequency control and network support services need to be sourced from Victoria to maintain power system security, SA cannot rely on the contribution from windgeneration because it cannot maintain system security and reliability it must therefore source baseload fossil generated power from Victoria to maintain system reliability', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1507815884000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'it can not maintain system security and reliability', u'effect': u'when levels of wind and/or solar generation relative to demand are high need sa can not rely on the contribution from windgeneration'}], u'author_id': u'14680298', u'in_reply_to': u'106663488', u'id': u'106682303', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'davidfitzie', u'text': u'I pray she makes use of this to show real leadership.

Given that their fanaticism has kept their denial going for over 20 years now that renewables have become their target do you really think they are going to stop? No, they were very successful on delaying and obstructing climate and being fanatics they don't stop so they will spend the next twenty years fighting renewables.
I don't know why people, including Bishop, think that Abbott has done a U-turn on AGW, he has always described AGW using the classic denier meme, ""I believe in climate change and that humanity makes a contribution to it"". I remember watching Abbott use these phrases in an interview with Barry Cassidy on Insiders a week before he began his failure as PM and then again in a debate with Peter Hartcher as a moderator Hartcher repeated it back to him. I don't know if Cassidy knew what Abbott was doing because he let it slide but it was easy to see how Hartcher was completely bamboozled by this language because many MSM journalists (with a few notable exceptions) have been completely taken in by this and other memes put out by the deniers. The deniers have been very successful at gaming media discourse on AGW and Abbott is just following what has worked.
Its just so frustrating that no MSM journalist over the past 7 years has not called Abbott out on his use of this and other denier memes/talking points, this is a complete failure of main stream journalists in Australia, they need to shoulder a lot of the dysfunction in the Australian polity that has come from this.', u'recommendation_count': u'11', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1507810803000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'he let it slide', u'effect': u'if cassidy knew what abbott was doing'}, {u'cause': u'many msm journalists with have been completely taken in by this and other memes put out by the deniers', u'effect': u'how hartcher was completely bamboozled by this language'}], u'author_id': u'1157519', u'id': u'106676859', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'polytropic', u'text': u'Less than 1% of total energy comes from wind and solar.

I fired off an email to Abbott’s office asking for more information about this promising new form of coal — I mean, if “clean coal” exists, all our problems are solved, right?
After sending nine polite emails over four months, all unanswered, I called Abbott’s office and spoke to a lovely, yet understandably haggard, office manager, who explained that the former prime minister’s priority was his Warringah electorate. I asked if I could speak with his energy advisor and was told that, as a backbencher, Tony Abbott doesn’t have the luxury of an energy advisor.
A further five emails were ignored, and I reached the conclusion that many start with — Tony Abbott is not interested in rational discussion about energy, instead preferring to lob home-made logic bombs and run.
In an echo of the “cultural cringe”, still alive and well in Abbott’s circles presumably, the “member for Warringah” — apparently too busy with local constituent issues to discuss his nationally published opinions — flew to London to deliver the annual address at a climate-science denial thinktank and in the process launch a missile directly at its intended target, the Australian energy debate.
Abbott’s speech is arguably the most ideological contribution to our energy debate yet, a mixture of historical revisionism (facts and consistency irrelevant), homage to the “triumph of the Western liberal order” and an expression of deep regret for the emergence of a “post-Christian nostalgia” akin to goat sacrifice by “primitive people”. Almost every sentence is outrageous and one could dissect every one of them in an attempt to set the record straight. That, however, would be entirely missing the point.
Abbott’s bomb — designed to shock and destroy, not contribute — landed right on target. In a week when energy minister Josh Frydenberg tried to reassure us that “the good news is that we have learned the lessons of the past, we know where we are going and we have a comprehensive plan to get there”, never has it been more apparent that the Coalition has learnt nothing, has no idea where it is going and literally has no plan.
The biggest news of the week is not Abbott’s speech, but the message it underscored: that the clean energy target (CET) is dead.
For a brief moment in June there was hope that the Coalition and Labor might find a common ground through chief scientist professor Alan Finkel’s technology agnostic proposal to solve the energy trilemma — affordable, reliable and lower-emissions electricity. In the intervening period the Coalition has decided energy will be where they find their point of difference with ”blackout Bill’s” Labor as we gear up for a prolonged campaign into the next federal election.
Frydenberg’s signalling on Monday confirmed that the chance of bipartisan energy legislation passing before the next election just went to zero. Without long term, stable energy policy, renewable investment will slow, the fossil fuel power investment strike will stretch into its second decade and the unsolved trilemma will bite deeper.
Frydenberg and Turnbull both understand the energy system and they know that Finkel got it basically right, yet a backbench with abysmal energy literacy and extraordinary power has given them no choice but to drop the Finkel plan, even before an alternative has been put on the table.
Sometime soon Frydenberg will deliver an “energy investment framework”. Nothing can come of it while the world view of the backbench — currently more powerful than cabinet — is based on a couple of great big lies.
The first is the misconception that renewable energy is heavily subsidised, based on gross miscalculations (misinformation?) driven hard by Australia’s “merchants of doubt”, the Minerals Council of Australia and the Institute of Public Affairs. While there’s now a chorus demanding the end of “renewable subsidies”, few understand that major renewables projects (including two wind farms totalling 980 MW) are now being contracted with an effective subsidy of $0.
Far from no longer being needed, the renewable energy target provides the impetus for retailers to write long term purchase contracts, essential to securing project finance. For an increasing number of projects, the RET costs retailers literally nothing; in fact every expert analysis, including the centrepiece of Abbott’s Warburton review, shows the RET lowers costs of capital and introduces cheaper energy into the market to the consumer’s benefit.
For all the same reasons, the CET would enable a lower cost and more orderly energy transition than relying solely on extreme prices to new signal investment.
The second major misconception is that we have a major reliability problem caused by renewable energy. We don’t. South Australia did have a state-wide blackout a little over a year ago. The wind energy that shut down the grid was not wind turbines, but a series of tornados that toppled 22 pylons. Protection equipment kicked into action, yes, some of it at wind farms, and disconnected enough of the grid for it to “collapse”. The reasons behind the collapse are of great interest to power system engineers, but it was the failure of the generators contracted to restart the grid in this eventuality that impacted South Australians the most. Even with massive network damage and failure of emergency procedures, service was restored to many households in just three hours.
But what of all the other blackouts in South Australia? Apart from a transmission line failure in December, storm damaged power lines after Christmas, gas generators that sat idle when needed to run in February — all minor incidents blown out of proportion to suit a narrative — reliability in SA has been the same as elsewhere in Australia: excellent.
Try telling a Coalition MP that we don’t have a reliability crisis and they’ll laugh in your face. Presumably none are aware that the Australian Energy Market Operator announced earlier this week that the hole left by Hazelwood’s closure has been filled. We’re entering summer better prepared than at any other time in history.
As long as the backbench’s grasp on the facts is so poor, they will keep fighting a battle they can’t win.
Renewable energy is wildly popular with the public. 20% of all Australian households have installed solar on their rooftops — the highest in the world — and the pace of installation is only increasing. Poll after poll shows that Australians, regardless of their political stripes, want more renewables.
Yet, oddly, renewable energy would appear to have no friends in the Coalition. Even among the many in Abbott’s party room who can’t stand the man – who within the party has stuck their neck out to counter his lies?
We won’t see another coal fired power station built in Australia. Anyone who believes it’s going to happen doesn’t comprehend the economic, engineering and political barriers that stand in the way. Now that the economic case has been won, the shift to clean energy is locked in; however, it is now certain that politics will remain vile through to the next election and beyond.
It is almost as if the Coalition is planting landmines in front of their own army — this cannot end well for them, or for Australia. As a young, ambitious minister, Frydenberg must be praying daily for a reshuffle.
On energy, the Coalition is fighting battles on many fronts — against each other, the opposition, consumers, the facts and the future.

Nicholas Stern, an eminent climate economist at the London School of Economics, said: “This very important analysis shatters the myth that fossil fuels are cheap by showing just how huge their real costs are. There is no justification for these enormous subsidies for fossil fuels, which distort markets and damages economies, particularly in poorer countries.” 
Lord Stern said that even the IMF’s vast subsidy figure was a significant underestimate: “A more complete estimate of the costs due to climate change would show the implicit subsidies for fossil fuels are much bigger even than this report suggests.”

Thermal inertia means we underestimate future warming and its effects, takes centuries for full glacial melt, but if we stopped emitting tomorrow, temperatures wouldn't hit 1.5 °C. 
Political inertia is a social construct - things can change and have to. They do in war - can 'the war on warming' engage their resolve? 
Infrastructure inertia is what we're facing in this article - what is financed now will emit for the next 30 years... although possibly it won't because nature will get its urgent message through and new gas power stations will only be allowed to run on a fraction of capacity using landfill and waste methane.

The Burning Question said 2017 is the year when we need to stop building any new fossil fuel infrastructure, as we continue to use it over for its full lifetime we will push warming beyond 2 °C. This is also confirmed in the FT, and by the IEA 5 years ago. We're seeing some impacts of 1 °C, and know 2 °C pushes ecosystems beyond their natural variability.
""$11bn in renewable energy and $4.5bn in energy efficiency"" is paltry. It's minuscule. The World Bank itself says:
BQSTART
Over the next 15 years, the world will require about $90 trillion in new infrastructure – most of it in developing and middle-income countries. Making the right choices in favor of infrastructure that is climate resilient and locks in a low carbon development pathway is critical and urgent. Action now will avoid huge costs later. 
The IEA estimates that limiting the rise in global temperature to below 2 Celsius by the end of the century will require an average of $3.5 trillion a year in energy sector investments until 2050. 
BQEND
The World Economic Forum projects that by 2020, about $5.7 trillion will need to be invested annually in green infrastructure.
We don't want the global South to repeat the mistakes of 19th century Britain. It would be insane given what we know now. They can leapfrog the maldeveloped countries by providing for human needs exclusively sustainably - given, of course, the right help. Meanwhile public pledges to the Green Climate Fund are way short of their inadequate target, only half of which is supposed to be for mitigation. Private investors are doing a lot, but the lead needs to be set by strategy.

Anybody who has read and understood the last two IPCC reports (AR4 & AR5) and who followed the remorseless rise of CO2 emissions (current and already ""in the system""); would recognize that any talk of a 2 C limit or the even less plausible 1.5 C ""target"" by the arbitrary date of 2100 are, at best, political-generated aspirations, not remotely realistic expectations.
Both the lower targets have always been dependent on human society (including policy makers and bankers) reducing its emissions. That has not happened yet and shows no sign of happening for decades - if ever. We continue to emit on our previous insane level, that is the ""business as usual"" level and, as the scientists have consistently warned, that future holds no prospect of 2 C or the even more imaginative 1.5 C being achieved. More like 2.6 to 4.8 C by 2010.
A quote from IPCC WG1AR5 Chapter 12. Long-term Climate Change makes the point. ""Global mean temperatures will continue to rise over the 21st century if greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated. Under the assumptions of the concentration-driven RCPs, global mean surface temperatures for 2081–2100, relative to 1986–2005 will likely be in the 2.6°C to 4.8°C range.""
Worryingly, it is also apparent that even those projections might be overly conservative. 
The MIT (Sokolov et al) study in 2009 had: ""The MIT Integrated Global System Model is used to make probabilistic projections of climate change from 1861 to 2100. Since the model’s first projections were published in 2003, substantial improvements have been made and improved estimates have become available. The new projections are considerably warmer than the 2003 projections; for example, the median surface warming in 2091–2100 is 5.1°C compared to 2.4°C in the earlier study.""
And then there is the methane/permafrost issue which certainly will not make ""holding"" the 2 C ""limit"" any easier. Example paper from 2016: The growing role of methane in anthropogenic climate change. (MSaunois1 et al.) ""The evolution of atmospheric methane over the last three years is inconsistent with the mitigation required in the Representative Concentration Pathways 2.6 and now most closely aligns with the RCP 8.5."" (2.4 to 4.8 C)

With the exception of geothermal energy it is not a significant improvement.
The most basic way to look at a thermal plants efficiency is the carnot cycle. 
This gives a maximum efficiency for electricity generation of:
1 - T [Lower] / T[upper]
Temperatures have to be in Kelvin
When we want to heat water though this can have a much higher efficiency as this isn't Work but heat. 
So typically we might be looking at a 55% efficiency for a CCGT (gas power plant) to generate electricity.
If we took 20% of the input energy and converted it at 90% efficiency to hotwater. Then we would have a CHP efficiency of 44% (elec)+ 20% (heat) = 64% efficiency
In practice though to remove the heat from the power plant requires reducing the electricity generation efficiency as T[lower] is higher so as to remove more heat. It also reduces the capacity of the power plant. Say to 50%
Then for these numbers instead of a 1GW power plant at 55% efficiency, you'd have a 0.8GW power plant at 50% electricity.
The electrical part is less efficient and you'd need more of it.
While you gain on the hot water, the efficiency of small scale is better than large scale and transporting it. For anything other than nuclear you increase the CO2. 
The only reason the schemes can work is by putting the pipes deep enough to use geothermal but even then in summer it is waste and you need huge extra infrastructure.

There once was a time, long ago, when goods and services were created to serve a consumer need. And then, along came a big giant (let's call him the Marketing ogre), and the big giant realised that actually, the consumer could be created to service a corporate need.
The giant called this (perversely) consumerism...and it was strong magic. 
Then the forest people (who are good) came along, and told the common folk, that they could satisfy many of their service and lifestyle requirements, using process, materials and systems that were good for all...all that is, except the corporate marketing ogre...who used all his many gold coins and magic beans, and members of the Kings court, to drive the forest people away.
And so, the big bad marketing and corporate ogre, was able to continue creating a consumer base, to satisfy all of the new things that he created.

the amount of methane escaping from coal mining is supposed to be included as is the energy cost of mining. likewise gas does escape from pipes and wells- but 300g of waste for every kwh does seem excessive. fracked gas is on the high end of the range= 650g/kwh and the low end for coal- high quality in super efficient boilers= 740g/kwh
BQEND
Of course what you are saying is largely correct. If you look at the thermal energy rather than electric. 
Then gas's CO2 /kWh without accounting for fugitive emissions is about 230g CO2 / kWh. 
If it were pure CH4 then it would be nearer 200g CO2 /kWh. 
For methane every % leaked would add 0.25 of the basic level so ~50g CO2e / kWh per % leaked. 
For coal you'd be looking at around 300g-350g CO2 / kWh
It would require that the total leakage of the natural gas would be about 4% or higher for NG to be worse.
Now, the majority of fugitive emissions to date for FF comes at the point of extraction, with NG there are potentially end-of-life issues that we have yet to see with onshore gas too.
But basically, if we look at the current exploitation trends for gas then it is not easy to judge just what the likely leakage is as it has not even seriously been assessed from anything but where they put the hole.
If we look at global methane though then we are basically adding enough CH4 to be 1200ppb above pre-industrial. You look at the growth since fracking started or as an estimate of the maintained level then you could well be looking at 0.6ppm CO2e.
CH4 GWP is about 26x and a total life perhaps at 26 years Which means currently it is adding about 2ppm CO2e / yr from CH4. About 60% is above pre-industrial levels.
And likely fracking gas adding about 50% of the short-term addition. 
The TPES of coal is about 26%, NG about 21%The CO2 from this is estimated as coal 46% and NG 19%.
The thing is that the Carbon cycle removes a significant amount of the extra CO2 but much more negligible upon the CH4 (although does impact the lifetime of the CH4).
This then means that fracking as compared to existing coal is very close with gas quite possibly adding more to the estimated imbalance if you include aerosols.
And a higher proportion of gas is used as direct heating.

The new analysis also reveals that some of the taxpayers’ money given to coal and gas projects was counted as “climate” finance. 
Funding for fossil fuel projects from the six main international development banks totalled at least $5bn in 2016, according to a report from researchers at Oil Change International (OCI).
In particular, OCI estimate the funding for exploration for new oil and gas more than doubled in 2016, to $2.1bn. Funding for clean energy also grew by more than a third, to $11.4bn. 
A second report from analysts at E3G suggests that in recent years the World Bank and European Bank for Development and Reconstruction (EBRD) have given similar levels of funding to fossil fuels as to climate-friendly energy projects. 
“Despite the Paris Agreement being reached, multilateral development banks that say all the right things on climate are still financing billions of dollars in oil, gas, and coal projects,” said Alex Doukas at Oil Change International. “They are using relatively scarce public resources that need to be used as strategically as possible if we have a hope of meeting the agreement’s aims. If they really want to help lift people out of poverty, taxpayer-funded banks can no longer finance climate destruction. They must stop funding fossil fuels.”
Helena Wright at E3G said: “Development banks must do more to green their investments. As a first step, the banks should commit to ending finance for fossil fuel exploration. Obviously exploration for new resources is not in line with the Paris goals – we have got enough fossil fuels already to go over 2C of warming.” 
Scientists showed in 2015 that to keep under the internationally agreed 2C warming limit, then most existing fossil fuel reserves need to stay in the ground. In July, the G20 nations were accused of hypocrisy for talking tough on global warming but providing four times more public finance for fossil fuels than for renewables.
Wright also found that millions of dollars given by the EBRD for a coal port in Morocco were counted as climate finance on the grounds the port contributed to adaptation to climate change. In another example, millions of dollars given by the EBRD for an offshore gas exploration project in Azerbaijan were also counted as climate finance on the basis that it reduced emissions compared to baseline. “It seems a bit ridiculous,” she said.
However, a spokesman for the EBRD said it strongly disagreed with the analysis in the new reports and the way in which the projects were categorised. He said the EBRD spent 2.7 times more on energy-related climate projects than on fossil fuels and that the analyses had not included lending that went to projects via partner banks.
A World Bank spokesman also disputed the analyses and emphasised the bank’s clean investments: “Over the last five years, the World Bank Group has invested more than $11bn in renewable energy and $4.5bn in energy efficiency. We are now the largest multilateral provider of finance for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects in developing countries.”
Both of the new reports analysed the lending by the World Bank, EBRD, the African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Investment Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.
The OCI report estimated significant rises in fossil fuel funding in 2016 by the Asian Development Bank, where it leapt fivefold, and at the World Bank. The E3G report judged the Inter-American Development Bank as the greenest, giving over five times more to climate-friendly energy projects between 2013 and 2015 than to fossil fuel schemes.
Yongping Zhai, energy advisor at the Asian Development Bank, said: “ADB will continue to expand climate finance, while still providing access to energy in the most cost effective manner to support progress for developing countries. ADB’s financing to fossil fuel in 2016 was limited to natural gas, which is an important transition fuel, [with] lesser carbon.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/12/fossil-fuels-win-billions-in-public-money-after-paris-climate-deal-angry-campaigners-claim

Closely related to corals, sea anemones are invertebrate marine creatures that live in symbiosis with algae, which provide them with food, oxygen and colour.
Clownfish, also known as anemonefish, in turn use the structures as shelter to lay their eggs and raise their young – keeping the anemones clean in return.
For the study, published in the journal Nature Communications, a research team monitored 13 pairs of orange-fin anemonefish living among the coral reefs of Moorea Island in the South Pacific.
They were monitored before, during and after the El Niño weather event that in 2016 caused major coral bleaching as the Pacific Ocean warmed.
Half of the anemones in the study “bleached”, expelling the algae that live on them and turning bone white, the team found. This happens in response to environmental stress, such as ocean warming or pollution.
“Among the clownfish living in the bleached anemones, the scientists observed a drastic fall (-73%) in the number of viable eggs,” said a statement from France’s CNRS research institute. “These fish were laying eggs less frequently and they were also laying fewer and less viable eggs.”
No changes were observed among fish with unbleached abodes.
Blood samples showed a sharp increase in levels of the stress hormone cortisol in the affected fish, and a “significant drop” in sex hormones that determine fertility, the team reported.
The health of the anemones and the fish improved three to four months after the end of the warming event.
Further research is needed, the team said, to examine the effects of a longer, or more intense, warming period, and whether affected fish would deal better or worse with a new bleaching episode.
Exceptional ocean warming events are predicted to become more frequent as the average global temperature rises. Nearly 200 nations agreed under the 2015 Paris agreement to limit warming to two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) over industrial levels.
A level of about 1C has already been reached and scientists fear the ceiling will be shattered, with potentially disastrous consequences for the Earth’s climate.
In June last year, a study said many of the real-life Nemos swimming in children’s fish tanks around the world were caught using cyanide – another threat to the species.
Finding Nemo, the movie about the quest of a young fish separated from its family, resulted in more than a million clownfish being harvested from tropical reefs as pets.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/12/finding-nemo-losing-climate-study-clownfish

Speaking from South Korea on the ABC’s 7:30 on Thursday, the foreign affairs minister rebuked Abbott by recounting his record of signing the Paris climate agreement and setting the renewable energy target.
Bishop’s comments follow a similar intervention from energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, stating that climate change is real and recalling that Abbott signed the Paris agreement.
On Monday evening Abbott told a climate sceptic thinktank in London that policies to combat climate change were like “primitive people ... killing goats to appease the volcano gods”. He also reprised his 2009 assertion that the “so-called settled science of climate change” was “absolute crap”.
Asked about Abbott’s comments, Bishop said he was “entitled to express his views, as any other member of parliament ... is entitled to do”.
But she added: “The views he expressed recently are different to those he expressed as prime minister when he supported the Paris agreement, and in fact set a nationally determined targets and the renewable energy target was established under then Prime Minister Abbott,” she said. “So, it’s up to him to explain the differences between his opinion then and his opinion now.”
Bishop said the Turnbull government was determined to deliver “affordable, reliable energy ... that will still meet our international obligations, which were, in fact, established under then Prime Minister Abbott”.
Asked why Abbott was not expelled for “constant breaches of discipline”, Bishop noted that he was discussing an issue that was “controversial” in some sectors of the community.
Bishop suggested the reason there was “a deal of interest in what he has to say” is that he had changed his mind from his view as prime minister. “I think the question that has to be asked of Tony Abbott is why does he have a different view now than when he was prime minister?”
With the government backing off the clean energy target recommended by the chief scientist, it is unclear what mixture of climate policies it will propose to meet international obligations.
Bishop said the Turnbull government’s energy policy “will be discussed by cabinet and by the party room and then of course announced to the Australian public”.
The government could unveil its energy policy as soon as next week, when parliament resumes for the final spring session.
The expected overhaul of the market rules in the government’s looming energy policy overhaul is expected to be accompanied by mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including the use of international permits, which the government first signalled when it launched a review of its Direct Action policy.
The energy sector also expects the existing Emissions Reduction Fund, which is the Coalition’s voluntary scheme that gives incentives for farmers and landholders to reduce emissions, will also have its funding topped up between now and the next election.
Abbott’s speech was labelled “loopy” by Labor’s deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek, but defended in part by Liberal MP Craig Kelly, the chairman of the backbench committee on climate and energy.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/12/tony-abbott-needs-to-explain-u-turn-on-climate-change-julie-bishop-says

It's a huge improvement. You're hugely reducing the amount of natural gas burned and thus emissions.
BQENDIt's a cut, but you've still baked a gas dependency into the system.
Remember, the capacity factor for solar is barely more than 10%, wind 37% and tidal 18-22%
If you want a de-carbonized electricity system, you need low-carbon generation that's available come rain, shine or low wind speed. Which means the stuff that's available generate on a weekday evening in February when there's no wind. Which basically means nuclear, or CCS fossil fuel.

Hydrogen is promising as an energy store for surplus renewables. Wind turbines, for example, produce very abundant, but intermittent, energy. At times when turbines are producing more energy than can be used by the grid, the surplus could be used to generate H2.

https://www.theengineer.co.uk/converting-the-gas-network-to-hydrogen/
BQEND
Thanks. This is certainly an interesting concept, and a good article (if a bit light on technical detail).
My understanding is that while H2 distribution via a natural gas network is certainly possible, it would be at pressures similar to natural gas, and require blending with a dilutant/inerter for safety reasons. It would still require processing and compression (to 700 bar!) at filling sites before being usable in vehicles. This itself requires considerable energy and still requires large storage tanks at the filling site if it is to be able to handle significant volume.
Secondly, this would require complete replacement of Natural Gas equipment, such as boilers and cook-tops, with H2 equipment at every premises on the network. It would be hard to do this piecemeal: you'd have to shut down the Natural Gas network, region by region, spend many months or years upgrading equipment at every customer site, and finally start it back up with H2. This itself may well make it a non-starter!
I can't help but think they have the entire concept backwards: they are trying to promote an H2 network to justify continued Natural Gas exploration/production, to produce H2 via steam reformation with the idea that CCS will make it carbon neutral. (CCS is, unfortunately, unproven and very expensive - and many CCS trials have failed.)
A far better idea, perhaps: Use H2 to produce synthetic natural gas. This is actually not difficult once you have the H2, and you can use CO2 extracted from the atmosphere:
CO2 + 4 H2 → CH4 + 2 H2Ohttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabatier_reaction
This carbon-neutral gas could be blended seamlessly with the existing gas supply, with the proportion increased over time as more H2 production becomes available.

CCS is, unfortunately, unproven and very expensive
BQEND
We know how to do it. But it is indeed, expensive. It works much better with pure CO2 sources than flue gasses.
Thing is, some CCS is almost certainly necessary in the UK. We cannot get to net zero emissions, which is necessary to arrest, rather than merely slow, global warming without some negative emissions. Cement, agriculture, steel-making and (so far) aviation all have emissions that are very hard to remove and there will be other residual activities. We do not have enough land for BECCS at the scale required, and we do have _lots_ of undersea storage and facilities and suitable pipelines connected to it. We are almost certainly going to have to use those for CCS in the next 30 years, and it would be a good idea to set it up before they get decomissioned.
The tricky part is working out how to pay for it, because it needs a carbon price around £200/tonne to make it commercially attractive, and currently the ETS is 6 euros and the UK carbon floor is £18. But, like the rest of decarbonisation, we don't really have a choice. Prof Stuart Haszeldene's favoured scheme is a simple requirement that CO2 emissions have to have corresponding CO2 disposal certificates, so there will be a market in disposal. That could work. It also adresses the problem quite directly.

""Assuming that all the signatories reported their credentials accurately, credentialed climate experts on the list are very few."" The problem is made worse, Lahsen notes, because critics ""added bogus names to illustrate the lack of accountability the petition involved"".[20] Approved names on the list included fictional characters from the television show M*A*S*H,[21] the movie Star Wars,[20] Spice Girls group member Geri Halliwell, English naturalist Charles Darwin (d. 1882) and prank names such as ""I.

So we don't even know if many of the people are real. But it gets worse... 


BQSTART
Of the 26 we were able to identify in various databases, 11 said they still agreed with the petition —- one was an active climate researcher, two others had relevant expertise, and eight signed based on an informal evaluation. Six said they would not sign the petition today, three did not remember any such petition, one had died, and five did not answer repeated messages.
BQEND
This was back in 2001 and already six out of 26 had changed their minds. That was of the people they were able to identify. Since then fifteen of the warmest years on record have happened and we have just had the three warmest in a row.
 So that's the ones they were able to identify, which is another problem. From wiki again...

A cursory examination by Todd Shelly of the Hawaii Reporter revealed duplicate entries, single names lacking any initial, and even corporate names.

The proposals aim to slash air pollution in the historic university city, which has seen levels of the harmful pollutant nitrogen dioxide rise above legal limits in some areas.
Under the plans being put out for consultation on Monday, the ban would be introduced in phases, starting with preventing non-zero-emitting taxis, cars, light commercial vehicles and buses from using a small number of streets in 2020.
As vehicle technology develops, the zero-emissions zone will extend to cover all non-electric vehicles, including HGVs, in the whole of the city centre by 2035, according to the joint proposals by Oxford city council and Oxfordshire county council.
The introduction of the zero-emissions zone could see levels of nitrogen dioxide, much of which comes from traffic fumes, particularly diesel engines, fall by up to three-quarters by 2035, the councils said.
Data released by the World Health Organisation last year showed that Oxford was one of 11 British cities to breach the safe limits set for toxic particles known as PM10s. It also breached the limit for PM2.5s.
The city has already won £500,000 of government funding to install charging points for electric taxis, and £800,000 to install 100 electric vehicle charging points for residents, but officials say more will be needed to support the zero-emissions zone. Other schemes being considered to support the zone include reduced parking fees for electric vehicles, electric taxi-only ranks, and electric delivery vehicle-only loading areas.
Councillor John Tanner of Oxford city council said: “Toxic and illegal air pollution in the city centre is damaging the health of Oxford’s residents. A step change is urgently needed; the zero emissions zone is that step change.
“All of us who drive or use petrol or diesel vehicles through Oxford are contributing to the city’s toxic air. Everyone needs to do their bit, from national government and local authorities, to businesses and residents, to end this public health emergency.”
Oxfordshire county council councillor Yvonne Constance said: “We want to hear from everyone who uses the city centre, including businesses, bus and taxi firms and local residents ... Pragmatism will be an important part of anything we plan, but we have set the ambition.”
The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, called last month for the environment department to amend the Clean Air Act to allow for the creation of zero-emission zones.
Other cities that have tried to introduce measures to tackle vehicle emissions include Madrid, whose city council ordered half of the city’s cars to be banned in 2016, and Oslo, where the authorities eventually backtracked on a plan to ban all private cars in the Norwegian capital.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/11/oxford-aims-to-cut-air-pollution-car-ban-zero-emissions-zone

Where does the ""globally exemplary"" quote come from? It's not in the report, which actually specifically acknowledges that it is still based on the CCC targets derived from the 2C target, and therefore is not even attempting to meet the Paris target of well below.
I don't know if your other link was meant as preferable to talking about cumulative emissions. A linear graph doesn't give clear budgets for specific timeframes, which are what policy makers want.

I'm for electrification of heating through heat pumps.
BQENDAs am I - I have two water sourced heat pumps that I run mainly off solar+batteries.
But 23 million UK homes rely on gas heating, plus there's all the industrial demand not just for heating but as a chemical feedstock.Then there's the increasing gas for electricity generation.
Are we coming off gas?No.Have we built the 6000 biogas farms required to cover 30% of demand?No.Do we have a programme to do this?No.
So the reality is that we have to import gas or revert to coal.
Your arguments inevitably go towards speculated, often whimsical extremes of possibility as opposed to noting what is actually happening. This is no different.
You know your scenario is not happening - and therefore (if you oppose domestic gas) then you are knowingly setting the scene increasing the demand for imported gas.

BQENDThis is something of meaningless statement. The Earth will be consumed by the sun -
eventually.The quesion is, will it be released from storage in a meaningluf time frame. You have to provide a mechanism or evidence that natural hydrocarbon reservoirs that have held fluids (including methane and even CO2 ) for millions of years will suddenly start to leak, rapidly, at the same time, over the next few hundred years.
I also think you are missing the point about CS potential fro both non-power station use (e.g. cement works) and BECCS.

That's interesting, so let's say 40 miles for 45kWh = 0.89 miles / kWh, v's about 4 miles per kWh for EV's.
So 4/0.89 = 4.5 times more, very close to your original statement of needing 1/4 of the energy from leccy. In fact probably very, very close when including distribution losses and battery charging losses.

Cement works are responsible for significant CO2 emissions.
BQENDThe link you had on that text is faulty. Will this do?
Wikipedia - Environmental impact of concrete
""The concrete industry is one of two largest producers of carbon dioxide (CO2), creating up to 5% of worldwide man-made emissions of this gas, of which 50% is from the chemical process and 40% from burning fuel.[1] The carbon dioxide CO2 produced for the manufacture of one tonne of structural concrete (using ~14% cement) is estimated at 410 kg/m3 (~180 kg/tonne @ density of 2.3 g/cm3) (reduced to 290 kg/m3 with 30% fly ash replacement of cement).""
Which is a carbon footprint worth paying at least while we are using concrete to build up the infrastructure of a low carbon economy.
BQSTART
BECCS , in theory, can be carbon negative.
BQENDWell why didn't you just type this in the first place?
""BECCS (Bio-Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage) is a technology that integrates biomass systems with geological carbon storage.""
Tacking the CCS fraud onto biomass ruins it. With friends like BECCS, biomass doesn't need any enemies.

Biochar is an alternative avoiding gas reservoirs.
BQENDBiochar is climate friendly. Like I said above -
BQSTART
The only kind of Carbon Capture and Storage which should be considered ""climate friendly"" is when the carbon is captured as carbon or carbonate (solid) but not as carbon dioxide (gas)

The problem with your conspiracy theory about deliberately leaking CO2 is that it would be picked up from locally stationed monitoring detectors
BQENDLocally stationed monitoring detectors can be corrupted locally too just like the local police and local government can be corrupted in places where they grow the plants to make the drugs that are a mainstay of the local economy.

and independently from the CO2 satellite sensors starting to be deployed to monitor national GHG commitments.
BQEND
Carbon dioxide which is leaking from seabed injection wells or from fractures in the reservoir geology will
dissolve in the seawater making satellite detection a non-starter.
For CCS sites leaking into shallow holomictic seas, the mixing sea water will eventually transport the carbon dioxide from the sea bed to the surface where it will diffuse into the atmosphere in a dispersed way that will be impossible to pinpoint the culprit leaking CCS site.
For CCS sites leaking into deep meromictic seas, the carbon dioxide will accumulate in the cold sea depths seemingly without a problem until when many years in the future, those layers become saturated with carbon dioxide when further leaking and bubbling up of CO2 or some other disturbance may set off a limnic eruption which is a catastrophic release of all the ""stored"" CO2 at once, with lethal consequences not to mention exposing the folly of CCS even to non-scientists.
BQSTART
It also presupposes that all those involved in CCS are out to pull a fast one and are homicidally disingenuous.

The most important aspect of the UK government’s new clean growth strategy is its unequivocal statement that tackling climate change and a prosperous economy are one and the same thing.
This has been clear to many for some time, including Philip Hammond, if not his predecessor George Osborne. There is no long-term, high-carbon economic strategy because the impacts of unchecked climate change destroy economies, as Lord Nicholas Stern puts it.
But the Conservative party has long been swinging between the green dream and fossil-fuelled fantasies. David Cameron went from pledging the “greenest government ever” to dismissing the “green crap” in three years. Recent years have seen one green policy shredded after another, destroying confidence among the businesses we need to deliver a low-carbon economy.
The new strategy published on Thursday signals a new, if belated, beginning. It is the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel age: it is highly notable that the government plan omits any mention of fracking, having previously been its cheerleader.
The government had to produce this plan under its own climate laws to explain how it will get on track to meet the nation’s legally binding carbon targets in 2030 and beyond. But ministers have rightly made a virtue of the plan’s necessity.
The proposals themselves are ambitious but lack concrete suggestions in many areas. However, ambition always precedes action and there are plenty of groups, not least the government’s official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, who will hold ministers to account.
If the government’s efforts to cut emissions from buildings have been slow, it is now taking seriously the need to address energy efficiency. Energy that isn’t used – negawatts – are by far the cheapest way to cut both emissions and energy bills. But as the vast failure of the green deal showed, efficiency is hard to make happen and it is here where firm plans are most urgently needed.
Along with heating, transport also needs urgent action – emissions here have been rising. There is plenty in the new plan to harness the surging market for electric vehicles, though little of it is new. Ministers have also once again failed to explain how expanding aviation with Heathrow’s third runway fits with its climate change plan.
Electric cars will need clean power and the UK’s electricity grid is already greening fast – coal power has fallen from 40% to 2% in the last five years. The new plan rightly builds on the UK’s success in dramatically driving down the cost of offshore wind power, yet it all but ignores an even cheaper source – onshore wind. It seems that even the conviction that the green economy is the UK’s future is not enough to face down the rural Tory-voting minority who continue to tilt at windmills. Solar power also seems destined to suffer the same fate.
Despite looking these gift horses in the mouth, and ignoring tidal power, the plan promises yet more cash for those with their snouts in the nuclear trough. The hyper-expensive Hinkley Point farce has not dulled the appetite for more new nuclear power and it intends to plough by far the biggest sum of its innovation funding into the one energy technology where costs are always rising.
But the biggest worry is the very limited support for carbon capture and storage, the technology that takes emissions from fossil fuels and buries them under the ground. CCS is seen as absolutely vital by the Committee on Climate Change, the National Audit Office and the UN’s climate science panel and the UK’s emptying North Sea fields are perfectly placed carbon reservoirs. But CCS gets only about a quarter of the investment of nuclear and just a tenth of the £1bn promised in the plan so abruptly canned by Osborne in 2015.
Trees are natural carbon stores and the new plan pledges to “establish a new network of forests in England, including new woodland on farmland”, which offers a tantalising glimpse of the radical change to farm subsidies that may follow Brexit. But there is no mention of the reduction in meat consumption deemed essential in beating global warming by scientists.
However, while many of the details are missing, the clean growth strategy marks an important and vital step forward for the UK. As the prime minister Theresa May says in the plan’s foreword: “Clean growth is not an option, but a duty we owe to the next generation. Success in this mission will improve our quality of life and increase our economic prosperity.” The strategy is now crystal clear – it is time to deliver.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/12/uk-climate-change-masterplan-grownups-finally-won-clean-growth-strategy

Let us be clear, I started this thread with a comment which was factually correct which you disagreed with.
I have shown the primary source as to what our ratification means in terms of international treaty.
I also explained exactly what I meant. Now you are making an ""appeal to authority"" to the CCC which I linked to the document which would take precedent as to what their view over Paris was and doesn't agree with how you characterise their opinion.
In addition, it includes claims that are not supportable by the best science out there. But from your unlinked source for the CCC what is stated is:
BQSTART
""UK action on climate change is based on the 2008 Climate Change Act. The Act is a piece of domestic legislation implemented by the UK Parliament as a contribution to global efforts to prevent dangerous climate change. Those global efforts have been reinforced, and increased, following the Agreement reached in Paris in 2015. The Act stands irrespective of the UK’s membership of the EU and as such its main targets and overal l approach remain. ""
BQEND
This is the basis of their statement about Brexit having no effect. But the international treaty unlike the CCA would have had actual legal force prior to 2050. 
In fact Theresa May circumvented the amendment in 2009 which updated the CCA when she abolished the DECC. Which raises even more legal questions. 
The CCC continue as if the act is legally binding which is probably appropriate but it absolutely is not as far as meeting budgets is concerned.

I thought we were talking about whether Brexit meant suddenly the UK loses any commitment under Paris.
BQEND
We are debating both points. But what I think you fail to realise is that the UK's INDC requires zero extra emission reductions.
Your secondary sources don't state otherwise and have inaccuracies to boot. We started to talk about Paris in detail BTL from the draft text was first available prior to its press release.
If you look at what the UK signed up to it was to agree to the EU terms. Which are 40% below the 1990 level. The UK is already claiming to have done this.
Therefore, unless you are predicting an increase in emissions then it has no legal force. Our contribution to a Green fund remain but this too was rebranded,
BQSTART
We haven't submitted an INDC. We didn't need to.
BQEND
Yes we did, it falls under the EUs heading. But that is our submitted INDC without one we could not have been a signatory. We could have added our own voluntary INDC which was in excess of the separate EU INDC but didn't.
I fully understand everything to do with the INDCs. 
The CCC are a very mixed bag when it comes to information over climate change. For starters, their budgets have no legal force but they like to pretend that the UK government will meet them.
If you want the full equivocation to the Paris agreement by the CCC it is given here:
https://www.theccc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/UK-climate-action-following-the-Paris-Agreement-Committee-on-Climate-Change-October-2016.pdf
They might use things that are suggested elsewhere but it doesn't make it right. For example they mistakenly work on the basis that BECCS is carbon negative, it is not. 
The key sentence is buried in the introduction which states:
""We currently have no scenario for how the UK can achieve net zero emissions""
The question is: ""why not?""
BTW his is including their magic -ve CO2 despite being sources ideas.
They speculate for about 10 pages about what the implied section about 1.5C would mean which never actually was pledged meaningfully but fair enough. But they state that they don't know what that means.
At the end of chapter 1: they finally state what I said which is that the only way the UK is signed up is to the aforementioned 40% by 1990. They assume that their budget will be enough to exceed this so no change is given.
There is no mention of the UK's consumption index figures either.
And while we will meet the INDCs the report states:
""The Committee’s assessment in our 2016 Progress Report was that current policies would at best deliver around half of the emissions reductions required to 2030, with no current policies to address the other half. ""

When we enquired about redoing all our huge sash windows with double glazed ones, the lady at the council had a fit of the vapours. We have no wall cavities--built in 1903, have ourselves insulated the roof, every gap in the house is stuffed with various forms of draught exclusion--any other suggestions? In our late 70s--we heat 2 rooms only
BQEND
I live in a listed property in a conservation area, with single-glazed windows, brick walls almost two feet thick and modern, gas-fired central heating. I used only to heat rooms twice a day - the classic set up - and nearly expired from cold, not to mention wake up each morning to windows and walls covered with condensation. One day I could not take it any more so did some research on the internet about how to fix condensation and I tried a new course.
These days I have the central heating on all day long, extremely low. Several windows are opened a couple of millimetres to make a tiny air vent. The result has been transformative: the house stays at a steady 20-21 degrees; I get no condensation to speak of any more; and I warm. Bizarrely my heating bills have plummeted. I'm clearly using far less gas than in the days when the heating was on high twice a day. This new draught-sealing advice from the govt, in my view, is as disaster-in-waiting for old houses.

houses need to breathe to prevent damp
BQEND
Building physics is a lot more complex than that simplistic statement. Houses need to be designed and upgraded in such a way that air, heat and moisture movement are all correctly managed. They all affect each other, so you have to consider all three together.
The best way to treat most houses is external insulation and internal airtightness, with vapour permeability preferably everywhere, but otherwise impermeable layers on the inside. It's very easy to get this right. Internal insulation is more complicated because it leaves the structure cold, so humidity levels in said structure have to be lower.
The idea that the only way to make houses that work is the 19th century 'very draughty, no insulation' scheme is nonsense.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1507830310000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'it leaves the structure cold', u'effect': u'internal insulation is more complicated so humidity levels in said structure have to be lower'}], u'author_id': u'4307215', u'in_reply_to': u'106672940', u'id': u'106696769', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'RonanPt', u'text': u'Hard to judge whether MVHR is, like EVs, selling a problem (extra electricity consumption) as a solution (saving electricity).

The long-delayed blueprint for how the UK will hit its binding target of cutting emissions by 57% by 2032 includes about 50 policies supporting everything from low-carbon power and energy savings to electric vehicles and keeping food waste out of landfill.
Big winners in the 164-page Clean Growth Strategy include offshore windfarm developers, which will be guaranteed a further £550m of subsidies. Experts believe that could more than double the UK’s existing offshore wind capacity. 
Energy efficiency for businesses and householders is at the heart of the plan, which the government was required to publish under the Climate Change Act.
There is an aspiration that all houses will be brought up to the minimum of energy band C by 2035, but how that will be achieved is not spelled out. Existing schemes to improve insulation will be extended until 2028.
New nuclear power stations are encouraged, but they will only go ahead if developers can do so at competitive prices. Solar power was given tentative support, while onshore windfarms won partial backing.
The business secretary, Greg Clark, compared the changes under way in energy today to the big changes wrought by the UK’s first coal power station in 1882.
“This government has put clean growth at the heart of its industrial strategy to increase productivity, boost people’s earning power and ensure Britain continues to lead the world in efforts to tackle climate change,” he said, launching the plan at the Olympic Park in east London. 
Green campaigners, industry groups and businesses mostly welcomed the plan but said it needed more ambition and lacked detail in some areas.
Robert Gross, the director of the Centre for Energy Policy and Technology at Imperial College London, said the politics of the strategy were key, and showed the greener wings of the Tory party had won out.
“In 2015 the government started hacking and slashing at all manner of green policies. This has stopped, and that’s very welcome,” he said.
Richard Black, the director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank, echoed that view. He said the strategy showed a “sea change” in “top-line thinking about the low carbon economy”, with Theresa May’s government seeing it as an opportunity rather than a cost as it was viewed under David Cameron.
Claire Perry, the climate minister, said May’s foreword to the plan was important and showed how seriously the government was taking it.
Asked if the strategy showed green-minded Tories were winning out after a slew of climate programmes were axed by the Conservatives in 2015, she said: “This isn’t about factions winning, it’s about getting on with capturing the opportunity [for business].”
She told the Guardian: “This is doubling down on the green ambition, actually saying we see the economic benefit from doing this.”
The minister said there would be a new “triple test” for whether the government backed clean technologies. They would have to maximise the amount emissions come down; show they can become cheaper in the future; and be an area in which the UK could lead the world.
She said a proposed £1.3bn tidal lagoon at Swansea – which an independent government review backed in January but on which government has yet to signal its view – would have to pass that test.
New policies included a green light for onshore windfarms on remote Scottish islands being allowed to compete for subsidies. The move was welcomed by Orkney and companies including SSE, which plans a windfarm on Shetland, jointly owned with the community.
There is also £100m of funding for research on carbon capture and storage (CCS). However, that is a fraction of the £1bn government competition on the technology that was cut two years ago.
The plan is also scant on any detail of how the UK will cut emissions from heating, talking instead of simply exploring the best options. Low-carbon alternatives to gas include electrification via heat pumps, or using greener gases such as hydrogen.
Many of the ideas in the strategy have already been announced, such as phasing out petrol and diesel cars by 2040 and £246m to develop batteries for cars and energy systems.
Despite the wide-ranging policies, the strategy concedes that the UK is still not on track to meet its legally binding carbon targets for the late 2020s and early 2030s. The government noted it had ‘flexibilities’ on meeting the targets under the Climate Change Act, but might not need to use them.
The Committee on Climate Change, the UK’s statutory climate advisers, welcomed the strategy but warned ministers against using the law’s flexibilities in meeting its carbon targets. “This should not be the plan,” said Lord Deben, the group’s chairman. The authority will pass its verdict in January after analysing the plan.
Campaign group ClientEarth said it was weighing its options, given the legal requirement for government to close the gap.
Jonathan Church, a lawyer at the group, said: “The UK government is still in breach of the Climate Change Act. The UK is on course to miss its 2023-27 emissions reductions targets by 116MtCO2e – equivalent to more than the Philippines’ emissions in a whole year – and the clean growth strategy does not fix this.”
The Green party said the strategy was a missed opportunity. Caroline Lucas, the party’s co-leader, said: “Government has blown this enormous opportunity to put Britain on track to meet its climate target.”
Other observers, including the London School of Economics, said the broad thrust of the strategy was good, but it was too vague. The union Prospect said there were “still too many unanswered questions”.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/12/uk-puts-energy-efficiency-at-heart-of-climate-change-strategy

In winter lucky to get 100 miles. And in winter – no heating!
To suggest, as some ignorant people have, that electric cars ‘emit no CO2’ is absurd because the power stations that charge them do. To charge an electric vehicle (such as a Tesla), just once, requires the burning of 43 kilogram of coal.
A petrol car will require about 20 kilogram of petrol for the same distance. It follows that the electric car is emitting more than twice the CO2 of a petrol car.
Here are the sums:
Drax uses about 0.31 kilogram of coal per KWhr generated.
1 A Tesla battery is rated at 70 KWhr and fast charging is only 50% efficient. It will need 140 KWhr of electricity for a single charge; this works out as about 43 kilogram (0.31 × 140) of coal for a full charge.
The cost of electricity for the range available in a Tesla—200 miles in summer; 100 miles in winter—works out at £22.50. The petrol for 200 miles costs very little more and most of that cost is tax (currently about 60%) – about £28. In winter, for 100 miles, the petrol costs just £15.
During trials between 1927-30 of British steam locomotives a typical result was that, for a 500 ton express train, coal was consumed at the rate of 20 kg per mile.
2 Over 200 miles therefore 4000 kg was consumed. Scaling down to a 2 ton car: 4000÷250=16 kg coal. Even allowing for economies of scale, compare this to the 43 kg required by a Tesla.
Further issues
Battery cycling – the deterioration of the capacity of a lithium battery with charging – must be allowed for, costing about £3 per cycle.3 Fire: even small lithium batteries are liable to catch ﬁre or even explode, releasing deadly toxins such as COS, HF, CO.
4 The huge dangers for occupants in event of an accident are obvious. Firehoses would only exacerbate the problem, causing electrocution of victims.
5 This has already happened: www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/richard-hammond-switzerland-car-crash-10599134
WeightThe Tesla battery weighs 800kg—that’s nearly a ton—equivalent to 10 people. Battery/petrol equivalent weight ratio—in summer 50:1, in winter 100:1.
Further hazards
In winter, in severe conditions, electric cars become death traps. Firstly, the battery power halves every ten degree drop in temperature, so you are likely to get stuck in a snowstorm. Then there will be no heating in the car and a blizzard outside. You will freeze to death inside and, outside the car, you may die seeking help. This would not happen in a petrol car. A petrol car’s engine remains at full power down to the last drop of petrol and has plenty of heating. The electric car loses power almost immediately as the battery drains—and has no heating.
As most of the numpties, who think electric cars are viable, live in towns the above point doubtless passes them by, but the huge potential for trafﬁc clogging due to ‘dead’ electric vehicles has not been considered
6 , nor has the issue of time to recharge. Currently an average petrol car takes about 5 minutes to ﬁll up with petrol, pay and depart. If an electric car takes a minimum of 75 minutes to recharge, the queues are going to be astronomical and the time wasted also astronomical.
The BBC tried to take an electric car from London to Edinburgh. It took more than three days, slower than a stagecoach. Strangely, people sometimes need to get to places quickly.
In case anyone thinks that there is a miracle battery just over the horizon, I can absolutely assure him or her that there is not. Battery technology is mature, and, to quote Mr David Hume, “Miracles do not happen.” (at least in technology). Just where is all this power to come from anyway? The Climate Change Act requires that by 2045 all gas heating be replaced by electric heating and all cars be electric.
Besides the stupidity of turning huge amounts of electricity back into heat, clearly no one in government has done the maths. The results are horrendous!
Electric HGVs anyone?
Drax power station in Yorkshire 4 gigaWatt = 4,000,000 kiloWatt
17 million gas using households @ 30kW (to replace gas boiler) 17 million chargers for electric cars @ 8kW 38kW
Were these to be run on biomass (woodchips) as 50% of Drax already is, Plus we will need to dig up every street to lay much bigger cables. (assuming only one car per household) all needed at peak domestic demand (5pm-10pm): 38kW × 17,000,000 = 646,000,000 kW ÷ 4,000,000 = 160 Drax sized power stations this would consume, annually, the total annual timber harvest of the USA!

There, just as informative and deep as your post.
I see the new Tesla will do 560 kilometers on a charge, that takes 45 minutes and will be offered free at cafes and fast food outlets. Also electric cars have far far fewer moving parts than a internal combustion engine vehicle, which means far less maintenance, far far less. Also it is $70 grand, which seems a lot, but factor in a tank of fuel at about $70 per week, over one year at $3,650, over 10 years $36,650.

Now in the ABC article there is talks of using a battery but a Reposite scheme is set up so the grid can use the battery storage at peak times. So this system develops electricity credits so you can use power at another time and not get charged for it.
There is no doubt about it since solar produces a lot of power in summer, the set up of storage like pumped hydro is the way to go to store summer solar power output.
When a home solar system is set up if batteries are to be part of it the solar system has to be big so when winter hits the solar system is big enough to power the house as well as charge the battery, when there is low solar production due to short daylight sun hours.

Australians remain deeply reluctant to buy electric cars, which accounted for just 0.1% of new car sales in 2015. Australia is increasingly falling behind other countries, particularly in Europe, where sales of electric cars represented 1.2% of new European Union car sales in the same year.
In Norway, electric vehicles made up 22.8% of new car sales, thanks largely to a suite of financial and policy incentives. Electric cars are allowed to use Norwegian bus and taxi lanes, pay no parking fees and are exempt from road tolls, VAT and registration charges.
 Drivers in France are given a rebate for low-emitting cars and charged an extra fee for high-polluting vehicles. France’s scheme reduced average carbon emissions for a new car from 149 grams per kilometre in 2007, a year before the policy was introduced, to 114g in 2014. In the same year the average for a new car in Australia was 188g.
The Australia Institute, in a report released on Friday, warned Australia risked becoming a “laggard” on electric cars by international standards. Australia offered “disappointingly few” incentives for buyers of electric cars, the report said, and lacked proper battery charging infrastructure. 
Trials of electric vehicles in state government fleets were too small to produce meaningful results, the report said. Victoria used only 54 electric or hybrid cars between 2010 and 2014, in an overall fleet of 4.5m vehicles in the state.
“Electric vehicles promise benefits to both consumers and governments,” the report said. “Nonetheless, the market for electric vehicles remains underdeveloped and progress has been slow.
“Australia’s electric vehicle market is, by international standards, a laggard. This is in no small part due to a lack of public investment in establishing the conditions necessary for growth.”
The Australia Institute said it had conducted its own survey showing majority support for policy incentives to encourage the uptake of electric vehicles.
The report recommends exempting electric vehicles from the luxury car tax, which applies to more expensive types of electric cars, including the Tesla Model S. It also calls for tax breaks to build a “visible, densely distributed network” of charging stations, to ease consumer concerns about being left stranded with a flat battery.
“The development of this network requires careful management,” the report said. “Left unregulated, there is a risk that competing technology standards cannibalise the EV market.”
Australia should also allow a Norwegian-style scheme to allow electric cars access to bus lanes, although such a perk should be time-limited to avoid congestion as the uptake of electric vehicles grows, the report said. 
The measure would also require number plates that identify cars as electric. It should only apply to all-electric vehicles, the report said, to reduce congestion in bus lanes. 
The report also recommended adopting a carbon pricing scheme, similar to that operating in France, which made cleaner cars cheaper to buy.

Great article. However, in my opinion you are forgetting one big thing here. China is about to have an ETS (before the end of the year). This means that our food, iron, aluminium etc will become globally uncompetitive unless we switch to a lower emissions economy. The businesses know this and will start to act (unless of course they simply decide to shut their doors). In that world, which is only a few months away, it won’t matter whether we have a carbon price or not. Anyone who is trade exposed to China (ie, just about everyone) will be paying a carbon price in some form anyway. Then it won’t matter whether Tony Abbott is in charge or Humphrey Bear. I’m optimistic that the businesses will start to take the lead on this, and then investment will follow. Political leadership will be replaced by companies who need to address carbon liability for their shareholders. It’s already happening as I’m sure you know.Cheers for a great article.

Actually it started with wicked wind farms in South Australia, but there really is only so much torture I can inflict on you this weekend, so I’ll spare you that particular recap, which now feels about a century ago.
BQEND The decline started in January 2016 not the October storms.
Sure it got worse in October 2016 but in December 2015 - January 2016 most of us saw the decline of the conservative vote. Ian Macfarlane defected from the liberals to the Nats, Joe Hockey gets job as ambassador to US, Mal Brough stands aside, then we learned about Jamie Briggs and a late-night bar scandal in Hong Kong. 
Peter Dutton was apologising for a ""mad f***ing witch"" text message.
Turnbull was trying to innovate us all and ignore all of the above by hiding in the Gentlemans club as often as possible.

Let’s look forward.
BQEND During October 2016 it was clear the Liberal party vote slump directly after the July election was not a small hiccup.
BludgerTrack: 52.0-48.0 to Labor
Seat projection on 2PP then was...Coalition - 66 ALP - 79
From October 2016 - February 2017 the SA Blackout raged, the ""Blame Labor"" - ""Coal is Great"" period I call it.
In February 2017 Morrison brought a lump of coal in our peoples representative house to taunt Labor and try and score points after months of blaming Labor for once in 100 years storms to the Apocalypse.
The reward for that was a 55-45 Newspol result.
Turnbull's bedwetters finally saw a problem, time for drastic action... Snowy Hydro 2.0 was born along with more Malcolm 2.0's ghosting policies (in name only) from the very party they were telling us and are still telling us... are not fit to govern.
Then there is now.
BludgerTrack: 53.9-46.1 to Labor
The graph tells the story.
Seat projection on 2PP is now...Coalition - 57 ALP - 88
The entire period is there in the graph, a graph that continues to climb.
Where will it end up? Around ALP 90 seats permanently until 2019.
That is not a government that is governing for the people.
Groundhog day? The Liberals are learning the lesson ALP did, it does not matter what leader you have and how many times you swap them... you have to have policies that make people vote for you.

On 12/10/2017 the peak load was 24138 MW; minimum load was 17960 MW. That is a 26% variation that need to be considered for Grid Design. This variation will control the level of renewable power that is possible to be install in the and the level of synchronous generation to maintain a stable Grid.

Let’s start with a little quote from Andrew Bolt circa 2009: 
“What I want is for people, it’s the emperor’s new clothes thing. I want people to see that the emperor has new clothes. If Tim Flannery can go on the ABC TV and say, whoops the theory isn’t working, the world is not warming, it’s actually cooling, then even you have to say, gosh, why are we then doing this massive tax that wouldn’t stop global warming even if it’s true and will cost a lot of people their jobs? Why don’t you ask that?”
Ok, that wasn’t the quote I was going to use, but I found it while looking for his piece about how it’s not heat that kills people, it’s cold. I thought the above quote reveals a lot about poor Andrew’s understanding of things. He desperately wants the people to “see that the emperor has NEW clothes”! Which is rather unfortunate, because if you remember the fairy tale, the whole point is that the emperor has NO clothes ...

The reason for Friday’s startle reflex is, of course, the return of the federal parliament for the blockbuster spring session next week.
The reasons for the period of suspended animation before the startle reflex are also obvious.
All the controversial issues the government has been spinning its wheels on for months, or warily circling, will hit between now and Christmas.
The high court will determine the fate of the various dual citizens, and then, the public, potentially at least, depending on the decision, will determine the fate of the Turnbull government’s one-seat majority in the lower house.
The public will also chart a course on same-sex marriage. Assuming a yes vote, given that seems to be the general direction of the public opinion polls, the Liberal party will then have to indulge one more round of handwringing about religious freedom before the parliament has its say.
Then there’s energy, which will finally land next week.
It really is hard to overstate the contortions that have accompanied this debate, which started in its current iteration with the energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, floating and then killing an emissions trading scheme for electricity in the space of 24 hours, then rolling through to the creation of the Finkel review of the electricity market, then through the process of trying to land a clean energy target, which now seems to have been abandoned, at least in the form the chief scientist suggested it.
Actually it started with wicked wind farms in South Australia, but there really is only so much torture I can inflict on you this weekend, so I’ll spare you that particular recap, which now feels about a century ago.
Let’s look forward.
On current indications, this is what will happen when the federal parliament resumes next week: the energy policy will go to cabinet, then to the Coalition party room, and if it doesn’t explode on impact in either of those places, pitching us into a whole new rodeo, it will then emerge for scrutiny by the world.
Assuming success, that the policy clears the various internal hurdles, the government will then fire up its good news machine, and bombard us all with its general magnificence, but obviously we need to ignore all that, and keep a laser-like focus on the central issues.
Next week, when we all get to making judgments about whether or not the government’s energy policy is reasonable (assuming the default unreasonableness that exists in the Coalition any time climate change is mentioned doesn’t consume it before take-off) – we need to look closely at the fundamentals.
Australia’s energy sector is operating in an environment where there is no future investment certainty because there is continuing carbon risk.
If carbon risk is a new concept for you, it just means the risk of a future government suddenly implementing serious policies aimed at reducing emissions to try to head off the worst climate-change scenario.
That ongoing policy uncertainty has a price impact. Unless the new government investment framework explicitly addresses carbon risk, the price pressure in the system – the one we all feel through our nasty, nasty, power bills – will continue to be a problem.
One way to deal with carbon risk would be to adopt the clean energy target proposed by the chief scientist Alan Finkel.
A clean energy target is certainly not the only way to address carbon risk. In fact, many people (me included) would say there are much better ways of addressing carbon risk than a clean energy target. Unfortunately the Coalition has ruled most of the sensible alternative options out.
The government may well come at the carbon problem, at the task of lowering emissions, by setting a reduction trajectory, giving more money to the existing Emissions Reduction Fund and adjusting the existing safeguard mechanism (two features of the existing Direct Action climate policy), and allowing the use of international permits.
But if that’s the broad approach, depending how it’s structured, it could well be tokenistic.
If the policy response is tokenistic – tokenistic enough, say, to subdue Tony Abbott, and the conservatives he speaks for in this wretched debate – it will not actually reduce carbon risk, which is what drives investment uncertainty, and pushes up energy prices.
The government will have fixed a problem, but fixed it in the style of Christopher Pyne’s now infamous “fixing”, as in no fix at all – as in a fix that makes people in the real world, outside the strange retro hothouse of the Coalition party room, actually laugh out loud, out of nervous despair, rather than hilarity.
To cut a long story short, the government will have produced a policy that clears the party room, but fails in the court of public opinion. Quite a risk that, given its electoral buffer, as we’ve noted, is a distance short of huge.
There is one other reason to want Finkel’s clean energy target, and it’s this.
The advantage of a clean energy target as a mechanism (as opposed to other means of lowering greenhouse gas emissions that may well be included in the government policy) is it had a prospect of securing a bipartisan consensus.
The lack of bipartisan consensus is a big problem in climate and energy policy, not just a minor inconvenience.
To understand this, you just have to stick with carbon risk, and push your mind through the various steps that would follow the government producing a policy that Labor can’t support.
I know people inside the Coalition who equate public life with bar brawling see opportunity in having another zero sum bout with Labor – but standing on the fringes of the big stupid-off are a bunch of serious corporate interests who have to make decisions very quickly about new energy infrastructure, and a bunch of businesses that might well go to the wall if power prices keep rising.
If Labor rejects the Coalition’s energy fix, then we have another brutally contested election, followed by a new government.
Let’s stick with the current poll trend and speculate that the new government might be a Labor government. (You saw the might in that sentence, right?)
Let’s say then that prime minister Shorten tries to navigate a climate and energy policy through a parliament where the Coalition is led by Peter Dutton, or let’s just pull a name out of a hat, Tony Abbott.
In those circumstances, an outbreak of carbon peace seems unlikely, unless the Coalition has just suffered a major electoral bout, which results in someone in team centre-right twigging to the fact that governing for the nervous sensibilities of Andrew Bolt doesn’t really win you elections.
But pushing on with our basic thought exercise, let’s assume in the next parliament that the Coalition again refuses to implement a climate policy that actually does anything.
Then we are back with a Labor government, trying to get a policy through the parliament, with the Greens driving a hard bargain, which sounds a lot like Groundhog Day, and a Groundhog Day that doesn’t settle anything for the energy sector, because they just need to get off this damn roundabout.
They need a policy that won’t be ripped up at the next election.
They need this stupidity to stop.
So does the country.
In fact, we needed that at least a decade ago.
So the question Malcolm Turnbull faces next week is much bigger than the bobble head preoccupations: who won or lost, who had the best line, who had the best tactics.
Our prime minister needs to look the country in the eye and answer this, very simple, question: are you the political leader who can deliver what Australia needs?",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/14/failure-to-act-now-on-energy-policy-will-only-trigger-groundhog-day

David Keith, a solar geoengineering (GE) expert at Harvard University has said there is a real danger that his work could be exploited by those who oppose action on emissions, at the same time as he defended himself and colleagues from the claims GE strengthens the argument for abandoning the targets set by the Paris climate agreement. 
“One of the main concerns I and everyone involved in this have, is that Trump might tweet ‘geoengineering solves everything – we don’t have to bother about emissions.’ That would break the slow-moving agreement among many environmental groups that sound research in this field makes sense,” Keith said on the sidelines of the Climate Engineering Conference (CEC) in Berlin. 
Indeed, utterances from people in or close to the Trump administration – most notably GE proponent secretary of state Rex Tillerson, who has referred to climate change as “just an engineering problem” – make it clear they either tacitly or directly support the idea of climate engineering.
Earlier this year, Keith, a professor of applied physics at Harvard announced plans to conduct an outdoor trial into stratospheric aerosol injection, involving launching a high-altitude balloon that will spray a small quantity of reflective particles into the stratosphere. Keith believes the experiment may help to measure the feasibility and risks involved in GE, an umbrella term for a range of techniques to deliberately adjust the climate in an effort to mitigate global warming.
They include reflecting sunlight from space, adding huge quantities of lime or iron to the oceans, pumping deep cold nutrient-rich waters to the surface of oceans and irrigating vast swaths of desert to grow trees.
Supporters of research into geoengineering argue that its techniques – roughly-speaking divided into carbon dioxide removal (CDR, or negative emission technologies) which removes greenhouse gases, and solar-radiation management (SRM or solar geoengineering) which reduces the amount of solar energy warming the planet – could help to lessen some of the consequences of climate change. However, the common consensus is that the techniques should be used in addition to reductions in CO2 emissions.
This week’s conference drew attention to the huge risks involved.
“All the techniques being proposed have potentially severe environmental impacts,” said Silvia Ribeiro of the ETC Group, leading campaign monitors of new technologies and their possible impact on the world’s poorest. 
“They also ignore the question as to why there’s not enough political will to have done more to tackle climate change until now and they in turn serve to justify the inaction,” she added.
Concerns focus on techniques such as stratospheric aerosol injection, which some experts say has the potential to reduce the amount of rain from Asian and African monsoons and could have a devastating impact on the food supply of billions of people. Aerosol injection also has the potential to reduce the ozone layer and heighten the risk of exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Other possible side effects of GE may be an increase in ocean acidification, a change in weather patterns, a rapid rise in temperatures, and a huge uptake in the use of agricultural land, all of which could prompt mass migration of millions of climate change refugees.

But scientists such as Keith, and Mark Lawrence, scientific director of the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS) in Potsdam, argue that with the Paris agreement goals to limit temperature rise to two degrees or less, almost impossible to achieve, the world has little choice than to thoroughly explore technical intervention and the potential it has to avoid global disaster.
“It will be very difficult to achieve the Paris agreement calls without some form of climate engineering,” Lawrence said. “It’s not impossible, but it’s hard to imagine we would make the major changes in our infrastructure and lifestyles in the time necessary.” 
Keith also dismissed the view that climate engineers like himself were on a mission to prove that climate engineering worked at all costs, or else see the importance of decades of their life’s work evaporate.
“At the best climate engineering is a supplement, and it could be that we shouldn’t do it,” he insisted. “Our work is to inform better choices and it would actually be very useful to know for sure it didn’t work. Right now there are heads of state and others in leadership who are explicitly assuming it could work, that it’s there if we need it. But let’s say we found something deep in the climate models which suggested we were overoptimistic about solar geoengineering, then I would say ‘abandon it’. That would be great. I’d love to publish that.”

Your citation hand-waves the seasonal death variation away as perhaps influenza related, ignoring the reality that winter influenzas tend to kill more people than summer influenzas.

What's not to like? So what do generators do? They build more renewable supply and take coal off line because the subsidy/market dynamic has pushed up the unit cost of each MWh.However, Australia has a baseload demand of about 20,000 MW which are required 24/7. That demand cannot be supplied from renewables at the reliability demanded by consumers, but resolving that issue is not the responsibility of the generators and AEMO has no authority to force them to keep power stations open.Exactly this dilemma has hit South Australia already and their solution is to (a) rely more heavily on coal power from Victoria (which is itself more reluctant to provide that power) and (b) build a fossil fuel power station at the taxpayers' expense, because no one else wants to build one.Maybe Jay Weatherill thought about building a 1,000 MW renewable plant for that baseload, but that would be unthinkably expensive. For example, to build a hybrid solar / pumped hydro plant to provide 1,000 MW on a continuous 24/7 basis you would have to build a solar plant with a capacity of at least 4,500 MW alongside a 1,000 MW pumped hydro scheme. Eyewatering expense! Hence my statement:

Money better spent on, either providing a new renewable 'leg up', or toward a generator already up and running to expand and add storage.Let AGL get on with pushing their own barrow, why on earth subside them to do something that's clearly unprofitable?

Overall, bad news for onion enthusiasts and thus Tony. However, if he moves back to UK, there could be more onions in northwest Europe and fewer in southeast Europe. 
For determinate crops such as onions, warming will reduce the duration of crop growth and hence yield (Harrison et al., 1995b), whereas warming stimulates growth and yield in indeterminate crops such as carrots (Wheeler et al., 1996). Onion yields are sensitive to the degree of warming (Harrison et al., 1995b), with a yield decrease for warmer scenarios and a yield increase for cooler scenarios. There also is a spatial gradient, with yield increases in northwest Europe to decreases in southeast Europe.

There is no doubt that Abbott is loathed; his 2014 Budget was ideology based, and was an attack on those in the community unable to defend themselves. It displayed a lack of a fair go.As Opposition Leader and later as PM Abbott displayed no vision for Australia.
In relation to his climate change speech he presented views that have been debunked or have been cherry picked. While temperatures are going up; ironically, extreme cold weather events are being experienced. Hence it is more accurate to use the term ""climate change"" than ""global warming"".Oceans are taking up much warmth; the result being that storms that can be expected under normal circumstances are intensified through a climate change influence. Several quotes from climate scientists make such a point in relation to Harvey, Irma and Maria.
While the media concentrate on particular storms; the aftermath of storms gets little comment. Mould on walls being a huge health problem; lack of uncontaminated water being another, particularly in Puerto Rico. 
Over the last few years several hundred Indian farmers committed suicide as their crops failed due to drought.Exreme warmth, or flooding is also unhealthy for crops which leads to starvation. Catalyst, a ABC Science program highlighted the tens of thousands of people who died from heat stress earlier this century in one particularly bad season, Spain and Russia were particularly badly hit.
By equating cold with more deaths than warming does not take int account homelessness; a political/economic/ideological matter; rather than, climate change one.
The comment Abbott made about more people die from cold than heat does not stand up very well when taking other underlying features into account.

 His speech to the Global Warming Policy Foundation was a typical Abbott speech: a greatest hits of climate change denying canards that collapsed under its own lack of internal logic. 
It was redolent of the shallow conservative thinking that unfortunately dominates far too much Australian commentary – especially when it comes to climate change. 
They think climate change is a myth but it doesn’t matter because global warming will be good because, as Abbott put it, “far more people die in cold snaps than in heatwaves”. 
And as with most dull conservative thinking in Australia, it is a very European perspective that oddly would have you believe that Australia is located nearer to Austria than Asia. 
The idea that increased temperatures may have some positive aspect for colder parts of the world is neither new nor insightful. The 2006 Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change noted that, in higher latitudes, “cold-related deaths will decrease” as a result of warming . 
And if you stop there – as in effect Abbott did – all sounds good. But the report’s next sentence notes climate change will “increase worldwide deaths from malnutrition and heat stress”.
Climate change is much easier to stomach when you ignore the fate of a majority of the world’s population.
Abbott’s weird approach of viewing climate change as though we live in some snowbound country is the type of thinking that leads to the Carmichael coalmine despite a lack of financial viability and great environmental negatives. 
The Australian’s Paul Maley, for example, responded to Abbott’s speech in praise-worthy tones, suggesting it was “was a thoughtful speech that deserved to be taken seriously”. He suggested that Abbott raised many good questions but that “a richer vein would have been the inherent tension between poverty reduction and climate mitigation measures”.
He is right, but wrong in picking what that tension is. 
The argument offered by Maley is one that echoes Abbott and other conservatives such as Barnaby Joyce and Matt Canavan that industrialisation powers economic growth and thus it would be wrong for us to deny this to other nations. 
Maley argues that “this begs an awkward question: are we really opposed to climate change in all its forms? What if coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef is the price we must pay for affordable energy in south Asia? What if renewables, for all their promise, can’t provide the horsepower required to lift millions out of poverty?”
It is a line of thinking that writer Richard Cooke recently suggested to me involves shouting how Greenies want us to go back to horses and carts, while at the same time arguing that we can only ever use 19th century modes of power generation.
Not only will Australia suffer much more from climate change than just coral bleaching but the economies of south Asia are going to be hit harder than just about anywhere else. 
In a nice bit of timing, the day after Abbott’s speech, the IMF released its latest World Economic Outlook, which contained a chapter on the economic impact of climate change. 
The reported noted (much as the Stern review did) that climate change may actually have some positive economic affects for countries in colder parts of the world. 
The IMF noted rising temperatures have “uneven macroeconomic effects”. If you live in a place where the climate is colder, warmer temperatures may actually lead to increased crop production. 
But the report also notes that there will be “adverse consequences concentrated in countries with relatively hot climates, such as most low-income countries”.
The IMF argues that in these countries climate change will lead to lower per capita output, in both the short and medium term.
Even worse, they suggest the effect will be “long-lasting” and widespread. “[It] operates through several channels: lower agricultural output, depressed labour productivity in sectors more exposed to the weather, reduced capital accumulation and poorer human health”.
And just in case you were hoping the problem might be able to be mitigated, the IMF found that “data indicate that macroeconomic outcomes have not become any less sensitive to temperature shocks in recent years, pointing to significant adaptation constraints”.
That is, such countries are not going to be able to just adapt to the higher temperatures and carry on as before. 
It rather slaps down the faux altruistic excuse for supporting the Carmichael mine as being important to help India’s economy, given the IMF finds that India’s economy will be among those most affect by climate change. 
But while you might think it doesn’t really affect us, it is worth noting that when the IMF talks of economies with “relatively hot climates’ it refers to “117 economies with average temperature greater than 15°C.”
And among those 117 economies is a rather familiar island continent known as Australia. 
While the economic output of the southern parts near the coast of Australia are projected to be relatively unaffected, the IMF projects significant output per capita drops for the rest of Australia.
The agricultural areas will be hardest hit – something that you would think might worry the National party.
We need to shift from treating our nation as though its climate is that of Europe. We like to think our economy is linked with Asia more than Europe; our climate certainly is and we need to act accordingly.

PQE is too high risk

Current QE invites funds looking for a safe return to invest in the UK via bond purchase, for a guaranteed return. The funds released provide commercial banks with lending money to invest in private-asset building.

PQE would use the exact same vehicle (with a one-off seed capital transfer from the State) but the money raised would be lent to businesses that will undertake public works that benefit the UK: Broadband, transport and utilities, other infrastructure.

PQE will create productive employment, decreasing the precariat and increasing the tax-paying workforce, drive the increase in our skills base, creating a virtuous circle of reinvestment, improving the lives of all.

Well for the record I think it's a disgrace that so much wealth resides with so few and that vast amounts of money are placed offshore. I think too many tax loopholes favour the 'elites'
However I think that making spending promises based on taxing elites is fundamentally flawed...because what happens when society is fairer? It's a short term fix but We need a more sustainable economic model. We need to not be afraid of either nationalisation or the private sector but have a diverse mixed economy with enough regulation to stop crash...boom...crash cycles.
I think corbynism is fundamentally flawed, PQE is too high risk. Just as tories put all their eggs into the capitalist basked, labour would put all their eggs into the 'interventions it'd basket. 
I am happy to pay more taxes to fix our broken welfare system and social services. I can see the case for nationalising infrastructure. It's part of the 'enabling' role of a government.
I do respect your views. I accept they are different. I think you are being very unfair and rude to me. I don't like that. I wonder why there is so much hostility. I wonder if 'for the many. It the few' is actually divisive. I think it is.

But no, it’s not Trump",article,http://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/15/imf-corbyn-rich-tax-taxation-economy,0,"The International Monetary Fund has been on quite a journey from the days when it was seen as the provisional wing of the Washington consensus. These days the IMF is less likely to harp on about the joys of liberalised capital flows than it is to warn of the dangers of ever-greater inequality.
The fund’s latest foray into the realms of progressive economics came last week when it used its half-yearly fiscal monitor – normally a dry-as-dust publication – to make the case for higher taxes on the super-rich.
Make no mistake, this is a significant moment. For almost 40 years, since the arrival of Margaret Thatcher in Downing Street and Ronald Reagan in the White House, the economic orthodoxy on taxation has been that higher taxes for the 1% are self-defeating. Soaking the rich, it was said, would punish initiative and lead to lower levels of innovation, investment, growth and, therefore, reduced revenue for the state.
As the Conservative party conference showed, this line of argument is still popular. Minister after minister took to the stage to warn that Jeremy Corbyn’s tax plans would lead to a 1970s-style brain drain.
The IMF agrees that a return to the income tax levels seen in Britain during the 1970s would have an impact on growth. But that was when the top rate was 83%, and Corbyn’s plans are far more modest. Indeed, it is a sign of how difficult it has become to have a grown-up debate about tax that Labour’s call for a 50% tax band on those earning more than £123,000 and 45% for those earning more than £80,000 should be seen as confiscatory.
The IMF’s analysis does something to redress the balance, making two important points. First, it says that tax systems should have become more progressive in recent years in order to help offset growing inequality, but have actually become less so.
Second, it finds no evidence for the argument that attempts to make the rich pay more tax would lead to lower growth. There is nothing especially surprising about either of the IMF’s conclusions: in fact, the real surprise is that it has taken so long for the penny to drop.
Growth rates have not picked up as taxes have been cut for the top 1%. On the contrary, they are much weaker than they were in the immediate postwar decades, when the rich could expect to pay at least half their incomes – and often substantially more than half – to the taxman. If trickle-down theory worked, there would be a strong correlation between growth and countries with low marginal tax rates for the rich. There is no such correlation and, as the IMF rightly concludes, “there would appear to be scope for increasing the progressivity of income taxation without significantly hurting growth for countries wishing to enhance income redistribution”.
With a nod to the work of the French economist Thomas Piketty, the fiscal monitor also says that countries should consider wealth taxes for the rich, to be levied on land and property.
The IMF’s findings on tax provide ample and welcome political cover for Corbyn and John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, as they seek to convince voters that Labour’s tax plans are not just equitable but also economically workable. By contrast, the study challenges President Donald Trump to rethink tax plans that would give an average tax cut of more than $200,000 a year for someone earning more than $900,000. The response from the US administration was predictable: mind your own business.
The IMF is not naive. It knows it is one thing to make the case for higher taxes on the rich but another altogether to get governments to implement them, because better-off individuals have more political clout.
The argument that what is good for the super-rich is good for the rest of us has been demolished, but don’t expect the top 1% to give up without a fight.
Looking at Theresa May’s energy price cap for the answer to reining in your electricity and gas bills? Then you were watching the wrong government announcement last week.
The solution to making energy affordable lies not in the draft legislation for the cap, which is a short-term stopgap that will do nothing to make prices fairer in the long term, but in a climate change masterplan launched by ministers at the Olympic Park in London. While the clean growth strategy is short on detail for a 164-page tome, it should be praised for putting energy efficiency front and centre.
The plan’s bright idea is an aspiration to bring all homes in England and Wales up to a minimum of energy band C, by fitting new boilers, insulation and more efficient appliances. The potential savings on bills are enormous. Someone in an E-rated home would save £650 a year if it was overhauled to a C-rating. What’s missing are the sort of bold measures to make the aspiration a reality.
There are good reasons that people don’t both with insulation. “For some, energy efficiency measures’ upfront costs and hassle can be high. The payback period from lower energy bills can be longer than the time people expect to stay in their home,” the National Infrastructure Commission said this week.
As the commission pointed out, the market hasn’t delivered: so government intervention is needed. Ministers’ last attempt to kickstart improvements was a disaster, and the number of homes being made more efficient has plunged as a result. More radical policies are required to convince householders that energy efficiency is worthwhile – and fortunately there is no shortage of ideas.
Lower stamp duty for energy-efficient homes, discounts on council tax and allowing people to take out bigger mortgages on greener homes (an idea that government is exploring) have all been mooted. Such steps are a big ask because they would require the Treasury’s buy-in.
But the imperative for upgrading Britain’s leaky, draughty housing stock has never been greater.
The clean growth strategy admitted that the best way to cut the carbon emissions from heating our homes is not yet clear. That means the mundane but vital job of stopping our radiators’ warmth leaking out through our walls and lofts is more important than ever – not just for our wallets, but for the planet too.
Classic descriptions of financial bubbles usually describe the final pre-pop stage as the moment when the general public is attracted by the whiff of easy money. In the 21st century, we should not be surprised that social media and celebrity are also part of the story.
That is the context in which to view a tweet by football manager Harry Redknapp, which grabbed attention last week. “Proper excited about Mobile Cryptocurrency! I’m in, get involved!” he declared
Redknapp might have read the cryptocurrency warning from the Financial Conduct Authority that any investor backing an initial coin offering should be ready to lose the whole investment.
But it seems equally possible that the 750% surge in the past year in the value in bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, has provoked a mania that feeds off itself. Electroneum, the venture that excites Redknapp, reported that four Premier League footballers had got in touch within hours of Harry’s tweet.

At current coal prices (US$98/tonne) the operating cost will rise towards or beyond A$60 per MWh. 
 AGL's wind all-in PPAs are A$55/MWh, solar A$65/MWh. This means that the operating cost of existing power stations will be above the total cost of new wind and solar. Similar trends can be seen in India and the USA. Meanwhile, the costs of renewables are still falling.
All that will be stopping a major shift into renewables will be the cost of ""firming"". In the USA this is done with gas, for now. In Australia, because of the debacle of gas policy, we will likely skip the intermediate stage of gas firming and go straight to storage. But the Powerwall plus solar is already cheaper than (29 cents/kWh LCOE) most retail electricity, so much of the storage will be located behind the meter in households and small businesses. 
And during blackouts, solar plus a Powerwall is a winner:

How does Powerwall work during an outage? 
Powerwall can detect an outage, disconnect from the grid, and automatically restore power to your home in a fraction of a second. You will not even notice that the power went out. Your lights and appliances will continue to run without interruption.
If you have solar and Powerwall, then solar energy will continue to power your home and recharge Powerwall. Without Powerwall, solar will shut down during an outage.
We estimate how long your home will stay powered during an outage based on your indicated home size and the appliances you elect to back up, derived from national data. With solar, your Powerwall charge will deplete only when your home energy usage exceeds your solar power production. We cap our estimate at 7 days to account for the occasional cloudy day that may impact solar production.

The cost of a 2000 Mw battery for Adelaide would cost?
BQEND
The Tesla big battery cost US$50 for 129 MWh. So, a 2000 Mwh battery would cost 2000/129*50, about US$770 million. The concentrated solar power plant near Port Augusta will deliver 150 MW for 8 hours into the night. It will cost A$650 million, but that includes generating the power as well as the storage. The Cultana pumped sea water hydro will have 1770 MWh of storage. No official cost estimates have been revealed as yet, but analysts at ANU estimate costs at A$30/MWh, much cheaper than batteries.

BQEND
You surely mean a 2000 MW power station. Coal power stations cost US$3500 (in the US) per kW to build. So a 2000 MW coal power station would cost US$7000 million (source) And that's BEFORE the cost of fuel. Updating 2008 data to today, you could in effect build 10 battery banks for the cost of a new coal power station. And remember, that in Oz (and the USA), the cost of fuel in a coal-fired power station is now almost equal to the total cost of wind power.

However, SA has a baseload demand of about 1,000 MW which are required 24/7. That demand cannot be supplied from renewables at the reliability demanded by consumers. Resolving that issue is not the responsibility of the individual generators - they are just following the market rules - and AEMO does not have the authority to force them to keep coal power stations to open. This is the problem that Jay Weatherill is now trying to solve by (a) relying more heavily on coal power from Victoria (which is itself more reluctant to provide that power because they have the same problem) and (b) building a fossil fuel power station at the taxpayers' expense, because no one else wants to build one.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1508165979000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'a renewables is subsidised', u'effect': u'generators have started replacing coal with renewables b favours'}, {u'cause': u'no one else wants to build one', u'effect': u""b building a fossil fuel power station at the taxpayers ' expense""}, {u'cause': u'they have the same problem', u'effect': u'which is itself more reluctant to provide that power'}], u'author_id': u'15089024', u'in_reply_to': u'106851704', u'id': u'106872621', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'WayWest', u'text': u'May need to re-read the article as you did exactly what the article states some media organizations did.

Guardian uses 'plants' as it's metric. The summary you quote in Fact 2 uses units of 30 MW or larger. As the article stated a single plant may comprise of many units.
If you want to compare units to units sure, we can do that based on history. 
Year 2006 Total new units: 89,926Year 2007 Total new units: 92,711Year 2008 Total new units: 70,201Year 2009 Total new units: 76,150Year 2010 Total new units: 88,309Year 2011 Total new units: 93,885Year 2012 Total new units: 83,334Year 2013 Total new units: 80,897Year 2014 Total new units: 70,268Year 2015 Total new units: 104,099Year 2016 Total new units: 78,925Year 2017 (half year) Total new units:29,957
It's pretty clear the total number of units, when we compare apples to apples is down for the first half of 2017. We'd need to see a surge in new unit construction to come close to hitting the yearly trends since 2006 to 2016.

So why would combining the two be anything other a flaming middle finger pointed at our planet? Here's the thinking: Unlike fossil fuels, trees are already part of Earth's carbon cycle. So when you burn a tree, you're only releasing the carbon that the tree had stored up, carbon that would have been released anyway when the tree died and decomposed. That's why the new energy bill that just passed in the Senate—with bipartisan support, no less—includes an amendment saying that biomass should be classified as a carbon neutral energy source.
So does this mean that the Senate has actually made a positive environmental policy decision? No, you crazy optimist. The Senate is just buying into the carbon-accounting loophole that the European Union has been exploiting: Burning wood pellets doesn't actually give you a carbon footprint of zero, it's just a sneaky way to have your cake and eat it too.
Basically, this is just the latest update from the ""ketchup is a vegetable"" school of science that politicians seem to love. The interest here, though, is the way the science almost works out.And a forest isn't only trees.

It’s not always down to dishonesty. Sometimes it’s just a lack of time, a headline and the multiplying power of ideological certainty.
Last week, China announced it was stopping or postponing work on 151 coal plants that were either under, or earmarked for, construction.
Last month, India reported its national coal fleet on average ran at little more than 60% of its capacity – among other things, well below what is generally considered necessary for an individual generator to be financially viable.
Neither of these stories gained much of a foothold in the Australia media. But one story on global coal did: that 621 plants were being built across the planet.
The line was run in print, repeated on national radio and rippled out on social media among likeminded audiences. Some politicians and commentators claimed it showed it was strange, maybe even ridiculous, that MPs, financiers and energy companies said new coal power stations had no role to play in Australia.
But the figure is wrong. Way off, in fact. According to the most recent data, there are 267 coal stations under construction. More than 40% of those are not actually new ones, but expansions of existing generators.
A bit of background: the figure dates back to 19 June, when Nationals senator John “Wacka” Williams asked the parliamentary library to answer a few reasonable questions. How many coal plants are there in other countries? How many have been built recently or are being built? How many have closed? According to the parliamentary library analysis, he wanted the answers by 4pm the same day.
Fast forward to September, and the Australian ran a page one story quoting the analysis under the headline “World building new coal plants faster than it shuts them”. The Oz (correctly) reported that the library found 621 coal-fired power units were being built. This was mis-repeated by several people who don’t accept that climate change is a present threat – including blogger and broadcaster Andrew Bolt and government backbench energy and environment committee chair Craig Kelly – as 621 plants being built.
In reality, coal power stations are usually made up of several units. Victoria’s Hazelwood, which shut in March, had eight. But the distinction mattered little once Bolt had provided the shareable online headline: “New coal-fired power stations: World 621, Australia zero. Now understand?”
While the stations/units confusion is relevant, it is not the main issue. The 621 is incorrect, however you cut it.
By the time it appeared in the media, it was more than a year out of date. How do we know? The guy behind the data that was the initial source for the library analysis says so.
The parliamentary library used as its source the Comstat Data Portal, a trade-focused African website not known for its energy expertise. As the library noted, the African portal copied its data from the Global Coal Plant Tracker, the widely respected database run by US-based anti-coal organisation CoalSwarm and used by the OECD, International Energy Agency and Bloomberg publications. But none of the players involved in spreading this story in Australia contacted CoalSwarm directly to check if the African database was accurate.
It’s not. Ted Nace, the director of CoalSwarm, says there appeared to be numerous transcription errors. More significantly, the data on Comstat is out of date – from August last year. It did not reflect that new construction of coal plants plummeted in 2016 and 2017 following declines in construction in China and India.
More coal-fired capacity is still being built than closed each year, though the gap has narrowed significantly.
But, crucially, coal stations are not being used as much. The amount of electricity produced across the planet by burning coal has fallen each year since 2013.
“A distinction needs to be kept in mind between capacity and electrical output,” Nace says. “Even though there are more power plants, the actual production of electricity from those plants – and likewise the amount of coal used worldwide – has fallen every year since 2013, with a small drop in 2014 and larger drops in 2015 and 2016.”
The parliamentary assessment, and subsequent reporting, would have benefited from a closer glance at a report released in March by CoalSwarm, Greenpeace and the Sierra Club. Titled Boom and Bust 2017, it found an extraordinary 62% drop in new coal plant construction across the globe last year, and an 85% fall in new coal plant permits in China.
Analysis of CoalSwarm’s database shows that in July, construction was taking place at 300 plants globally. Of those, 183 were new power stations and 117 extensions of existing plants. But that number is changing rapidly.
As in so many things, the extraordinary story in coal comes from China. It still uses a stack of it, and is still building plenty of power stations. But according to a breakdown of the latest cancellation data announced last week by Simon Holmes à Court, senior adviser at the University of Melbourne’s energy transition hub, it stopped construction at 33 sites in the past three months alone.
It means that since July, the number of new coal stations being built in China has fallen from 103 to just 74. There has also been a slight decrease in the number being expanded, down to 46. The reason? A glut in the Chinese electricity market. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis found its coal fleet ran at only 47.5% capacity last year.
India is the other big player, with 45 power stations under construction – 19 new plants and 26 being expanded. While debate continues to rage over whether the Australian government should subsidise Adani’s planned giant export coal mine in outback Queensland, existing Indian coal plants – including those owned by Adani – are struggling.
Among countries comparable to Australia in terms of development, Japan – which signalled it would make a significant investment in coal after shutting down its nuclear fleet following the Fukushima disaster six years ago – has 14 construction projects, many of them small by Australian standards.
Germany has been held up by lobby group the Minerals Council of Australia as an industrialised country investing in “high efficiency, low emissions”, or HELE, coal technology. It has one station under construction. Building work at what is known as Datteln 4 started a decade ago next month. After several delays, it is due to be commissioned next year.
It is the only coal station being built in western Europe. Britain’s Conservative party has promised to phase out coal by 2025, and Justin Trudeau’s Canadian government by 2030. The two countries last week said they would work together to push other countries to join them. Despite Donald Trump’s grand promises about reviving the coal industry, there are no new stations under construction in the US.
What does all this mean for Australia? In terms of the political debate, probably very little. Given the modern aversion to the persuasive power of evidence, misinformation will find a way.
But don’t let yourself be kidded into thinking only local investors are leaving coal behind.

That is decidedly unusual and suspect, since this is an area where no one is claiming extreme precision -- they all report a significant range of possibilities. So was Scafetta looking at mid-points, high-points, low-points? He doesn't say, although he does distinguish transient sensitivity from equilibrium sensitivity, which is a small point in his favor. 
Moving past that curious deficiency in his graph, I tried to verify the sources referenced in Scafetta's graph.
The first thing that jumped out at me was that the large number of recent references attributed to Lewis and Curry. Curry, in my book, has zero credibility, but maybe her number can be justified. So my BS meter is running high, but I'm still willing to give him the benefit of the doubt if his other sources check out.
Given the surprising paucity of non-Curry references, I used Google Scholar to look up recent climate sensitivity papers (something any half-way competent peer reviewer should have done for this paper).
Limiting the search to 2013 on, the first article listed was this:Spread in model climate sensitivity traced to atmospheric convective mixingTheir abstract says this:
BQSTART
The mixing inferred from observations appears to be sufficiently strong to imply a climate sensitivity of more than 3 degrees for a doubling of carbon dioxide.
BQEND
In the body of the paper they say this:

BQSTART
Taking the available observations at face value implies a most likely climate sensitivity of about 4C, with a lower limit of about 3C. ... on the basis of the available data, the new understanding presented here pushes the likely long-term global warming towards the upper end of model ranges 
BQEND
So there's a data point: Sherwood et al. 2013, sensitivity of 4C.
Hmm, not in Scafetta's graph.
Ok, here's very next paper in the search results:Clouds, Circulation and Climate SensitivityAvailable evidence suggests a range in the climate sensitivity from 1.5 to 4.5 K.So there's another data point. Bony et al, 2103; 1.5C to 4.5C
ALSO not in Scafetta's graph.
Third paper: Inhomogeneous forcing and transient climate sensitivity
The abstract says this: 
BQSTART
the lowest end of the range of transient climate response to CO2 in present models and assessments (<1.3 ◦ C) is very unlikely
BQEND
The body says this:

BQSTART
TCR is 1.7 ◦ C (1.3–3.2 ◦ C)
BQEND
So Shindell, 2104 should be shown with a TCR of 1.7 (and error range reaching up to 3.2C).
ALSO not present.
At this point I'm fed up -- his graph is missing the first three references that even a cursory search would turn up, all of which would blow his conclusion out of the water if he had included them. I call bullshit.
I'm not even a climate scientist and it took me about 1/2 hr to prove that at least part of his paper (Fig. 7, to be specific) is complete garbage. Do I really need to look through the entire literature and publish my own comprehensive graph, or is that enough evidence that we just agree that Scafetta's graph (if not the entire paper) is bogus?

The ""MIT Technology Review"" website still has an article from Richard Muller dated December 2003 which includes :
BQSTART
Let me be clear. My own reading of the literature and study of paleoclimate suggests strongly that carbon dioxide from burning of fossil fuels will prove to be the greatest pollutant of human history. It is likely to have severe and detrimental effects on global climate.

Richard Muller may have had some questions about the methodology used in the Mann et al ""Hockey Stick"" papers and the more extreme claims made by Al Gore in his ""The Inconvenient Truth"" book and documentary, but he was never a ""denier"".

You were once a ""Sky Dragon Slayer"" ???

NB : Before protesting that you did not mean to say that you ever held such an ""extreme"" version of the word ""denier"" remember than you are on the ""CiF - Environment - 97% Consensus"" sub-section of the Guardian media organisation.
On these hallowed webpages the only possible definition of ""denier"" is the ""= a Sky Dragon Slayer"" one (or an equivalent reaction, such as ""So you are denying fundamental physics ?"" or ""So you are denying basic [climate] science ?"", which always reduces to ""So you deny that CO2 is a greenhouse gas ?"").

The government there is intent on ending all burning of coal for power generation by 2025 and believes that to do that requires replacing its aging, domestically designed, gas-cooled reactors, most of which are now shut. Ministers want to construct up to ten new nuclear plants. But the winds buffeting the global industry are making it hard to find anyone to build them.

BQENDThe people who want nuclear are climate scientists and the people who don't are the fossil fuel lobby who fund misinformation campaigns containing the rot you wrote there.
Are you a fossil fuel lobbyist or just a pawn of the fossil fuel lobby?
Open Letter to President MacronJuly 1, 2017Dear President Macron,
We are writing as environmentalists, conservationists and climate scientists to congratulate you on your win in the presidential election, and to applaud your push for a carbon tax. Nobody has done more for advancing clean energy on the grid than France. In light of this knowledge, we are also writing to express our alarm at your decision to move France away from clean nuclear power.
Few nations have done more than France to demonstrate the humanitarian and environmental benefits of creating a high-energy, nuclear-powered, and electrified society. Not only was France host of United Nations climate talks, it also has some of the lowest per capita carbon emissions of any developed nation.
Any reduction in France’s nuclear generation will increase fossil fuel generation and pollution given the low capacity factors and intermittency of solar and wind. Germany is a case in point. Its emissions have been largely unchanged since 2009 and actually increased in both 2015 and 2016 due to nuclear plant closures. Despite having installed 4 percent more solar and 11 percent more wind capacity, Germany’s generation from the two sources decreased 3 percent and 2 percent respectively, since it wasn’t as sunny or windy in 2016 as in 2015.
And where France has some of the cheapest and cleanest electricity in Europe, Germany has some of the most expensive and dirtiest. Germany spent nearly 24 billion euros above market price in 2016 for its renewable energy production feed-in tariffs alone, but emissions have remained stagnant. Germany is set to miss its 2020 emission reduction goals by a wide margin. Despite its huge investment in renewables, only 46 percent of Germany’s electricity comes from clean energy sources as compared to 93 percent in France.
Solar and wind can play an important role in France. However, if France is to make investments in solar and wind similar to those of Germany, they should add to France’s share of clean energy, not inadvertently reduce it. Renewables can contribute to the further electrification of the transportation sector, which France has already done with its trains and should continue to do with personal vehicles.
Shifting from nuclear to fossil fuels and renewables would grievously harm the French economy in three ways: higher electricity prices for consumers and industry, an end to France’s lucrative electricity exports, and — perhaps most importantly — the destruction of France’s nuclear export sector. If the French nuclear fleet is forced to operate at lower capacity factors, it will cripple the French nuclear industry by adding costs and shrinking revenues. Eventually this will lead to poorer safety standards and less opportunities to fund research, development and efforts to export French nuclear technologies. Nations seeking to build new nuclear plants rightly want to know that the product France is selling is one that France itself values.
The French nuclear program has historically been the envy of the world. It demonstrated in the 1970s and 80s that the decarbonization of an industrialized country’s electricity sector is in fact possible. For France, the next necessary step to help combat climate change and improve air quality is to increase clean electricity from all non-fossil sources and massively reduce fossil fuels used in heating and the transportation sector. Nuclear power must play a central role in this.

Coal lost | Dana Nuccitelli,article,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/oct/16/the-war-on-coal-is-over-coal-lost,0,"Last week, Trump’s EPA administrator Scott Pruitt announced, “the war on coal is over.” If there ever was a war on coal, the coal industry has lost. According to a new report from the Union of Concerned Scientists, many old American coal power plants are being retired or converted to natural gas, and new coal power plants aren’t being built because they’ve become more expensive than natural gas, wind, and solar energy: 
The share of US electricity coming from coal fell from 51 percent in 2008 to 31 percent in 2016—an unprecedented change. New UCS analysis finds that, of the coal units that remain, roughly one in four plans to retire or convert to natural gas; another 17 percent are uneconomic and could face retirement soon.
Natural gas has now surpassed coal to supply 32% of US electricity (up from 21% in 2008), and solar and wind are up to 10% (from 3% in 2008).
This trend will continue. As old coal plants continue to retire and be replaced by cheaper renewables and natural gas, their share of the US electricity supply will continue to plummet, and coal will become a fossil fuel in every sense of the word. That’s why American companies continue to invest in cheap, clean renewable energy. As a result, our air and water are becoming cleaner, Americans are becoming healthier, and our carbon pollution is falling.

The shift away from coal poses a challenge for regions in which the local economy depends on the fossil fuel, but the transition is inevitable. A wise economic policy would involve funding programs to help those regions adapt to the change (Hillary Clinton proposed one such plan during her presidential campaign). A recent study showed that Americans are willing to pay a carbon tax with some of the revenue going to assist displaced coal workers. The Trump administration has instead opted to try and slow coal’s inevitable decline.
The Trump administration seems hell-bent on causing as much global warming as possible. First there was the historically irresponsible decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, joining war-torn Syria as the only world countries to reject the treaty. Then just a few weeks ago, Trump’s Energy Secretary Rick Perry announced a plan to effectively take coal out of the free market and instead subsidize it with taxpayer dollars to bail out the industry and keep uneconomical coal power plants open. The hypocrisy ran thick – as Perry called for propping up the coal industry with increased taxpayer subsidies, Pruitt called for an end to subsidies for renewable energy: 
I would do away with these incentives that we give to wind and solar. I’d let them stand on their own and compete against coal and natural gas and other sources, and let utilities make real-time market decisions on those types of things as opposed to being propped up by tax incentives and other types of credits that occur
Soon thereafter, Priutt announced that Trump’s EPA will repeal the Clean Power Plan. That policy represented America’s most significant effort to cut its carbon pollution, but had been mired in a legal battle over whether the plan exceeded EPA’s regulatory authority under the Clean Air Act. Rather than let the courts decide the case, which many experts felt the EPA would win, Pruitt stopped defending the case in court and ended the program. 
The problem is that according to the US Supreme Court, the EPA is legally required to regulate dangerous carbon pollution. Pruitt’s EPA may propose a dramatically weakened plan that probably wouldn’t survive a court challenge, or he may just try to run out the clock on Trump’s term. As with the disastrous Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, they don’t have a replacement plan. In the meantime, states and environmental groups will take his Clean Power Plan repeal to court.

Pruitt’s Clean Power Plan repeal justification is largely based on bogus economics, which the Trump administration is using to reduce government estimates of the ‘social cost of carbon.’ This figure – which estimates how much a ton of carbon pollution costs society in terms of damages caused by climate change – is integral to many government policies. A majority of economists think the government’s estimate is too low, but Pruitt’s EPA manipulated the math by ignoring the costs of America’s carbon pollution to the rest of the world, and by using a high discount rate, which essentially says we care more about saving money now than preventing climate damages and suffering for future generations.
However, because renewables and natural gas are now cheaper than coal, an analysis by the Rhodium Group found that the US will meet the Clean Power Plan target of cutting carbon pollution from electricity generation 32% below 2005 levels by 2030 despite its repeal. 
That being said, with the Clean Power Plan in place, the US likely would have beat its targets. As this excellent tool created by Carbon Brief shows, many states like California and Idaho are ahead of the curve, but other states like Texas and West Virginia would have been forced to accelerate their transitions to clean energy, had the Clean Power Plan been enforced.
The good news is that none of the Trump administration’s moves are permanent. The next president can rejoin the Paris climate agreement, have the EPA draft new rules to regulate power plant carbon pollution, and revise the social cost of carbon based on real science and math. As Citizens’ Climate Lobby Executive Director Mark Reynolds wrote:
Those who cheer the EPA’s move should remember that President Obama initiated the Clean Power Plan in 2015 in the face of Congress’s inaction on climate change. Without effective legislation to combat climate change, a future president could just as easily go down the path of executive action and regulations again. The best answer here is for Congress to pass legislation putting the market to work on solving climate change.
There’s been some movement in this direction. A group of Republican elder statesmen in the Climate Leadership Council called for a revenue-neutral carbon tax, which would grow the economy. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) recently called for a price on carbon pollution and is said to be working with Senator Whitehouse (D-RI) on climate legislation. The House Climate Solutions Caucus is now up to 30 Republican and 30 Democratic members and is trying to craft a bipartisan replacement for the Clean Power Plan.
The Trump administration is taking every possible step to burn away our future, but fortunately the transition to a clean energy economy is unstoppable, and many of his party members are coming to grips with that reality.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/oct/16/the-war-on-coal-is-over-coal-lost

You wouldn't normally look to the Guardian for headlines both hilarious and somehow disturbing, but there should be some kind of award for this one.
And to answer a comment below, while shellfish have been around a lot longer than people, the sea pollution we are now producing (""run-off from agricultural fertilisers"") may be making them fart a lot more: so it is possible that human-induced changes are, at a remove, contributing to climate change in this way.
Personally, I remain more concerned about potential positive feedback effects from permafrost methane and undersea clathrate thaw, but admittedly this threat remains unquantified ... so for now I will ask my wife to do her bit to save the planet by chowing down more of those lethally gaseous oysters (someone's got to, but they remind me of cold phlegm).', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1508178615000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'2412184', u'id': u'106882996', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'jimble675', u'text': u'In the countryside they have loads of massive white fans to cool things down.

But beneath the schoolboy humour, there is a serious point. The two gases in question – methane and nitrous oxide – are potent agents of climate change, with a warming potential 28 and 265 times greater than carbon dioxide respectively.
Scientists studying the Baltic Sea off the coast of Sweden have found that shellfish are producing one-tenth of all the greenhouses gases released there – the equivalent to the amount produced by 20,000 cattle. If the same situation is being replicated around the rest of the world’s seas and oceans, we have a serious problem.
Chief scientist Stafano Bonaglia, from Stockholm University, is certainly concerned: “It sounds funny, but small animals in the seafloor may act like cows in a stable, both groups being important contributors of methane due to the bacteria in their gut.”
He also points out that shellfish were releasing these gases long before global warming became an issue, and believes that the recent emissions may have been exacerbated by the enrichment of coastal waters, due to the run-off from agricultural fertilisers.
To put this into perspective, the average cow produces 120kg of methane every year – 1,000 times as much as even the most flatulent human. With almost 100m head of cattle in the US alone, that means that 12m tonnes of gas are being released annually, dwarfing the efforts of the shellfish.
The major animal producers of methane are cud-chewing creatures known as ruminants, such as cattle and sheep – it’s the bacteria in their stomachs that causes the problem. However, kangaroos have a different digestive system, so produce a lot less methane – kangaroo steak, anyone?
Other creatures that create huge amounts of methane include the world’s 2,000-plus species of termite. Each only produces a tiny amount – roughly half a microgram a day, so it would take 2m termites to produce a daily dose of one gram of methane. However, there are so many of them that their annual emissions may top 20m tonnes a year. The big difference between termites and cattle is, of course, that termites – and the gases they release – are part of the natural ecosystem.

Numerically, just what percentage of the government numbers do Abbott and his extreme Conservative cohorts represent?
In parliament the combined LNP numbers are 105 [were 106 now 105 after Bernadi] of the 226 parliamentary positions or 46.46%. Just what percentage of those 105 LNP parliamentarians are aligned with Abbott and his combined Conservative forces?
Does anyone seriously believe Abbott controls 50+% of the elected Liberals, let alone 53 LNP parliamentarians?
I don't think so - so why is he allowed to not only dictate policy on this energy matter, also policy on the SSM and other issues?

When are coalition supporters going to get it? LNP policies and the majority of conservative voters hopes, intentions and expectations only ever coincide by chance and are treated as an occasionally useful bonus by the likes of Tony Abbott and the rest of the fringe-dwelling extremists in the party but by are no means considered necessary to the development of policy or in any way binding on these politician's words and actions.
The LNP is the party of the rich and business, particularly the fossil fuel business. That has suited most conservative voters for a long time until they started noticing increasingly long droughts, that electricity can't be taken for granted and that their country burns to the ground more seriously every summer as other parts of the world get destroyed by catastrophic weather events on an ever increasing scale. 
Meanwhile those responsible have been encouraged by the LNP to continue contributing to these disasters with all the social and geopolitical consequences they entail in the name of economic growth (their own profits) and the free market.
Get real! selfish complacency is no longer an option, LNP voters get up on your hind legs and call your party to account!

It will also create new reliability obligations to ensure there’s enough dispatchable power in the system.
Cabinet, and the government’s backbench committee on environment and energy, considered the government’s new policy on Monday night before a party room debate slated for Tuesday morning.
Government sources have confirmed the Coalition will not adopt the clean energy target recommended by Australia’s chief scientist, Alan Finkel, in his review of the national electricity market.
The vociferous internal critics of Finkel’s proposal, led by the former prime minister Tony Abbott, have made it clear for months they will not accept any policy that contains new subsidies for renewable energy. The existing renewable energy target peaks in 2020 and will run out to 2030.
It is understood the new obligations for reliability and emissions reduction will be imposed as part of an overhaul of the national electricity market rules recommended by the Australian Energy Market Operator and the new Energy Security Board, established by the Council of Australian Governments to drive the recommendations of the Finkel review already endorsed by state and federal energy ministers.
While key details of the policy are not yet clear, government sources claim the required emissions reductions in electricity will be consistent with the Paris framework, and the new policy approach will have a more positive impact on power prices than the clean energy target, which Finkel said would lower energy prices compared with business as usual.
The government is also expected to keep the emissions reduction fund and it flagged the potential use of international permits to help meet Australia’s emissions targets at lowest cost in its review of the Direct Action policy, launched in March.
The government’s efforts to resolve its energy policy comes as the new Guardian Essential poll finds a clear majority of voters support the now dumped clean energy target to help drive the transition to low emissions power sources.
The new poll shows support for a clean energy target at 65%.
It also suggests Coalition conservatives who have campaigned against the Finkel proposal are out of step with the views of their own supporters.
While the total approval for the clean energy target is 65% in the new survey, 68% of Coalition voters in the sample of 1,845 voters said the government should implement a clean energy target.
And while Coalition conservatives have railed for months against subsidies for renewable energy – Australians are on a different page.
Australians are overwhelmingly supportive of incentives for low-emissions technologies, with 74% of the sample backing ongoing support for renewables, and 75% of Coalition supporters endorsing that view.
A majority of voters, including a slim majority of Coalition voters, also support Labor’s policy goal to source 50% of electricity from renewable sources by 2030 – a policy regularly attacked by the Coalition.
Labor’s policy was supported by 62% of the sample, and 52% of Coalition voters said they approved of it.
At the beginning of a critical week for the government on energy, voters are inclined to see the government in Canberra underperforming on a key issue, although they are not as frustrated with the Coalition as they were in February.
The Turnbull government is not doing enough to ensure affordable, reliable and clean energy for Australian households and businesses, according to 61% (down from 71% in February). Only 15% think it is doing enough, and 19% (up 5%) say they don’t know.
More than half (56%) of Coalition voters think there has not been enough action, and 22% think it is doing enough.
With Tony Abbott spending the past several months front running the government’s energy debate, and leading the opposition to the Finkel recommendation, 42% think the former prime minister should resign from parliament (down 1% from April), while 30% think he should stay in parliament in some capacity (down 2%).
Liberal/National voters were more likely to think Tony Abbott should stay in parliament (38%) than Labor voters (27%) and Greens voters (17%).
Labor is still in front in the new poll, leading the Coalition on the two-party preferred measure 52% to 48%, but that is an improvement on the government’s fortunes from a week ago, where Labor led 54% to 46%.
The major parties traded blows over energy in parliament on Monday, when Labor asked a series of questions about why the prime minister had given early public endorsement to the clean energy target when the government now intended to dump it.
Labor has signalled it is highly unlikely to support an energy policy which abandons the core Finkel recommendation but the shadow climate minister, Mark Butler said on Monday the opposition held out “some hope” that the government would produce something sensible.
A major business group, the Business Council of Australia, urged the ALP to “stop, pause, and look at the detail” before forming a position on the government’s plan, because stakeholders needed bipartisanship for investment certainty.
“The worst thing that could happen now is that we go into another round of never ever, pure politics or this won’t work or it’s not our scheme, so it’s not a good scheme,” said the BCA’s chief executive, Jennifer Westacott.
Westacott said it was “hugely important” for the government to set a trajectory for emissions reduction, and a establish a clear trigger, so businesses understood how emissions would be treated, because “if you’re trying to do a major project you want to price risk.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/17/coalition-balks-on-finkel-target-but-will-unveil-energy-and-emissions-policy

Natural climate solutions, also including protection of carbon-storing peatlands and better management of soils and grasslands, could account for 37% of all actions needed by 2030 under the 195-nation Paris plan, it said. 
Combined, the suggested “regreening of the planet” would be equivalent to halting all burning of oil worldwide, it said. 
“Better stewardship of the land could have a bigger role in fighting climate change than previously thought,” the international team of scientists said of findings published in the US journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The estimates for nature’s potential, led by planting forests, were up to 30% higher than those envisaged by a UN panel of climate scientists in a 2014 report, it said. 
Trees soak up heat-trapping carbon dioxide as they grow and release it when they burn or rot. That makes forests, from the Amazon to Siberia, vast natural stores of greenhouse gases. 
Overall, better management of nature could avert 11.3bn tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions a year by 2030, the study said, equivalent to China’s current carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel use. 
The Paris climate agreement, weakened by US president Donald Trump’s decision in June to pull out, seeks to limit a rise in global temperature to “well below” 2C above pre-industrial times. 
Current government pledges to cut emissions are too weak to achieve the 2C goal, meant to avert more droughts, more powerful storms, downpours and heat waves. 
“Fortunately, this research shows we have a huge opportunity to reshape our food and land use systems,” Paul Polman, CEO of Unilever, said in a statement of Monday’s findings. 
Climate change could jeopardise production of crops such as corn, wheat, rice and soy even as a rising global population will raise demand, he said. 
The study said that some of the measures would cost $10 a tonne or less to avert a tonne of carbon dioxide, with others up to $100 a tonne to qualify as “cost-effective” by 2030. 
“If we are serious about climate change, then we are going to have to get serious about investing in nature,” said Mark Tercek, chief executive officer of The Nature Conservancy, which led the study.

This is why civilisation has developed experts, who specialise in their domain areas. We cannot all be experts on every subject. 
When my car tyre was punctured, I did not argue with the AA rescue guys, I did not argue with my garage mechanics as to how to make a temporary repair, and then replace with a new tyre. (Though, with the number of punctures I've had in the last 5 years, even my amateur eye could immediately see the old tyre was a write off)
Only today, I was listening to a R4 article on the carving discovered by archaeologists using mammoth tusk - they estimated it would have taken an expert carver some 400 hours to prepare the item, at a time when humanity was under extreme environmental pressure from the ice age onset. If primitive human societies can trust in experts to do this, and give them the time and resources to spend doing this, then as a more advanced society with myriad more professional branches of expertise, then its probably wise to pay attention to the experts.
Thus when nit picking, cherry picking and quote mining to disagree with what the expert community globally, has over the last century concluded, you make yourself look like a fool.

Therefore, we conclude that despite statistical correlations between SST and Atlantic hurricane activity in recent decades, it is premature to conclude that human activity–and particularly greenhouse warming–has already caused a detectable change in Atlantic hurricane activity. (“Detectable” here means the change is large enough to be distinguishable from the variability due to natural causes.) However, human activity may have already caused some some changes that are not yet detectable due to the small magnitude of the changes or observation limitations, or are not yet confidently modeled (e.g., aerosol effects on regional climate).

“Existing records of past Atlantic tropical storm or hurricane numbers (1878 to present) in fact do show a pronounced upward trend, which is also correlated with rising SSTs (e.g., see blue curve in Fig. 4 or Vecchi and Knutson 2008). However, the density of reporting ship traffic over the Atlantic was relatively sparse during the early decades of this record, such that if storms from the modern era (post 1965) had hypothetically occurred during those earlier decades, a substantial number would likely not have been directly observed by the ship-based “observing network of opportunity.” We find that, after adjusting for such an estimated number of missing storms, there is a small nominally positive upward trend in tropical storm occurrence from 1878-2006. But statistical tests reveal that this trend is so small, relative to the variability in the series, that it is not significantly distinguishable from zero (Figure 2). In addition, Landsea et al. (2010) note that the rising trend in Atlantic tropical storm counts is almost entirely due to increases in short-duration (<2 day) storms alone. Such short-lived storms were particularly likely to have been overlooked in the earlier parts of the record, as they would have had less opportunity for chance encounters with ship traffic.
Figure 3 (click to enlarge)
Figure 4 (click to enlarge)If we instead consider Atlantic basin hurricanes, rather than all Atlantic tropical storms, the result is similar: the reported numbers of hurricanes were sufficiently high during the 1860s-1880s that again there is no significant positive trend in numbers beginning from that era (Figure 3, black curve, from CCSP 3.3 (2008)). This is without any adjustment for “missing hurricanes”.
The evidence for an upward trend is even weaker if we look at U.S. landfalling hurricanes, which even show a slight negative trend beginning from 1900 or from the late 1800s (Figure 3, blue curve). Hurricane landfalling frequency is much less common than basin-wide occurrence, meaning that the U.S. landfalling hurricane record, while more reliable than the basin-wide record, suffers from degraded signal-to-noise characteristics for assessing trends.
While major hurricanes (Figure 3, red curve) show more evidence of a rising trend from the late 1800s, the major hurricane data are considered even less reliable than the other two records in the early parts of the record. Category 4-5 hurricanes show a pronounced increase since the mid-1940s (Bender et al., 2010) but again, we consider that these data need to be carefully assessed for data inhomogeneity problems before such trends can be accepted as reliable.
The situation for Atlantic hurricane long-term records is summarized in Figure 4. While global mean temperature and tropical Atlantic SSTs show pronounced and statistically significant warming trends (green curves), the U.S. landfalling hurricane record (orange curve) shows no significant increase or decrease. The unadjusted hurricane count record (blue curve) shows a significant increase in Atlantic hurricanes since the early 1900s. However, when adjusted with an estimate of storms that stayed at sea and were likely “missed” in the pre-satellite era, there is no significant increase in Atlantic hurricanes since the late 1800s (red curve). While there have been increases in U.S. landfalling hurricanes and basin-wide hurricane counts since the since the early 1970s, Figure 4 shows that these increases are not representative of the behavior seen in the century long records. In short, the historical Atlantic hurricane record does not provide compelling evidence for a substantial greenhouse warming-induced long-term increase.”', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1508721633000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'their innate conservative nature', u'effect': u'have yet to confirm this'}, {u'cause': u'increases in short duration storms', u'effect': u'that the rising trend in atlantic tropical storm counts is'}], u'author_id': u'15456519', u'in_reply_to': u'107162085', u'id': u'107177447', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'KingInYellow', u'text': u'BQSTART

Apart from most countries having an academy of that type, there are many in specific fields of science in each country, such as the Geological Society of London, the American Institute of Physics, etc etc.
You speculated about what are the possible futures that could come from the climate change currently happening.
A paper worth looking at is -
""A human-induced hothouse climate?"" - Kidder & Worsley, 2011
Here's a key quote from the Conclusions:
""The likely cool greenhouse in which about half of Antarctica is still ice-covered means devastation from the tens of meters sea level is likely to rise (e.g., Ward, 2010), and poleward shifting of warm climate belts.""
So the appropriate term for what's likely to happen is a 'cool greenhouse', which sounds harmless, but is not.
It's a very interesting paper.
How quickly?
Another quote:
""a cool greenhouse seems imminent within perhaps a century or two.""
However, although those conditions could set in within that time, the process of melting half of the ice on Antarctica would take around 1000 years.
Meanwhile the
""poleward shifting of warm climate belts.""
means that the equatorial regions will become increasingly inhospitable - but over time, not in a couple of weeks.
On this point, the most useful comparison is probably with the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, which was around 56 million years ago.
The fossil record in rocks formed around the equator during the PETM is really poor, an indication that life was extremely stressed.
Agriculture is basically adapted to the mostly-stable Holocene - that is not going to be the offer from Earth systems as the effects of CO2 continue.
People can't grasp this, because it truly is outside any human experience.
In fact when there have been short, sharp climate shocks, humans have found it very difficult to cope.
In 1815 there was a big eruption in Indonesia.
It caused global temperatures to drop by a degree or so for a few years, and created an event in 1816 called ""The Year Without a Summer"", leading to failed crops and near-famine conditions in many places.
In 1258 there was a European famine across many countries, and this is now linked to a major eruption in 1257 on Lombok in Indonesia - it has a much bigger sulphate peak in the ice cores than Tambora in 1815, so it was a bigger eruption.
We are now looking at a much longer-term change, of an extraordinary kind.
Although changes over a century or two seem fast in human terms, this is fast compared to events such as the PETM which happened over a much longer time scale.
The current rate of CO2 output is far faster than during the PETM.', u'recommendation_count': u'18', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1508706092000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'it truly is outside any human experience', u'effect': u""people ca n't grasp this""}, {u'cause': None, u'effect': u'failed crops and near famine conditions'}, {u'cause': u'it', u'effect': u'global temperatures to drop by a degree or so for a few years'}], u'author_id': u'2923581', u'in_reply_to': u'107169704', u'id': u'107171515', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'ID2310987', u'text': u'Mann and Gore ""collaboration"" has nothing to do with the topic.

The old: put words in the mouth of my debate opponent to make a cheap, false point. I never said we don’t know anything. Of course we know a lot about climate. The point I’m making is that there is nothing in the climate record that suggests doom or future catastrophe is imminent or likely. You referred to increased temps, and I’ll add rising sea level. Those DO have basis in fact in the climate record. Famines, wildfires, droughts, tropical storms DO NOT. 
The one thing I agree that societies need to address is rising sea level. We need to do that now while the energy economy continues to innovate.

Thanks for that input. But if you think the same science that makes those projections also makes projections about famines and wildfires, I think your severely mistaken. Those things, along with hurricane, drought projections are not tied to anything associated with climate trends. The media and some scientists are raving about the busy tropical storm season in the Atlantic Basin, but climatology is absolutely flat lining over the course of the past 100 years or so.

These are fictional books that somehow or someway bring real climate change science to the reader. What is really interesting is that Cli-Fi books often present real science in a credible way. They become fun teaching tools. There are some really well known authors such as Paolo Bacigalupi and Margaret Atwood among others. A list of other candidate Cli-Fi novels was provided by Sarah Holding in the Guardian. 
What makes a Cli-Fi novel good? Well in my opinion, it has to have some real science in it. And it has to get the science right. Second, it has to be fun to read. When done correctly, Cli-Fi can connect people to their world; it can help us understand what future climate may be like, or what current climate effects are.
As I write this, we are getting a steady stream of stories out of Puerto Rico the island was devastated by Hurricane Maria. It is hard to imagine the devastation, what life is like without electricity, food, or water. What is life like on an island of 3 million people, each fending for themselves, just trying to survive.
Another thing that is hard to imagine is the future. What will the world be like decades from now when Earth temperatures have continued to rise? What will agriculture be like? What will coastal communities be like? What will international relations and armed conflict be like?
It is also hard to imagine what living a subsistence agriculture life is like, today. What happens to lives and communities when the rains change, or don’t come at all? What would that world look like? 
Cli-Fi stories are vehicles that can help us imagine. The authors get us to think about these what ifs – these future Earths. Cli-Fi novels (and movies for that matter) can make experiences far more real than endless graphs or plots of temperature variations. And that, perhaps, is the most important contribution Cli-Fi can make to the discussion of climate change in our everyday lives. These authors get us to imagine what experiences are or would be like. 
One recent example of Cli-Fi literature is South Pole Station by Ashley Shelby. In this book we follow an artist, Cooper Gosling, who is traveling to a research location on Antarctica to create paintings. Yes, an artist is sent to live with researchers and crew – with funding from the National Science Foundation. After arriving at the South Pole, Cooper has to become acquainted with the strange social system that exists there. Ashley writes the book in such a way that you actually feel you are huddled in the cold with her and her co-workers.
Cooper doesn’t uplift her life to travel to the South Pole on a whim. It is an outcome of a family tragedy and a history that involves romanticized stories of adventure to this remote place. While Cooper is stationed at the pole, she hears news that a radical scientist is coming. This scientist claims that climate change is a hoax – and his presence further upsets the delicate social balance that exists at the research location. 
You see the expected reaction of the regular scientists when this climate denier arrives to perform his research. There is backstabbing and sabotage where in the end we find Copper helping this climate-denying scientist carry out an experiment. The experiment goes awry and there are repercussions all the way back to the US mainland, and the halls of Congress.
I liked this book because I don’t like fiction. That is, I find it really hard to get into fictional books because my mind always runs back to science, or my email, or papers to grade, or kids’ soccer practices to get to. I never feel like I have time to just read for fun. But this book was really engaging. It was the first fictional book in a decade that I didn’t want to put down. 
It is funny with really quick-witted humor that made me laugh. At the same time, I was impressed by how I felt like I was there – working amongst the staff and scientists. I enjoyed how Ashely weaved in threads of real and accurate science. And this, perhaps, is what makes the Cli-Fi genre so important. We can unintentionally learn real science. 
Ashley’s book is at the edge of this genre. It is not “dystopian” and it is not about a post-apocalyptic world resulting from climate change. It is topical and, though fiction, is as present-day as a news headline. This book is about what people, dedicated to facts, are really doing today. It doesn’t seem futuristic. It seems like we are at a point when a bunch of scientists and friends of facts could take over a research station and say, “Stop the madness!”
Salman Rushdie recently said that in the present day the country is so filled with lies and fantasy and fiction surrounding the truth, that it might require the fiction writer to plainly lay out what is reality and what is not. I think Ashley’s book fits that notion.
So, take a look at this new (newish?) form of literature. Particularly if you want a break from the usual genres.

The episode was an allegory for the replacement of 2nd Temple Judaism with Christianity. It's closely associated with the cursing of the fig tree. Hitler's take on it was not a big stretch.

Hitler in 1934 carrying his whip.

Hitler was very mindful that Jesus had used a whip to drive the money-grubbing Jews from the temple:

he even took to the whip to drive from the temple of the Lord this adversary of all humanity, who then as always saw in religion nothing but an instrument for his business existence.

BQENDIf you read an
actual historical document such as Josephus' Jewish Antiquities, you may discover that Jewish leaders of the time were not Roman puppets.
It was the Christian 'messiah' who supposedly told people to render unto Caesar what is Caesar's. He reserved his anger for Jewish leaders. People like the Pharisees - about whom the gospel writers didn't seem to have had a clue (see Josephus again).
A bit of research into Second Temple Judaism and you'd see that money changing was essential to Jewish religious practice. The 'cleansing of the Temple' is an allegory for the destruction of Judaism.

Of course, he’s very strong on defending western culture and its Judaeo-Christian roots. For this cause he is an unwavering ideological warrior. But as in all wars, truth is often the first casualty. In this case, it’s the truth of the very scriptures Abbott himself employs.
His latest intervention, invoking Genesis to push back against the “religion” of climate change, is a prime example. His use of the Bible was clumsy – and not for the first time.
A few years ago on Q&amp;A, he was asked “What would Jesus do?” in relation to refugees. Stunningly, his first impulse was to invoke the example of Jesus clearing the temple. When pressed, he expanded on the connection. Jesus knew everything, he told us, and this included that there was “a place for everything and it is not necessarily everyone’s place to come to Australia”. Are we to believe that when Jesus cleared the temple of what didn’t belong there he was giving us a mandate for the treatment of refugees? What possible connection was Abbott drawing? The mind boggles.
But perhaps this cavalier attitude to the Bible is not unrelated to the battle he wages for western values. 
His 2015 Margaret Thatcher lecture, addressing Europe’s refugee crisis, was an earlier occasion when he linked a oblique Bible reference to the roots – and preservation – of the west:
[T]he imperative to “love your neighbour as you love yourself” is at the heart of every western polity. It expresses itself in laws protecting workers, in strong social security safety nets, and in the readiness to take in refugees. It’s what makes us decent and humane countries as well as prosperous ones, but – right now – this wholesome instinct is leading much of Europe into catastrophic error.
The command to love the neighbour is invoked, but circumscribed. The “error” to be avoided is allowing the influx of refugees to “possibly changing [Europe] for ever”. In other words, Europe and its preservation is the goal. Biblical teachings (or allusions to them) serve to defend western culture – as idealised by Abbott and his fellow cultural warriors. It can be used to critique other cultures, but not “the west”.
It is therefore not surprising to discover that the former prime minister’s recent speech to the Global Warming Policy Foundation displayed a similar juxtaposition of the Bible and an endorsement of the west. On this occasion, however, there was an added concern: the alleged advance of a new religion. 
Climate change is by no means the sole or even the most significant symptom of the changing interests and values of the west. Still, only societies with high levels of cultural amnesia – that have forgotten the scriptures about man created “in the image and likeness of God” and charged with “subduing the earth and all its creatures” – could have made such a religion out of it.
The logic seems to go like this. Climate change is replacing Christianity as the west’s religion. But if we’d just stick to the Bible we would realise that climate change isn’t a problem. After all, the Bible teaches that we are to “subdue the earth”. In other words, climate change is actually part of the divinely-mandated human vocation. 
It is regrettably true that the teaching about “subduing the earth” (found in Genesis 1:28) has been used as an ideological tool to justify exploitative and destructive attitudes towards the earth. But even a cursory engagement with the critical discussion of this verse will quickly reveal that this use and English translation of the text are themselves in some tension with its use in Genesis 1. 
The text preceded the industrialised world by at least a couple of thousand years and was pitched at an agrarian society. Even if we take the resonances of the English word “subdue” at face value, it would have meant something quite different in that earlier context. To invoke it to justify the climate change produced since the industrial revolution is a straightforward category mistake. 
But, and this is the crucial point, we shouldn’t take the English translation at face value in any case. We need to engage the meaning of the original Hebrew word: kabash. 
All exercises in translation are complex, and, yes, there are some problematic dimensions to this word where it surfaces in other parts of the Bible. But in Genesis it’s connected to the divine declaration of creation’s goodness. In this first chapter of the Bible kabash can suggest the idea of “development”, argues Old Testament scholar Terence Fretheim. “This process offers to the human being the task of intra-creational development, of bringing the world along to its fullest possible creational potential.” 
When the original readers of this text read it they would not have heard a cavalier “change the climate at your convenience”. Instead, they are more likely to have heard something like, “make something good of this earth”.
If this is what subdue means in Genesis 1, and if human actions harm the earth, despoil it of its goodness, and frustrate its potential, then this biblical teaching becomes a critique of the environmental damage humans have caused, not a justification for it. That the west has undeniable Christian roots does not mean that the Bible is simply there to defend whatever “the west” has become.
Convinced that climate change is the new religion, Abbott argued in his London speech for “less theology”. Actually, Abbott himself needs more Christian theology if he’s going to quote the Bible. As a former seminary student, perhaps he could rekindle his own theological studies. He would discover that the Bible contains literature capable of calling every culture into question, not least “the west”. And he would be better informed for those occasions when he makes theological pronouncements from the various platforms he is given as a former PM.

Here's the pitch: 
Taylor Kitsch is flipping through the job ads in his local newspaper, he's been out of work a while and he's looking for something that's going to pay the bills. All of a sudden the power goes out - he's been cut off - 'if only I'd invested in solar panels instead of an expensive tariff of non-renewable energy' he says. Using the last seconds of juice on his mobile he calls a mysterious number on a BP ad. 'Be at industrial unit 442 in the petroleum-meat packing district at 11pm, come alone'. 
In the world of Taylor Kitsch a paycheque is a paycheque, so he heads down to the industrial unit in the dead of night. Think the industrial estate from the finale of Robocop, but filmed on location in Mansfield - the plumbing supplies store would be edited out in post. Inside the industrial unit is a load of generic oil drums and a green BP branded drilling machine that's fracking loads. All of the workers are wearing little face masks because of the pollution that's spilling out into the warehouse. From the warehouse the pollution is then vented off into the playground of a local primary school. Taylor's shocked, he has a copy of National Geographic in his bathroom, he can't believe someone would willingly destroy the natural world like that. *Twonk* John Browne clacks Taylor over the head with the exhaust unit of a diesel car, knocking him unconscious. 
He awakes sometime later, his vision foggy with PM10's, his temperature blazing like a world without rainforests. Where is he? He tries to move but he can't, he stuck to something. Suddenly lights come on in the room. Several other D-grade celebrities have been sewn together, mouth to anus, like the Emmys directed by Tom Sixx. There's Ludacris, Denise Van Outen and James Corden. The horror. John Browne enters to spout some exposition :
'In order to facilitate the accelerated use of fossil fuels and boost our company profits we have joined you together, the human body being excellent at generating power. Don't think about the science, just know that petro-chemicals are evil'
He then wanders over to Kitsch and starts pouring a tank of gasoline down his throat. He coughs and splutters as it makes it's way down to his belly, igniting in the acids of his stomach. Electrodes planted into James Corden's skull, wired up to the national grid, start crackling. Cut to the living room of a 'nuclear' family - the lights get brighter, the TV louder as the electricity surges into their home. Cut back to the warehouse, a hosepipe stuck up Ludacris' anus starts pumping out treated diesel. Cut to a local gas station, the price of diesel plummets, everyone's buying up and consuming like never before. 
John Browne laughs an evil laugh of pure corporate irresponsibility. Trees wither and die in the new climate, grass turns brown before disintegrating in the sooty winds. It's like storm Ophelia on spice. The world looks to be doomed. 
Michael Jackson's Earth Song kicks in - what's that? it's Elon Musk travelling through the air on a solar panel like the Silver Surfer, the atmosphere clearing up and flowers blooming in his wake. He smashes through the window of the warehouse, hopping from his solar panel which flies toward John Browne, decapitating him. He then pulls apart the Human Centigrade and declares the world saved. We then cut to a epilogue where Taylor Kitsch and the rest of them win a collective Oscar for saving the planet. #OscarsSoGreen.', u'recommendation_count': u'3', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1508416199000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u""the pollution that 's spilling out into the warehouse"", u'effect': u'all of the workers are wearing little face masks'}], u'author_id': u'12827599', u'id': u'107024146', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'PaulieB', u'text': u'No. Has this article been posted from 2011 when this was actually relevant rather than another god awful Gerard Butler film as he struggles to keep his entourage in credit.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1508416085000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'1083130', u'id': u'107024047', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'ID3277273', u'text': u'This comment was removed by a moderator because it didn't abide by our

Climate change deniers argue that the Sun is the main cause of climate change. But the measured energy imbalance occurred during the deepest solar minimum in the record, when the Sun's energy reaching Earth was least. Yet, there was more energy coming in than going out. This shows that the effect of the Sun's variations on climate is overwhelmed by the increasing greenhouse gasses, mainly from burning fossil fuels.

Observed and simulated cloud change patterns are consistent with poleward retreat of mid-latitude storm tracks, expansion of subtropical dry zones, and increasing height of the highest cloud tops at all latitudes.

The models solve the equations of fluid dynamics, and they do a very good job of describing the fluid motions of the atmosphere and the oceans. They do a very poor job of describing the clouds, the dust, the chemistry and the biology of fields and farms and forests. They do not begin to describe the real world we live in.  And, in 2009: 
What has happened in the past 10 years is that the discrepancies between what's observed and what's predicted have become much stronger. It's clear now the models are wrong, but it wasn't so clear 10 years ago.

Some say there are only 7 plot-lines in existence. 
Climate as villain here falls under the umbrella of ""humans meddle with nature - and feels the consequences"". Popular since Jekyll made a potion, Frankenstein explored making life, Eve took a bite of an apple or probably since humans experienced the first tsunami/eruption forest-fire or whatever and attributed it to some violation of divine rules. 
In the last century this narrative has been told as humans meddling with medicine (creating zombies), atoms (creating Godzilla, bad mutants, china syndromes and nuclear winters), chemicals (doing all sorts of bad things - like causing climate change). In LOTR the dwarfs dug so deep from greed that they unleashed a Balrog as an early environmental story. Even meddling with physics, opening wormholes and portals to distant parts of the Universe has a tendency to unleash the revenge of nature upon us. 
Anyways - I do not see Hollywood use climate as anything else than the other ""proxies"" for villains. 
That said - there are exceptions. ""Wall-E"" and ""Up!"" do use modernity and environment as a very tactile and more peaceful backdrop - with little pointing morality and lots of laughter. And Hollywood has also made very relevant biographical movies about the environment (Erin Brockovich). Hence it is possible to make relevant scripts. 
I am, by the way, bummed out by ""geo-farse"", sorry ""Geostorm"". It is a chance blown by exploring much more realistic scenarios of human meddling with Terraforming and correction. 
Problem, of course - slightly more realistic scenarios never approach the speed of nuclear/asteroid impact that allows a script to cover a few days and to allow the CGI-shops to create scenes of cities being crashed in a second by 1000 feet tall waves. 
There are only 7 plot-lines. 
Climate change makes for a very poor villain. The backdrop of climate change could, however, make for a nice back-drop of a political thriller or two (and I do not mean the feeble attempts that James Bond has been given to rescue the world from eco-terrorism). Hollywood had a history of writing thriller-manuscripts of ""secret documents on the loose before the congress is about to vote"" kind of story-lines. 
Personally I would like to see National Lampoon's goes off grid  with the scene with decorating the house with Christmas-lights as an eye-watering memory. 
Just make one such Lampoon movie - where they go through a year of vacations - with zero-carbon footprint. Give us Chevy Chase fixing solar panels on the roof. Let them go on holidays with an EV. Let them have a climate neutral vegan Thanksgiving. 
The pop-industry has not really pondered how funny we are in trying to make the world a bit better, mostly as individuals, since governmental advice and infrastructure is so lacking. 
Let the Lampoons install a huge wind-mill in their garden. Just because someone funny can take that scene and make it crazy funny. Let them wake up and see their effort being shot to pieces because of noise-pollution. Because it would be true
Make room for Donald Trump (as government) tweeting his suggestion of fitting the Mexican wall with solar panels, apparently not knowing exactly where the sun is on a north-south axis. 
I would have loved that film. Because it is as realistic as when the Griswold family graciously moved in with their family in Germany(?). And because - this humour. 
To LOL in the face of the real villain is important. So Hollywood - we are all the Griswolds. Make us laugh.

But climate change is already evident, the Hadley Cell continues to expand polewards, extreme periods of drought, flooding, heat waves and violent storms around the world are increasing, ecosystems are steadily changing, and the fossil CO2 in the atmosphere continues to increase at high rates with no end in sight. The Keeling Curve is nowhere near flat:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeling_Curve
Once the Keeling Curve flattens out, it will still take 50-100 years for the climate to finish catching up.

No. Chemistry is unambiguous:
When you burn a hydrocarbon such as methane in Oxygen you will release CO2.
We have released more CO2 than has been added to atmosphere, therefore, all other sources and sinks of CO2 have had a net negative effect.
The fact that you can account for the long /slow carbon cycle too doesn't mean that we even need to know about this to understand the cause of the CO2:

But it's very slow.
CO2 in rain makes a weak acid, which causes chemical weathering (especially of carbonate rocks like limestone, but of other rocks as well).
Rivers carry the carbon compounds down to the oceans, where various processes (such as the formation of calcareous shells by organisms) eventually deposit the material on the ocean floor.
This is the long, slow, part of the carbon cycle.
After the PETM warming event around 56 million years ago, it took around 20 million years for CO2 levels to fall sufficiently for glaciation to begin in Antarctica, at the Eocene-Miocene transition.
The CO2 was mainly taken up by weathering of the newly-rising Himalayas.

No, human activity is producing over 100 times as much CO2 per year than all the Earth's volcanoes.
For volcanic activity to produce this much CO2 we'd need 2 supervolcanic events per year - they are actually very rare indeed and the last one was over 70,000 years ago.
The extra CO2 has an isotopic mix that shows the carbon is of biological origin - in this case from ancient fossil fuels.
Of course the climate has changed for various reasons in the past, but attribution studies have eliminated the 'natural' factors from responsibility for the current change.
One attribution study is
""A probabilistic quantification of the anthropogenic component of twentieth century global warming"" - Wigley & Santer, 2012.
Their results showed that the expected warming due to all human influences since 1950 (including aerosol effects) is very similar to the observed warming.
Here are two more attribution studies:
""Global temperature evolution 1979–2010"" - Foster & Rahmstorf, 2011
BQSTART
...........we list the linear trend in the signals due to ENSO, volcanic forcing and solar variation in table 3. The magnitudes of these trend contributions are quite small compared to the overall trends. In fact the net trend due to these three factors is negative for all data sets except UAH, for which it is zero. Hence these factors have not contributed to an upward trend in temperature data, rather they have contributed a very slight downward trend.

""Anthropogenic and natural warming inferred from changes in Earth’s energy balance"" - Huber & Knutti 2011
BQSTART
We find that since the mid-twentieth century, greenhouse gases contributed 0.85 °C of warming (5–95% uncertainty: 0.6–1.1 °C), about half of which was offset by the cooling effects of aerosols, with a total observed change in global temperature of about 0.56 °C.

But the incremental death march of the real thing was considered a little too slow for Independence Day’s king of kablooey. So impatient was he to bring forth a biblical flood and subsequent ice age that was epic enough to swallow the Statue of Liberty, Emmerich conspired to make his cataclysm happen in days, not decades, courtesy of a cosmically unlucky (and scientifically unlikely) flash freeze.
In 2017, the desire to accelerate climate change – even in the name of brash, mass-market pop art – is quaint yet horrifying. The nagging feeling that humankind may already have zoomed past some sort of ecological tipping point thanks to our voracious appetites for cheap energy and consumer goods seems increasingly undeniable. Previously, we looked to the multiplex to vicariously experience the catastrophic aftermath of freak super-storms and monster tsunamis; now we see these images appear with increasing and distressing regularity in the news.
Perhaps that is why climate change is a common theme across a broad range of movies this year, either as an obvious baddie or a subtextual spectre. The forthcoming eco-thriller Geostorm optimistically suggests that we could circumvent the cataclysmic heavy weather caused by climate change if only we tasked someone like scientist-astronaut Gerard Butler to invent a network of weather-controlling satellites. But when that system malfunctions, the planet reaps the whirlwind (not to mention mega-storms and tidal waves). Director Dean Devlin, who produced Independence Day with Emmerich, seems keen to outdo his old partner in terms of on-screen mass obliteration, with cities such as Dubai, Tokyo and Moscow in his apocalyptic sights. Whether global audiences will be excited by such destruction after recent natural disasters in Mexico, Sierra Leone, Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, remains to be seen.
Similarly direct is An Inconvenient Sequel, the follow-up to Al Gore’s Oscar-winning documentary, An Inconvenient Truth. The 2006 film was a crucial climate change primer that compiled scary collapsing icebergs and even scarier statistics (in short: tundra-enlightening, very, very frightening). Some reviews suggest the statesman’s sequel – which ponders how to tackle climate change in the increasingly science-sceptical era of Donald Trump – may have been unnecessary as well as inconvenient. But it is not as if the planet’s situation has improved, and Gore’s impassioned yet measured messaging bears repeating.
Postapocalyptic sci-fi will always be a popular film playground, but increasingly it seems as if we are being invited to look at worlds worn out rather that instantly shattered. Before it blasted into space, Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar painted a plausible portrait of the US as a parched, crop-free dustbowl beyond resuscitation. Earlier this year, Logan presented a harsh, scrappy near future that looked as exhausted as its ailing hero, a planet teetering towards a more relatable kind of collapse than the apocalyptic threats of superhero cinema.
The central message of Aronofsky's Mother! is consistent: what is wrong with these people?
Even the imagery and palette of screen dystopias seems informed by freakish weather that climate change has made commonplace. The whooping, bestial carnival of Mad Max: Fury Road seems like one of the only sane responses in a world where 18-wheelers are dwarfed by electrified dust-devil storms that block out the sun. The crimson-choked Las Vegas of Blade Runner 2049, meanwhile, might not even be three decades away; cinematographer Roger Deakins was inspired by the Australian storms of 2009 that gave the Sydney Opera House a Martian makeover (in reality, red topsoil scooped up from the heart of Oz).
A shared anxiety about how we have abused our planet and how it might ultimately retaliate has seeped into recent cinema in other intriguing ways. Darren Aronofsky’s densely allegorical Mother! encourages any number of environmental interpretations, with Jennifer Lawrence as a barefoot earth mother whose Edenic dream home is invaded by selfish, rapacious squatters – an intensifying nightmare that leaves her traumatised but mostly bewildered. Despite its surreal, disorientating escalations, the central message is consistent: what is wrong with these people? How can they do this?
In the forthcoming Downsizing, Oscar-winning writer-director Alexander Payne imagines a near future where eco-conscious Norwegians have developed a sci-fi shrink-ray that can zap people, such as stressed everyman Matt Damon, down to just five inches in height. Everything about this growing community of nu-Lilliputians is smaller – particularly their carbon footprint. In the film, the procedure is marketed as a quasi-altruistic lifestyle choice that doubles as a lottery win, suggesting participants will improve the planet’s sustainability as well as artificially extending their savings. 
Payne’s movie is a sociocomic parable that has the reassuring presence of Damon at its centre, an actor audiences have seen surviving in tough environments. But with the shrinking process irreversible, Downsizing seems to make a subtle but important point, one arguably as frightening as any large-scale disaster movie where a catastrophe annihilates humanity. Any real-world solution to our inescapable climate change problem is likely to be similarly and uncomfortably extreme – an even more inconvenient truth. Until we overcome our indifference to this monumental problem, the outlook is only going to get worse. Where’s Gerard Butler when you need him?

Another was raised by NASA's former lead climate scientist James Hansen in 2016 with his paper Ice melt, sea level rise and superstorms.
In that paper Hansen wrote that shutdown of the AMOC (part of which is popularly known as the Gulf Stream) is more sensitive to freshwater input from the ice sheets than previously thought.
And that the resulting increased horizontal temperature gradient between high and low latitude regions of the N Atlantic would drive superstorms unlike any today.
He provided multiple lines of evidence that during the previous interglacial, at temperatures less than 1 degree C above today, there were storms which moved boulders 10 times the size that modern storms move.
Ocean overturning circulation has been observed to be slowing. Not just the AMOC, but also Antarctic bottom water formation which provides much oxygen to the deep ocean.

“Our results offer evidence that sea level may not rise in an orderly, linear fashion,” says Jeff Nittrouer, a coastal geologist and study coauthor.""
As the glaciologist Richard Alley noted (see talk below), mass loss happens in spurts. As one section of an ice sheet loses its grip on land it slips. So although we know that multi-meter sea level rise is possible in a single century, it’s likely that some decades saw more rise than others.
Think of ice sheet retreat as a retreating army, moving quickly from one hilltop to the next and then pausing.
The 120km wide Thwaites Glacier in West Antarctica can drain 3.3m of sea level rise equivalent of ice which is holding on to an undersea ledge by its fingernails and debris evidence indicates that in the past a section of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet lost its grip on land and slid quickly into the ocean.
 When you look at this graph of post glacial sea level rise, think about how we are now warming more than 10 times as fast as when coming out of previous glaciations.

A big problem regarding this is the concomitant rise in sea level which puts sea levels closer and closer to the top of a coastal defense. This raises the risk of a storm surge breaching the defense, as happened all across New Orleans with Katrina and as a result 1,836 people died.
Many of these coastal places won't go slowly with the drip, drip, drip of sea level rise, but swiftly in catastrophic storms.

Emanuel said that overall it is water, not wind, that causes the vast majority of damage from such storms, though most people underestimate the severity of the water impact. To illustrate the point, he showed a short, dramatic video of a hurricane-produced storm surge striking a building. “It is hydrodynamically the same thing as a tsunami,” he explained, as the clip showed water rushing steadily in and quickly engulfing an entire house. 
“I wish everyone who lives in zones subject to these storms could see films like this,” he said, adding that the scene depicted was clearly not survivable. “Water is the big killer.”

But science can not be applied like that (as climate deniers also learn from their ideological context) 
The earth is not in the process of ""revenge"". Earth is just in the process of gaining new energy equilibrium with the Universe as it is being loaded with certain molecules. Morality is something that is falling out of the sleeve of evolution. Physical reality does not care much about morality, we have learnt. 
Remember - the entire Universe is what science call a ""pretty big thing"" - and it is constructed to instantly kill us life (and morality) in a very short time if we are exposed to it. Imagine the astronauts on the ISS and what the universe would do to them if it made a small hole in their cocoon. The blood inside their veins would instantly reach the pressure-temperature of boiling. 
The laws of universe is very very hostile. And definitely not moral by any human standards. Even the right-wing love of ""survival of the fittest"" as some socio-evolutionary principle of economics becomes rather stupid when confronted with basic laws of the universe. 
Fact is - we are surrounded by a universe that is an estimated minimum 3 times bigger than the speed of light could have travelled since it all came into existence. To the best of our knowledge - this pretty big place is yet to provide even the tiniest planet where we can walk outside in a shorts without near instantly being killed by vacuum, high energy particles from a star or even high energy cosmic radiation originating from big bang itself. Add to this that the universe is more than happy to sling asteroids towards us, making stuff bursting out gamma-rays or collapsing into black hole singularities that are not happy with just pulling our limbs apart - but does not stop until it have pulled the stuff making primary particles of atoms apart. Physics - it is not a moral or friendly place. 
Remember that the oxygen we love and need so much - it killed pretty much everything alive that evolved for billion of years as anoxic because evolution invented a thing called photosynthesis. Science as of today do appreciate anti-oxidants because of this. Oxygen is really not kind to organic carbon-compounds. It makes stuff rust. 
Nature is not moral - because the universe is not moral. 
This fact makes the quote from Carl Sagan interesting. We are star-dust. But it makes another Sagan quote even more interesting. 
BQSTART
We are a way for the cosmos to know itself 
BQEND
To me this quote indicates that we are outside of the pure physics and chemics of he Universe that wish to kill us with some interesting method ranging from cold to vacuum to radiation to little gravity/excess of gravity and more. We - as being consequence of evolution as consequence of big bang could invent morality. Even faith. Even struggle and love and creativity and histories. 
And as such - to make the universe from big bang create self-awareness. A thing so complex that it studies itself by looking back at itself with telescopes. 
And what we learn is that it is not moral. We live despite of - not because of. 
So physics is clearly not a mirror of the human conditions. It refuse to be compared to the kind loving and nurturing thing that we feel under blue sky and above green grass while a gentle summer breeze dry skin and hair after a dip in the ocean. It refuse the similarly ideal image of denial when tiny humans can not affect nature. 
The universe just is. I do not think that mass of the universe (that happens to be more about very dispersed atoms in vacuum and mass and energy we can not even observe than about consciousness want revenge because of some life climbing down from trees a few million years ago). 
Do not claim laws of the Universe for some kind of moral ideology. We are the result of them laws. And we better obey them and act in accordance with them. 
Because the universe is clearly ready to kill us. Even astronauts 400 kms away - safe inside the magnetosphere of this planet are gently killed by the universe long before they journey outside of planet Earth's natural protection. They have to tuck inside from even the cutest solar flare that makes tourists at on the ground go all giddy with aurora and beauty of the universe.

Kind of beautiful, no? It also illustrates that remnants of tropical Hurricanes are not unknown to have hugged the UK in the past - but massively over-represented by them who bounce off the east coast of the US/curls around the ""Azores High"", more or less tracking the core of the ""gulf stream"" (or North Atlantic Current, as better name) as it spins off the subtropical gyre and skips across the Atlantic to hug the Eurasian continent as pretty much an eastern boundary current, ready to become deep-water once the density-engine of heat-loss has done it's thing up in the Nordic Seas. It is really strange to look at the track of Ophelia. Seriously counter-intuitive. 
The whole system gives me a very ""hybrid"" sensation. 
This said - how fantastic has not meteorology become these days? Having observed and monitored the cold winds blowing south-easterly off west Greenland days ago. Predicted that this air will curl up rather forcefully south of the UK days ago. 
Now - that is some serious understanding of physics and number-crunching going on right there. A pretty amazing example of science hard at work over 200 years - or 110 years since Bjerknes outlined weather prediction not only in scientific papers - but also as a series of 3 long ""letters"" to a Norwegian newspaper - which ""obviously"" assumed that the general newspaper-reader were well advanced in solving differential equations and bringing fluid- and thermodynamics together by physics. (now THAT was the days of science communication). 
30 years ago these same physical principles and equations obviously existed (they are from the 19th century) . But the power to apply them and calculate them fast enough at good enough resolution did not exist. So only 30 years ago - many such perfect storms came and bit us badly with hardly any warning. Movies have been made about those old days of the 1980's and 90's where weather could sneak up unnoticed. 
Storms do not do that surprise bite any longer. Neither does climate. Over the last 200 years - science has continued to unmix reality. That so much insight in discovered post WW2 is explained in this figure that shows it is not just driven by computing power - but also numbers of brain-power:

They had not thought it was feasible for hurricanes to head north so near the coast of Europe.
As it was, the cold sea south of Ireland took the sting out of the 15th named storm of a busy Atlantic hurricane season. Even so the winds of up to 100 miles an hour were only just below hurricane strength when they hit the south coast of Ireland.
And Ophelia may be the shape of things to come. To form, tropical storms need sea temperatures to be at least 26C; they usually grow in strength until they make landfall or head over cooler seas. 
Climate change means 26C “tropical seas” are now extending further north. Research tracking these storms has shown this is allowing hurricanes to reach maximum power about 30 miles further north than 10 years ago.
The ability of hurricanes to sustain themselves as they travel north in these warmer seas is expected to be a continuing trend, putting Europe potentially in the firing line for hurricanes.
In the meantime, the main concern in Britain will be storms coming from the west. Brian, the second potentially damaging autumn storm, is out there somewhere in the Atlantic. These storms are named when the Met Office calculates they need to issue weather warnings.
The depressions do not need warm seas to form, although climate change is giving them extra energy and they carry more rain. With the jet stream speeding up the outlook is currently turbulent.

With the UK facing health crises from pollution and inactive living, other plans could include using electric cargo bikes to deliver packages from internet retailers rather than vans, Norman told the Guardian.
Saying his ambition was to “make the transition to a world where a 12-year-old can cycle safely”, Norman said he could not promise extra funding for cycle routes, but said central government could start pushing councils to take more action.
A review into cycling safety announced last month would be broad, possibly including whether cyclists should be forced to wear helmets and high-visibility clothing, Norman said. But he promised any conclusions would be led by evidence.
People buying electric or hybrid cars can receive up to £4,500 off the purchase price through a government subsidy scheme. However, there is no equivalent policy for e-bikes, where a small electric motor provides a boost when the rider pedals.
These are increasingly popular with novice or older cyclists or those facing a hilly or lengthy commute, but can often cost £1,500 or more.
Norman said an e-bike subsidy could happen: “We’ve done some work on that already, and I haven’t looked at the outcomes yet, and they might not be ready yet. There’s a case in principle.”
He said there was “tremendous opportunity” for more packages to be delivered by electric-assist cargo bikes: “If you think about what in terms of local deliveries, a lot of these Amazon deliveries are lighter things – you don’t need a Transit van to be doing that.
“I think e-bikes and ebikes-plus are a really interesting potential way of handling that last mile or two of deliveries.”
Norman, who was appointed in June, faced accusations of anti-cyclist bias last month over his response to the case of Charlie Alliston, who was jailed for killing a pedestrian, Kim Briggs, after hitting her on a bike without a front brake.
After the trial Norman said he would examine a possible new offence of causing death by dangerous cycling, and announced the review of cycle safety. He also wrote a letter to cycling organisations warning them riders should abide by the Highway Code.
Norman said critics had “missed a wider point” that the safety review would also cover the danger posed to cyclists by drivers, including those “using cars in ways that are intentional and punitive”.
Asked if he had experienced dangerous driving while cycling, he replied: “I bike every day, so absolutely.”
On possible laws for helmets and high-visibility clothing, Norman said the review would “ask very general questions and if the feedback is that we should consider that stuff, then we’ll look at it”.
He added: “Obviously there will be some people who feel very strongly that there should be hi-vis, and there will be plenty of people who think very strongly the other way. It’ll be the same with helmets. The literature on risk is quite a well developed one, I don’t need to tell you.”
About 1-2% of trips in the UK are made by bike, considerably fewer than in many other other European countries. 
A report by MPs in 2013 called for a share of 10% by 2025, to be achieved by spending £20 per person annually on cycling provision, notably safe bike lanes.
Norman said the current spend had risen from £2 a head in 2010 to £6 after the launch in April of a new cycling and walking strategy, but he did not know if this would increase further: “Six weeks before the Budget it would be a brave minister indeed who made any pronouncements.”
He raised the idea of a more proactive approach from Westminster over cycling, saying he was “not ruling out” the idea of ministers pushing local councils to do better on the issue, or mandating national standards for bike lanes.
With the advent of driverless vehicles and other moves away from traditional cars, governments needed to think about how road transport was being transformed, Norman said, saying cycling would be key to this.
He said: “It’s not just, if I may say so, the actions of a government which is supportive of cycling, it’s also the actions of a government that understands that the whole nature of the way in which we use the roads, and the way we think about cities, is going to change dramatically over the next decade or two, and possibly earlier. We need to be fully abreast of that.” ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/20/uk-may-consider-electric-vehicle-subsidy-to-increase-cycling

You are an abject failure as PM mate, give it away. You can't lead, you can only follow - and you are following a bunch of science-denying deadshits your party is stupid enough to put up for election. We are paying you to make the hard decisions for the country's future, but once again (just like the asylum seekers) you have taken the easy way out. Get out of our lives and go and sit on your balcony and watch the rest of the world pull up their sleeves and face future challenges - less damage to Australia if you go (and go now).
Where are his supporters Katharine other than in the MSM? The majority of 100s of comments are negative. Simply, no one believes him anymore on anything and rightly so. His own doing.
It was telling at his staged press conference this week with the so called Experts of Energy that very little thought had gone into it let alone the 8 page ""policy"". It had nothing to do with respecting the Australian people's intelligence.
When asked by a journo ""Why is this better than a CET?"" he not only couldn't answer it, he fumbled around looking for someone on his panel who could, and eventually flicked it to John Pierce saying ""would you like to have a go?""......Seriously ??!!
Any media advisor in his office worth an ounce of salt should have prompted this as probably the first negative question he'd be asked. It appears no one including Malcolm saw it coming. Which is evidence that Malcolm reacts with brain farts that are ill thought out, doesn't listen to anyone else's or doesn't seek it, and just thinks he can survive on his belief in his own ""superior intelligence, doesn't worry about what damage he may do to others reputations, and then gets reactive and defensive when caught out with reasonable questions that any dickhead should have seen coming. Most times I am seriously shocked at how dumb he appears. But then I've seen this many times with high IQ narcissists, who have no judgement or emotional awareness, a grandiose self belief and self-interest, and defensiveness and tantrums when people don't automatically fall in line.
Why should anyone, let alone the country, follow this man or prop him up on anything? Which is clearly the question the public is asking, regardless of the media prop up.
The MSM is becoming as ""ideologically"" contaminated as the government because neither are really acting in the public interest which is supposed to be both their charter after all.

A study back in 2014 found Australian fossil fuel subsidies of $4billion per annum.
The Australia Institute around 5 years ago:
It is estimated that those in the fossil fuel business receive more than $10 billion per year in government subsidies, with the mining industry receiving the lion’s share. 
One of those subsidies is the enticingly named Fuel Tax Credit Scheme. It is worth more than $5 billion per year. Under this scheme if you use diesel for transport on non-public roads you do not pay fuel excise tax. 
Originally it was primarily aimed at farmers but the biggest beneficiary is the mining industry.
The huge mining trucks that tower over everything around them are never driven on public roads and actually wouldn’t fit on a normal road. Therefore the diesel that goes into them is covered by this scheme and is tax free. This saves the mining industry billions of dollars every year.
The fossil fuel industry has had benefits for many years prior. 
Further back I believe governments used taxpayer money to build coal fired power stations as well as the grid.
Now Queensland politician Christiansen wants the government using taxpayers money to build a new hele coal fired power station in Queensland.
He thinks this is a good use of our money. But no subsidies for renewables.

I told him that my design parameters were for 50C days. He looked shocked that I understood the thermodynamics better than him.
The old unit could pump a bit over two kilowatts of heat for every one kilowatt of electrical energy. The new unit can do a bit more than four kilowatt for every one kilowatt of electrical energy.
This unit is bit less than half the cost to heat my house than a gas heater. I ran the experiment by using the air-conditioner to heat the house rather than gas and compared the bills. I will ditch the gas supply and install PV panels and battery backup to save even more.

Sean Kelly writes that the Abbott Turnbull conflict reminds him of the Black Knights in Monty Python.
Bleeding outAbbott and Turnbull are slowly destroying each otherBY SEAN KELLY
BQSTART
And so we have Abbott, willing to become more and more absurd, and Turnbull, willing to disappoint and disappoint, with each hoping the other hits the limits of absurdity or disappointment first. If Abbott can’t force Turnbull to call on a spill, he can at least erode his support until a spill becomes inevitable. 
It put me in mind of the Black Knight in Monty Python, declaring “It’s only a flesh wound” after losing both his arms in a duel, insisting on carrying on the fight (by kicking his opponent). Eventually, his opponent tires of him, saying, “What are you going to do, bleed on me?” Only in this scenario we have two Black Knights, each reduced to bleeding on the other, desperately hoping the other bleeds out first.

Confronted by repeated requests from Kevin Rudd’s office to go hard against the then opposition leader Malcolm Turnbull over climate change, the then junior climate change minister Greg Combet asked a sensible question.
Combet recalls in his memoir, The Fights of My Life, that he asked Rudd and the office why Labor would “shit on someone you are trying to do a deal with?”
Well versed in the art of the deal as a union official, Combet thought Labor needed to ease off on Turnbull until it had successfully legislated the carbon pollution reduction scheme.
He feared that Rudd himself, and Rudd’s backroom “were confusing politics and policy outcomes, with the risk that Turnbull would be deposed and we would lose a chance to tackle climate change”.
Combet was spot on. 
Turnbull was deposed, and the government lost that critical opportunity. Combet tried to make good later on, with the second phase of Labor’s climate policy, but that was lost too, because of brutal political short-term-ism from Tony Abbott and his appalling “axe the tax” (that wasn’t a tax) offensive.
Combet’s observations are worth lifting from the vault, because right now, a bunch of parliamentarians who know the country desperately needs an outcome on climate change and energy are preoccupied with, as Combet so colourfully puts it, shitting on each other, for different imperatives.
Before we wade boldly into the muck, let’s first establish what happened this week. Turnbull got an energy and emissions reduction regulatory concept through the Coalition party room – and no one got assassinated.
Abbott was apparently lulled by the victory he thought he’d chalked up with killing Alan Finkel’s clean energy target, and in the ensuing lull, the cabinet, and the bulk of the party room came over the top and signed off on a proposal that looks a lot like a regulated carbon price. By acclamation. That’s really quite something in Coalition terms.
Turnbull emerged with a concept called the national energy guarantee. Calling it a policy is a massive stretch. It’s a prototype. The organising idea is energy retailers would face a reliability obligation, and an emissions reduction obligation.
The concept is not stupid. I’m not as effusive as Bloomberg New Energy Finance, which says the national energy guarantee could well prove “ingenious”, but I’d agree the approach of imposing reliability and emissions reduction obligations on electricity retailers is “elegant”.
There may still be plenty of devil in the detail, but the main flaw, glaringly obvious up front, is a lowball emissions reduction trajectory, which, on the face of it, won’t see Australia meet its Paris commitments, and certainly not at least cost.
So the bottom line is Turnbull produced something this week that isn’t perfect, but can be worked with.
But before we start pinning medals on anyone’s chests, and sending off herograms, we need to contemplate the muck.
The developments of this week are only the start of a multi-stage process to deliver a practical policy outcome – a process involving several stakeholders.
If this idea is ever going to see the light of day, Turnbull must first persuade the states, which have to implement it. Right now, several state leaders are furious about being dealt out of Canberra’s deliberations.
If this seems a bit precious on the part of the premiers, bear in mind the states have just worked through the Finkel review; months of process and deliberation, and they thought they were getting an entirely different policy framework, not the one that just dropped out of the sky.
Jay Weatherill in South Australia also went through a previous iteration when he tried to lead a (largely) cooperative conversation about an emissions trading scheme for electricity. The federal energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, looked interested in that idea for 24 hours before he dropped that one too.
Further back, Weatherill had tried, with Mike Baird, to help Turnbull open up a debate on the GST early in his prime ministership, a bit of cooperative federalism that caused some tensions in the Labor fraternity. But Turnbull backed off that one as well.
That potted history might help explain the explosion from Adelaide this week.
While the premiers might calm down, we also need to be aware the new federal policy hasn’t landed in a vacuum. Queensland is about to go into an election. Weatherill in South Australia is shaping up for a brutal three-cornered contest early next year. Tasmania and Victoria follow in 2018.
Having tried to be constructive through the Finkel process, then been provoked by Turnbull’s “ambush” (as Weatherill puts it), some premiers might now cut their losses, seeing benefit in having a cage fight with Canberra over the future of renewable energy.
The states aren’t Turnbull’s only problem.
While the prime minister has pushed his concept successfully through the party room, that milestone doesn’t end the internal conversation. I predict that some right wingers in the Coalition will continue to quibble and fight every step of this journey.
Even if elements of the right and the restless suddenly find some generosity of spirit, there is a reasonably widespread view around the Coalition that climate and energy needs to be a point of significant political differentiation between the government and the opposition.
There is a view Turnbull needs to muscle up to his political opponents, and seek out conflict.
There’s just one small problem. These opponents are the same people the prime minister will need to turn his energy concept into law.
The energy sector and big business groups have made it clear that the only settlement that will work is a bipartisan one – that major party agreement is the only way to give people confidence to make the investments they will need to make.
So Turnbull is being yanked in several different directions.
The cross-currents explain the mixed messages. We see a prime minister who says he wants to settle the decade-long climate wars, and a prime minister who says he has a “game changing” policy to allow him to achieve that.
But the same prime minister also makes a point of excoriating the people he needs to deliver the outcome. People who need a deal generally don’t seek to execute one by calling their joint venture partners idiots and ideologues, but that’s what Turnbull does on a regular basis.
As Combet pointed out in 2009, that sort of too-clever-by-half politicking can get you into trouble. It can sink the boat you really want to sail.
Labor too has got to make some grown-up decisions.
While some in the party are attracted to Turnbull’s concept provided there is scope to scale up the ambition on emissions reduction, the opposition in Canberra feels no great pressure to rush to a decision on a policy that is only a prototype, and which can be made or broken by the states.
There is a view Turnbull needs to carry his own water with the premiers.
While leaving its collective options open, Labor has been quick this week to poke the hornet’s nest of the Coalition’s internals by pointing out that the national energy guarantee looks a lot like a price on carbon.
Partly, this goading is about Labor giving itself cover in the event it decides to support the policy. It’s a bit of virtue signalling to progressive voters that the concepts of the Neg are actually respectable, even though it looks like a sop to coal.
But it’s also about needling. Turnbull is vulnerable if the party room senses a swifty has been pulled, and Labor knows it. So, some trolling.
While it’s always naive to declare there should be no politics in politics, this issue has some special characteristics.
Because the last decade has been such a monumental botch-up, we are running out of workable policy options. We are also running out of time to execute an orderly transition that reduces emissions and keeps the lights on.
That’s the sum of the past stupidity. So politicians need to be a bit careful before relegating an idea that could be made to work.
Last weekend, I asked whether Turnbull was a political leader who could deliver what Australia needed on climate and energy.
This week, the prime minister assumed the posture of statesman, flanked by a trailing Jedi council of energy regulators – but styling, and an eight-page letter from the Energy Security Board, isn’t an outcome.
So my question about Turnbull persists, unresolved, and this weekend, I can add another one. 
Can all the key players in our political system be grown-ups, rise above frustrations, past botch-ups and petty intrigues, and come together to consider an issue on its merits, and ultimately act in the national interest?",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/21/at-least-for-once-dont-let-politicking-kill-off-a-workable-energy-policy

Of course the climate has changed for various reasons in the past, but attribution studies have eliminated the 'natural' factors from responsibility for the current change.
One attribution study is
""A probabilistic quantification of the anthropogenic component of twentieth century global warming"" - Wigley & Santer, 2012.
Their results showed that the expected warming due to all human influences since 1950 (including aerosol effects) is very similar to the observed warming.
Here are two more attribution studies:
""Global temperature evolution 1979–2010"" - Foster & Rahmstorf, 2011
BQSTART
...........we list the linear trend in the signals due to ENSO, volcanic forcing and solar variation in table 3. The magnitudes of these trend contributions are quite small compared to the overall trends. In fact the net trend due to these three factors is negative for all data sets except UAH, for which it is zero. Hence these factors have not contributed to an upward trend in temperature data, rather they have contributed a very slight downward trend.
BQEND
""Anthropogenic and natural warming inferred from changes in Earth’s energy balance"" - Huber & Knutti 2011
BQSTART
We find that since the mid-twentieth century, greenhouse gases contributed 0.85 °C of warming (5–95% uncertainty: 0.6–1.1 °C), about half of which was offset by the cooling effects of aerosols, with a total observed change in global temperature of about 0.56 °C.

In addition the western diet, which is high in meat, is having a major negative effect on lack of sufficient food. For every kilogram of meat produced, it takes at least 2 kilograms of grain or fish. This is more food, being fed to animals, to make ... less food. In addition, animal pasture is space hungry, whilst crops are a much more efficient use of arable land, so far more food in the form of crops can be grown in the same area, than meat can be produced.

Noise is a standard scientific and statistical term used across many disciplines when looking at data sets.
For example, today where I am, is warmer than yesterday. Both days were in Autumn. Despite today being warmer, statistically in Autumn we experience cooling as we go in towards Winter and statistically Summer is warmer than Autumn . That is the trend jhvance refers to.
AGW is also not a story. It has strong scientific roots going back 100+ years, which is based ons strong empirical Evidence(TM) that has been observed for 100+ years.

This is well known amongst scientists and informed people.
GMSLR is not uniform across the planet. This is due to a many to many relationship in GMSLR.
For example, Scotland is rising, whilst SE Britain is sinking, due to isostatic rebound effects.
This is one example of one of the many effects relating to local changes in sea level.

I find your comment reactionary.
No one is suggesting that the Earth doe snot change.
However, the current observed changes are due to human activity, which we know about, and could prevent.
It is only to lax and delinquent behaviour by the biggest polluters that we do not cease such behaviour, and stop the human cost we are seeing.
Further, suggesting people move is naive in the extreme, as we can see the reaction of other local countries such as Australia, who are hardly rushing to welcome refugees with open arms. So free movement of people has also ended thanks to national borders and reactionary policies.

No.

As you fly in to the main island of South Tarawa, located less than 100 kms from the equator, a precariously thin strip of sand and green materialises out of the ocean.
On one side, a narrow reef offers some protection to the inhabitants and their land – at low tide, at least. On the other side, a shallow lagoon reaches kilometres out to sea. The 33 islands of Kiribati – pronounced “Kiribass” – are extremely shallow; the highest point on many of the islands such as South Tarawa is just a couple of metres above sea level. Looking out of the aeroplane window, there is no depth to the scene – sea dissolves seamlessly into sky, a paint palette of every blue
Kiribati is estimated to have a population of just over 100,000, with more than half making their home on South Tarawa. There’s only one road on the island and everything travels along it: schoolchildren, hospital patients, food, water, workers, taxis, minibuses, private cars, and motor scooters.
When I was last here four years ago the road was in a very poor state – a reflection of the country’s perilous economic position. Potholes and washaways were common, and the speed bumps were severe enough to rip out the front end of your car unless great care was taken. 
Australia provided just under 30% of the A$77m (US$60.4m) cost of the Kiribati Road Rehabilitation Project. It was the largest economic infrastructure investment in the country since the second world war, and has made a substantial difference to the quality of life on South Tarawa. However, Kiribati is facing greater challenges which infrastructure alone cannot repair.
Climate change is a huge concern. Rising ocean waters are threatening to shrink Kiribati’s land area, increase storm damage, destroy its crop-growing lands and ultimately displace its people long before the islands are submerged.
Lack of fresh water is an immediate problem. Fresh water lies under the atolls and islands of Kiribati in what are known as a “water lenses”. Fresh water, which is less dense, floats on top of the denser salt water in a convex shape giving the sources their name. However, king tides and sea incursions are polluting the once-reliable sources and ruining the taro plant pits, known as babai pits, which depend on them.
Claire Anterea, one of the co-ordinators of Kirican, the Kiribati Climate Action Network, says she fears the “extraordinary impact on our islands”. 
Having yesterday witnessed the effects of sea incursions on vegetable growth on the island of Abaiang, she says: “It has just moved me into tears. Like, oh my God, this is very serious. [The sea] is two or three metres from the babai pit [where taro plants are grown].
“I feel hopeless in one way that our people are suffering, but I also have the hope within our people that they will try to find a way to adapt.”
At the southern end of Abaiang in the village of Tebontebike, Maria Tekaie leans against an uprooted coconut tree that used to be 100 metres from the shore. The village had to be moved recently, as did the babai pits, due to the incursion of the sea.
The 65-year-old expects to have to move again: “My children are worried and have started to talk about where else they can go. This is the only piece of land for us and they love it here,” she said. 
“I just want the world to know, and my request to them is that we need help to protect our land because if we try to build something like a seawall the waves are stronger and we don’t know what option that we have. We just need help from you.”
Eighty minutes north along the bumping and tortuous dirt road is the village of Tebunginako. It’s the most graphic example of sea inundation. Toroua Beree, 63, says: “I moved away from this village because they don’t have any more life on this piece of land.
“I talk about life because before this land was full of banana, babai, coconut trees, so many coconut trees, so many trees we get food from, but now how can those trees continue to live when you don’t have fresh water to give them? This is community land and so everybody has a right to live on it but now it seems like the sea has taken that away.”
John Kaboa, 28, and his wife, Tinaai, run the Tebero Te Rau bungalow resort on Abaiang. Their optimism is typical of the spirit and entrepreneurship that runs hand in hand with fear and despair.
The accommodation sits on stilts over the water and the resort is powered with solar panels and a small, portable generator. Kaboa grows enough vegetables and fruit – such as cabbages, egg plants, papaya, pumpkin, watermelon, longbean, sweet pepper, taro, giant swamtaro and coconut tree – to supply his kitchen. He also buys local produce from farmers on the island in preference to buying imported products. And he has become involved in production of copra, the dried kernel of coconut which is used to extract oil for cooking, hair oils, shampoo, margarine and detergents. 
Kaboa says he is hoping “to get enough money so that I can support my family to move to other countries if Kiribati will covered by the seawater. But I still really love my paradise country.”
Elsewhere, I meet a Swiss man who is growing vegetables hydroponically in PVC pipes. Each pipe has been elevated on racks to keep the plants safely away from the crabs who are a constant menace to crops grown in the ground.
In March 2016 Taneti Maamau became the new president of the Republic of Kiribati. The elections swept away 12 years of BTK (Boutokaan Te Koaua) party rule along with the outgoing president Anote Tong, who had spent many of those years on the world stage raising awareness of the problems his low-lying island nation was facing due to climate change. 
The new government is more inward focussed. Its long-term project is Kiribati Vision 20 (KV20), which looks ahead 20 years. The plan is to plough revenue generated by fishing licences and tourism back into the Kiribati economy to reduce unemployment, raise education standards and reduce poverty. Kiribati earned A$197.8m in 2015 from the sale of fishing licences, up from A$29.5m in 2009. 
The new government has also doubled the price of copra to A$2 per kilo. This made the average sack of copra worth about A$200 – a large sum on Kiribati. The idea of this initiative is to entice people to travel back to their outer island homes and take pressure off the heavily populated South Tarawa. It seems to have had an immediate effect. 
But opposition MPs believe the doubling of the copra price will mean that people sacrifice their healthy subsistence lifestyle in favour of the more profitable copra production. They also worry that the government’s dedication to domestic progress will be futile given Kiribati’s future will ultimately be determined on the global stage.
Tong, the former president, sits on the seawall that protects his house. His extended family live all around him. 
His public speeches have tracked his emotions regarding the fortunes of the I-Kiribati people from frustration to anger to a sense of futility. He says he grieves for what is happening to his country. 
“Climate change for most if not all of the countries in the Pacific is a survival issue,” he says. “If we do not address the climate change challenge, all of our efforts in trying to achieve economic survival, economic viability all will come to nought.
“[Since leaving office] I’m at home, I’m seeing my grandchildren grow up, and the question that is always on my mind [is]: ‘What’s going to happen to my grandchildren in 20, 30, 40, 50 years time?’”
I ask him: will the residents of Kiribati become climate refugees? “I think we have no excuse, we have more than enough time to deal with it,” he says.
Following the Paris agreement on climate change – and despite the withdrawal of the US under Donald Trump – Tong feels there is now momentum for addressing the challenge. However, he notes that capping global temperature increases at “two degrees or 1.5 degrees does not mean a great deal for countries like Kiribati for whom the projected sea level rise will continue to be disastrous”. 
Tong hopes Australia and New Zealand will support Kiribati’s cause at the United Nations’ framework convention on climate change in Germany next month. “If Australia and New Zealand are not there, it really puts into question the meaning of any relationship [we have] with Australia and New Zealand.”
Unfortunately, in Australia climate change has been used as a political punchline. In 2015, the Australian immigration minister Peter Dutton made a joke about rising sea levels in Kiribati to the then prime minister Tony Abbott. After Abbott complained that the Pacific Islands Forum in Papua New Guinea ran later, Dutton said: “Time doesn’t mean anything when you’re, you know, about to have water lapping at your door.”
During my conversation with Tong, I purposefully re-use those words and a brief flash of anger crosses over his normally peaceful face. He replies: “Well, actually, it does come into the door ... it’s not funny to the person being hurt.” 
His sentiments are echoed by many of the residents of Kiribati, including Anterea. “I think you are too comfortable in your own country,” she says. “Just come to Kiribati and see with your own two eyes what we are suffering from.”
This story has been corrected. Previously it stated that the highest point in Kiribati is just two metres above sea level; it now states that the highest point on many of the islands such as South Tarawa is just a couple of metres above sea level.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/23/waiting-for-the-tide-to-turn-kiribatis-fight-for-survival

Temperatures have soared above 37C (98.6F) in parts of the South Island, with records broken in Dunedin, Wanaka, Christchurch and many other cities and towns.
Temperatures are expected to peak on Tuesday or Wednesday around the high 30s or 40C mark – highs that are proving particularly challenging for school children as many New Zealand classrooms are equipped with heaters but not air conditioners.
Ben Noll, a meteorologist from the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (Niwa), said unusually warm sea temperatures were the major factor contributing to the heatwave, as the mainland experienced a dramatic rise in land temperatures as soon as the sea rose above average. Niwa has recorded seas of 24C to 26C around Auckland, compared with 18C to 22C at the same time last year.
New Zealand was tracking towards its warmest January on record, Noll said, with high temperatures expected to continue into February.
He added: “In New Zealand its quite rare to get above 30C or even 35C, so New Zealanders are finding this tough because it’s not something they’re accustomed to.
“We have no fans left and air conditioning is much less prevalent than in many other countries.”
The Howard League for Penal Reform told RNZ it had heard reports of prisoners fainting from the extreme heat in unventilated cells and of prison guards struggling to cope in stab-resistant body armour.
The chief coroner, Judge Deborah Marshall, issued a warning for people with health issues to take extra precautions, after a woman died in Christchurch from heatwave conditions. Hospitals around the country have reported an increase in patients – many of them elderly – presenting with heat stress and severe sun exposure.
A nationwide shortage of fans prompted prime minister Jacinda Ardern to improvise, with her partner Clarke Gayford refurbishing a broken fan to keep the couple cool. 
“Climate change means summer temperatures are expected to rise across both the North and South Island, increasing the risk of heat stress and subtropical diseases,” said associate health minister Julie Anne Genter.
“Climate change is also likely to result in more droughts, wildfires, floods and infectious disease across the country. These are potentially big challenges for the health sector and I want to make sure it is ready to tackle them.”
Ardern has called tackling climate change “my generation’s nuclear-free moment”. 
The regions of Otago and Southland were expected to declare drought conditions this week after months of little to no rain. Some cattle and sheep farmers have taken to moving stock in the middle of the night to avoid the heat.
Droughts have already been declared in the lower North Island and the South Island’s west coast, with the government offering farmers emergency relief funding. 

New Zealand’s current hottest temperature on record was 42.4C, recorded in Rangiora in the South Island in February 1973, according to Niwa.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/30/new-zealand-heatwave-health-alerts-scramble-fans

And the problem is growing: with costs falling and kitchen appliances becoming “status” items, owners are throwing away microwaves after an average of eight years, pushing rising sales.
A study by the University of Manchester worked out the emissions of carbon dioxide – the main greenhouse gas responsible for climate change – at every stage of microwaves, from manufacture to waste disposal.
“It is electricity consumption by microwaves that has the biggest impact on the environment,” say the authors, who also calculate that the emissions from using 19 microwaves over a year are the same as those from a car.
“Efforts to reduce consumption should focus on improving consumer awareness and behaviour to use appliances more efficiently. For example, electricity consumption by microwaves can be reduced by adjusting the time of cooking to the type of food.”
Each year more microwaves are sold than any other type of oven in the EU: annual sales are expected to reach 135m by the end of the decade.
David Reay, professor of carbon management at the University of Edinburgh, pointed out that the damage done by microwaves is still a fraction of that done by cars. “Yes, there are a lot of microwaves in the EU, and yes they use electricity,” he said. 
“But their emissions are dwarfed by those from cars – there are around 30m cars in the UK alone and these emit way more than all the emissions from microwaves in the EU. Latest data show that passenger cars in the UK emitted 69m tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2015. This is 10 times the amount this new microwave oven study estimates for annual emissions for all the microwave ovens in the whole of the EU.”
The energy used by microwaves is lower than any other form of cooking. uSwitch, the price comparison website, lists microwaves as the most energy efficient, followed by a hob and finally an oven, advising readers to buy a microwave if they don’t have one. However, they urge owners to switch them off at the wall after use, to avoid powering the clock.
“Yes, it’s important to use microwaves efficiently,” said Simon Bullock, senior climate change campaigner for the charity Friends of the Earth. “But so is making sure the electricity that powers them is as low pollution as possible. The government should reverse its policy attacks on solar and onshore wind. We need green electrons powering all the nation’s tellies, microwaves and fridges.”
Alejandro Gallego-Schmid, one of the report’s authors, said: “The aim of our study was not to compare microwaves to other cooking appliances but to look at the environmental impacts of microwaves as ubiquitous devices in households in Europe and draw attention to the need to make their design, use and end-of-life waste management more efficient.”
The report also reveals that the lifespan of microwaves has reduced by nearly seven years over the last 20 years – from more than a decade to six-eight years. By the end of this decade 16m microwaves are expected to be discarded each year. 
“Given that microwaves account for the largest percentage of sales of all types of oven in the EU, it is increasingly important to start addressing their impact on resource use and end-of-life waste,” said Gallego-Schmid. 
Existing regulation is not enough to reduce those environmental impacts, and specific regulations are needed for microwaves, says the report.
“My microwave’s not too high impact at the moment,” said Bullock. “It’s broken, waiting in a corner for me to work out where best to recycle it.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/18/europe-microwave-ovens-emit-nearly-as-much-co2-as-7m-cars

If not, I'm not sure why you think you can critically assess climate models.
But the crux of your issue seems to be:
""But hey lets have a panic seeing as the US has now lost control of the worlds energy resources.""
Surely the whole point of responding to climate change is to actually give each country and community and, most importantly of all, consumer, greater control over their energy resources.
Renewables are, by definition, more localised. Solar has to be consumed where it is produced. Same with wind and wave. Indeed, renewables can even allow some people to come off the grind. It doesn't get any more liberating than that.
Why is the fossil fuel industry resisting climate change?
Because its evil?
No. The reason is because fossil fuel requires higher start up costs and is more centralised. In short the fossil fuel industry is a natural monopoly/oligopoly. This gives the companies who operate in that market enormous power. They can set higher prices and achieve greater profit because they're not as exposed to competition. 
Most renewables have the potential to open up the energy market to competition. If you consider yourself to be a ""free market capitalist"" you should support renewables. 
The one renewable that still has the potential to maintain a degree of uncompetiveness is nuclear. That's why the traditional energy providers support nuclear. Because it doesn't threaten their monopolies. It's also the reason I support nuclear. Because there's less resistance coming from vested interests in the energy market. 
I consider the downsides to an uncompetitive energy market to be less severe than the downsides to climate change so I'm on board with nuclear.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1515711671000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'fossil fuel requires higher start up costs and is more centralised', u'effect': u'the reason is'}, {u'cause': u""they 're not as exposed to competition"", u'effect': u'achieve greater profit'}], u'author_id': u'2979908', u'in_reply_to': u'110659929', u'id': u'110728806', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'SFromNl', u'text': u'Nice misquote by the way, last straw when the reality is in your disadvantage.', u'recommendation_count': u'3', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1515681956000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'17048054', u'in_reply_to': u'110708982', u'id': u'110709185', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'SFromNl', u'text': u'Catching on to what?

That means for a year to have the highest temp it has a 1 in 100 chance of happening. Not great odds, but not terrible either.
BQEND
As PeaBea pointed out the more informative question is what the odds are of repeated records --we should be looking for trends not merely for exceptional instances.
The 5 hottest years (not yet including 2017) over those 100 years (actually the instrumental record goes back further, but we'll err in your favour) were, in descending order, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2010, and 2013. The probability of the 5 hottest years all occurring in the same decade would have to be in the order of 10^-5. The probability of them all occurring over the last 10 years would be in the order 10^-6. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that might be p=0.0000035. In any case, even give or take an order of magnitude, tremendously ""terrible"" odds.
Of course this doesn't even take into account that the 7th (2009), 9th (2012) and 10th (2007) hottest years also occurred from 2007-2016 (again not counting 2017 yet). In other words of those last 10 years only 2 years (2008, 2011) were not in the top 10 hottest years over the instrumental record. The probability of that happening by chance alone, you will realise, is vanishingly small.
Moreover since this is what, at first gloss at least, theory would predict were the concentration of known forcing gases in the atmosphere to be increased, we have a far more likely explanation than dumb (and highly improbable) chance already at hand. Science, huh?

That is indeed the far more pertinent question than asking about the chances of any single year being a new record.

You also need to acknowledge the fact that we are having more record highs even with an increasing dataset. In other words, if there was no external forcing it should be getting less likely that we have record or close to record years.

Projected future changes in global tropical cyclone (TC) activity are assessed using 5,000 year scale ensemble simulations for both current and 4 K surface warming climates with a 60 km global atmospheric model. The global number of TCs decreases by 33% in the future projection. Although geographical TC occurrences decrease generally, they increase in the central and eastern parts of the extra tropical North Pacific. Meanwhile, very intense (category 4 and 5) TC occurrences increase over a broader area including the south of Japan and south of Madagascar. The global number of category 4 and 5 TCs significantly decreases, contrary to the increase seen in several previous studies. Lifetime maximum surface wind speeds and precipitation rate are amplified globally. Regional TC activity changes have large uncertainty corresponding to sea surface temperature warming patterns. TC-resolving large-ensemble simulations provide useful information, especially for policy making related to future climate change.

The Earth warmed out of the last glacial stage until around 9,000 years ago - initially due to astronomical cycles, but boosted by CO2 coming out of the warming oceans.
Then the temperature was (nearly) stable for about 4,000 years - this is called the Mid-Holocene Climatic Optimum, or Mid-Holocene Warm Period.
Then, about 5,000 years ago, it began to cool very very slowly - until humans began to add lots of CO2 to the air as the Industrial Revolution developed.
Then it started to warm quickly, reversing the cooling trend.
Temperatures at points in the Mid-Holocene Climatic Optimum might have been (just about) as warm as in the later 20th century, but only in the summer and only in the northern hemisphere.
Now, in the early 21st century, the Earth is quite possibly warmer than any time since the Eemian interglacial over 115,000 years ago.
The Eemian was warmer than the Holocene because of higher insolation conditions.
CO2 was last over 400 ppm in the Pliocene.
Global average temperatures then eventually reached 3 or 4 degrees C (5.4-7.2 degrees F) higher than today’s and as much as 10 degrees C (18 degrees F) warmer at the poles.
Sea level ranged between five and 40 metres (16 to 131 feet) higher than today.
Earth systems take time to respond to forcings.
For example, sea level can't suddenly rise on that scale, because it takes time for enough heat to be accumulated to melt enough ice.', u'recommendation_count': u'7', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1515601068000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'higher insolation conditions', u'effect': u'the eemian was warmer than the holocene'}, {u'cause': u'it takes time for enough heat to be accumulated to melt enough ice', u'effect': u""for example sea level ca n't suddenly rise on that scale""}], u'author_id': u'2923581', u'in_reply_to': u'110638707', u'id': u'110666127', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'rockyrex', u'text': u'You mean dozens of governments, of a wide range of different political types, have been plotting to bribe scientists for many decades?

Real sceptical scientists investigated this matter.
They set up a project called Berkeley Earth in 2010.
They found independent funding, including from sceptics in the business community.
Many so-called climate sceptics said this was exactly what they wanted, and they would accept what BE reported.
The first phase of the project took about 2 years.
When BE then reported that their research agreed with other researchers that:
- the Earth is warming;
- has been since the 19th century;
- and that greenhouse gases produced by human activity are the cause....
- suddenly the so-called climate sceptic websites rejected BE, and never mention it.
The sceptical scientists, of course, now accepted that their check on other scientists' work had confirmed that the science published on this matter is good science - because those sceptical scientists were real sceptics.
Going back even further, when Exxon got its own scientists to investigate climate change in the 1970s, those scientists found that CO2 from burning fossil fuels was causing global temperatures to rise.
Exxon didn't tell anyone of course.
Not their shareholders, for example.

A study by Myles Allen and colleagues at Oxford University, for example:
""Test of a decadal climate forecast"" - Allen et al, 2013
compared climate forecasts that begin in 1996 with the actual temperatures observed since.
They found that the simulations accurately predicted the warming experienced in the past decade to within a few hundredths of a degree.

Heat and ocean acidification are associated with the biggest ever marine extinction, the End-Permian.
The Palaeozoic reef-building corals were major victims.
All the early reef-building corals (the Rugose and Tabulate corals) vanished in the End-Permian mass extinction event, around 250 million years ago, and there were no reef-building corals at all in the earlier part of the Triassic - which lasted several million years.
The new reef-builders, the Scleractinian corals, which still exist today, evolved from a different line of coelenterates, first appearing in Middle Triassic rocks.
They don't appear to be closely related to the extinct tabulate or rugose corals, and probably arose independently from a sea anemone-like ancestor.
The ocean chemistry simply made it impossible for corals to form their structures, and these new reef-builders did not appear until the oceans had stabilised.... after several million years.

Untrue. In the long run, climate models have done very well. 
The IPCC first published temperature projections back in 1990. Nearly 30 years later, those projections have proven remarkably accurate. 
On the other hand, predictions that warming would stop (+/- cooling) have been... well, hopeless.

The bureau’s annual climate statement released on Wednesday revealed 2017 was Australia’s third-hottest year on record, with the annual national mean temperature 0.95C above the average. 
It meant the 11-year mean temperature between 2007 and 2017 was now the highest on record, and seven of Australia’s 10 warmest years had occurred since 2005.
“Despite the lack of an El Niño – which is normally associated with our hottest years – 2017 was still characterised by very warm temperatures,” the agency’s head of climate monitoring, Karl Braganza, said.
The national mean temperature of 22.76C – or 0.95C above the long-term average – was the third-highest since records began in 1910. 
The bureau said background warming associated with climate change had seen Australian annual mean temperatures increase by about 1.1C since 1910, and most of that warming had occurred since 1950.
Will Steffen, a climate change expert from the Climate Council, said the exceptionally warm year included “some of the worst impacts of climate change seen in Australia to date”, including severe heatwaves and devastating coral bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef.
“Another year has passed and we have another set of records driven by intensifying climate change,” he said. 
“In recent days Australians have felt the impact of a disruptive climate, with a severe heatwave across the south-east. Parts of the Hume Highway melted in the heat and on Sunday the temperature at Penrith hit 47.3 degrees Celsius, making it the hottest place on Earth during that 24-hour period.”
Both day and night-time temperatures were warmer than average, with the maximum for the year the second-highest on record. Prolonged high sea surface temperatures led to the first instance of back-to-back years of mass coral bleaching events on the Great Barrier Reef.
“Australia has been looking at an increased frequency of heatwaves and other extremes that have been positively associated with climate change,” Braganza said.
Australia’s above average temperatures coincided with what the bureau called an “exceptionally warm” year globally, part of a continuing trend. 
The estimated global mean temperature for 2017 was 0.09C above the 1961 to 1990 average, and the bureau said it was “likely 2017 will be the second or third-warmest year on record since 1850”. 
The warmest two years were 2016 and 2015, records that were assisted by a strong El Niño, making 2017 the hottest year so far without the assistance of the weather pattern. 
Global temperatures increased by just over 1C since the pre-industrial period, and all of the 10 warmest years on record occurred between 1998 and the present.
In the United States, 2017 was typified by climate-related disasters: California’s hottest-ever summer helped contribute to the state’s record wildfire season, while researchers believe global warming helped boost Hurricane Harvey’s record rainfall.
But the year was also dominated by climate denial, particularly in the US where the president, Donald Trump, led a dramatic withdrawal from efforts to curb global warming.
In June he announced the US would withdraw from the Paris climate accord, confirming the fears around the world of scientists and politicians about the US’s repositioning on climate change.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/10/australia-had-third-hottest-year-ever-in-2017-weather-bureau-says

For the first time in more than 40 years, the largest source of greenhouse gas pollution in the US isn’t electricity production but transport – cars, trucks, planes, trains and shipping.
 Emissions data has placed transport as the new king of climate-warming pollution at a time when the Trump administration is reviewing or tearing up regulations that would set tougher emissions standards for car and truck companies. Republicans in Congress are also pushing new fuel economy rules they say will lower costs for American drivers but could also weaken emissions standards. 
 Opponents of the administration fret this agenda will imperil public health and hinder the effort to address climate change. 
 “This Environmental Protection Agency doesn’t seem to have met an air regulation that it likes,” said Mary Nichols, chair of the California Air Resources Board and a former EPA assistant administrator. “I’ve not seen any evidence that this administration knows anything about the auto industry, they just seem to be against anything the Obama administration did.
“Vehicle emissions are going up, so clearly not enough is being done on that front. The Trump administration is halting further progress at a critical point when we really need to get a grip on this problem.”
The 1970 Clean Air Act, signed by Richard Nixon, set standards for a cocktail of different pollutants emitted from new vehicles. New cars and trucks, which account for more than 80% of transport emissions, now have to meet fuel efficiency standards and display this information to consumers. This approach has helped cleanse previously smog-laden American cities and tamp down greenhouse gas emissions.
 But in 2016, about 1.9bn tons of carbon dioxide emissions were emitted from transportation, up nearly 2% on the previous year, according to the Energy Information Administration. This increase means that transport has overtaken power generation as the most polluting sector in the country, and it’s likely to stay that way. 
 Cheap gasoline prices have led to a recent uptick in vehicle emissions, despite the fuel standards, at the same time that coal is being rapidly displaced by an abundance of cheap natural gas and the steady rise of renewable energy, driving a sharp decline in CO2 emissions from the power grid. 
 While coalminers have lost their jobs to technological advancement and environmental protesters have thrown their bodies in the path of oil pipelines, there has been far less to disrupt the basic emissions-emitting models of cars, trucks and planes. 
Americans are buying larger cars and taking more flights – domestic aviation emissions grew 10% between 2012 and 2016 – and face little opposition in doing so.
 “The change in power generation has been very impressive over the past 10 to 15 years,” said Brett Smith, assistant director of the Center for Automotive Research.
 “In the automotive sector, there isn’t the same push. There are certainly Americans concerned about global warming but people are driving bigger and bigger vehicles each year. It’s not a priority for them. The cost of fuel is pretty cheap and at the moment there isn’t a better option out there than the internal combustion engine.”
 Transport accounts for about a quarter of all US planet-warming emissions but also poses a direct health threat to about 45 million Americans who live, work or attend school within 300ft of roads that are shrouded in high air pollution levels. 
 This pollution can stunt lung growth, trigger asthma attacks, exacerbate heart disease and cause developmental problems. The EPA estimates 17,000 schools across the US are located next to roads with heavy traffic, with children from low-income and minority groups disproportionately put at risk. California is the only state in the US to ban the construction of a school on the cheap land found beside major highways. 
 US cities haven’t emulated the likes of London and Stockholm by charging drivers a congestion fee to coax them on to public transport, cycling or walking; nor does the US feature the comparatively high rates of fuel tax seen in Europe. France’s move to ban sales of petrol and diesel cars by 2040 would be politically unthinkable in the States. But the air is much cleaner in American cities than it was in the 1970s, and a world away from the fug that now envelops Beijing and Delhi, in part due to vehicle emissions standards that have progressively been ratcheted up by the EPA. 
 That trajectory has been cast in doubt by the Trump presidency. In March, the EPA scrapped a deal struck between Barack Obama’s administration and automakers that would require new cars to run 54.4 miles per gallon of fuel, up from 27.5 miles per gallon, by 2025. 
 The White House said the new rules had been “shoved down the throats” of car makers, with the main industry lobby group pointing out that consumers overwhelmingly prioritize safety, driving performance and value for money over fuel efficiency. There are more than 70 car models on sale that achieve 40 miles per gallon and they account for just 1% of total new vehicle sales. 
 Then, last month, the EPA cited “regulatory overreach” by the previous administration for its decision to waive clean truck standards that would have phased out “glider” vehicles that produce 55 times more diesel soot than new trucks. Scott Pruitt, administrator of the EPA, said his predecessors had “attempted to bend the rule of law and expand the reach of the federal government in a way that threatened to put an entire industry of specialized truck manufacturers out of business”.
 These rollbacks from the executive branch have dovetailed with an effort by Republicans in the Senate and the House to revamp fuel efficiency rules by replacing state and federal requirements with a single standard. Environmental groups and previous administration officials fear this will lead to a further weakening of emissions standards.
 “America’s clean car standards have dramatically improved the fuel efficiency of vehicles, saving consumers billions of dollars and cutting pollution in the process,” said Carol Browner, a former administrator of the EPA.
 “Instead of rolling back commonsense, successful and popular clean cars standards, we should focus on innovation and technology that will continue the auto industry’s growth and the pollution reductions we’ve achieved since these standards were first established.”
 In the short term, this new approach risks a flashpoint between the federal government and California, which has a long-held waiver to enact vehicle pollution standards in excess of the national requirements. Twelve other states, including New York and Pennsylvania, follow California’s standards, an alliance that covers more than 130 million residents and about a third of the US vehicle market. 
 Nichols said she had been disturbed by signals coming from Pruitt and other EPA officials that she said show the federal government is looking to end California’s waiver. 
 “We are very concerned because these standards are the bedrock of our whole climate change platform,” she said. “Scott Pruitt has made threatening noises about the Californian waiver, saying that we are trying to run the country. It feels like this is going to be the next shoe to drop. If it does, we will litigate and fight for our rights in the political arena with other states and consumer advocates.”
 With federal regulation set to be pared back, technological advances in electric and gas-powered cars, as well as consumer preferences, are likely to play an increasingly important role in whether vehicle emissions are forced back down. 
 A flurry of recent optimistic studies have forecast that, by 2040, as much as 90% of all cars in the US will be electric. But the current conundrum is that petroleum-fueled vehicles are cheaper and seen as more reliable than their electric counterparts by most new buyers. Affordable gasoline is competing with electric recharging stations that are considered too sparse by many drivers to risk running out of puff, no matter the benefit to the environment.
 “It’s a challenging position for automotive companies because they are touting electric vehicles but ultimately they have to sell more cars,” said Smith. “Consumers in the US aren’t pushing for electric vehicles to the extent they are in Europe and unless we take a very different approach as a country, that doesn’t look like it will change soon.
 “You will need to see a major change in battery technology to make it viable. People are becoming more aware and concerned about global warming, but we aren’t there yet. And when you look at the vehicles being put out by the major car companies, you could argue it’s not an issue for them, either.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/01/vehicles-climate-change-emissions-trump-administration

Let's have a look at that for a moment. I walk my dog (see profile pic) for two or more hours every day. I often see dog poo in fields an on paths, only very rarely abandoned in poo bags (although I often find empty bags, presumably dropped when fishing a bag out of a pocket - these can be useful if I'm running low myself), and ALMOST NEVER hung in trees, in nearly four years of doing this. I'm beginning to think these poo bag sightings should be reported to the X Files.
Anyway; poo bag etiquette. My dog tends to do what he has to do near the beginning of a walk. If I know there's a bin nearby, no problem - carry the bag to the bin. On most walks I know there isn't a bin en route: if it is a circular walk, I carry the bag with me (you can't be squeamish with a dog); but if it is a there-and-back walk, I leave the bag in a convenient but not in the way place, and pick it up on the return leg, that doesn't seem unreasonable. If you see a poo bag near a path, don't assume it has been abandoned- the owner may well be on their way back for it, even if it's in a tree.
Thank you for your time and consideration.

Now in relation to plastic

On its own, plastic can take up to a thousand years to break down, if it ever does.Mycelium on barkPhoto: Mycelium is the furry, weblike substance that grows off fungi.
But international research is showing fungi can decompose tough plastics, in much the same way as it clears dead wood from a forest floor.
To be specific, it’s fungi’s “mycelium” that’s doing the work here — a furry, web-like substance that grows off the fungus and “vomits” enzymes onto materials to decompose them.
Mycelium has the potential to clean up overflowing landfills, in a time when less than 5 per cent of the world’s plastic is recycled.
And that’s not all it has to offer: mycelium is a tough substance that’s flame repellent and water retardant.

Why do British people do this? I've never seen it anywhere else in the world.
BQENDI have a theory. The local park/lake where I walk dogs has two specific hotspots for bagged poo, both are just where the tree-line meets a large open space.
I suspect the 'selfish idiots' pick up / bag up poo when in the open and can be seen, but on passing the tree line, then forget the second half of 'bag it and bin it' and ditch the bag to save having to carry it for several minutes till a bin appears.
I suspect those people wouldn't even pick it up at all, if they were sure that nobody could see them.

Here, a solitary flickering flame casts out a warm glow, illuminating the nearby ridge line of the Malvern Hills. 
Below the light sits a mysterious green contraption resembling a cross between a giant washing machine and a weather station. This is the UK’s first dog poo-powered street lamp, and it is generating light in more ways than one.
The idea seems simple enough: dog walkers deposit the product of a hearty walk into a hatch and turn a handle. The contents are then broken down by microorganisms in the anaerobic digester, producing methane to fuel the light, and fertiliser.
Brian Harper, who started work on the machine three years ago after becoming fed up of seeing plump little bags hanging in trees and on grass verges, reckons that 10 bags will power the light for two hours each evening.
“The gas light captures people’s imagination and shows them dog poo has a value,” says Harper, who developed the system with funding from the Malvern Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. “As a result, we get it [poo] off the ground, into a receptacle, and producing something useful.” The next step is to try to interest managers of urban parks in the technology.
Humans have used animal dung as fuel since the neolithic period, and have known how to get flammable gas from decaying organic matter since the 17th century. Small-scale anaerobic digesters are commonplace in many developing countries, while larger plants producing heat and electricity from animal manure and human sewage have long been used in the west.
Yet the energy in most excrement still goes to waste. Greater exploitation of this most plentiful resource has been held back by the availability of artificially cheap fossil fuel. But now Harper is at the vanguard of a new movement of innovators finding ingenious, sustainable ways of harnessing the power of excrement.
Local politicians in Waterloo in Ontario, Canada, are thinking along similar lines to tackle a different problem. Dog walkers who use three parks in the city are being asked to drop their pet’s poo into concrete storage units. These are periodically emptied by trucks that take it to a large central plant where it is broken down along with other forms of organic waste to produce methane and then electricity. The fertiliser byproduct is sold to farmers.
 Analysis of the first five months of an 18-month trial suggests that at the current rate, the scheme would generate enough electricity to power 13 homes and remove 630kg of CO2 from the atmosphere. Modest returns perhaps – but not the main goals of the project. 
 “Collecting dog waste separately prevents it contaminating our recycling streams, allowing us to divert both away from our landfill sites,” says Jeff Silcox-Childs, Waterloo’s director of environment and parks.
 In India, the use of small household biodigesters to get gas for fuel from cow manure is common. One social enterprise is deploying the technology on a larger scale as part of a major initiative to end open defecation in the country by 2019. 
 Sanitation and Health Rights in India (SHRI) turned to biodigestion as a way to keep public toilets clean – a major issue with existing communal facilities. At an initial cost of $30,000, SHRI builds blocks of 16 free-to-use toilets, half for men and half for women. The resulting sewage is broken down in a biodigester to produce methane, which powers a groundwater pump. The water is filtered, bottled and sold for half a rupee (half a pence) per litre, to pay for approximately half of the maintenance costs.
 “We are using existing technologies in ways they haven’t been connected before to help people in India get the safe, well-maintained and hygienic toilets they deserve,” says SHRI’s cofounder Anoop Jain. The group opened its first community toilet block in 2014 and is currently building its seventh.
 Back in the UK, the Bristol-based GENeco, a subsidiary of Wessex Water, ran its famous Bio-Bug trial in which a VW Beetle was converted to run on methane extracted from human waste. The use of biomethane from sewage plants to power cars is more widespread in other countries, such as Sweden.
 In 2014 GENeco launched its Bio-Bus, the UK’s first bus powered by gas generated from sewage and food waste. Capable of running for 300km on a full tank, it produces significantly less carbon dioxide and air pollution than fossil fuel-powered equivalents. It ran in trials between Bath and Bristol Airport and then, naturally, on Bristol’s “Number 2” bus route. 
GENeco also runs a facility that processes human sewage and food waste to generate enriched biomethane that is injected into the grid, providing fuel for some 5,000-6,000 homes. Severn Trent also opened an anaerobic digestion plant for sewage at Minworth near Birmingham in 2014.
 “Our facility is no longer a traditional sewage treatment works but a factory, taking inputs including sewage and food waste and turning them into products including gas for cooking or transport and nitrogen- and phosphate-rich fertiliser,” says Mohammed Saddiq, managing director of GENeco. “People talk about the circular economy, but what we are doing is putting that vision into practice.”
 While GENeco’s gas-to-grid operation is certainly greener than traditional facilities, there is another input that muddies the water. It, and others like it, receive subsidies under the government’s renewable heat incentive. Moreover some argue that large-scale operations involving transporting biomass to a central location are not necessarily the best of solutions.
This was the starting point for SEaB Energy, a Southampton-based company assembling modular, automated, odour-free anaerobic digesters in shipping containers. So far it has mainly sold units designed to process food waste, but it is currently assembling its first commercial Muckbuster units, due for installation in Japan and in Brazil in 2018.
 Sandra Sassow, CEO and cofounder of SEaB, warns that some facilities that turn biomass, including excrement, into energy may not be as green as they appear, if, for example, they use fuel to transport waste a long way before it is turned into an energy source.
 Right now, waste is collected, trucked, moved and processed, often ending up in landfill at worst or having some energy extracted from it at best, says Sassow. 
“We want to disrupt that completely to incorporate decentralised, distributed, on-site appliances into farms and buildings around the world. A lot of things have been tried, but it’s a case of finding a technology that produces an energy benefit over the full life cycle, not just an apparent energy benefit.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/01/stools-to-fuels-street-lamp-runs-on-dog-poo-bio-energy-waste-

A storm like a Sandy, or a Katrina, or a Harvey will occur again and soon. Recall how Katrina was supposed to be one of those 'once-in-a-century' storms? The good folks over in Houston would probably dispute that claim. The people up there in New York City, too. Look for another Sandy-like event to strike the NYC area within the next 10 years or so. How many $19 billion hits can New York City take in one century, I wonder? I dunno', let's close our eyes and find out.
By the end of the century, the United States will be dealing with at least 80 million climate change refugees. Americans already hate refugees. I'm curious as to how we'll react when they are are our own.
Further, disaster relief directly and indirectly resulting from responding to climate change related disasters (Harvey, for example) is already eating into any economic growth our nation may be experiencing and has for some time now. Currently it accounts for about 0.75% (this in an economy where +/-2.5% is considered significant). By 2025, it will be double that.

That's not to say he [Proffessor Muller] still doesn't have problems with sweeping statements about climate change: ""90 per cent of what's said about climate change is nonsense. That when people attribute Hurricane Katrina, or dying polar bears, that's not based on any science whatsoever. In fact in many cases, it's wrong. So there's plenty of room for scepticism. 
Criticism of the BEST project has come thick and fast, uniting sceptics and mainstream voices in condemning both the group's methods and its decision to release its findings before they underwent peer review.
One of the strongest voices criticising the study comes from the BEST team itself. Dr Judith Curry, head of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology, declined to be a co-author on the latest BEST study, and says on her blog she does not ""see any justification in [BEST's] argument for"" the group's statement that its warming data fits with manmade carbon dioxide. Curry's not alone: former climate scientist William Connolley claims BEST has done ""none of the attribution work you'd expect"".

Soil is the only place to store the 200 billion tons of carbon that we must first remove from the atmosphere and then an additional 200 billion tons from the ocean. The soil is the only beneficial place, and the only ubiquitous place we can put it.
We can through best management practices get the wee beasties to work with us, the microbes and fungi of the soil can grow exponentially storing soil carbon fast enough to avoid disaster.
To speed up this process we can also use biomass energy, via gasification and pyrolysis extract the energy from the hydrocarbons without burning the elemental carbon biochar saving this carbon for the soil where it will stay for thousands and thousands of years.

A ten percent increase in atmospheric [CO2] can raise the planetary temperature or it can establish a power imbalance, typically calculated in watts per square metre of the planet's surface (land and sea both). It takes ~(334 J/g * 900000 g/m^3), 300 MJ/m^3, to melt ice, and therefore a 1-W/m^2 radiative imbalance on an icefield will thin it at a rate of 10 cm per year.

Seven posts above I asked you what you meant by ""extreme weather"" and you have used that term once more without explaining what you mean by it. I asked what you meant by extreme weather as you do not seem to consider extreme extreme El Nino events, extreme heat waves and extreme hot days to be extreme weather. 
Food production is hampered by droughts. During the neutral ENSO years leading up to the 2015-16 extreme El Nino event, the west of my state, parts of the central highlands and even usually wet coastal sugar growing regions were subject to a long and crippling drought. Beef became an expensive item and I had to eat more imported pork. Drought had reduced my state's food production. During the millennial drought locally grown rice became in short supply and we had to rely on Asian and European grown rice. We're a rich country which can afford to import food when there are shortages in our local production, but not all countries, affected by the increased rate of onset of drought due to global warming and the increased drought due higher frequency of the extremes of the ENSO spectrum due to global warming, are so fortunate. When such countries are also affected by problems of governance, the world community is alarmed but not alarmist at the reality of famine.
Global warming has increased the length and intensity of the Australian bushfire (wildfire) season. This has made the task of fire management authorities more difficult as rapidly rising spring temperatures reduce the time available to carry out fuel reduction burns near human habitation and to maintain firebreaks. The increase in extremely hot dry spring, summer and autumn days combined with hot dry winds can result in fire fronts that are not stopped by fuel reduction and firebreak perimeters with wind borne embers flying 5 km ahead of the fire front and starting new fires. People have been alarmed but not alarmist at the loss of human life and destruction of buildings and stock that has occurred in southern Australian bushfires.', u'recommendation_count': u'4', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1514934150000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'global warming', u'effect': u'affected by the increased rate of onset of drought due to global warming and the increased drought due higher frequency of the extremes of the enso spectrum'}, {u'cause': u'global warming and the increased drought due higher frequency of the extremes of the enso spectrum', u'effect': u'affected by the increased rate of onset of drought due to global warming'}, {u'cause': u'the increase in extremely hot dry spring combined with hot dry winds', u'effect': u'fire fronts that are not stopped by fuel reduction and firebreak perimeters with wind borne embers flying 5 km ahead of the fire front and starting new fires'}], u'author_id': u'12483673', u'in_reply_to': u'110323889', u'id': u'110341136', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'loco_p_man', u'text': u'BQSTART

Incorrect. There was warming during this period.
It is true to say that the warming trend was not statistically significant for these dates, sure. But the trouble is that over a period only a little longer, the trend suddenly becomes not only statistically significant, but large.
You then end up trying to defend a nonsensical conclusion - that there was no warming for the majority of a period that experienced a lot of warming.

Fifty years before we knew how to create such a graph the work of a scientist named Milankovitch indicated that when we got our act together we would see Earth’s orbital cycles, which operate on time scales of tens to hundreds of thousands of years, in the record.
But what Milankovitch didn’t expect (1) is that when there was more sunlight at high Northern latitudes, processes like ice melt caused oceans to warm and release CO2 which made even the Southern hemisphere warm, although it was getting less sunlight.
The only way to explain this is with C02, so a story that didn’t start out to be about CO2 became one.
CO2, methane, and ice sheets were feedbacks that amplified global temperature change causing these ancient climate oscillations to be huge, even though the climate change was initiated by a very weak forcing.
The physics doesn’t change now that we are rapidly increasing atmospheric CO2, in fact ice is melting all over the planet and methane is beginning to escape the permafrost.

The year: 1959. Robert Dunlop, 50 years old and photographed later as clean-shaven, hair carefully parted, his earnest face donning horn-rimmed glasses, passed under the Ionian columns of Columbia University’s iconic Low Library. He was a guest of honor for a grand occasion: the centennial of the American oil industry. 
Over 300 government officials, economists, historians, scientists, and industry executives were present for the Energy and Man symposium – organized by the American Petroleum Institute and the Columbia Graduate School of Business – and Dunlop was to address the entire congregation on the “prime mover” of the last century – energy – and its major source: oil. As President of the Sun Oil Company, he knew the business well, and as al director of the American Petroleum Institute – the industry’s largest and oldest trade association in the land of Uncle Sam – he was responsible for representing the interests of all those many oilmen gathered around him.
Four others joined Dunlop at the podium that day, one of whom had made the journey from California – and Hungary before that. The nuclear weapons physicist Edward Teller had, by 1959, become ostracized by the scientific community for betraying his colleague J. Robert Oppenheimer, but he retained the embrace of industry and government. Teller’s task that November fourth was to address the crowd on “energy patterns of the future,” and his words carried an unexpected warning:
Ladies and gentlemen, I am to talk to you about energy in the future. I will start by telling you why I believe that the energy resources of the past must be supplemented. First of all, these energy resources will run short as we use more and more of the fossil fuels. [....] But I would [...] like to mention another reason why we probably have to look for additional fuel supplies. And this, strangely, is the question of contaminating the atmosphere. [....] Whenever you burn conventional fuel, you create carbon dioxide. [....] The carbon dioxide is invisible, it is transparent, you can’t smell it, it is not dangerous to health, so why should one worry about it?
Carbon dioxide has a strange property. It transmits visible light but it absorbs the infrared radiation which is emitted from the earth. Its presence in the atmosphere causes a greenhouse effect [....] It has been calculated that a temperature rise corresponding to a 10 per cent increase in carbon dioxide will be sufficient to melt the icecap and submerge New York. All the coastal cities would be covered, and since a considerable percentage of the human race lives in coastal regions, I think that this chemical contamination is more serious than most people tend to believe.
How, precisely, Mr. Dunlop and the rest of the audience reacted is unknown, but it’s hard to imagine this being welcome news. After his talk, Teller was asked to “summarize briefly the danger from increased carbon dioxide content in the atmosphere in this century.” The physicist, as if considering a numerical estimation problem, responded: 
At present the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen by 2 per cent over normal. By 1970, it will be perhaps 4 per cent, by 1980, 8 per cent, by 1990, 16 per cent [about 360 parts per million, by Teller’s accounting], if we keep on with our exponential rise in the use of purely conventional fuels. By that time, there will be a serious additional impediment for the radiation leaving the earth. Our planet will get a little warmer. It is hard to say whether it will be 2 degrees Fahrenheit or only one or 5. 
But when the temperature does rise by a few degrees over the whole globe, there is a possibility that the icecaps will start melting and the level of the oceans will begin to rise. Well, I don’t know whether they will cover the Empire State Building or not, but anyone can calculate it by looking at the map and noting that the icecaps over Greenland and over Antarctica are perhaps five thousand feet thick.
And so, at its hundredth birthday party, American oil was warned of its civilization-destroying potential.
Talk about a buzzkill.
How did the petroleum industry respond? Eight years later, on a cold, clear day in March, Robert Dunlop walked the halls of the U.S. Congress. The 1967 oil embargo was weeks away, and the Senate was investigating the potential of electric vehicles. Dunlop, testifying now as the Chairman of the Board of the American Petroleum Institute, posed the question, “tomorrow’s car: electric or gasoline powered?” His preferred answer was the latter:
We in the petroleum industry are convinced that by the time a practical electric car can be mass-produced and marketed, it will not enjoy any meaningful advantage from an air pollution standpoint. Emissions from internal-combustion engines will have long since been controlled.
Dunlop went on to describe progress in controlling carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide, and hydrocarbon emissions from automobiles. Absent from his list? The pollutant he had been warned of years before: carbon dioxide.
We might surmise that the odorless gas simply passed under Robert Dunlop’s nose unnoticed. But less than a year later, the American Petroleum Institute quietly received a report on air pollution it had commissioned from the Stanford Research Institute, and its warning on carbon dioxide was direct: 
Significant temperature changes are almost certain to occur by the year 2000, and these could bring about climatic changes. [...] there seems to be no doubt that the potential damage to our environment could be severe. [...] pollutants which we generally ignore because they have little local effect, CO2 and submicron particles, may be the cause of serious world-wide environmental changes. 
Thus, by 1968, American oil held in its hands yet another notice of its products’ world-altering side effects, one affirming that global warming was not just cause for research and concern, but a reality needing corrective action: “Past and present studies of CO2 are detailed,” the Stanford Research Institute advised. “What is lacking, however, is [...] work toward systems in which CO2 emissions would be brought under control.”
This early history illuminates the American petroleum industry’s long-running awareness of the planetary warming caused by its products. Teller’s warning, revealed in documentation I found while searching archives, is another brick in a growing wall of evidence.
In the closing days of those optimistic 1950s, Robert Dunlop may have been one of the first oilmen to be warned of the tragedy now looming before us. By the time he departed this world in 1995, the American Petroleum Institute he once led was denying the climate science it had been informed of decades before, attacking the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and fighting climate policies wherever they arose. 
This is a history of choices made, paths not taken, and the fall from grace of one of the greatest enterprises – oil, the “prime mover” – ever to tread the earth. Whether it’s also a history of redemption, however partial, remains to be seen.
American oil’s awareness of global warming – and its conspiracy of silence, deceit, and obstruction – goes further than any one company. It extends beyond (though includes) ExxonMobil. The industry is implicated to its core by the history of its largest representative, the American Petroleum Institute.
It is now too late to stop a great deal of change to our planet’s climate and its global payload of disease, destruction, and death. But we can fight to halt climate change as quickly as possible, and we can uncover the history of how we got here. There are lessons to be learned, and there is justice to be served.

Effectively, yes.

about 50% of a CO2 increase will be removed from the atmosphere within 30 years

BQSTART
That 50% decrease would only apply to half of the last 30 years worth of increase.
BQENDThat's an interesting interpretation.
BQSTART
Carbon dioxide cycles between the atmosphere, oceans and land biosphere. Its removal from the atmosphere involves a range of processes with different time scales. About 50% of a CO2 increase will be removed from the atmosphere within 30 years, and a further 30% will be removed within a few centuries. The remaining 20% may stay in the atmosphere for many thousands of years.
BQEND
Clearly one of is is a moron.
Me who read that as 50% of CO2 will be removed, as you will find in most explanations

BQSTART
nce carbon dioxide is put into the atmosphere, about 50% of it will stay there for decades. About 30% of it will stay there for centuries. And about 20% will stay there for thousands of years, as shown in this graph from Global Warming Art

But I readily accept the fact that at best we know maybe 10-20% of what there is to know about our climate.
BQEND how do you know that is that state of climate science?
did you just pluck it out the air like your 'most people' quote?
Clearly we don't know much about the universe- given it is so large- but we do know all the elements that exist in it, the bandwidth of light - we know very little about gravity but we know that jumping out of buildings is harmful and means to defy it.
The established stuff about AGW has been known for a century or more and the detail established in the 50s- we have now moved on to more detail.
Even if you could back up your claim that only 20% of knowledge of Earth's climate system was understood that leaves 80% uncertainty- and that the 20% of knowledge is the important bit.
But perhaps you are right in some respects- AGW is too slow and too distant for many to see it as a political priority, but so is peak oil, a global economic system built on debt and property values, an economic system where 1% own 50% of global wealth.
These are all to vague and off the radar for most people to worry about- instead they will carry on until it goes tits up.
Sometime in the next 20 years the global grainbelt from the US through russia and China will suffer drought and or floods- and if that disruption is global then people will be very concerned as food prices spike and unrest kicks off.
perhaps it will be too little too late, perhaps tech will deliver EVs and renewable energy,
But it is a reason we have elected leaders- people with vision to worry about the things we don't have time, or money, or inclination to worry about.

about 50% of a CO2 increase will be removed from the atmosphere within 30 years and a further 30% will be removed within a few centuries

No, you have completely misunderstood how it works.
That 50% decrease would only apply to half of the last 30 years worth of increase.
The remainder would be on the 30%/(few centuries) decay already.
Say we split the emissions history into ten year blocks, and consider the decay of each block from the time of emission.
Each block would approximately follow the 50% reduction in 30 years then 30%/(few centuries).

In fact, 2017 was the hottest year without an El Niño by a wide margin – a whopping 0.17°C hotter than 2014, which previously held that record. Remarkably, 2017 was also hotter than 2015, which at the time was by far the hottest year on record thanks in part to a strong El Niño event that year.
For comparison, the neutral El Niño conditions and the level of solar activity in 1972 were quite similar to those in 2017. 45 years later, the latter was 0.9°C hotter than the former. For each type of year – La Niña, El Niño, and neutral – the global surface warming trend between 1964 and 2017 is 0.17–0.18°C per decade, which is consistent with climate model predictions.
I’ve been writing for the Guardian for almost 5 years now, and every year I’ve had to write a similar headline or two:
Those early years were the height of the denier frenzy about the mythical global warming ‘hiatus.’ At the time, John Abraham and I frequently wrote pieces pointing out that while various factors were temporarily dampening global surface warming, the oceans (which absorb over 90% of the excess heat from the increased greenhouse effect) continued warming rapidly. 
It was only a matter of time until short-term effects stopped holding back the rise of Earth’s surface temperatures. That’s now happened, and as a result we’re seeing unleashed global warming causing record temperatures year after year. In fact, in February 2014 I wrote about a study that predicted this would happen:
the [ocean] heat uptake is by no means permanent: when the trade wind strength returns to normal - as it inevitably will - our research suggests heat will quickly accumulate in the atmosphere. So global temperatures look set to rise rapidly out of the hiatus, returning to the levels projected within as little as a decade.
Temperatures have in fact risen so quickly, it appears to have taken just a few years for that prediction to come true and for the denier focus on the short-term surface warming slowdown to look quite foolish.
Speaking of climate denial, on the 362nd day of the hottest year on record without an El Niño, the US president tweeted this:
In the East, it could be the COLDEST New Year’s Eve on record. Perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country, but not other countries, was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against. Bundle up!
Climate scientist Sarah Myhre aptly described the tweet as “Phenomenally dumb,” for several obvious reasons. 
Trump also began the process of withdrawing the US from the Paris Climate Agreement in 2017, leaving America as the only country in the world denying the urgent need to address global warming. Fortunately, every other nation is taking action to mitigate this existential threat, but there’s a shocking gap between reality and the ‘fake news’ beliefs of arguably the most powerful man in the world.
America was also battered by climate-fueled extreme weather events in 2017. Research has already shown that global warming boosted Hurricane Harvey’s record rainfall (and associated flooding) by about 38%. California’s record wildfire season was similarly fueled by the state’s hot summer. The southwestern states were cooked by record hot summer temperatures this year, and global warming is making droughts in America and Europe worse. America was hit by 15 billion-dollar weather and climate disasters in 2017, and it will likely be the costliest such year on record once all of the hurricane damages are tallied.
These extreme weather events are expensive. Until we manage to cut global carbon pollution, temperatures will continue to rise and climate change consequences will become more severe.

The study, which is one of the most detailed assessments to date of future aridity, suggests that many regions could face an increased threat of drought and wildfires.
Limiting global warming to under 1.5C would avoid extreme changes for two-thirds of these areas, the study suggested.
Chang-Eui Park, the first author from the Southern University of Science and Technology (Sustech) in Shenzhen China, said: “Aridification is a serious threat because it can critically impact areas such as agriculture, water quality, and biodiversity. It can also lead to more droughts and wildfires similar to those seen raging across California.”
Aridity is a measure of the dryness of the land surface, which can be calculated by combining predictions of precipitation and evaporation. 
The scientists studied projections from 27 different global climate models to pinpoint regions where the land is expected to become significantly drier, as global warming reaches 1.5C and 2C above pre-industrial levels.
Manoj Joshi, a co-author of the study from the University of East Anglia (UEA), said: “Our research predicts that aridification would emerge over about 20 to 30% of the world’s land surface by the time the global mean temperature change reaches 2C. But two-thirds of the affected regions could avoid significant aridification if warming is limited to 1.5C.”
Drought severity has already increased across the Mediterranean, southern Africa, and the eastern coast of Australia during the 20th century, while semi-arid areas of Mexico, Brazil, southern Africa and Australia have started turning into desert as the world warms. The study suggested that equatorial regions and countries at high latitudes could get wetter.
Prof Tim Osborn, also one of the study’s co-authors from UEA, said: “The areas of the world which would most benefit from keeping warming below 1.5C are parts of south-east Asia, southern Europe, southern Africa, Central America and southern Australia where more than 20% of the world’s population live today.”
The findings are published in the journal Nature Climate Change.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jan/02/keep-global-warming-under-15c-or-quarter-of-planet-could-become-arid

Yes, but the problem is that the increases have depended on a stable climate; with climate change, the problem is that the varieties have been optimised for the wrong conditions and, as the climate changes, so yields will start to drop. That is why accelerated breeding techniques are being examined, so that the breeders have a better chance of keeping up with the changes.
BQEND
What wrong conditions? The planet has been warming for 200 years and crop yields are going up year on year, even with the recent increased rate of warming the crop yields are still going up and up, improved farming practices have a lot to do with it but the 1.1 degree warming certainly has not negatively impacted the yields.

Scientists think they can now better explain the recent surge in methane levels seen in the Earth's atmosphere. 
Although only a trace component in the air, CH4 is a greenhouse gas and has been rising rapidly since about 2006.
Tropical wetlands and fossil fuels are suspected as major sources - but the sums do not add up.
Only if methane reductions stemming from fewer global fires are considered can the CH4 budget be made to balance, says a new Nasa-led study.

In 1968 while driving from Brisbane to Camooweal in Queensland's arid/monsoonal North West to explore caves developed in Cambrian dolomites, my agronomist friend said he would have studied straight ecology if he had those last few years over again; but agronomy was applied ecology. 
We went on to explore the caves in the caves in the pre-monsoonal heat leaving as the first drops of rain fell. We found troglobitic cockroaches and a corkscrewing cave in the black soil. He went on to be an agronomist in Papua New Guinea and explore the extraordinary caves of that country which he recorded in a book on the Caves of the Cloud Forest - such beauty.
My studies branched into geology, geomorphology, palaeoecology and finally back to insects and their applied ecology - all of which were affected by climate change through time and space.

Note Section 10 of Fischer, Byerlee and Edmeades monograph pp 381-420 deals with Climate change,crop yield, adaptation and mitigation.
The keys points of this section are as follows.
* Climate change is slow, uncertain and geographically heterogeneous. For this reason, this chapter considers only those effects associated with warming and increases in the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) and ozone. Crop weather records of the past 20-30 years reveal wodespread evidence of warming.
* Inter-annual crop yield deviations often show a negative relationship to inter-annual variations in growing season mean temperature (Tmean). For cereals, yield sensitivity is around -2 % to -5% per degree C warming, but this includes the response to other weather parameters that vary in association with Tmean. Measurements and crop simulation modelling suggest cereal yield responses to growing season Tmean alone range from -4% to -7% per degree increase in temperature.
* Chronic warming reduces yield largely by hastening crop development, although shorter hot spells can also exert negative effects on seed number and grain size. CO2 rise currently benefits C3 crops (such as wheat) by ~0.2% p.a. but has little effect on C4 crops (such as maizw). Ozone levels are high enough to reduce crop yields in densely populated industrial areas, but ozone concentrations are generally expected to decline (except in some developing countries).', u'recommendation_count': u'10', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1514961131000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'12483673', u'in_reply_to': u'110344695', u'id': u'110345726', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Walsunda', u'text': u'aciar.gov.au/files/mn158_web_5_0.pdf', u'recommendation_count': u'4', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1514955257000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'12483673', u'in_reply_to': u'110342141', u'id': u'110344798', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Walsunda', u'text': u'Global grain crop yields have increased fairly linearly from 1.6 t/ha in 1960 to 4.2 t/ha in 2010, largely through the adoption of modern farming methods.

Their aim is to feed a growing population in a warming world.
The method used for centuries of growing one crop a year in variable weather conditions and then selecting the seeds from the best plants is no longer viable in fast-changing climatic conditions. Scientists are concerned that for some years there have been few improvements in yields of grain.
A new system called speed breeding, designed to grow six crops a year, has been developed in glasshouses to accelerate the process. Using LED lighting to aid photosynthesis, intensive regimes allow the plants to grow for 22 hours a day. This new form of lighting is a lot cheaper and also more efficient than using the old sodium vapour lamps that produced too much heat and not enough light.
Among the crops that can now be grown up to six generations a year are wheat, barley, peas and chickpeas. Canola, a form of rapeseed, can achieve four cycles.
Using this technology, scientists can study the way plants deal with diseases, and their shape and structure and flowering time, and the growing cycle can be repeated every eight weeks.
It is hoped the technique will yield new varieties of crops that can be grown on a commercial scale within 10 years. If this could be achieved, it would increase productivity in the same way as the green revolution of the 1960s, when new crop varieties, modern farm practices, and use of fertilisers saved millions of people from starvation.

The expansion in LNG exports, which saw a production increase of 41.6 per cent over the previous year, was the major contributor to this increase in emissions. Annual emissions are 0.8 per cent below emissions in 2000 (554.4 Mt CO2-e) and 9.1 per cent below emissions in 2005 (605.0 Mt CO2-e).

Emissions per capita, and the emissions intensity of the economy, were at their lowest levels in 28 years in 2017. Emissions per capita in 2016-17 have fallen 34.4 per cent since 1990, while the emissions intensity of the economy has fallen 57.8 per cent since 1990 (Figure 1).

The Turnbull government’s review of its climate policies, released before Christmas, flagged the Coalition’s intention to allow use of international permits to help Australia meet its international emissions reductions commitments.
Carbon credit schemes would allow Australian energy companies to buy credits for abatement projects, such as tree-planting in developing countries, to meet restrictions on emissions in the proposed national energy guarantee.
On Wednesday Abbott said he did not support overseas carbon credits being available to Australian businesses because it was a form of “carbon trading, which is a carbon tax under a different name”.
“That just means that Aussie consumers end up shovell­ing our money to foreign carbon traders and we all know the ­potential for rorts there,” he told the Australian.
The Australian Industry Group chief executive, Innes Willox, said industry had advocated for international credits for many years “as a cost effective means of achieving our obligations”.
“The sensible approach is to meet our obligations in the least costly ways possible,” Willox said. “And in some cases it will be less expensive to meet these obligations by reducing emissions [or sequestering carbon dioxide] in other countries.
“It makes absolutely no sense to rule out this option by insisting that our commitments can only be fulfilled within our borders.
“This can only increase the costs of meeting our international obligations.”
Willox said Australians would need to be “totally satisfied” commitments were met with genuine reductions with “strict methodologies and transparent measurement”, but that was true wherever abatement was achieved.
He said meeting Australia’s commitment in the Paris climate agreement would “inevitably” involve some cost.
A spokesman for the Business Council of Australia said it also supported the use of “credible international permits as a practical measure to reduce emissions”.
 He said support for international permits was a practical measure that would “help provide the flexibility and capacity for Australian businesses to participate in what is fundamentally a global issue”.
The energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, has stood by the in-principle support for international credits but said a final decision on the quantity and quality limits would be made by 2020.
He hit back at Abbott’s comments, arguing that international credits have been on the table since the Abbott government signed up to the 2015 Paris climate agreement.
Frydenberg said the climate review showed that the Business Council of Australia, Australian Industry Group and the Minerals Council all strongly support international permits.
“It is worth noting that Mr ­Abbott’s position on international permits is closer to the Greens than that of Australia’s big employers,” he told the Australian.
The Liberal MP Craig Kelly, the chairman of the government’s backbench committee on climate and energy, has backed Abbott’s call to rule out the use of international permits.
Kelly has advocated that Australia backload its emissions reduction target, opting to make less abatement in the short term and achieve higher emissions reductions closer to the 2030 deadline when renewable energy technology advances may make it cheaper to do so.
“I am still relatively confident that under the Neg our Paris commitment can be achieved, taking advantage of technology, at virtually zero cost, if the trajectory is done in a sensible manner,” he told Guardian Australia.
Kelly said if Australia could not meet its targets in that way “you’ve got to ask yourself if we have set that target too stringently” and there would be a debate about what price the community is prepared to pay to meet the targets.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/03/abbotts-stance-on-international-carbon-credits-makes-no-sense-business-says

Zero-emission, mainly all-electric as well as a few hydrogen-powered cars accounted for 20.9% of total sales in 2017, official figures released on Wednesday showed. Hybrid vehicles accounted for 31.3%, including 18.4% for plug-in hybrids, the Norwegian Road Federation calculated.
This represents an increase over the previous year, when zero-emission and hybrid cars accounted for 15.7% and 24.5% respectively of total sales, making Norway a world leader in electrifying road transport. 
Norway, the biggest producer of oil in western Europe, has set itself the ambitious goal of selling only new zero-emission cars starting from 2025.
Unlike diesel or gasoline cars, which are heavily taxed, electric cars benefit from a very generous tax system, making their purchase prices relatively competitive. Their owners also enjoy many privileges such as free city tolls, ferries, parking and recharging in public car parks, as well as having the right to drive in bus lanes.
Authorities plan to gradually reduce some measures whose benefits and costs are disputed by critics. 
In 2017 the rightwing government tried to remove one of the tax exemptions on large and luxurious electric sedans in what was dubbed the “Tesla tax”, but was later forced to pull back due to opposition from its centre-right allies.
The Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association welcomed the new statistics while calling for a continued state incentive: “The goal of 2025 is ambitious,” said its secretary general, Christina Bu.
“We need to go from 21% market share to 100% in seven years, which means we still have a way to go even if it’s going in the right direction and the increase compared to 2016 is satisfactory.”
While there was a large interest in electric and hybrid cars, proven by long waiting lists for new vehicles, manufacturers had been slow to meet this demand, with lengthy delivery times and a lack of models, Bu said.

Well, it's complicated",article,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/04/climate-fear-or-hope-change-debate,0,"There’s a debate in climate circles about whether you should try to scare the living daylights out of people, or give them hope – think images of starving polar bears on melting ice caps on the one hand, and happy families on their bikes lined with flowers and solar-powered lights on the other.
The debate came to something of a head this year, after David Wallace-Wells lit up the internet with his 7,000-word, worst-case scenario published in New York magazine. It went viral almost instantly, and soon was the best-read story in the magazine’s history. A writer in Slate called it “the Silent Spring of our time”. But it also garnered tremendous criticism and from more than the usual denier set.
Beyond quibbles with the science, critics including the illustrious climate scientist Michael Mann took issue with the piece’s “doomist framing” because, as he wrote at the time, there’s “a danger in overstating the science in a way that presents the problem as unsolvable, and feeds a sense of doom, inevitability and hopelessness”.
But others say scaring people is the only way to make them care. Perhaps the most famous purveyor of climate scare tactics is Guy McPherson. Described by the New York Times as an “apocalyptic ecologist”, McPherson’s doomsday theory of “near-term extinction” has attracted something of a following. McPherson wrote on his website, which includes links to suicide hotlines, that the David Wallace-Wells piece “largely captures my message”.
Rather than treat emotions as levers to be pulled, they should be seen as part of a dynamic interplay
Both sides are wrong, from a psychological standpoint. Emotions are complicated and can vary tremendously from person to person. Trying to crudely manipulate them doesn’t work.
That’s the conclusion from behavioral scientists at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, Daniel Chapman, Brian Lickel and Ezra Markowitz, who, in a recent paper published in Nature Climate Change, seek to bring the lessons of psychology to bear on communicating the importance climate change.
To attempt to either scare or inspire people “simultaneously oversimplifies the rich base of research on emotion while overcomplicating the very real communications challenge advocates face by demanding that each message have the right ‘emotional recipe’ to maximize effectiveness”, they write.
Climate experts, after all, are not experts on human behavior and the people who are say there are better ways to communicate the climate problem. Rather than treat emotions as levers to be pulled for a desired effect, they should be seen as part of a dynamic interplay among factors that shape our behavior, exquisitely specific to the human being inhabiting them.
What’s more, since the vast majority of us are not very good at getting people to feel the way we want them to based on the words coming out of our mouths alone, the best approach, it would seem, is one of humility – that is, to spend more time listening, and also, to know our own limits.
“Practitioners in different fields have varying perspectives on the issue,” Chapman told me. “In general, I think we need researchers and practitioners attending in an honest way to what research does and does not tell us about how to engage the public with climate change.”
For those intent on communicating climate change in psychologically adept ways, there are some takeaways from the science. 
For instance, though we’ve been conditioned to think of anger as an undesirable emotion, research has shown it to be an important emotion for motivating action in the face of social injustice. And the pairing of certain feelings, like fear and efficacy, can be helpful too.
 Like a patient who’s given both a diagnosis and a course of treatment, people respond better to risks when given both a reason and a way to act. In this sense, it seems the hope and fear camps of the climate debate are each seeing only part of the puzzle.
But even in places where the science is relatively strong, researchers caution against simplistic applications. Rote formulas like “three parts hope to one part scary” won’t translate from one person to another. Indeed, to use such information responsibly requires, if not some level of sophistication, then at least considerable forethought, as well as a concerted, ongoing effort to meet people where they are.
That means, above all, knowing your audience and what’s relevant to them. Are they considering chopping down a nearby forest or putting their houses up on stilts? Do they need to rebuild or relocate? Parsing people’s needs and sensitivities is critical in any form of communication, but particularly when it comes to talking about climate science, with its great technical complexity, profound personal impact, and tremendous political polarization.
Above all, it means remembering that climate change is a very big story. It isn’t monolithic, and communication of it looks like many things – be it climate scientists talking to lay-people or Leonardo DiCaprio making a movie.
The overwhelming problem in climate communication, after all, isn’t how it’s talked about so much as whether it’s being talked about at all. A 2016 report from Yale’s programme on climate communication found one in four Americans say they “never” hear someone discussing it.
Looked at that way, David Wallace-Wells’ apocalyptic horror story cum viral sensation is the best thing that’s happened in climate communication some time.• Lucia Graves is a Guardian US columnist",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/04/climate-fear-or-hope-change-debate

It reminds me of thoughts from the Australian philosopher Warwick Fox , earlier work by Prof Arne Næss (eco-sophical thinking) - that itself has roots back with Spinoza. 
This sounds a bit high-flying - but it is surprisingly concrete (until one start to dive into the formal logic - Næss was originally in formal logic and did not take easy on that)
At the deeper level these guys also explored the fact of our modern history of dividing the ""modern world"" from the ""natural world"" and argued against it. Deeply analysing how it is an illusion - arguing that our way to ""tame"" the world in fact feedback to the ""nature"" that then feedback to ourselves. 
(Remember - much of this was written before ""ozon hole"" or observation of AGW was a common fact)
At deepest level they used a similar argument as ""second body"" - how the collective stress civilisation cause nature returns back to us. 
Since I do not find the right words, Carl Sagan used the similar concept when saying

She didn’t have any home insurance. “There had been two false alarms that year … We’d been told that the water would come into our house at 4.2 metres, but when the levels got to 4.3 in early December, we were still dry.” She and her husband were in receipt of automated telephone calls whenever the rain started to fall – a computerised female voice would predict the height the river might reach. “When it rains she rings up all the time,” she explains; “you stop picking up to her.” They went away with their young daughter for a few days over the Christmas holidays, and when they came back, the river was lapping near their ceilings. “Before we went away we moved all our things a few inches off the ground, emptied the bottom drawers, and piled everything on to the second shelf up. This was one of the most pointless things I have ever done.”
After the flood receded, neighbours and strangers gave up their Christmas holiday time to help her hose out sediment and clean up. “I became a designated Victim with an assigned caseworker and my own reference number at the food bank.” During the flood her father had swum out to the house to gather paperwork; as she laid out the papers to dry, passers-by took pictures of her with their phones. A reporter hoping to interview her feigned pity, and on the television she saw aerial footage of her street. “The flood looked very small. It wasn’t like that on the ground where it was everywhere.” She found catharsis in throwing away many of her possessions – a catharsis that expressed itself physically: “The sense of relief was located in my spine, it felt as if my vertebrae were spacing themselves further out, as if my body was growing longer and more loose.”
Her in-laws live in Birmingham; she and her husband took turns driving between there, to spend time with their daughter, and alone in Yorkshire cleaning the house of slime and sewage. “In spite of all the help that was offered, nobody offered to help in such a way that would allow us to keep our family together, which was all I thought I wanted at the time.”
The premise of The Second Body is that all human beings have two bodies – the one they have immediate autonomy over, made of flesh and bone, and another which is more diffuse. Hildyard struggles to define exactly what she means by the second body, but in one place calls it “the global presence of the individual body”. Elsewhere it is imagined as an entity shared and distributed across every aspect of the biosphere impacted on by humans. The flood was part of this second body – an elemental retribution brought about not just by her, but by all the collective bad decisions of Homo sapiens: “My second body came to find my first body when the river flooded my house.”
Hildyard has taught Shakespeare at university level; in order to make sense of her experience she turns to Shylock in The Merchant of Venice. “He asks: what happens to a human from whom everything beyond his body has been taken away?” Shylock’s experience of destitution is to fall back on the carnal aspects of his humanity (“If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die?”). She explicitly compares Shylock’s perspective to that of Nina Simone when, after listing everything she doesn’t have in “Ain’t Got No – I Got Life” (home, shoes, money, cigarettes), Simone proclaims and celebrates all her body parts (hair, brains, tongue, boobs). “Shylock and Nina Simone cannot speak directly about what it is to be a living human now. What was interesting to me was that they shared a vision of an individual body that was very personal, but also overpopulated with other people’s organs – this was how it seemed to me. I thought that other people acted as if that was not the case: as if their organs, and their bodies, were somehow different from those that were all around them.”
Hildyard and her husband were awarded compensation by the government, which she used to take a cheap flight to a Mediterranean island with her daughter (“In a technical way I believe in climate change, but I do not much act as if I do … I didn’t want to spend this money on more things”). Walking in the warm evening air she comes upon beached lifeboats, an immigration Portakabin, some Red Cross tents and “a queue of humans, some wearing blankets, waiting to be seen”. The connection is left implicit between her own experience, internally displaced by climate change, and that of migrants on the Mediterranean beach.
I have concentrated on Hildyard’s final essay because it’s there that her themes cohere most convincingly, and her writing is most compelling. The first three essays describe encounters with animals alive and dead, and with scientists who make sense of life. There’s a convalescence story of an injured pigeon that she later describes as a pet, a visit to a butcher called Richard and a conversation with Gina, an American zookeeper turned prison officer turned investigator of environmental offences (such as the smuggling of exotic animals as pets, and the slaughter of orangutans to clear forest for palm oil plantations).
In Jena, near Leipzig, Hildyard seeks out the advice of three academic biologists – Luis, Nadezhda and Paul. Nadezhda teaches her about fungi, Luis about the origin of life. He is described as knowing more than Hildyard about almost everything, but she is puzzled by his optimism about the future of humanity, and discomfited when he explains that the definition of life is open to debate: “Stop,” I said. “You don’t actually know what life is? ... You need to get your act together.”
These are fretful, questioning essays with occasional flashes of beauty, demanding of readers that they think about anthropogenic disruption of climate and ecology. Their structure feels disjointed, and their register wilfully banal, but perhaps their very fragmentation is a comment on modern disconnection and disaffection. They seem to come from a place of perplexity and anguish, bewilderment struggling towards expression.
“When Hamlet, Macbeth and Lear die … they repeat themselves increasingly until they make funny sounds,” Hildyard writes towards the end of the book. She uses the example of King Lear: “Howl, howl, howl, howl! It is not clear whether this is a noise or a command.”

The educated people are not necessarily aware.

But they are. Educated technologists might have caused the problem, but it's also educated technologists who will solve it if that's at all possible. You blame the educated, but you have to know that until the 1980s almost nobody was aware of man made climate change. It simply wasn't on the radar. And the fact is it takes time to turn the ship around. But it is turning, and it needs educated people to help get the job done. For example, who designs and develops innovative renewable energy systems? Who mandates the use of biodegradable packaging? Who self-limits their families to 2 children? Let me tell you, it's not the uneducated poor. Where I live, at the supermarket checkout they put individual items into plastic bags that are all then put into multiple larger bags to carry them - plastic bags on the Russian doll principle. Recycling? Never - just dig massive holes and dump everything from garden cuttings to toxic waste into them and bulldoze the top over. Battery acid? Pour it down the sink. You would
not  want to eat the fruit or vegetables grown by poor farmers in Asia, Africa or South America for all the chemicals they're covered with.
As you rightly point out, we caused this mess. My contention is that we therefore have a duty to help clear it up.

Twenty years ago in response to the suddenly rising popularity of a racist right wing party, the Labor state government introduced optional preferential voting where a voter could choose not to distribute all or some of their preferences. This reduced the preference flow from the racist party to the conservative opposition parties but also saw the election a good number of racist party candidates who squabbled among themselves with the majority becoming independents over the course of the next parliamentary term.
With the increase this century of first preference votes to the Greens in urban electorates optional preferential voting could reduce Labor's chances in some seats by reducing the flow of Green voter preferences. Hence the reversion to compulsory preferential voting. At last November's election the minority Labor Government of the last three years attained the majority it wanted.

There are also plants that grow in dirt but don't have roots (Comb Ferns, Lycopodium, Mosses and Liverworts). 
The only plants in the sea that do have roots are sea grasses - angiosperm or flowering plants whose evolutionary lineage has returned to the sea. They are eaten by fish and dugongs. Kelp are large brown algae that form undersea forests in cold marine waters. They have holdfasts to keep them attached to the rocks in the surf but no roots as they get what they need from the surrounding sea water. Brown algae, red algae and green algae are regarded as plants.
Plants are defined as members of the Kingdom Plantae which is comprised of multicellular organisms that produce their own food from inorganic molecules by photosynthesis and have more or less rigid cell walls containing cellullose. The Kingdonm Plantae consists of Thallophytes - algae brown, red and green; Bryophytes - mosses, liverworts, etc.; Pteridophytes - ferns, club mosses etc.; Gymnosperms - Pine trees, cycads, ginkos etc.; and Angiosperms - flowering plants including those with cryptic flowers such as grasses and casaurinas.
Living cellular things are divided into 5 Kingdoms: Monera which lack complex intracellular organelles - bacteria including Archea, blue green algae, and some other pathogens; Protista - protozoans, most algae, and slime moulds; Fungi- yeasts, rusts, moulds and mushrooms/toadstools; Animalia and Plantae. Also Phytophthora a group of fungal like organisms that cause a dieback disease in crops and ecosystems are classified in a separate Kingdom - Chromista or Stramenopila. 
Note blue green algae, or as they are now often called blue green bacteria, organisms with simple bacterial cells capable of photosynthesis, are regarded as Monera, not as plants or Plantae. First appearing in the fossil record 3.8billion years ago, they together with other bacteria, transformed the Earth over the next 3.2 billion years eventually making it an environment where the other 4 or 5 Kingdoms could evolve.
Algae are are diverse group of not particularly closely related eukaryotic organisms (with complex intracellular organelles) in the Kingdom Protista. Some classifications include the large multicellular kelp and other multicellular algae in the Protista. Green algae and green plants are a lineage or clade but Thallophyta is not. Protista capable of photosynthesis include green algae such as stoneworts or Chara, Spirogyra, desmids, marine flagellate Tetraselmis, Volvox, Chlamydomonas, Micromonas, Acetabularia, Ulva (sea lettuce, laver or nori); brown algae such as diatoms, loricas, golden algae, Actimonas, coccolithophorids, silicoflagellates (another group of diatoms) plus brown algae and sea weed; plus cryptomonas, red algae, dinoflagellates and Euglena.https://www.britannica.com/science/algae/classification-of-algae', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1515291189000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'that', u'effect': None}], u'author_id': u'12483673', u'in_reply_to': u'110491475', u'id': u'110499050', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Alan1987', u'text': u'You do know that nearly all published peer reviewed science papers are overturned at some point don't you?

They also use their speed to increase water flow over the gills, unlike other fish that must pump water over the gills.
And they need all this, because they use a great deal of oxygen:
Tropical pelagic tunas and billfishes exhibit a high-performance physiology, including exceptionally high rates of somatic and gonadal growth, digestion, and rapid recovery from exhaustive exercise. These energy-consuming expenditures require large amounts of oxygen.... Here, we consider the plausible hypothesis that these species have oxygen limitations that impact vertical habitat use.
You continue to ignore other points I made. Unlike trout, these species normally dive deeply, and the vertical expansion of oxygen-depleted zones will force them (and their usual prey) into a restricted space closer to the surface, where they are more likely to be caught.

Are the 1.4 billion people in China and their 10,293 million tons of CO2 emissions any more a terrible problem and any less acceptable than the 1 billion people in the US and Europe with their 11,293 million tons of CO2 emissions?
There are more of them and they are actually producing less than the us and Europe combined. If you examine the per capita emissions of the EU, US and China, you realise that China's per capita emissions are close to those of the EU while those of the US are more than twice those of China and the EU. This explains why 1 billion people can produce more CO2 emissions than 1.4 billion. Do you regard the US and Europe combined as ""horrible offenders""?
Any countries total emissions are the product of their per capita emissions and their population.

Most sea creatures cannot survive in these zones and current trends would lead to mass extinction in the long run, risking dire consequences for the hundreds of millions of people who depend on the sea.
Climate change caused by fossil fuel burning is the cause of the large-scale deoxygenation, as warmer waters hold less oxygen. The coastal dead zones result from fertiliser and sewage running off the land and into the seas.
The analysis, published in the journal Science, is the first comprehensive analysis of the areas and states: “Major extinction events in Earth’s history have been associated with warm climates and oxygen-deficient oceans.” Denise Breitburg, at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center in the US and who led the analysis, said: “Under the current trajectory that is where we would be headed. But the consequences to humans of staying on that trajectory are so dire that it is hard to imagine we would go quite that far down that path.”
“This is a problem we can solve,” Breitburg said. “Halting climate change requires a global effort, but even local actions can help with nutrient-driven oxygen decline.” She pointed to recoveries in Chesapeake Bay in the US and the Thames river in the UK, where better farm and sewage practices led to dead zones disappearing.
However, Prof Robert Diaz at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, who reviewed the new study, said: “Right now, the increasing expansion of coastal dead zones and decline in open ocean oxygen are not priority problems for governments around the world. Unfortunately, it will take severe and persistent mortality of fisheries for the seriousness of low oxygen to be realised.”
The oceans feed more than 500 million people, especially in poorer nations, and provide jobs for 350 million people. But at least 500 dead zones have now been reported near coasts, up from fewer than 50 in 1950. Lack of monitoring in many regions means the true number may be much higher.
The open ocean has natural low oxygen areas, usually off the west coast of continents due to the way the rotation of the Earth affects ocean currents. But these dead zones have expanded dramatically, increasing by millions of square kilometres since 1950, roughly equivalent to the area of the European Union. 
Furthermore, the level of oxygen in all ocean waters is falling, with 2% – 77bn tonnes – being lost since 1950. This can reduce growth, impair reproduction and increase disease, the scientists warn. One irony is that warmer waters not only hold less oxygen but also mean marine organisms have to breathe faster, using up oxygen more quickly. 
There are also dangerous feedback mechanisms. Microbes that proliferate at very low oxygen levels produce lots of nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas that is 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide.
In coastal regions, fertiliser, manure and sewage pollution cause algal blooms and when the algae decompose oxygen is sucked out of the water. However, in some places, the algae can lead to more food for fish and increase catches around the dead zones. This may not be sustainable though, said Breitburg: “There is a lot of concern that we are really changing the way these systems function and that the overall resilience of these systems may be reduced.”
The new analysis was produced by an international working group created in 2016 by Unesco’s Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission. The commission’s Kirsten Isensee said: “Ocean deoxygenation is taking place all over the world as a result of the human footprint, therefore we also need to address it globally.”
Lucia von Reusner, campaign director of the campaign group, Mighty Earth, which recently exposed a link between the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico and large scale meat production, said: “These dead zones will continue to expand unless the major meat companies that dominate our global agricultural system start cleaning up their supply chains to keep pollution out of our waters.”
Diaz said the speed of ocean suffocation already seen was breathtaking: “No other variable of such ecological importance to coastal ecosystems has changed so drastically in such a short period of time from human activities as dissolved oxygen.”
He said the need for urgent action is best summarised by the motto of the American Lung Association: “If you can’t breathe, nothing else matters.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/04/oceans-suffocating-dead-zones-oxygen-starved

In a study published in the journal Science, the researchers revealed a “dramatic shortening” of the time between bleaching events was “threatening the future existence of these iconic ecosystems and the livelihoods of many millions of people”.
The study examined 100 tropical reef locations across the world, analysing existing data on coral bleaching events as well as new field research conducted on the Great Barrier Reef after the longest and worst case of bleaching caused by climate change killed almost 25% of the coral.
“Before the 1980s, mass bleaching of corals was unheard of, even during strong El Niño conditions,” said lead author Prof Terry Hughes, director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies. “Now repeated bouts of regional-scale bleaching and mass mortality of corals has become the new normal around the world as temperatures continue to rise.”
The study found that time between bleaching events had diminished five-fold in the past 30 to 40 years, and was now too short to allow for a full recovery and was approaching unsustainable levels.
While mass bleaching events used to occur about once every 27 years, by 2016 the median time between them had shrunk to 5.9 years. Only six of the 100 sites had escaped bleaching.
“Our analysis indicates that we are already approaching a scenario in which every hot summer, with or without an El Niño event, has the potential to cause bleaching and mortality at a regional scale,” the paper said.
Globally, the annual risk of severe and moderate bleaching had increased by almost 4% a year since the 1980s, from an expected 8% of locations to 31% in 2016. 
The Western Atlantic remained at highest risk but Australasia and the Middle East saw the strongest increases in risk of bleaching.
Hughes said he hoped the “stark results” would prompt stronger action on reducing greenhouse gases. In May scientists warned that the central goal of the Australian government’s protection plan was no longer feasible because of the dramatic impact of climate change.
Friday’s paper also determined the link between El Niño and mass bleaching events has diminished as global warming continues.
Prior to the 1980s mass coral bleaching on a regional scale was “exceedingly rare or absent” and occurred in localised areas stretching tens of kilometres, not the hundreds of kilometres affected in recent times, the paper said.
These local bleaching events were largely caused by small-scale stressors like unusually hot or cold weather, freshwater inundation or sedimentation.
Then global warming increased the thermal stress of strong El Niño events, the paper said, widening the impact of individual bleaching events. Now, they are occurring at any time.
“Back in the 80s it was only during El Niño events that waters became hot enough to damage corals and induce them to bleach,” co-author Andrew Baird, a professor at James Cook University, told Guardian Australia.
“But now it’s 30, 40 years later and we’re seeing those temperatures in normal years.”
Baird said it was difficult to know if the current conditions were reversible but “the window to address it is diminishing”.
“It’s impossible to know if this is the end of coral reefs but it might be,” he said. “We really need to get on top of climate change as soon as possible.”
There have been several large-scale and devastating mass bleaching events in recent years. The 2015-16 event affected 75% of the reefs studied by the researchers, who said it was comparable to the then unprecedented mass bleaching of 1997-98, when 74% were affected.
“Interestingly one of the first papers that effectively drew attention to the issue – back in 1999 – suggested that by 2016, 2017, 2020, we would be seeing bleaching annually,” Baird said. “That’s pretty close to what’s happening unfortunately.
“Some of these earlier works were quite prescient in their prediction and unfortunately we didn’t pay enough attention back then.”
The study follows a discovery late last year that 3% of the Great Barrier Reef could facilitate recovery after bleaching – a finding the researchers at the time suggested was akin to a life-support system but small enough not to be taken for granted.
On Friday scientists announced that a major outbreak of coral-eating crown of thorns starfish had been found munching the Great Barrier Reef in December, prompting the Australian government to begin culling the spiky marine animals.
The predator starfish feeds on corals by spreading its stomach over them and using digestive enzymes to liquefy tissue. 
“Each starfish eats about its body diameter a night, and so over time that mounts up very significantly,” Hugh Sweatman, a senior research scientist at the Australian Institute of Marine Science told ABC radio. “A lot of coral will be lost,” he said. 
The crown of thorns were found in plague proportions in the Swains reefs, at the southern edge of the Great Barrier Reef, by researchers from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority.
The authority already killed some starfish at Swains reefs in December and said it would mount another mission in January.
There have been four major crown of thorns outbreaks since the 1960s in the Great Barrier Reef but it recovered each time because there were always healthy populations of herbivorous fish. The outbreaks are usually triggered by extra nutrients in the water but the reason for the current outbreak was unclear, Sweatman said.

Before I had one of my own I'd grab leaves from the roadside for cooking.
Different species of mosquito are more viscous in the biting department than others. Aedes funereus is a small, very black, mosquito that breeds in brackish swamps. When I ventured into it's beautiful territory of Grey Mangroves and large Mangrove Ferns, I'd wear long trousers, gumboots, hat and ling sleeved shirt with every inch of skin and parts of clothing sprayed with a DEET based repellent - even a dab behind the ears. DEET stops them detecting the odour of your skin, but they are still homing in on the CO2 gradient you create as you exhale, and attempt to fly up your nostrils. I never put DEET up my nostrils as it burns like chile.
Dengue is carried by introduced species of Aedes one of which Aedes aegypti used to live in Brisbane. Occasional outbreaks in are treated with a rapid and local response. Fortunately the mosquitoes involved don't fly too far from breeding place. A persistent outbreak that occurred in Charters Towers when I was there, was found to be due to breeding in the numerous old abandon gold mines that hit the water-table 10 metres down. There have been a few deaths due to haemolytic dengue which occurs when people are infected for a second time by a strain different to the first.
There is a widespread local disease mosquito borne called Ross River fever which occurs throughout the east coast which causes a painful arthritis like condition that can last up to a year. There are also a number of rare but devastating encephalitis type viruses. Malaria is longer endemic to Australia as it can now be treated in the liver stage in the human host. There are a couple of malaria free Queensland islands kilometres off the coast of Papua where malaria is endemic. The Papuans visit the island by canoe for trade and medical assistance but they're usually gone by nightfall when the anopheline mosquitoes emerge.
During world war 2 allied forces who'd been fighting in the Pacific and South East Asian war were stationed outside Canungra in the lush valley below the rainforest covered basalt plateau. Local dairy farmers started coming down with malaria no doubt transmitted by Anopheles brancroftii which is often present in large numbers breeding in agricultural ditches. All that was needed was an pool of infected humans to spread the Plasmodium into the mosquito population.

Atmospheric scientists have learned a great deal in the past many decades about how clouds form and move in Earth's atmospheric circulation. Investigators now realize that traditional computer models of global climate have taken a rather simple view of clouds and their effects , partly because detailed global descriptions of clouds have been lacking, and partly because in the past the focus has been on short-term regional weather prediction rather than on long-term global climate prediction. To address today's concerns, we need to accumulate and analyze more and better data to improve our understanding of cloud processes and to increase the accuracy of our weather and climate models.

No evidence for this statement. I suspect you are just making it up. Here is a fairly recent study...
BQSTART
Here we show that several independent, empirically corrected satellite records exhibit large-scale patterns of cloud change between the 1980s and the 2000s that are similar to those produced by model simulations of climate with recent historical external radiative forcing. Observed and simulated cloud change patterns are consistent with poleward retreat of mid-latitude storm tracks, expansion of subtropical dry zones, and increasing height of the highest cloud tops at all latitudes. The primary drivers of these cloud changes appear to be increasing greenhouse gas concentrations and a recovery from volcanic radiative cooling. These results indicate that the cloud changes most consistently predicted by global climate models are currently occurring in nature.

One ecosystem that will be seriously affected will be cloud forests – tropical jungles persistently bathed in fog.
Until now, little research had been done on the likely impacts of rising clouds, but one scientist is planning to change that using an enormous curtain strung up in the middle of the forest.
Cloud forest thrives on mountainsides at 500-4,000 metres above sea level, making up about 1% of the world’s forest in a tropical band that hugs the equator. But, though the area covered is small, the forests are vital to much broader regions. For instance, they help regulate rivers across vast tracts of lowlands, absorbing moisture into spongy soil when the weather is wet and releasing water when it’s dry. And they provide habitats for many birds, such as the coppery headed emerald hummingbird of Costa Rica and the elfin wood warbler of Puerto Rico, both of which live only in cloud forests.
Many scientists believe the process forcing clouds higher may already have begun. This would diminish a cloud forest’s moisture and it’s uncertain whether forests could successfully migrate uphill in response. Examining the impact of clouds relocating is critical to understanding the future of the forests.
Dan Metcalfe, a biology professor at Lund University in Sweden, wants hard data so he can determine what will happen to the forests that remain if the models are correct. He explains he’s trying something never before done: “an experimental approach where we actually physically try to remove clouds from a portion of the forest”.
Metcalfe had planned to encircle a square plot twice the size of a basketball court with a mesh curtain suspended from 10-storey phone poles at each corner. Fog would condense on the fabric, leaving the interior moisture-starved. He chose the Wayqecha Biological Station, a cloud forest research centre 3,000m above sea level in Peru. But he didn’t factor in the difficulty of operating heavy equipment at Wayqecha. Precipitous slopes and fragile soil prevent hauling in the kind of drill rig that could set corner posts deeply enough for big nets. No roads penetrate to Wayqecha’s groves, only footpaths.
Metcalfe realised he’d have to install bolted metal lattice towers. These can be hand-carried in pieces, then assembled on site. They can be built atop slender footings and stabilised by guy wires installed with lightweight equipment. But they’re expensive. He couldn’t afford two, let alone four, and feared that he might have to cancel the project. But then Metcalfe heard that not long before, the station had suffered a misfortune that could help him.
Wayqecha already had three lattice towers, supporting a catwalk over a ravine. Until recently, the walkway had included a fourth tower, but it had been toppled by a landslide. However, the structure’s struts and decking were undamaged. Rather than completely enclosing a plot in nets, Metcalfe realised he could suspend a single mesh curtain across the path of mist blowing up a valley. The fog-catching curtain would dangle from a cable stretched between one of the undamaged towers and a new one he’d build out of the one that had fallen.
Metcalfe encountered obstacle after obstacle even carrying out his plan: a key member of his construction team got sick and needed months of recovery; a fire destroyed expensive gear; and Peruvian customs balked when they saw that a shipping container of construction supplies included the bow and arrow he’d need for stringing cables. In the four years since he started the project, his wife had a child. And then another. It got tougher to leave home for Peru.
But finally, the curtain is nearly done. A crew built the tower in September and the last step, suspending the curtain above the forest floor, was completed at the end of October. Soon, Metcalfe will be able to shed light on the future of the forest.

The scientific paper warned the skewed ratio could threaten the population’s future.
Sea turtles are among species with temperature dependent sex-determination and the proportion of female hatchlings increases when nests are in warmer sands.
Tuesday’s paper, from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, California State University and Worldwide Fund for Nature Australia, is published in Current Biology. It examined two genetically distinct populations of turtles on the reef, finding the northern group of about 200,000 animals was overwhelmingly female.
While the southern population was 65%-69% female, females in the northern group accounted for 99.1% of juveniles, 99.8% of subadults and 86.8% of adults.
“Combining our results with temperature data show that the northern GBR green turtle rookeries have been producing primarily females for more than two decades and that the complete feminisation of this population is possible in the near future,” the paper said.
The temperature at which the turtles will produce male or female hatchlings is heritable, the paper said, but tipped to produce 100% male or 100% female hatchlings within a range of just a few degrees.
“Furthermore, extreme incubation temperatures not only produce female-only hatchlings but also cause high mortality of developing clutches,” it said. “With warming global temperatures and most sea turtle populations naturally producing offspring above the pivotal temperature, it is clear that climate change poses a serious threat to the persistence of these populations.”
The lead author, Dr Michael Jensen from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said the research provided a new understanding of what the turtle populations were dealing with.
He said the findings were surprising and “a bit alarming”, with significant conservation implications.
“While we can hope there might be some cooler years to produce a few more males, overall we can expect the temperatures to increase,” he said.
Jensen said the researchers worked around “ethical implications” of past studies that required sacrificing some hatchlings to accurately determine sex ratios and pivotal temperature ranges.
This team instead studied more than 400 turtles at foraging grounds, gathering information on the sex of turtles from multiple generations.
“Knowing what the sex ratios in the adult breeding population are today, and what they might look like five, 10 and 20 years from now when these young turtles grow up and become adults, is going to be incredibly valuable,” Jensen said.
The research was facilitated through the Great Barrier Reef Rivers to Reef to Turtles project by the World Wildlife Fund Australia.
The chief executive of WWF Australia, Dermot O’Gorman, said it was yet another sign of the impact of climate change, following recent research that coral bleaching events were occurring far more frequently.
“We’ve had two years where we’ve had mass bleaching events on the Great Barrier Reef,” he told Guardian Australia. “That’s a very visible sign of the impact of climate change. But this is an invisible change. We can’t see the impact it’s having on a turtle population until a study like this shows some long-term trends.”
O’Gorman said more urgent action on climate change was clearly needed but conservationists were taking some practical measures, including trialling the use of shadecloth on known nesting beaches to lower the sand temperature, and reducing bycatch in the fishing industry.
“[Shadecloths] can be done in certain places but there’s a limit to the scale you can do that,” he said.
 The green turtle is one of the most populous species of turtle in the world but the Great Barrier Reef settlement was significant and turtles were under enormous pressure outside Australian waters, O’Gorman said.

The US had 16 disasters last year with damage exceeding a billion dollars, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) said. That ties 2011 for the number of billion-dollar disasters, but the total cost blew past the previous record of $215bn in 2005.
Costs are adjusted for inflation and Noaa keeps track of billion-dollar weather disasters going back to 1980.
Three of the five most expensive hurricanes in US history hit last year.Hurricane Harvey cost $125bn, second only to 2005’s Katrina, while Maria cost $90bn, ranking third, Noaa said. Irma was $50bn, for the fifth most expensive hurricane. Western wildfires fanned by heat racked up $18bn in damage, triple the previous US wildfire record, according to Noaa.
Almost certainly, according to a statement issued by the World Meteorological Organization on Tuesday. “Climate change means that when we do have an event like Harvey, the rainfall amounts are likely to be higher than they would have been otherwise,” the UN organisation’s spokeswoman Clare Nullis told a conference. Nobody is arguing that climate change caused the storm, but it is likely to have made it much worse.
Warmer seas evaporate more quickly. Warmer air holds more water vapour. So, as temperatures rise around the world, the skies store more moisture and dump it more intensely. The US National Weather Service has had to introduce a new colour on its graphs to deal with the volume of precipitation. Harvey surpassed the previous US record for rainfall from a tropical system, as 49.2 inches was recorded at Mary’s Creek at Winding Road in Southeast Houston, at 9.20am on Tuesday.
There is a proven link – known as the Clausius-Clapeyron equation – that shows that for every half a degree celsius in warming, there is about a 3% increase in atmospheric moisture content. This was a factor in Texas. The surface temperature in the Gulf of Mexico is currently more than half a degree celsius higher than the recent late summer average, which is in turn more than half a degree higher than 30 years ago, according to Michael Mannof Penn State University. As a result there was more potential for a deluge.
Yes, the storm surge was greater because sea levels have risen 20cm as a result of more than 100 years of human-related global warming. This has melted glaciers and thermally expanded the volume of seawater.
“While we have to be careful about kneejerk cause-effect discussions, the National Academy of Science and recent peer-reviewed literature continue to show that some of today’s extremes have climate change fingerprints on them,” said University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd, a past president of the American Meteorological Society.
At least 362 people died in 2017 due to these natural disasters, the agency reported, including 64 killed in Puerto Rico. Outlets such as the New York Times and BuzzFeed have questioned the official death toll from the island, and estimated that Hurricane Maria has caused the deaths of about 1,000 people.
Noaa announced its figures at the society’s annual conference in Austin, Texas.The weather agency also said that 2017 was the third hottest year in US records for the lower 48 states with an annual temperature of 54.6F (12.6C), 2.6 degrees warmer than the 20th-century average. Only 2012 and 2016 were warmer. The five warmest years for the lower 48 states have all happened since 2006.
This was the third straight year that all 50 states had above-average temperatures for the year.
Five states Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and New Mexico had their warmest year ever. Temperature records go back to 1895.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/08/us-bill-natural-disasters-cleanup-record-climate-change

Solar thermal is looking good, but it's just not there yet as a solution to intermittency.So, intermittency means that we need storage. The only currently feasible storage option we have is pumped hydro. We would need 40GW of pumped hydro because there will always some days when we need 40GW and there are no renewables are available. Now to power the pumped hydro you need a power source, but using a ""renewables only"" constraint that means that we would need an additional, say 40 GW of solar / wind to pump for the immediate requirements of the each night / still period, giving ourselves a slight buffer to accommodate the 80% efficiency of pumped hydro.Then you have to add capacity for prolonged periods of dull, still weather. Let's say for up to 10 days maximum at a time. That doesn't add to the required generation capacity of pumped hydro - that stays at 40GW - but it certainly adds to the amount of dam storage you require and the amount of renewables capacity you require to fill that dam storage.So all up we would need a minimum of 150 - 200GW of renewable generation and 40GW of pumped hydro capacity to provide the same reliability as 40GW of gas / coal / nuclear (providing there are no periods of dull, still weather longer than 10 days). So where are we at? We require about $225bn - $500bn to build the required renewables capacity (at the current price of $1.50 to $2.50 per Watt) and if you use Snowy Hydro 2.0 as a metric, an additional investment of $60bn in pumped hydro, but frankly that sounds cheap because the current benchmark is $3.00 per Watt. So we are looking at an absolute minimum $300bn investment (but possibly as much $600bn to replace $40bn of fossil / nuclear capacity. And they are facts. You can play at the margins with the costs and assumptions, but I have erred on the side optimism, so you wont get much out of that. That is the engineering reality, Divine. So now we turn to the political reality. You have to convince the taxpayers to invest in something which is massively expensive that could make a small improvement to global climate change, but only if every other country in the world agrees to do the same thing. Good luck with that. Oh, and while you're at it, electricity generation is at best, what, 40% of total greenhouse gas production. It moves power from the States to the Commonwealth, always a popular move. Not. It requires finding sites for dams that have to supply 400GW days of power as an absolute minimum. (Remember, the Australian Greens was founded 30 years ago on getting the building of the Gordon-below-Franklin hydro dam stopped, so they would have to change their policies very substantially...)I could go on... So, Divine, when you unpack it, as lofty and as laudable as moving to renewables may be, it is not a case of believing in something. You have to be able to get it done.

Both solar and wind are intermittent. Everyone agrees with that for solar because they understand the concept of night, but there are still people who like to think of wind as continuous, or continuous enough to supply baseload.

The Earth has in the past been about the temperature it is today with CO2 concentrations many times what they are today. CO2 is a minor greenhouse gas, and one small variable (among thousands of variables), that determine our impossible-to-predict climate. So why the huge amount of interest in CO2? Well, it can be taxed. And taxation means regulation, control, wealth distribution, and outright extortion. It's what these ""treaties"" and ""protocols"" have been all about.

Australia’s share of global economy is 1.7%...matches our emissions pretty closely.

By what mechanism do you suggest that economy produces emissions?
There is no causation there - your metric makes no sense.
India is 2.8% of the world economy and produces 6.43% of ghg emissions.
UK is 3.3% of the world economy and produces 1.2% of ghg emissions.
Your comparison is imaginary.

If you are such an 'engineering' genius you should know that reality based physics trumps man made systems like economics. Or is that too big a step for you? The fact is that we can transition away from fossil fuels without sacrificing living standards - but we are held back by the lobbyists, and the media who work for the established vested interests of the HUGELY and artificially profitable fossil fuel companies.

Coal consumption has now been declining for three years in China
China's decreasing reliance on the fuel, large population and enormous investment in renewables mean it is increasingly being seen as a global leader on climate change, after the US withdrew from the Paris agreement earlier this month.
In the UK, three major coal power stations were wound up last year after a carbon tax was introduced and the last three underground coal mines closed.
British coal consumption fell by 52.5% in 2016 and the trend away from the fuel has continued this year, with the first coal-free day since the 19th century.
The US saw an astonishing 9% fall in demand, while Chinese hunger for energy is being tempered by moves to a more sustainable growth pathway and the rapid expansion of renewables, which spells even further trouble for coal in the years to come

No mention of pumped hydro

Divine, I agree, our friend Abel Adamski would have been much better off promoting pumped hydro, which, as we both know, is the only currently feasible technology for storing energy in sufficient quantities to provide dispatchable firming supply for renewables. But no, he just had to go down the fusion path...

...subsidies to fossil fuels...
BQEND
That's an empty well, Divine, excuse the pun.
Two problems:
1. Renewables are massively subsidised at the moment. Renewables receive capital grants, RET certificates (at $80 MWh) and most damagingly, market preference to the detriment of other supply sources which the grid also needs. Pot. Kettle. Black.
2. Current ""fuel subsidies"" are actually the waiver of a tax levied to pay for roads that certain vehicles do not use. It's pretty daft to think of the waiving of a tax as a subsidy - that's a very perverted view of taxation.
I am always staggered at the number of people commenting on The Guardian site with absolutely no understanding of basic engineering, project economics and political reality of massive energy projects. They call for the most pie-in-sky investments as though no one has to pay for this stuff or get it approved and permitted at multiple levels by multiple stakeholders!

It's time for this government to stop pretending | Greg Jericho,article,http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2018/jan/09/australias-emissions-are-rising-its-time-for-this-government-to-quick-pretending,0,"In the week before Christmas the government yet again released its latest data on greenhouse gas emissions in the hope they would be missed amid other news and the nearing festivities. As we start the new year let us revisit the data and highlight just how terrible the government’s record on emission reduction has been.
The news that the temperature in Penrith reached 47.3C on Sunday naturally had people talking of climate change. And while noting that a very hot day is evidence of climate change is not as stupid as the very stable genius, Donald Trump, suggesting that the cold snap in the east of the USA meant climate change was fake, we should remember that weather – even if it is hot – is still not climate.
Fortunately we do have data that shows the average temperatures for the entire planet over a year, and not just for a day, in a particular part of Australia. Less fortunate however, the data shows that things are very bad.
2017 will be the second warmest year on record and easily the warmest ever for a year not affected by El Nino:
It means that 2017 will be first time in six years that the calendar year has not been warmer than the one which preceded it. But that is small comfort, given it is warmer than every single year that did precede it but one.
All this fits appropriately with the news of Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions.
I should of course note that the news is a bit old – although you might have missed it. In 2016, the government released its emissions data on the Thursday before Christmas Day. Last year they were a bit better – they did it on the Tuesday before Christmas. Rather coincidentally it was also the day Malcolm Turnbull announced the reshuffle of his ministry and the government released its energy policy review.
I know the environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, would be disappointed if you had missed the release amid all that news, so let me give you a recap: short version – they are terrible; long version – they are terrible, and there is little hope that they will get better.
In the 12 months to September 2016, Australia’s annual greenhouse gas emissions rose to a record level of 550.2 Mt CO2-e if you include the rather dodgy emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sectors.
The government’s report sought to paint a nice picture, noting that this was just 0.7% above the previous year and was “0.8% below emissions in 2000 and 9.1% below emissions in 2005”.
But we can all cherry pick dates. For example, while it might be below 2000 and 2005 levels the latest emissions are around 4% above where they were in June 2014.
The government likes to include LULUCF emissions when comparing with 2000 and 2005, because back then we had a lot of such emissions, due to tree clearing and the like:
If we include such emissions in our overall count it means we can reduce our emissions by simply planting trees, or not clearing land (or promising to do so). That is why both in the Kyoto protocol and in the 2005 Paris agreement, Australian governments have made sure such emissions are counted.
Unfortunately this has been a long practice. The release of the latest cabinet papers from the final years of the Keating government showed the then ALP government sought a “no regrets” policy on climate change which essentially meant doing nothing that would increase electricity prices and trying to achieve reductions through limiting land clearing and planting trees.
The exclusion of LULUCF emissions shows just how greatly this affects our goal of reducing emissions by 26%-28% below 2005 levels by 2030:
Including LULULCF has us currently 9.1% below 2005 levels, but if you exclude them, Australia’s emissions are nearly 6% higher than they were in 2005.
The reality is “no regrets” and other climate change cons such as a “green army” or direct action do not work. And the latest emissions data shows this clearly.
Since the removal of the carbon price in June 2014, annual emissions have grown every quarter:
And you don’t need to be a Rhodes scholar presiding over a party room full of climate change deniers to know why. Putting a price on carbon provided an incentive for firms to use less of it. Removing that price removed the incentive.
It’s fortunate for the government that there is some good news – though this good news occurred in spite of its policies rather than due to them.
Annual electricity emissions have fallen – down 3.7% in the last year. But mostly this is due to a fall in demand for electricity and the reduction in the use of brown coal generated electricity due to the closure of the Hazelwood power station:
The problem for the government is that while the inclusion of LULUCF emissions and slowing electricity demand do help their path towards a 26% cut on 2005 levels by 2030, they remain a very long way from achieving that aim.
The government also released its latest emissions projection figures. And while the projections are lower than they were a year ago, they still predict Australia’s emissions by 2030 will be just 5% below 2005 levels:
The government’s energy policy – even if it allows a quasi price on carbon through buying of international permits – will not do anywhere near enough to reach the goal (no matter how much it annoys Tony Abbott).
The problem is that even if electricity emissions were to fall by 26% below 2005 levels, Australia’s overall emissions would still be just 9% below 2005 levels (and 4% above if you exclude LULUCF emissions).
The time has come for our politicians to quit pretending we can reduce emissions painlessly. If that was actually possible it would have already been done by every government on the planet. Climate change isn’t a problem because the solution is easy.
Time is running out. Yes, Australia only has a small percentage of the global land mass and emissions but either we are part of the global solution or we stand complicit with the ignorant and the charlatans who would say it is all a hoax.
The aim is to stop temperatures from rising to more than 2C above pre-industrial levels. We are already around 1.1C above those levels. Even using a very conservative liner trend of the past 50 years (something that is close to a best case scenario) we will reach 2C by 2071 – just 53 years time.
If that sounds a long time away, note that according the latest life expectancy figures all Australia males under 28 and all females under 32 can expect to live till then. That means 41% of Australians will likely live to experience such temperatures, unless action is taken.
But while we have a government with climate change deniers in key cabinet positions and which hides emissions data under the cover of Christmas holidays and a news dump I have little faith Australia will be part of any such action.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2018/jan/09/australias-emissions-are-rising-its-time-for-this-government-to-quick-pretending

The findings, published in the international medical journal the Lancet on Tuesday, have prompted the climate lobby group Doctors for the Environment Australia (DEA) to urge the federal government to fund states and territories to make hospitals more energy-efficient.
Researchers obtained 2014-15 financial data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare for 15 sectors of the healthcare industry, including public and private hospitals, dental services and private practice. They used this data in mathematical modelling to determine a carbon dioxide equivalent emissions factor for each sector, and to obtain an overall emissions footprint.
“We found that the carbon footprint attributed to healthcare was 7% of Australia’s total; that is, similar to the entire carbon emissions associated with the activities of 7% of Australians,” the study found. This represented 35,772 kilotonnes of Australia’s 494,930 kilotonnes of carbon emissions in 2014-15. The study found hospitals and the pharmaceutical industry were together responsible for two-thirds of the healthcare carbon footprint.
It is the first time the carbon footprint stemming from healthcare has been determined for Australia. Similar analyses conducted overseas found healthcare contributed 3% of total emissions in England and 10% in the US.
The co-author of the study, Dr Forbes McGain, an anaesthetist and intensive care physician with Western Health in Melbourne, said anaesthetic gases were a significant contributor to hospital carbon emissions. DEA has called on physicians to use general anaesthetic alternatives to gases, such as intravenous drugs.
“The anaesthetic gases we pump into the atmosphere have a very high global warming potential, up there with chlorofluorocarbons,” McGain said. The gases desflurane and nitrous oxide, known as laughing gas, were especially bad for the environment, he said.
Intravenous drugs or less potent gases could be used instead, with no impact on the quality of patient care.
“Though there are some reasons why gases might be used, such as fast onset and offset, Denmark for example uses intravenous anaesthesia much more commonly than gases,” he said. “So cultural factors are extremely important, as well as marketing by pharmaceutical companies to influence doctors. Gases won’t be completely replaced, but they don’t need to be used as commonly as they are.”
He agreed with DEA that more hospitals needed to turn to renewable energy. Short payback times for photovoltaics and rising energy prices meant solar panels should become an increasingly viable option, McGain said.
In an accompanying comment piece published in the Lancet, public health researchers Professor Peng Bi and Dr Alana Hansen from the University of Adelaide wrote that reducing the number of patients attending hospitals would also curb carbon emissions. General practitioners would be essential to this, by detecting disease early and promoting disease prevention measures. 
“Health promotion efforts to encourage healthy lifestyles will help to reduce the need for access to healthcare and on the reliance for pharmaceuticals, the sectors with the highest direct carbon dioxide equivalent emissions emissions,” the authors wrote. 
“Messages on how to maintain a healthy lifestyle might help to reduce individual and community vulnerability to the health effects of climate change and, ironically, help lower the main contributing factor – carbon emissions.”
McGain said it was promising that many states had committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2050.
“But to achieve emissions reductions in healthcare will be a massive effort, requiring support and funding at the federal level,” he said. “Climate change is a health problem, and the health sector should be leading the way in addressing it.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/09/australias-healthcare-system-contributing-to-7-of-nations-carbon-footprint

Where ""this"" equals the fact that you don't have to show that an event is unprecedented to show that climate change has occurred but instead it is sufficient to show that the frequency of such events has occurred.
Climate is defined as the weather conditions prevailing in an area over a long period - in most cases taken as a 30 year period. By definition an increase in the frequency over a 30 year period of a weather event such as a particular maximum or minimum temperature or a particular levels of daily precipitation is a change in the climate for that region. This is basic textbook knowledge that all climatologists bring to their studies without stating the obvious with every study.
There is however no shortage of studies that show that particular weather events such as heatwaves and extremely hot days for the region, plus extreme rainfall events, have in increased in frequency worldwide in various climates.
Note that I was talking above about the weather pattern seen recently across North America, not the frequency of winter storms.

The projected changes involve the following risks to humans and other species: (1) continued shrinking of Arctic sea ice, with effects on native cultures and ice-dependent biota; (2) less snow accumulation and earlier melt in mountains, with reductions in spring and summer runoff for agricultural and municipal water; (3) disappearance of mountain glaciers and their late-summer runoff; (4) increased evaporation from farmland soils and stress on crops; (5) greater soil erosion due to increases in heavy convective summer rainfall; (6) longer fire seasons and increases in fire frequency; (7) severe insect outbreaks in vulnerable forests; (8) acidification of the global ocean; and (9) fundamental changes in the composition, functioning, and biodiversity of many terrestrial and marine ecosystems. In addition, melting of Greenland and West Antarctic ice (still highly uncertain as to amount), along with thermal expansion of seawater and melting of mountain glaciers and small ice caps, will cause substantial future sea-level rise, affecting densely populated coastal regions, inundating farmlands, and dislocating large populations (Melillo et al, 2014; IPPC, 2013). Because large, abrupt climatic changes occurred within spans of just decades during previous ice-sheet fluctuations, the possibility exists for rapid future changes as ice sheets become vulnerable to enhanced global warming associated with the greenhouse gas increases. Finally, carbon-climate model simulations indicate that 15%–40% of the anthropogenic CO2 “pulse” could stay in the atmosphere for longer than a thousand years, extending the duration of fossil-fuel warming and its effects on humans and other species. The acidification of the global ocean and its effects on ocean life are projected to last for tens of thousands of years and, on the basis of documented climate changes in the past, lead to extinction of species.

Yes, some people here are very impatient because they've seen all these things so often and get tired of the same confusions.
I try to be very careful to be polite and to rely on the scientific sources.
Doubt needs to be based on something - there's no point having an opinion that can't be supported by evidence.
The concept that global warming is being caused by human activity has - like other scientific paradigms - :
....... coherence - consilience - and - consensus ......
Coherence - a theory that coherently explains the multiple observed lines of empirical evidence across multiple aspects of the climate system.
Consilience - the predicted and projected changes being confirmed across multiple scientific disciplines observing the multiple aspects of the climate system.
Consensus - agreement amongst scientific researchers from many different academic disciplines that the first two C's are correct, and that no alternate theory can adequately explain this.
Climate change (AGW) is a scientific paradigm, so well-established that it sits alongside other paradigms as plate tectonics, evolution, and relativity.
The key concepts were established in the 19th century.
Tens of thousands of pieces of research in geochemistry, palaeontology, oceanography, atmospheric physics, and many more fields of study, have resulted in this overall concept.
Any other idea would need to explain at least as much evidence in a different way.
Which would include the huge mass of evidence from the geological record.
A scientific paradigm will only change if a new paradigm is found that explains not just the existing evidence but even more new evidence.
There is no sign at all of that process happening over AGW, because there is no evidence accumulating that would initiate a paradigm shift.
If that situation changed, then the paradigm would become open to change.
Those things related to food and health issues have never had the status of scientific paradigms, supported by evidence from a wide range of scientific fields.
I come to these discussions to share what I've found in the scientific sources.
The problem we now face is that all weather events now take place within a set of earth systems that are different to those of, say, 100 years ago. Climate change has produced a new framework for weather.
We can't tell which particular events a successful athlete on steroids would have won anyway without the steroids, but steroids increase the chance of victories.
Now, we can't tell what 'weather' would be like without climate change any more.
We now have ""weather on steroids"".
Or we could say that for the probability of any unusual weather event occurring, climate change loads the dice.

are you really claiming there's some vast plot involved in this
BQEND
No, I am not. But just look at the way the conversation has gone here, because I dared to say my position has shifted into neutrality (and I will go through why again below). Now I am a conspiracy theorist, a Trump support, a 'denier' (neutrality is NOT denial). What I am is a 'not surer'. Anybody who dares to offer a counter view or question anything related to climate change conclusions, is attacked. Can you imagine being a scientist in that environment?
Let's go through this logically.
1. Because I do believe in science as being the best way to try to arrive at material truths, I accepted AGW.2. There have been a number of failed predictions, pointing to the complexity of the earth's systems. My own observations and experiences (I am a nature freak) so observe things closely, have not aligned with the dire predictions for my local environment. Nor have they aligned with the cool summers we have had recently/are having (snow is a possibility today!). One can use one's own noggin and look at what's happening in the US to conclude that it doesn't look like the globe is warming. 3. Climate goes up and down, so these may be anomalies in a long term upward trend that will continue. I understand that, but I am, quire reasonably, suspicious of any scientific theory that says whatever the weather: hot, cold, wet, dry it's climate change caused by global warming. That is NOT how science works. Science needs a clearer prediction, not merely 'change'.4. All I have said is that if the warming trend significantly reverses as predicted by the coolists, I think it would be reasonable to discount global warming theories, which all point to increasing temperatures. 5. If the coolists theories prove wrong, then it only enhances the case for AGW.6. People are saying that the science is 'irrefutable'. NO science is irrefutable. Science is based on it being refutable. Diversity of scientific viewpoint must be permitted; that is how we get to the truth.7. There have been many instances of 'consensus' science or beliefs that have proved to be totally wrong. Think about the sugar/fat debate, or the egg/cholesterol, or the butter/margarine.8. What would you rather: a neutral person who personally tries to live a 'green' life, or an avowed and vocal believer in climate change who demonstrates no personal commitment to their belief in catastrophic CC.

I think warming is going to proceed much slower than model predictions, thanks in part to the inability of models (and modellers) to incorporate indirect solar effects into their experiments. My guess is the 20 year period ending 10 years from now will show only about 0.05C/decade warming rate for SAT, far below the model predictions of about .25C/decade for the same period.

Which is why it is also important to not only seek out and highlight the worst-case scenarios, but to place them in context, along with those considered most likely. People should be given all the information, not just bits of it. That can be misleading.

This time around, the myth appears to have been sparked by a Sky News interview with Northumbria University mathematics professor Valentina Zharkova. The story was quickly echoed by the Daily Mail, International Business Times, Sputnik News, Metro, Tru News, and others. Zharkova was also behind the ‘mini ice age’ stories in 2015, based on her research predicting that the sun will soon enter a quiet phase.
The most important takeaway point is that the scientific research is clear – were one to occur, a grand solar minimum would temporarily reduce global temperatures by less than 0.3°C, while humans are already causing 0.2°C warming per decade. 
So the sun could only offset at most 15 years’ worth of human-caused global warming, and once its quiet phase ended, the sun would then help accelerate global warming once again.
The myth ultimately stems from a period climate scientists have coined “The Little Ice Age” (LIA). This was a modestly cool period running from about the year 1300 to 1850. It was particularly cold in the UK, where the River Thames sometimes froze over, and ‘frost fairs’ were held. 
A team led by University of Reading physicist and solar expert Mike Lockwood wrote a paper reviewing the science behind frost fairs, sunspots, and the LIA. It included the figure below showing northern hemisphere temperatures along with sunspot number and the level of volcanic particles in the atmosphere over the past millennium:
During full blown ice ages, temperatures have generally been 4–8°C colder than in modern times. As this figure shows, during the LIA, temperatures were at most only about 0.5°C cooler than the early 20th century. Thus, Lockwood calls the Little Ice Age “a total misnomer.” As the authors put it:
Compared to the changes in the proper ice ages, the so-called Little Ice Age (LIA) is a very short-lived and puny climate and social perturbation.
For comparison, temperatures have risen by a full 1°C over the past 120 years, and 0.7°C over just the past 40 years.
The Maunder Minimum was a period of quiet solar activity between about 1645 and 1715. It’s often referred to interchangeably with ‘Little Ice Age,’ but the latter lasted centuries longer. In fact, three separate solar minima occurred during the LIA, which also included periods of relatively higher solar activity. Other factors like volcanic eruptions and human activities also contributed to the cool temperatures. In fact, a 2017 paper led by the University of Reading’s Mathew Owens concluded:
Climate model simulations suggest multiple factors, particularly volcanic activity, were crucial for causing the cooler temperatures in the northern hemisphere during the LIA. A reduction in total solar irradiance likely contributed to the LIA at a level comparable to changing land use [by humans].
Several studies have investigated the potential climate impact of a future grand solar minimum. In every case, they have concluded that such a quiet solar period would cause less than 0.3°C cooling, which as previously noted, would temporarily offset no more than a decade and a half’s worth of human-caused global warming. These model-based estimates are consistent with the amount of cooling that occurred during the solar minima in the LIA.
Although it would have a relatively small impact on the climate, it’s still an interesting question to ask whether we’re headed for another quiet solar period. Zharkova thinks so. Her team created a model that tries to predict solar activity, and suggests another solar minimum will occur from 2020 to 2055. However, other solar scientists have criticized the model as being too simple, created based on just 35 years of data, and failing to accurately reproduce past solar activity.
Ilya Usoskin, head of the Oulu Cosmic Ray Station and Vice-Director of the ReSoLVE Center of Excellence in Research, published a critique of Zharkova’s solar model making those points. Most importantly, the model fails in reproducing past known solar activity because Zharkova’s team treats the sun as a simple, predictable system like a pendulum. In reality, the sun has more random and unpredictable (in scientific terms, “stochastic”) behavior:
For example, a perfect pendulum – if you saw a few cycles of the pendulum, you can predict its behavior. However, solar activity is known to be non-stationary process, which principally cannot be predicted (the prediction horizon for solar activity is known to be 10-15 years). Deterministic prediction cannot be made because of the essential stochastic component. 
Just imagine a very turbulent flow of water in a river rapid, and you throw a small wooden stick into water and trace it. Then you do it second time and third time ... each time the stick will end up in very different positions after the same time period. Its movement is unpredictable because of the turbulent stochastic component. This is exactly the situation with solar activity.
Lockwood agrees that we don’t yet have a proven predictive theory of solar behavior. He has published research examining the range of possible solar evolutions based on past periods when the Sun was in a similar state to today, but as he puts it, “that is the best that I think we can do at the present time!”
Solar physicist Paul Charbonneau at the University of Montreal also concurred with Usoskin. He told me that while scientists are working to simulate solar activity, including using simplified models like Zharkova’s, 
on the standards of contemporary dynamo models theirs is extremely simple —in fact borderlining simplistic ... To extrapolate such a model outside its calibration window, you need an extra, very strong hypothesis: that the physical systems underlying the magnetic field generation retain their coherence (Phase, amplitude, etc.). As my colleague Ilya Usoskin has already explained, this is very unlikely to be the case in the case of the solar activity cycle.
Zharkova believes her solar model is correct, but at best it can only try to predict when the next quiet solar period will occur. Its influence on Earth’s climate is outside her expertise, and the peer-reviewed research is clear that it would be a minimal impact.
Zharkova disagrees – I contacted her, and she told me that she believes a grand solar minimum would have a much bigger cooling effect. However, she also referenced long-debunked myths about global warming on Mars and Jupiter, and made a comment about “the preachers of global warming.” She’s clearly passionate about her research, and has the credibility that comes with publishing peer-reviewed studies on solar activity. Perhaps these factors motivate journalists to write these frequent ‘mini ice age’ stories. 
But Zharkova’s climate science beliefs are irrelevant. While she has created a model predicting an imminent period of quiet solar activity, other scientists have identified serious flaws in the model, and in any case, research has shown that another solar minimum would only have a small and temporary impact on Earth’s climate.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jan/09/the-imminent-mini-ice-age-myth-is-back-and-its-still-wrong

It doesn't expose their dealerships to such a loss of maintenance revenue, nor throw the refuelling model into the air.
I have no problem with such an outcome - it still decarbonises transport, or at least the emissions related to fuels even if not addressing particulate emissions from brakes/tyres.
I wonder if we are past the point of no return though on EVs ? Every manufacturer seems to have current or future models of hybrid and full EV, while almost no-one has (IIRC) hydrogen-based models available now or announced.
It seems like a VHS/Betamax moment - a technically inferior solution winning because of market momentum. I say technically inferior from a refuelling and range pov. The gap to ICEs will, I expect, close on both those fronts. There was a double page article in the Saturday Times recently which had some very optimistic claims about range and refuelling times based on a move to solid state batteries. My understanding of the state of research into these is pretty much non-existent, so I don't know whether the ""possibilities"" are real or achievable soon.
On the grid impact, the National Grid seems fairly calm about it : http://fes.nationalgrid.com/media/1281/forecourt-thoughts-v12.pdf
and the latest BEIS report seems to think we will need less extra gas capacity than previously thought, even allowing for more EVs : https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/energy-and-emissions-projections

The district heating pipes already exist in the Chinese cities. This is evident from your wiki link: ""In northern China, district heating systems are common. Most district heating system which are just for heating instead of CHP use hard coal.""
These reactors provide a very low cost source of low-carbon heat, replacing the existing fossil-fuelled heat sources. The fact that they are low cost is emphasised in the original link @Quokkaz provided. ""China’s deep pool system will generate no electricity, but is designed for ultra low cost heat production.""Under the circumstances, they evidently consider this to be better than any renewable source of heating, given that they plan to deploy these on a grand scale. The scale is mentioned in the original link: ""Hundreds will be made to provide heat in Northern Chinese cities in the winter.""

Over 100 Finnish election candidates – Greens included – call for small reactors for district heating 
Climate change has continued to break the temperature and ice loss records. In the upcoming municipal elections [April 9, 2017] we have the opportunity of influencing greenhouse gas emissions from our cities. For example, more than half of all emissions in Helsinki are caused by district heat that is largely generated by burning coal.
Plans to replace coal with wood pellets do not reduce emissions enough. In addition, increasing wood harvests have disastrous environmental consequences.
However, a very low-carbon source of heat exist: nuclear power. New generation of mass produced small reactors are the conceptual opposites of massive prototype plants such as Olkiluoto 3. Reactors are factory-built and transported to the site, speeding up construction. They can also be passively safe, shutting themselves safely down even if all safety systems fail.
The undersigned municipal election candidates desire that the possibilities for using nuclear energy in district heating are explored.

China is the world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases and still invests in coal but in recent years it has become the largest investor in domestic renewable energy. The country is now on track to lead international investment in the sector, according to the report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).
“As the global transition toward renewables gains pace and as battery storage and electric vehicles technologies pick up momentum, China is setting itself up to dominate these sectors globally over the next several decades of this century,” said IEEFA.
IEEFA identified a record high spend of more than US$44bn by China on international takeovers and projects worth more than $1bn – a 38% year-on-year growth.
China’s One Belt One Road agenda, which drives infrastructure investment along ancient trade routes, is leading the country’s growth. $8bn of solar equipment has been exported from China since it began, and the country has overtaken the US and Germany to become the number one exporter of environmental goods and services.
“China’s presence in wind power globally is also on the rise, led by international activities of companies such as Goldwind and by China Three Gorges’ diversification away from hydroelectricity,” the report said.
The trajectory is in stark contrast to that of the US, which last year pulled out of the Paris climate accord and has renewed its support for the coal industry. The decision to abandon the Paris agreement “led to China’s quick reaffirmation of its emissions-reduction pledge”, the report said.
“That allows it to further project itself globally as a responsible major power while addressing its domestic air pollution concerns and building world-leading capacity in new energy markets.”
As part of its Paris commitments, China pledged to peak its emissions by 2030 while making best efforts to peak earlier. It would also increase the share of renewable or nuclear energy sources to 20%.
Co-author of the report and director of IEEFA, Tim Buckley, said China was setting itself up as a global technology leader “whilst the US government looks the other way”.
“Although China isn’t necessarily intending to fill the climate leadership void left by the US withdrawal from Paris, it will certainly be very comfortable providing technology leadership and financial capacity so as to dominate fast-growing sectors such as solar energy, electric vehicles and batteries.”
The report noted the August 2017 merger of China’s top coal mining company, Shenhua Group Corp, with one of the “big five” power utilities, China Guodian Corp.
The newly named China Energy Investment Corp created the world’s largest power generator, and with the clean-energy assets of Guodian, Shenhua’s growth was no longer dependent on the pursuit of coal.
“[This] strategic posture [of pursuing coal] has burdened China’s power companies and limited their appetite for innovative new clean energy technologies,” the IEEFA said.
The report also found China was “outmanoeuvring other economies” in securing energy commodity supplies such as lithium, nickel and cobalt, allowing them to dominate manufacturing of batteries and electric vehicles.
On Monday, the US federal energy regulatory commission rejected a plan by the Donald Trump-led US administration to provide subsidies for coal-fired and nuclear power plants.
Last year the energy secretary, Rick Perry, proposed moves to slow the phasing out of the ageing plants and Trump vowed to repeal Obama-era environmental regulations in a bid to end a so-called “war on coal”.
However, independent analysis found the subsidies plan would cost taxpayers $10.6bn a year, and the commission on Monday said there was no evidence that retiring coal-fired power plants threatened the reliability of the nation’s electricity grid.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/10/china-on-track-to-lead-in-renewables-as-us-retreats-report-says

Prof Jamie Seymour has “little doubt” irukandji will keep moving after a stinger was found at Fraser Island on Sunday and a boy was stung on Mooloolaba beach on the sunshine coast 12 months ago. 
“It would shut beaches. It would collapse tourism,” the toxinologist from James Cook University said. 
Seymour said warmer sea temperatures behind the irukandji’s drift south, and they could become a regular occurrence at Mooloolaba, and even as far south as Coolangatta on the Gold Coast. 
The lack of forward planning on the issue is a point of frustration for Seymour, who is “sick of” warning of the risk of the highly venomous species. 
“How many more people need to get stung before it’s realised it is not just a one-off?” he said. “Be proactive, don’t wait until it becomes a larger problem. Throw money at it now.” 
The irukandji jellyfish caught on the western side of Queensland’s Fraser Island on Sunday prompted a warning for swimmers to stay out of the water.
“We’re urging everyone to stay out of the water entirely on that western side of the island while conditions are hot and humid,” the Surf Life Saving Queensland regional manager, Craig Holden, said on Wednesday.
However, Queensland Tourism Industry’s chief executive officer, Daniel Gschwind, said there was no need for panic. 
“We want people to have a great time here and go away healthy. We are concerned about any potential risk but there is no need to be alarmed at this point,” Gschwind said.
Gschwind said collaborations with Surf Life Saving Queensland allowed information on risks to be communicated quickly to swimmers. “To speak about some sort of migration is misleading or premature,” he said. 
SLSQ has upgraded its stinger response with daily drags to find the jellyfish after a spate of serious stingers hit the area between late 2016 and early 2017.
There were 10 suspected irukandji stings on the western side of Fraser Island between 22 December 2016 and 5 January last year.
Holden said if a person was stung a triple zero call should be made immediately and the sting area should be doused with vinegar as soon as possible.
He advised people to take a bottle of vinegar with them if they were heading to the island. 
“We don’t want to cause widespread panic, but it is really important for people to exercise caution and put safety first at all times.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/10/deadly-irukandji-jellyfish-drifting-south-towards-gold-coast-as-sea-temperatures-rise

City officials have set a goal of divesting New York’s $189bn pension funds from fossil fuel companies within five years in what they say would be “among the most significant divestment efforts in the world to date”. Currently, New York City’s five pension funds have about $5bn in fossil fuel investments. New York state has already announced it is exploring how to divest from fossil fuels. 
 “New York City is standing up for future generations by becoming the first major US city to divest our pension funds from fossil fuels,” said Bill de Blasio, New York’s mayor.
“At the same time, we’re bringing the fight against climate change straight to the fossil fuel companies that knew about its effects and intentionally misled the public to protect their profits. As climate change continues to worsen, it’s up to the fossil fuel companies whose greed put us in this position to shoulder the cost of making New York safer and more resilient.”
De Blasio said that the city is taking the five fossil fuel firms – BP, Exxon Mobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Shell – to federal court due to their contribution to climate change.
Court documents state that New York has suffered from flooding and erosion due to climate change and because of looming future threats it is seeking to “shift the costs of protecting the city from climate change impacts back on to the companies that have done nearly all they could to create this existential threat”.
The court filing claims that just 100 fossil fuel producers are responsible for nearly two-thirds of all greenhouse gas emissions since the industrial revolution, with the five targeted companies the largest contributors.
The case will also point to evidence that firms such as Exxon knew of the impact of climate change for decades, only to downplay and even deny this in public. New York’s attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, is investigating Exxon over this alleged deception.
Divestment is the opposite of investment. It's the shifting of stocks, bonds or funds from certain businesses or sectors.
Individual people invest in various ways to generate money, but large institutions such as cities, universities and religious organizations do this on a huge scale. Traditionally, fund managers put together investment portfolios that will provide the best returns for these institutions, regardless of where the money is invested.
The divestment movement, primarily consisting of climate activists, is urging private and public institutions to rid their portfolios of all oil, gas and coal stocks to send a financial and ethical message that fossil fuels are harmful and shouldn't be tolerated. So far, it's estimated that funds totalling $6tn have committed to divesting from fossil fuels.
Activists hope this momentum will deprive fossil fuels of a social license, similar to tobacco, and help accelerate the deployment of cleaner energy, such as wind and solar.
 New York was badly rattled by Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and faces costs escalating into the tens of billions of dollars in order to protect low-lying areas such as lower Manhattan and the area around JFK airport from being inundated by further severe storms fueled by rising sea levels and atmospheric warming. De Blasio’s office said climate change is “perhaps the toughest challenge New York City will face in the coming decades”.
 New York’s lawsuit echoes a similar effort on the west coast, where two California counties and a city are suing 37 fossil fuel companies for knowingly emitting dangerous levels of greenhouse gases. One of those firms, Exxon, has complained that it has been targeted by a “collection of special interests and opportunistic politicians” as part of a “conspiracy” to force the company to comply with various political objectives.
 The legal action and the divestment draw perhaps the starkest dividing line yet between New York and the Trump administration on climate change. Under Trump, the federal government has attempted the withdraw the US from the Paris climate accords, tear up Barack Obama’s signature climate policies and open up vast areas of America’s land and waters to coal, oil and gas interests.
De Blasio and the city comptroller, Scott Stringer, have come under pressure for several years from activists to rid New York’s pension funds of any link to fossil fuels, with some environmentalists claiming the city has been too slow to use its clout to tackle climate change.
Stringer admitted the divestment will be “complex” and will take some time but said the city’s pension funds could promote sustainability while also protecting the retirement of teachers, police officers and other city workers.
“New York City today becomes a capital of the fight against climate change on this planet,” said Bill McKibben, co-founder of climate group 350.org.
“With its communities exceptionally vulnerable to a rising sea, the city is showing the spirit for which it’s famous – it’s not pretending that working with the fossil fuel companies will somehow save the day, but instead standing up to them, in the financial markets and in court.”
 Christiana Figueres, former UN climate chief and architect of the Paris climate agreement, added: “The exponential transition toward a fossil-fuel-free economy is unstoppable and local governments have a critical role to play. There is no time to lose.
“It’s therefore extremely encouraging to see NYC step up today.”
New York joins cities such as Washington DC and Cape Town in divesting, along with universities such as Stanford in California and Oxford in the UK. The Rockefeller Brothers Fund, notable for its links to the past oil wealth of John D Rockefeller, has also sought to divest.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/10/new-york-city-plans-to-divest-5bn-from-fossil-fuels-and-sue-oil-companies

With no trees or vegetation to slow the surge it swept rocks and boulders from the Verdugo mountains into a thunderous river.
Jeannette Abney, 88, watched in horror not believing slopes could so quickly turn to sludge and so quickly surround her home in La Tuna canyon.
“Oh God, the rain was terrible, terrible. Outside it was like a war zone, like Niagara Falls. It pushed my big truck 60ft across the road. It sounded like a freight train. I’ve never experienced anything like that.”
Abney escaped Tuesday’s mudslide in this rural corner of Los Angeles with her two dogs and spoke on Wednesday from an American Red Cross evacuation center. It offered cots, blankets, food and instant coffee. A cool breeze flapped posters declaring “disaster services”.
Swaths of southern California are in need after nature’s latest battering, this time in the form of heavy rains which unleashed massive debris flows, a grim sequel to a record drought and record wildfires.
At least 17 people died, mostly in Montecito, a wealthy enclave north-west of LA. The avalanche buried homes and swept others from their foundations, which in addition to the dead left at least 25 people injured, 24 missing and hundreds marooned, authorities said.
Rescue crews in helicopters plucked survivors from waist-high mud, including a 14-year-old girl. “I thought I was dead for a minute there,” she told them.
“All hell broke loose,” Peter Hartmann, a dentist, told AP. “Power lines were down, high-voltage power lines, the large aluminum poles to hold those were snapped in half. Water was flowing out of water mains and sheared-off fire hydrants.” He watched rescuers revive a toddler pulled unresponsive from the muck. “It was a freaky moment to see her just covered in mud.” 
The death toll was expected to rise as search-and-rescue teams took advantage of the storm’s ebbing to scour several dozen damaged and destroyed homes. “Right now our assets are focused on determining if anyone is still alive in any of those structures that have been damaged,” Sheriff Bill Brown of Santa Barbara county told reporters.
The storm – the first of the rainy season – turned devastating because huge wildfires in recent months charred mountains and canyons, leaving soil unable to efficiently absorb water.
Authorities anticipated the danger and issued evacuation orders in recently burned areas of Santa Barbara, Ventura and Los Angeles counties. Only an estimated 10 to 15% of people in a mandatory evacuation area of Santa Barbara county heeded the warning.
I’ve always been more scared of fires but now I think you have to worry more about mud – it’s silent and faster
The harrowing consequences rekindled a perennial debate about the Golden State occupying a thin line between fortune and disaster, and the lottery of never knowing which will strike.
“We’ve been dodging bullets and got lucky again,” said Tom Suchner, 63, a car mechanic, as he walked his dog down Kagel canyon. “It was a nice, steady rain. It got rid of a lot of the ash.”
In this part of the Verdugo mountains, a rugged patch of nature on LA’s outskirts, residents woke up on Wednesday to marshy soil and not much worse. 
But just a few miles away a mudflow traced a burnt ridgeline and smashed into an affluent neighbourhood lining La Tuna canyon road. 
“It was a full river, boulders floating down, hitting cars,” said one resident, Diana Kalaitzian, 45. “I’ve always been more scared of fires but now I think you have to worry more about mud because you don’t see it coming. It’s silent and faster.”
Helicopters hovered as Kalaitzian stood outside her home, surveying the aftermath: sludge in every direction, a landscape overnight turned brown. Neighbours were shovelling sludge.
At one end of the road earth-movers were clearing lanes and imposing some order on the mud. At the other, higher up in the canyon, there was no way for cars to pass and mud-splattered police were riding mountain bikes, inspecting damage. 
Kalaitzian’s home escaped but she was braced for a season of anxiety. “You know there’s more to come.”
California has just endured its worst and most expensive wildfire season. The Thomas fire, which encompassed the land around Montecito, burned more than 280,000 acres, the biggest in the state’s modern history. 
This followed a five-year-drought – by some measures the worst in a millennium – which emptied reservoirs and parched the countryside. 
It ended in 2016 with record rainfall which counterintuitively aggravated last year’s fire season by producing vegetation – fuel. It turned tinder dry last summer, the hottest on record. 
So many records in so short a time has convinced many scientists that climate change is a factor.
Elizabeth Terry, 63, a caregiver who lives in a boarding home in the Verdugo mountains, has had to evacuate three times: a wildfire in 2016, another in 2017, then this week’s mudslides. 
“California is a wonderful place to live – depending where you live,” she said, speaking from a Red Cross evacuation centre. Terry can’t afford to live in a safer area. “Lord knows I’m trying to move, desperately.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/10/california-mudslide-montecito-death-toll-wildfires-climate-change

I mean genuine plants to process plastic from the UK and the rest of Europe, not just depots for onward reselling as seems to have been the case. 
There are initiatives to use such waste plastic in innovative ways. For example there is a small startup company in Scotland, MacRebur, developing ways to reduce the amount of toxic bitumen in asphalt by substituting a proportion of waste plastic into the mix. Surely we should urge government and private industry to build and develop plants to deal with the problem now, before we are knee-deep in bottles?Ian PaulYork
• China’s huge expansion of domestic renewables and $8bn in solar technology exports last year alone is stunning (China on track to lead in renewables as US retreats, report says, theguardian.com, 10 January). I wish we had the same level of vision and drive in the UK government and parliament to follow a similar model.
While there has been welcome expansion in offshore wind, solar and onshore wind are stalling as the impact of deep subsidy cuts bite. The vacillation over tidal energy is evidence of another renewable revolution being spurned, allowing our competitors to steal a march on us. This compares markedly with an attitude of bending over backwards to assist overseas operators with billions of pounds in effective subsidy support for new nuclear projects. It is an illogical and irrational energy policy which could drive energy bills up rather than down.
Last year was a record one for renewable energy in the UK, with solar and wind combined producing more electricity generation than coal for 315 days of the year, but will it continue as these negative policies begin to bite?  
With the urgent need to decarbonise heat, and transport offering other benefits to the economy, let’s see some Chinese-type ambition in all sectors of our low-carbon renewable energy industry to drive an alternative energy revolution.Feargal DaltonConvener, Nuclear Free Local Authorities Secretariat Scotland
• We are currently in Veganuary, where people are encouraged to abandon their carnivorous ways and eat a vegan diet for the month of January. Perhaps next month the Guardian could organise “fossil-fuel-free February” where fossil-fuel car users are encouraged to abandon their polluting vehicles in favour of walking and cycling? It could become an annual event until fossil fuel cars are banned in a few decades’ time. It would also encourage petrolheads to develop a personal portfolio of transport options such as walking or using a bicycle for short journeys to the local shop while keeping car use for longer journeys instead of always using their cars regardless of distance to be travelled.Neil SinclairEdinburgh

On Wednesday, city officials announced that New York was to divest its pension funds of about $5bn in fossil fuel-linked money over the next five years. New York’s total pension fund for its teachers, firefighters and other city workers is worth about $189bn. 
Bill de Blasio, New York’s mayor, also revealed the city is suing the world’s largest oil and gas companies over their role in knowingly creating dangerous global warming in a two-pronged assault that he said is aimed at “standing up for future generations”.
Economists said the status of New York as a financial and cultural giant would probably spur other cities in the US and worldwide to divest and, more significantly, build momentum in the global shift required to reduce emissions and stave off the worst consequences of climate change.
“This is a really big deal,” said Jeffrey Sachs, an economist at New York’s Columbia University and special adviser to the UN secretary general. “Pension funds of other major US cities will follow, I think. New York is the neighborhood of the very big money managers. It’s a powerful, personal signal to them that they cannot keep funding the sorts of projects they have in the past.”
Divestment is the opposite of investment. It's the shifting of stocks, bonds or funds from certain businesses or sectors.
Individual people invest in various ways to generate money, but large institutions such as cities, universities and religious organizations do this on a huge scale. Traditionally, fund managers put together investment portfolios that will provide the best returns for these institutions, regardless of where the money is invested.
The divestment movement, primarily consisting of climate activists, is urging private and public institutions to rid their portfolios of all oil, gas and coal stocks to send a financial and ethical message that fossil fuels are harmful and shouldn't be tolerated. So far, it's estimated that funds totalling $6tn have committed to divesting from fossil fuels.
Activists hope this momentum will deprive fossil fuels of a social license, similar to tobacco, and help accelerate the deployment of cleaner energy, such as wind and solar.
New York will be the first of the US’s largest cities to divest and has jostled to the forefront of a group of global metropolises that have committed to ridding themselves of fossil fuel stocks, including Paris, Berlin, Sydney and Stockholm.
In November, the Norwegian central bank, which runs the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, proposed dumping shares in oil and gas companies. Dozens of other institutions, ranging from Oxford University to the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, have also joined a movement that activists say is worth $6tn in divestments or avoided investments.
“The divestment movement is active and growing and by its nature, New York will play a big leadership role,” said Sachs. “New York hosts Wall Street, the UN and the US media, it will now be the centre of climate action too. Even with Trump turning the keys over to the oil and gas industry, it’s clear that if you make egregious decisions you won’t get away with it.”
The divestment itself will be brushed off by major fossil fuel companies but could help galvanize political action even as the Trump administration peels away environmental regulations and throws open more US land and waters to drilling and mining.
“Divestment isn’t about economically punishing businesses, it’s a tool of collective action that can politically isolate companies,” said Paul Ferraro, an economist at John Hopkins University. 
“New York is fabulous in this respect because it’s so visible and it gives others room to create change. But it will only work if everyone follows, much like how everyone has to reduce their electricity use collectively for it to have a consequence for climate change.”
New York’s move on climate isn’t without its critics – environmentalists have complained about De Blasio’s opposition to congestion charging for vehicles and his own frequent car trips to the gym. 
Rightwing groups and business interests are also opposed. Linda Kelly, senior vice-president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said the plan was an “absurd attempt to politicize natural disasters, rather than a good-faith effort at securing meaningful change”.
The deep divisions over climate change in US politics, along with the continued strength of major fossil fuel companies, has tempered the enthusiasm even of those in favor of divestment and action to reduce emissions.
“The big oil and gas companies still have a long way to go and a lot of money to make,” said Ferraro. “When you look at the stock prices, it’s hard to believe that fossil fuels are facing imminent doom, as predicted by various environmentalists.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/11/new-york-city-fossil-fuel-divestment-spur-global-movement

Col McKenzie, the head of the Association of Marine Park Tourism Operators, a group that represents more than 100 businesses in the Great Barrier Reef, has written to the federal government asking it to stop funding the work of Professor Terry Hughes, claiming his comments were “misleading” and damaging the tourism industry.
But the Australian Conservation Foundation said tourism representatives and operators like McKenzie should stop blaming scientists for reporting what was happening to the reef and start targeting major polluters to ensure change.
Hughes, who serves as the director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, and is considered one of the world’s leading experts on the reef, has been warning of the damage rising water temperatures have been inflicting on the reef for years.
People won’t do long-haul trips when they think the reef is dead
While not disagreeing there was work to be done on the reef’s health, McKenzie accused Hughes of exaggerating the damage, which he said has been detrimental to the region’s multibillion-dollar tourism industry.
“I think Terry Hughes is a dick,” he told Guardian Australia. “I believe he has done tens of millions of dollars of damage to our reef in our key markets, being America and Europe. You went to those areas in 2017 and they were convinced the reef was dead. And people won’t do long-haul trips when they think the reef is dead.”
McKenzie said in 2016, tourism growth in the region had returned to pre-global financial crisis levels, before “that growth died” in 2017, which he blamed on Hughes “negative comments”.
In April 2016 Hughes made international headlines after releasing his final report on extensive aerial and underwater surveys, which showed that of the surveyed reefs (911 individual reefs), only 7% had escaped coral bleaching.
McKenzie said that gave the impression the reef was “dead”. “All driven off the back of the negative comments made by a researcher paid entirely by commonwealth funds. I think it is a misuse of commonwealth funds to make false or misleading comments to the media.”
He has previously written to ministers Christopher Pyne and Greg Hunt over the issue and said he had spoken to Josh Frydenberg “informally”.
A spokeswoman for the Australian Research Council said the council had provided $28m over the past seven years to James Cook University to fund the Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, with the funding going to the centre as a whole, not an individual.
 “All projects funded through the ARC are subject to rigorous assessment and only the highest-quality applications are funded,” she said in a statement. 
“The ARC monitors all projects that it funds for the achievement of their goals. All projects funded through the ARC are expected to be undertaken in accordance with the Australian code for the responsible conduct of research, which applies to the quality and integrity of the research.”
Hughes did not respond to McKenzie’s comments directly, but included his most recent peer-reviewed articles in Science and Nature, which deal with the increased incidence of coral bleaching as a result of rising sea temperatures.
His Science paper, published on 5 January, found that coral bleaching events were now happening too regularly to allow the reef to adequately recover.
“We analysed bleaching records at 100 globally distributed reef locations from 1980 to 2016,” the paper reported. “The median return time between pairs of severe bleaching events has diminished steadily since 1980 and is now only six years.”
The CEO of the Australian Conservation Foundation, Kelly O’Shanassy, said too much was at stake for tourism operators to blame scientists for what was actually happening to the reef and the real problem, climate change, had to be addressed.
 “Blaming scientists and attempting to get their funding cut is the worst possible response to this crisis,” she said. “Scientists are not to blame. Big polluters and their political allies are to blame. We need high-quality science more than ever so we can monitor and track what’s happening to the reef.”
Darrell Wade, the executive chair of Intrepid Travel, also disputed the idea that talking about environmental problems kept tourists away.
“The idea that conservation and tourism could be at odds on this issue is crazy,” Wade said. “It’s been implied that talking about the issues will have a negative impact on business – but we’ve actually found that the opposite is true.”
The latest health report from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Authority found outbreaks of crown-of-thorn starfish across the reef.
It noted the world heritage site has experienced “multiple significant impacts” over the past two years, including “severe coral bleaching, outbreaks of coral disease and crown-of-thorns starfish, and a severe tropical cyclone and subsequent flood plumes”.
“The significant heat stress experienced during summer 2016-17 – along with a warmer than average winter and spring in 2017 – means corals faced continued stress and will potentially be more susceptible to bleaching and disease in early 2018,” it reported.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/13/great-barrier-reef-tourism-spokesman-attacks-scientist-over-slump-in-visitors

The huge 1.8m sq km reserve – five times the size of Germany – would ban all fishing in a vast area of the Weddell Sea and around the Antarctic Peninsula, safeguarding species including penguins, killer whales, leopard seals and blue whales.
The idea was originally put forward by the EU and is being backed by a new Greenpeace campaign to be launched on Monday. The proposal already has the support of several countries – including the UK – and will go before a conference of the Antarctic nations in October.
Will McCallum, of Greenpeace’s new Protect the Antarctic campaign, said: “The next few years are absolutely essential for the future of our oceans and we are in desperate need for governments to come together and do what is best for these amazing ecosystems.”
He said a decision in 2016 to create a smaller sanctuary around the Ross Sea in the Antarctic proved global cooperation to protect the oceans is possible. 
“Now we want to go one better and create the world’s largest protected area. We want to create that momentum that says this is not just possible, it is inevitable if we are to protect the wildlife that call the ocean home and crucially help mitigate the worst effects of climate change.”
The sanctuary would stop industrial-scale krill fishing in the area, which scientists say is decimating key food that many larger animals – from penguins to whales – rely on.
Norway, China, South Korea and Russia are big players in the krill fishing industry and campaigners say the success of the proposal will depend on persuading those countries to back it.
McCallum said: “World leaders shouldn’t allow an ocean wilderness to be exploited by a handful of companies. In the 1980s it took a global movement to protect the Antarctic’s land. Now we need to protect its oceans.”
Greenpeace are setting off on a three-month expedition of the Antarctic this week and say a quarter of a million people around the world are already signed up to support the idea. 
24 national governments and the EU are members of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources [CCAMLR], which is responsible for the conservation of Antarctic waters. It will decide on the new sanctuary proposal at a conference in Australia in October.
Julian Gutt from the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research in Germany, which put forward the original proposal, said it would be an important moment in the fight to create a sustainable global ocean system.
“This will bring huge benefits in protecting this amazing ecosystem, in preserving the biodiversity and ecosystem functions of the ocean and in the wider fight against climate change.”
The seas around Antarctica are some of the most important in the world with a huge diversity of species. If successful, campaigners hope the sanctuary will build momentum towards a UN ambition to create a network of marine protected areas covering international waters.
Experts say that, as well as protecting wildlife by allowing ecosystems to recover in and around the Antarctic, the ocean sanctuary would provide global benefits, with recovering fish populations spreading around the world, encouraging vital biodiversity and providing food security for billions of people.
Callum Roberts, professor of marine conservation at the University of York, said the sanctuary would also play a key role in tackling climate change – soaking up huge amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. 
“The Antarctic is very important in locking away carbon in deep-sea sediments. There is also a very rapid rate of sinking there – it has some of the coldest waters in the world … and this sinking is one of the great pumps of the global ocean system.”
He added that the new sanctuary would be an important step to preserving a sustainable global oceans system.
“The Antarctic is a massively important area and you mess with it at your peril.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/13/worlds-biggest-wildlife-reserve-planned-for-antarctica-in-global-campaign

Autonomous or not... electric cars will provide a huge battery capacity available to stabilize the grid.

They won't be providing grid storage whilst they are moving.
Perhaps you are unfamiliar with the possibility that autonomous vehicles will enormously reduce ownership so cars won't spend 96% of their time parked, expensively, but will spend 90+% of their time providing transport services (and the rest charging). As a result there would be up to 90% fewer of them at any one time.
Should that come to pass, then the potential for grid storage from EVs is hugely reduced. I know Av is a tiresome confusionist, but he is right about that caveat.

Anymore and we’ll blow transformers left and right -- leaving us all in the dark.
BQENDQuick check. During the evening peak most households are pulling a kW+ (on average). At night we use very little (on average), perhaps 100-300W's.
Average driving in the UK is 8,000 miles pa, that's approx 22miles per day or around 5.5kWh.
Spread over 10hrs that's 550W's, so nightime demand with EV's would still be less than the grid 'happily' copes with during the evening peak. Nothing will 'blow'.

BEV's will actually reduce the peak demand by supplying leccy during the peak.

The investment figure is sharply higher than a previously announced target of $4.5bn by 2020, Ford executives said, and includes the costs of developing dedicated electric vehicle architectures. 
Ford’s engineering, research and development expenses for 2016, the last full year available, were $7.3bn, up from $6.7bn in 2015. 
Ford chief Jim Hackett told investors in October the carmaker would slash $14bn in costs over the next five years and shift capital investment away from sedans and internal combustion engines to develop more trucks and electric and hybrid cars. 
Of the 40 electrified vehicles Ford plans for its global line-up by 2022, 16 will be fully electric and the rest will be plug-in hybrids, executives said. 
General Motors Co, Toyota Motor Corp and Volkswagen AG have already outlined aggressive plans to expand their electric vehicle offerings and target consumers who want luxury, performance and an SUV body style – or all three attributes in the same vehicle.
Mainstream carmakers are reacting in part to pressure from regulators in China, Europe and California to slash carbon emissions from fossil fuels. They also are under pressure from Tesla Inc’s success in creating electric sedans and SUVs that inspire would-be owners to line up outside showrooms and flood the company with orders.
GM said last year it would add 20 new battery electric and fuel cell vehicles to its global line-up by 2023, financed by robust profits from traditional internal combustion engine vehicles in the US and China. 
GM’s chief, Mary Barra, has promised investors the Detroit automaker will make money selling electric cars by 2021. 
Volkswagen said in November it would spend $40bn on electric cars, autonomous driving and new mobility services by the end of 2022.
Toyota is racing to commercialize a breakthrough battery technology during the first half of the 2020s with the potential to cut the cost of making electric cars. 
Ford’s additional investments in electric vehicles contrasted with many of the vehicle launches at the Detroit show, which featured trucks and SUVs. 
Daimler AG unveiled its new G-class SUV, a bulky off-roader.
The Daimler CEO, Dieter Zetsche, hinted to Former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger during an exchange on stage next to the G-class that Daimler would some day have an electric version of the vehicle. 
SUVs figured in Ford’s electric vehicle presentation. The automaker’s president of global markets, Jim Farley, said Ford would bring a high-performance electric utility vehicle to market by 2020. 
Ford’s shift to the electric vehicle strategy has been more than six months in the making after Hackett replaced former CEO Mark Fields in May. 
The plan was finalized in recent months after an extensive review, a person familiar with the process said. In October, Ford disclosed it had formed a team to accelerate global development of electric vehicles, whose mission is to “think big” and “make quicker decisions”.
Some of the electric vehicles will be produced with Ford’s JV in China aimed at the Chinese market. 
China, India, France and the UK have all announced plans to phase out vehicles powered by combustion engines and fossil fuels between 2030 and 2040.

Historic Environment Scotland (HES), the agency which oversees nearly 340 of the country’s most important castles, abbeys, Neolithic sites and ruins, has for the first time issued red warnings for nearly a fifth of its sites and put amber, high risk warnings against another 70%.
Of those, 28 sites are identified as at the greatest risk because they are not yet properly protected. Those include Fort George , a vast fortress built near Inverness after the battle of Culloden, 800-year-old Inchcolm abbey and Inchcolm island on the Firth of Forth, and the Brough of Birsay, a Pictish and Viking-settled island in Orkney’s world heritage site, threatened by sea level rises and storms.
The agency says those 28 places, already made fragile by their age and weathering, are at an “unacceptable level of risk exposure that requires immediate mitigating action”.
Among the 70% of its sites given an amber warning is Holyrood Park in Edinburgh which includes Arthur’s Seat and Salisbury Crags, and borders the Queen’s official home in Scotland, Holyrood Palace, as well as the Scottish parliament.
 The park is at very high risk of being damaged by landslides and flooding, which justify red warnings in four categories, but those threats are reduced because the park is maintained by HES’s ranger service, so under the new risk register published on Monday it gets an amber .
Edinburgh Castle has red warnings for the risk of landslide and groundwater flooding, but as it too is under constant supervision by HES, it also gets an amber rating .
Three other world famous sites, Glasgow cathedral, the Neolithic village of Skara Brae and the Maeshowe chambered cairn on Orkney, and the Viking village of Jarlshof on the southern most tip of mainland Shetland, are also given red risk ratings. 
They too are under constant supervision, lowering the threat level to amber, but HES officials warn that even so, protected sites could still be damaged by the far more severe weather events now being forecast.
The study, the first of its kind, has combined climatic data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, geological information from the British Geological Survey, and the agency’s own site surveys to draw up a detailed assessment of every site. 
Combined into a single database, the surveys have confirmed evidence from numerous places that already fragile or exposed historic sites are at even greater risk from heavier flooding, coastal erosion driven by stronger storms and rising sea levels, increased winter rainfall or much drier summers. Its publication will increase pressure on other conservation bodies such as the National Trust of Scotland, which owns numerous sites at risk of extreme climate events, to step up their research. 
The database will be constantly updated and refined, said Ewan Hyslop, the agency’s head of technical research and science, particularly after far more detailed and updated UK-wide projections of climate risks are published in several months.
HES has increased the priority it gives to climate mitigation under legislation driven through by Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, which requires public bodies to factor climate change into their activities. But even so, HES faces an 8% cut in its grant under the Scottish government’s draft budget. The budget of Sepa, the Scottish agency responsible for monitoring climate change, will also be cut again.
The research draws on forecasts from Sepa that sea levels around Scotland will increase by between 16.5 and 28 centimetres by 2050, threatening coastal sites such as Skara Brae.
Average temperatures will rise by 2.8C in summer and 2.2C in winter, while average rainfall will jump by 16% in winter and fall by 13% in summer, increasing the risks of grassland and forest fires at historic sites. 
The report notes: “Water is the most destructive agent of decay. On a large scale, heavy and intense rainfall can directly lead to flooding in a short timeframe, which has the potential to cause catastrophic damage to all elements of the historic environment within reach of these potential flood zones.” ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/15/scotlands-historic-sites-at-high-risk-from-climate-change-report-says

This is an interesting assertion. Sure - science agree that higher pCO2 cause more photosynthesis - within limits. 
But are you sure ""crop yields"" are driven by CO2 - or do you think that it can also have to do with some pretty amazing clearance of rain-forests for crops as well? Do you think that a limiting factor being addressed is better chemicals in form of nutrients? (that has a bit of a down-side for the ocean, for example). Do you think a bit of the extra crops have something to use with the escalations of use of pesticides?

Sea level is after all something that gives decades and centuries of forewarning (in addition to a civilization-long tail behind it). 
I mean - the goal is to reach peak global population before we reach 100 cm of sea-level with good management - in other words in this century. And then from year 2100 see that both population and atmospheric CO2 start to drop from there on. 
These two goals are not science fiction - but are utterly within reach - with will (I think we will see peak global population before we see atmospheric peak GHG-forcing in fact)
But in this study - I was surprised of how responsive it it. And how important the Paris Agreement is. 
For those that believe ""the stable genius"" - the money involved in Paris - it is not about shipping around buckets of cash. The money is linked to ""cost"" of technology transfer - cost of giving cheap loans - cost of making nations in huge stress with little economical prowess to make themselves more resilient without needing to burn coal for 200 years like we did to emerge at a technological level where we could start to invent better ways to provide energy. 
I think a lot of people (like Donald) got confused with the money involved. 
Fun fact - dropping dollars (literately) over Africa does not really stop AGW - it has no cooling effect. To provide cheap loans - so that emerging nations can go straight to renewables does not have a cooling effect either - but it pull the planet from ""bushiness as usual"" - where every nation in the world must do as we in the west did from 1700 AD. 
The Paris Agreement is thus ""trickle down"" economics/technology for real - and sometimes I wonder if that is why the right-wing ideology get's so upset.

Temperature anomaly is only a measure. If you think about it - at only a few decimals of a degree body-temperature - you feel outside of your comfort-zone. This is how fine-tuned the ecosystem of your body is. 
A lot of these annual changes are rather well mapped. Google El Nino/La Nina patterns and you will get a wealth of information to these modes and what to expect. 
Sadly - this information is poorly used. We humans know where about there will be heat-stress/lack of water/crop failure during an El Nino. Still - the UN food programme and other huge organisations do not get donations until the images of already starving children are showed on TV-news a year later after the warning call went out.
This is the sadness of human understanding the basic operation of the physical system ALSO fail at the human level (for episodes that are not associated to someone ""believing"" (sic) AGW). 
Deeper down - in the physics of the planet - I in Norway grew up with an annual temperature anomaly that stretched from -40 C in winter to +30 degrees in winter. This is a 70 Cellist wing-span every year. If you look at monthly mean temperatures - the span is ca 25 degrees every year. 
Now - when I worked in Brazil (Fortaleza) offshore - their warmest month is December (29 degrees) and their coldest month is usually April (around 27 degrees) - a span of 2 (two) degrees as monthly mean. 
Now - this needs a bit of thinking. In the higher latitudes, the mean change is bigger (Arctic Amplification) - but in lower latitudes - 2 degrees change can be bigger than the total seasonal range. And this messes with people's heads and understanding of ""one degree"". (Last night wind changed from west to south where I am while speeding up - and I obviously saw a 10 degree increase in temperature from 6 pm to midnight.

There has been some research connecting this refugee problem with changes to the climate. In particular, the years preceding the Syrian refugee crisis were characterized by a severe drought that reduced farm output and led to economic and social strife there.
Separating out the influences of climate change from general social instability may be impossible, because they are intimately linked. But we do know that climate change can cause social and economic instability. We also know that these instabilities can boil over into larger problems that lead to mass exodus. The problem isn’t knowing the connection between climate and refugees exists – rather the problem is quantifying it.
All of this is important because we want to be able to plan for the “now” as well as the “tomorrow.” If we are already seeing climate-related migrations, can you imagine what’s in store in the next few decades as temperatures and extreme weather continue to increase?
A very recent publication appearing in the journal Science investigates this complex subject. The paper, Asylum Applications Respond to Temperature Fluctuations, was published by Anouch Missirian and Wolfram Schlenker from Columbia University. It focused not just on Syria and the Mediterranean area, but expanded their study to be worldwide.
The researchers identified 103 countries that contributed to asylum applications to the European Union. Collectively, these nations submitted 350,000 applications to the EU per year. The authors combed the weather histories from these 103 source sites and explored how the weather varied in the 2000–2014 time period. 
They found that when temperatures in agricultural areas and seasons at the source countries varied away from an optimal value (of about 20°C), the number of people seeking asylum increased. And the increase wasn’t just proportional. They found it was nonlinear, meaning that initial increases in temperature only mildly changed the asylum application numbers. But as temperatures varied more and more, the number of seekers increased more quickly. 
After making this connection to observations, the authors then projected into the future. Using a collection of climate models that are able to predict Earth’s future climate, the authors estimated that on a business-as-usual emissions pathway (where countries don’t meaningfully reduce greenhouse gas emissions), asylum applications will increase by almost 200% by the end of the century. On the other hand, under a modest warming scenario, where humans take some meaningful action to reduce emissions, the increase falls to about 30%. Again, this shows that what humans do today to combat climate change really matters.
What was also interesting is that temperature is a better metric for this problem than precipitation. I wouldn’t have guessed that initially; my naïve expectation would be that precipitation changes would also be very good at allowing prediction of asylum seekers. But it turns out temperature is much better. The discussion by the authors also demonstrated how many moving parts there are to this problem. Not only are the economic, climate, and social situations in the source country important, but those factors in the destination country are also critical. People migrate to where they expect better conditions.
I spoke with the authors who told me this about their choice of using temperature as the metric for asylum applications:
There is an emerging literature linking various sectoral outcomes in a country to weather shocks (conflict, agricultural yields, energy demand, mortality, labor productivity, labor supply, etc.). Using temperature shocks is ideal from a statistical perspective; our statistical model is not new, but well established. 
With much study on the topic in recent years, I wanted to know what contribution this new paper had made (that wasn’t known already). They said this:
The significance of our paper is that we are not looking at impacts in particular countries, but spillovers in the form of asylum applications. Most economic damage assessments examine the direct impact on a country, but countries are interlinked. So even if most of the economic damages occur in developing countries, there might be repercussions for developed countries. 
There is an existing literature on migration and refugees, but previous studies usually focus on one country at the time. We use data from all over the world (103 source countries that list asylum applications to the EU in every year 2000–2014) to systematically examine the relationship. We picked the European Union as destination country since it receives almost half of the asylum applications. 
Readers of this column know that I study climate change – both the rate and the future projections of what will happen. But readers also know I am very interested in the studies on impacts. We’ve solved the question about how much warming is happening and who is to blame. Now, the scientific community is turning its attention to the “so what?” questions. Questions about how climate change impacts us and what can be done to stop or prepare for the changes. This paper takes us another step toward answering those questions.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jan/15/study-finds-that-global-warming-exacerbates-refugee-crises

Maybe you should have read it. As I stated (correctly), this prediction did not happen, it's wrong, and depending on what data set you use it's spectacularly wrong. 
BQEND
Now, let's put back the parts you left out:
BQSTART
under the IPCC Business-as-Usual (Scenario A) emissions of greenhouse gases, a rate of increase of global mean temperature during the next century of about 0 3°C per decade (with an uncertainty range of 0 2°C to 0 5°C per decade)
BQEND
You clearly saw that uncertainty range but took care to omit it.
You also deleted the reference to business-as-usual emissions. Actual emissions since 1990 have been less this. BAU emissions from 1990 would have resulted in atmospheric CO2 of 418 ppm by 2016, but the actual level in 2016 was 404 ppm. The BAU scenario also assumed greater rises in atmospheric halocarbons than have actually occurred. 
In fact, the actual GHG emissions since 1990 have been closest to the IPCC's scenario B. The projected temperature rise for scenario B was 0.2C per decade.
Here are the warming trends from 1990 to the present (°C per decade):

Currently we are awaiting the results for 2017 from NASA, NOAA and the Met Office for 2017 final figures but the expectation is that it will be the second hottest year on record. And that's without an El Nino.

incorrect.predictions by scientists are unfortunately being confirmed, and have been being confirmed over the last entury.
For example, it was predicted that:- warming would occur as CO2e increased (observed)- diurnal warming would occur (observed)- Arctic warming would be greater (observed)- glaciers and ice sheets would retreat (observed)etc.

My context is reality,
BQEND
incorrect.You provide no context.Stating crop yields have increased has no context.
For example, last night at my council's monthly meeting my council's clerk stated that there was a planning application that had been received but it was not on the agenda. Factually correct, in reality. Context zero.
She provided the context. The planning application had come in too late to be considered at that meeting. The close date for comments was before the next council meeting next month. The planning application was on the boundary of our patch. This raised the flag that our council needs a policy to address the issue of compressed planning timescales slipping in between our meetings (which have to be held in public, advertised in advance). Therefore in this context, the clerk is now bringing forward a policy to deal with this.
That is context.
Similarly, in a previous role, I could confidently state to the Managing Director/CEO our division had booked £6M of sales.
I could confidently expect the Managing Director/CEO to haul me over the coals for that, as I would have failed to:- compare the sales achieved to formal budget/target- compare the sales achieved to the preceding month's forecast- detail which key sales had been achieved- which key sales had not been achieved and had variously- slipped dates- been lost- why- and then which sales had been brought forward- analyse the why's and wherefore's of those key sales- and what the bid and sales managers were doing to rectify the situation(s).
So stating crop yield has increased is simply an out of context piece of data, and as per the DIKW hierarchy adds nothing to our understanding of the actual situation of reality as it has no context.

Will money have value once the realization hits society that consumption causes C02 increase?
BQEND
Why wouldn't it? It's just a convenient medium for exchange. Replace 4% GDP growth with a steady-state sustainable economy, and you still need exchange (lots of it). Money won't go away.And the idea that we cannot exist without 4% growth is nonsense. Infinite growth on a finite planet is clearly impossible. It has to stop at some point. We should do that sooner rather than later, which involves measuring and valuing ecosystem services and human wellbeing as well as labour and capital. Those missing factors represent the fundamental failure of our current system, to actually provide what we want. 'more stuff' stopped improving wellbeing in the developed world a long time ago.
Read Tim Jackson's 'Prosperity without Growth' for a very helpful explanation of the problem and the economics surrounding it.

Even insects suffered a mass extinction – the only time before or since. Entire classes of animals – like trilobites – went out like a match in the wind. 
 But what’s arguably most fascinating about this event – known as the Permian-Triassic extinction or more poetically, the Great Dying – is the fact that anything survived at all. Life, it seems, is so ridiculously adaptable that not only did thousands of species make it through whatever killed off nearly everything (no one knows for certain though theories abound) but, somehow, after millions of years life even recovered and went on to write new tales. 
Even as the Permian-Triassic extinction event shows the fragility of life, it also proves its resilience in the long-term. The lessons of such mass extinctions – five to date and arguably a sixth happening as I write – inform science today. Given that extinction levels are currently 1,000 (some even say 10,000) times the background rate, researchers have long worried about our current destruction of biodiversity – and what that may mean for our future Earth and ourselves.  
In 2009, a group of researchers identified nine global boundaries for the planet that if passed could theoretically push the Earth into an uninhabitable state for our species. These global boundaries include climate change, freshwater use, ocean acidification and, yes, biodiversity loss (among others). The group has since updated the terminology surrounding biodiversity, now calling it “biosphere integrity,” but that hasn’t spared it from critique.  
A paper last year in Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution scathingly attacked the idea of any global biodiversity boundary. 
“It makes no sense that there exists a tipping point of biodiversity loss beyond which the Earth will collapse,” said co-author and ecologist, José Montoya, with Paul Sabatier Univeristy in France. “There is no rationale for this.” 
Montoya wrote the paper along with Ian Donohue, an ecologist at Trinity College in Ireland and Stuart Pimm, one of the world’s leading experts on extinctions, with Duke University in the US. 
Montoya, Donohue and Pimm argue that there isn’t evidence of a point at which loss of species leads to ecosystem collapse, globally or even locally. If the planet didn’t collapse after the Permian-Triassic extinction event, it won’t collapse now – though our descendants may well curse us for the damage we’ve done. 
Instead, according to the researchers, every loss of species counts. But the damage is gradual and incremental, not a sudden plunge. Ecosystems, according to them, slowly degrade but never fail outright. 
“Of more than 600 experiments of biodiversity effects on various functions, none showed a collapse,” Montoya said. “In general, the loss of species has a detrimental effect on ecosystem functions...We progressively lose pollination services, water quality, plant biomass, and many other important functions as we lose species. But we never observe a critical level of biodiversity over which functions collapse.” 
This doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be deeply concerned about biodiversity, according to the researchers. Instead, we should worry about every species lost and not focus on a theoretical line in the sand. 
“It is in fact the planetary boundary argument that implies that there is a lot of biodiversity that has no value. There is no problem with losing a small number of species, the argument goes,” Montoya said. “We argue that even small losses of biodiversity have important consequences for ecosystem function and service provisioning.” 
In other words, extinction of species may not result in a total collapse of our ecosystems – but the more we lose, the less productive, efficient, and healthy our environment will be. And the more at risk we put ourselves. 
 But, the Stockholm Resilience Centre recently published a long response to Montoya’s paper in the usual way of scientific sparring – publications going back and forth like boxers exchanging blows. 
 Johan Rockström the executive director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre and one of the leading researchers on planetary boundaries, said that Montoya’s critique didn’t stand up to scrutiny because its authors misunderstood the definitions built around the “biosphere integrity planetary boundary.” 
Rockström agrees that there is no evidence of a planetary tipping point when it comes to biodiversity. According to Rockström, biodiversity decline does not have a hard planetary boundary like, say, climate change. Instead he describes biodiversity as a variable that operates “under the hood of the planetary system” because it influences the stability of our climate, ozone layer and oceans – all of which Rockström contends have very clear planetary boundaries. 
“We have never suggested a planetary scale biodiversity tipping point...” Rockström said. “Instead, the rational for biodiversity as a planetary boundary is that the composition of trees, plants, microbes in soils, phytoplankton in oceans, top predators in ecosystems…together constitute a fundamental core contributor to regulating the state of the planet.” 
According to Rockström, biodiversity is one of the pillars supporting our planet – and if too much biodiversity is lost we risk “triggering a tipping point” in our climate or oceans, which in turn could risk pushing the planet into a new state.
“Without biodiversity, no ecosystems. No ecosystems, no biomes. No biomes, no living regulator of all the cycles of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide and water,” he added.  
Rockström says biodiversity loss could risk the “safe operating space” for humans, leaving us in an alien world increasingly hostile to our own survival. For example, life would still survive under apocalyptic climate change – but we may not. 
While ecosystems may not fully collapse, scientists have found that some ecosystems can undergo what they are called “regime shifts.” Coral reefs, overheated by climate change, will shift to a much less productive, much less biodiverse algae-based ecosystem. Climate change, or alternatively humans with chainsaws and fire, can shift forest ecosystems to grasslands. While none of these ecosystems may wholly collapse, they will look nothing like they did after the shift occurs. 
Montoya admits that such regime shifts “do actually happen” and is “well established” for some ecosystems – like forests, coral reefs and Arctic sea ice – though “unclear” if it happens in all ecosystems or only a few.  
And he adds, perhaps most importantly, that “the mechanisms [of regime shifts] have nothing to do with biodiversity loss.” Instead, they have been driven by climate change or human actions – such as clear-cutting. 
 It may be that unclear or shifting definitions are at the root of the dispute.  
“Fatally, the boundaries framework lacks clear definitions, or it has too many conflicting definitions, does not specify units, and fails to define terms operationally, thus prohibiting application by those who set policy,” Montoya, Donohut and Pimm write in the paper.
 But Rockström contends that when understood correctly the planetary boundary framework holds up to scientific scrutiny. He says planetary boundaries do not mean that humanity can just destroy and upend all the way up to a red line without consequences. 
 “This is of course just nonsense,” he noted, arguing that the planetary boundary for biosphere integrity is magnitudes more ambitious than the Aichi Targets from the Convention on Biological Diversity, an international agreement set on preserving biodiversity – though already several goals have not been met.
 “If the world is able to reduce biodiversity loss below the planetary boundary this would not only require major conservation efforts across the world,” he said, adding that “once inside the safe operating space, we would of course have to continue on a sustainable pathway.”
Rockström said that he believes the disputing researchers have much more in common than their infighting would imply.  
“We are [all] working to safeguard biodiversity for sustainable development. We are [all] in the same camp. Complementing each other, they at the ecosystem level, us at the planetary level.” 
But Montoya and his group stand by their criticism and are working on a second paper responding to Rockström and his team.  
While Montoya’s paper does not critique the other eight planetary boundaries in their paper, Montoya told me that each of the boundaries – even the physical ones – have faced “a lot of controversy.” 
“They all suffer from the tipping-point problem,” he said, “which we argue promotes a business-as-usual ethos and distracts us from taking the action that is urgently needed.”
 In many ways one could argue that the planetary boundary is an easy and simple way to explain environmental impacts to world leaders – few of whom have any education on ecology or the environment – and the public. 
 But Montoya argues that the planetary boundaries concept is doing more harm than good.  
“Poor or ill-founded science ultimately brings about ineffectual policies at best – and potentially highly damaging ones – and erodes trust in scientists,” he said.  And this can have real world impacts: Montoya and colleagues point to forest policy in Europe as one example. 
“The assumption that there is a critical biodiversity level below which forest functioning will collapse prompted managers [to] plant resilient tree species to climate change, pests, and disease,” Montoya explained, adding, “this was recommended to avoid reaching a tipping point in forest service provisioning, primarily timber production.” But the recommendations have resulted in endangered old growth forests and native species, according to Montoya. 
While the on-going debate over planetary boundaries is deeply academic and wonky, it is not without importance to the public. How we communicate environmental crises – and the accuracy of the science that underpins that communication – proves more important with every passing year, as the world walks into climate and ecological uncertainty.  
Yes, life itself survived the Permian-Triassic mass extinction event – but most species did not. Believe me, humans probably wouldn’t have survived the tens-of-millions of years that followed the Great Dying: oxygen levels were dangerously low, food would have been scarce, and the world would have looked largely barren and wasted even as some species and ecosystems managed to survive. Outside the moral dilemma of extinction, there is no question that if humans push more-and-more species into oblivion there will be impacts on our society – and they could become catastrophic. 
 Humans evolved 248 million years later in an Earth that was far more biodiverse and rich, a kind of Eden of abundance and diversity. But our current actions risk all that – and perhaps ourselves.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2018/jan/16/biodiversity-extinction-tipping-point-planetary-boundary

While said daughter is left handed, as Minister for Climate Change she instigated programs that reduced CO2 emissions, put in place legislation that reduced agricultural runoff onto the Great Barrier Reef and oversaw the strictest vegetation clearing legislation this state has seen and ran a state Office of Climate Change. In 2012 she lost her seat to Campbell Newman who had been paid a backbencher's wage to run against her by the Liberal National Party. Campbell's first action on becoming premier was to abolish the Office of Climate Change. My friend who is a climate change mitigation economist lost his job. In 2015 she won her seat back defeating the sitting Premier.
Labor was able to form a minority Government with cross bench support and instigated a number of large scale renewable energy projects across the state. My economist friend got his job back. Last November Labor won majority Government guaranteeing a return to strict tree clearing legislation 2018.

Optimum means the best or most favorable point. Points above and below that point are supra-optimal and sub-optimal respectively.
https://www.wordnik.com/words/supra-optimaluse this text example to illustrate the meaning of the word sub-optimal
""Disease in plants is likely to increase in those parts of species distribution ranges where a mismatch between the rate of relocation of the species and northward/upward shift of climatic zones results in populations remaining in supra-optimal temperature conditions.""
For many factors, such as climate temperature or calorie intake in humans, the concept of an optimal level makes sense. Global warming is a terrible idea at the rate we have seen it since the 19th century. What is very amusing is that you don't understand that an optimum temperature can mean that temperatures both above and below that optimal level create problems, in the same way as a sub-optimal calorie intake can result in unhealthy weight loss and death as occurred in the potato famine while supra-optimal calorie intake can result in obesity and a consequent fear of ramps.  I may have been better for the starving Irish to migrate to where it was warm in the mid 19th century - at least there was food there, even if there was also skin cancers for Irish skins - but 170 years later the globe has warmed and it's no longer a smart idea. But Ireland has not escaped unscathed from the effects of that global warming. While the denizens of Galway got excited by a 10 degree spring day the other year, the last time I was in the Emerald Isle, in early spring, the flattening of the northern high latitude temperature gradient by global warming has produced an Arctic blast with snow in the country where my protestant and my partners catholic ancestors had starved together and a blizzard that blew in killing the gamboling spring lambs, hours after we flew out of Belfast.
""Rofl"" is, I understand, an acronym for ""rolling on floor laughing"".

For each kilometre Qantas transports a passenger across the Pacific, it uses 64% more fuel than the two most fuel-efficient airlines operating across the Pacific: Hainan Airlines and All Nippon Airways (ANA).
One litre of aviation fuel was able to transport one passenger just 22km, on average, on Qantas flights, while Hainan and ANA were able to take a passenger 36km on 1L of fuel.
The wide variation between airlines provides a stark contrast to the industry’s aspirational goal of improving fuel efficiency of international flights by just 2% annually. 
Aviation currently accounts for about 2.5% of global carbon dioxide emissions. But pollution from the industry is expected to increase and, by 2050, use up a quarter of the allowable greenhouse gas emissions if the world is to keep global warming at less than 1.5C – the world’s “carbon budget”.
While Hainan and ANA tied as the most fuel-efficient airlines, they used different strategies to achieve the relatively low fuel burn.
Hainan Airways, a Chinese carrier, employed more fuel-efficient aircraft, using the Boeing 787 Dreamliner for more than 80% of its flights, and the Airbus A330 for the remainder. It also avoided having excessive empty seats, further increasing its efficiency.
Meanwhile, the Japanese airline ANA achieved the low fuel-burn by carrying a lot of cargo, which the analysis treated as equivalent to carrying people.
In contrast, Qantas used the two most fuel-intensive aircraft – Airbus A380 and Boeing 747-400ER – and carried the most empty seats of any transpacific airline, filling just 74% of its seats.
Comparing all the airlines, ICCT found that how much freight an airline carried was the strongest determinant of its fuel efficiency, explaining 48% of the variation between airlines. Seating density, aircraft efficiency and passenger load were the other major factors.
Looking at specific routes, the analysis found Delta was the most fuel-efficient airline on the Sydney-Los Angeles route, flying a passenger 33km on a litre of fuel. Virgin Australia and United were not far behind on 32km, while Qantas lagged on just 24km.
The most competitive transpacific route was Los Angeles-Tokyo, with six airlines flying between the two hubs. On that route United was the most fuel-efficient, taking a passenger 42km on a litre of fuel. Singapore Airlines was the least fuel-efficient, taking a passenger just 26km on a litre of fuel.
The report notes that Qantas is planning on using eight new Dreamliners for flights to the US, which, if operating now, would lift the airline one place from the bottom, above Korean Air and tying with Asiana in the second-bottom place.
The results follow an earlier analysis ICCT conducted on the efficiency of airlines on transatlantic routes in 2015, which found a significant but smaller variation between airlines than was found on Pacific routes.
In that report, British Airways and Lufthansa were found to have emitted 51% more carbon dioxide than the cleanest flyers, Norwegian Air.
“This research shows that there are a variety of ways that international airlines can reduce fuel use and carbon emissions,” said Brandon Graver from ICCT, the lead author of the study. “Buying new aircraft, carrying large numbers of passengers and optimising freight strategies all make a difference.”
Dan Rutherford, ICCT’s aviation program director and co-author of the paper, said: “There’s a reason airlines around the world are starting to avoid very large aircraft like the 747 and A380.
“Newer twin-engine widebodies provide the payload and range capabilities needed for transpacific flights with much lower fuel burn.”
Alan Milne, head of fuel and environment at Qantas told the Guardian that the airline ranks low in the analysis because it uses large aircraft, flies long distances and has premium cabins that leave more space between passengers.

Policies do not magic themselves out of thin air, civil servants will always be involved in the process of setting targets and legislation that accompanies it.
Similarly the CCC is made up of independent bodies from science, business and engineering. Their input as per the ATL article will not be run by ideology.
But, if you really think ministers are illiterate zealots, then you may have got it right, as the current illiterate zealous of a minister with the environment remit is Michael Gove. I guess you also object to his illiterate zealotry about reduction of plastic waste ?

However, I believe it was the case that Kings found that some 70% of the woodburning particles came from houses using open fires and that the woodburning stoves part of the story was to some extent a handy headline hook. I believe the report also said that a large part of the problem was what was actually being burnt on the fires and in the stoves - many people were using wood that was wet, had been painted or treated in other preservative ways, and that coal was still being used in many fires. I can see there is a problem here as many city-dwellers don't have places to store and dry wood in any quantity whilst suitably dried, to 20% moisture content, can be expensive to purchase in small quantities. Much easier to buy whatever is available from your local provider or gather it from skips and building sites and who has a moisture meter? I can see in the local ironmongers around me supplies of coal and kindling wood and the adverts for re-claimed wood so there is definitely a market. Household combustion is definitely a problem but jumping on the 'wood stoves are the problem' bandwagon is not the way to go. If wood-burning in cities was to return to the way things were in the early 1950s then this would really be a concern but I have my doubts that the problem is as serious as suggested when I look around my locality.I really would like to read the full study to find out more!

Emissions per capita are, according those alarmed about warming, irrelevant. What counts is the total tonnage.
Now if we look at who is emitting the tons, we find that China is emitting around 10 billion tons a year, which is about double that of the US, and about 20 times that of the UK. They have no, zero, qantitative targets to reduce this, under Paris. NONE.

2. University scientists, who do the bulk of research into climate change, are not paid via grants. They are paid for teaching work to undergraduates. Research grants fund research; equipment, materials etc. and maybe a poctdoc research assistant for a couple of years.

You can't do it with batteries, you can't do it with hydro. I have not seen any 100% renewables plans which actually add up for the UK. You can do something like 90% renewable 10% gas, but it's a lot more expensive than a nuclear+gas solution and has much higher emissions.
Any plan for the UK which will work and be reasonably affordable currently requires some nuclear as well as a lot more wind than solar.

Professor Russell Coope was the first to discover abrupt climate change events in the geological record of the 'ice age', while doing research for his Ph.D back in the 1950s.
Coope - who was my palaeontology lecturer long ago - made his discovery entirely by accident, while researching fossil beetle assemblages in 'ice age' sedimentary successions.
He ended up spending decades applying this technique to more and more examples of similar sedimentary successions.
The process works because a beetle wing-case is usually sufficient to identify a species, and the species have not changed much in a long time.
Any given collection of species taken together indicates a very precise temperature.
His discovery tells us that the Earth's climates are not fundamentally stable.
These rapid climate events were confirmed a few decades later by ice cores from the Greenland ice sheet..... the events he discovered had a number of natural causes.
Not long before he died in 2011, he said that people are messing with the trigger that causes climate change, and the consequences are likely to be 'ferocious'.
'Ferocious' is a difficult word to forget.

The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) said vague ambitions, such as banning new petrol and diesel cars by 2040, must be turned into solid plans and new policies, such as planting more trees, are needed.
The CCC also warned that there are “significant” risks to the delivery of existing projects, such as the new Hinkley Point nuclear plant. However, the CCC also praised Theresa May’s government for putting green growth at the centre of the nation’s economic strategy for the first time when it published its Clean Growth Strategy (CGS) in October.
“There has been a very fundamental change of stance,” said Lord Deben, chair of the CCC. “But that, of course, doesn’t mean there is not a very great deal more to do. There is a real pressure and urgency.” 
Deben said the CCC analysis released on Wednesday was the best-case scenario and had assumed ministers will deliver all the carbon cuts pledged so far. “We have given every benefit of the doubt,” he said. “But even if they do all the things they say they are going to do, to the maximum, there will still be a gap.”
The CCC’s independent assessment of the CGS analyses whether it puts the UK on course to meet its legally mandated carbon cuts in 2025 and 2030, and charts the most cost-effective path to an 80% reduction in emissions by 2050. The UK has already cut greenhouse gas emissions by 42% since 1990 and is close to phasing out coal, but it is not on track to meet the future targets, the CCC found.
The CCC highlighted a series of government pledges that have little or no detail on how they will be delivered, including giving all homes a good level of energy efficiency by 2035. Deben also attacked large housebuilding companies for not doing enough.
“If Persimmon had spent the £110m bonus it has given to its chief executive [Jeff Fairburn] on the 18,000 houses it has built this last year, it could have saved very significantly the energy bills of everybody who bought a house and contributed significantly to emissions reduction,” he said.
Also highlighted was the critical need to roll out carbon capture and storage plants (CCS) by the 2030s, to trap and bury emissions from fossil fuel plants. “We cannot underline more strongly that without CCS, meeting our statutory targets will cost a great deal more,” Deben said. “CCS is essential.” 
The UK’s North Sea is seen as a perfect place for CCS development but former chancellor George Osborne killed a £1bn programme in 2015. Since then only £100m has been pledged in its place, a sum “not commensurate with its importance” according to the CCC. 
But Deben also said oil and gas companies have not stepped up to develop CCS: “If you want to argue [against fossil fuel divestment campaigns], you have got to show you are taking really seriously the move away from fossil fuels. It is very dangerous for the industry not to take this very much more seriously.”
Gaps in government policies identified by the CCC include a clear plan to drive up sales of electric cars to the upper end of its goal of 40-70% of all cars by 2030 and to approach 100% by 2035. Another is the need to plant 70,000 hectares of trees by 2025 – it would take a century to achieve that at current rates.
The CCC also warned that relying on new nuclear plants for low-carbon electricity carried risks. “Nuclear has a history of not delivering on time or on budget,” said Deben. Any new nuclear plants after Hinkley “would have to come in at a much, much reduced cost”, given the very low cost offshore wind now offers, CCC officials said.
A spokeswoman for the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “The UK has reduced emissions per person faster than any other G7 nation and our CGS is the next ambitious milestone.

Incorrect.As commented before, only a drooling idiot would think the Chinese (or any other rational government) would wait until 29/12/2029 before starting to do something.
They cannot make a commitment to peak in 2030 without putting in place concrete steps to bring about the reduction in CO2e emissions.

BQEND
You cannot decrease total emissions without decreasing output per GDP or per capita.

decried the focus on terms such as ""per capita"" and ""per unit of GDP"".
BQEND
This is a common part of the deniers argument, a wilful ignorance of what these measures mean and why they are important in securing international agreements.

Here is an article in Nature from 2016.
There are other similar reports.

Incorrect.Firstly, I did not write it, I quoted from a different source.Secondly, the 2015 article in the Grauniad is now out of date.Thirdly, the latest Chinese 5 year plan puts them on track or ahead of the submission they put to the UN at the Paris conference.
So all in all, in response to the first idiot claiming China had a free pass, their claim was incorrect..
In response to your shifting of the goal posts, they are on track to peak carbon emissions before 2030, if it has not already happened before.
The fly in the ointment is the other GHGs they emit, but as their latest 5 year plan identifies they need to work on those too.

What do you quote the ""Chinese state media"" as saying ?
BQSTART
In order to fulfill its obligations under the Paris agreement Xinhua said China would need to cut carbon emissions by 60-65% per unit of GDP by 2030, compared with 2005 levels, and boost its use of non-fossil fuels so they accounted for 20% of its energy consumption.
BQEND
I asked you where the ""Chinese state media"", or anyone else, cited ""official"" pledges by China to reduce their TOTAL / ABSOLUTE emissions numbers.
Way back in 2015, the Guardian covered China's [I]NDC ""pledges"" in this article.
The very first paragraph is :
BQSTART
China will aim to cut its greenhouse gas emissions per unit of gross domestic product by 60-65% from 2005 levels under a plan submitted to the United Nations ahead of crucial climate change talks in Paris later this year.

That is what you wrote. China's position on that (per unit of GDP) point has not changed in 2.5 years ... but I was talking about ""total / absolute emissions"" instead !

Later in the article :
BQSTART
China has already set out a target of ensuring its still-growing emissions peak by 2030, a target experts say should be met. Which means the highest point will have been reached and emissions will begin to fall.

When fully up and running, which could be as soon as 2019, the initial power sector stage of the scheme will already be more than one and a half times bigger than the EU’s emissions trading scheme, currently the world’s largest.

But it does affect what you can do about it. If the source of the warming is humans burning fossil fuels, humans can do something about that.
Agriculture needs soil and soils quite literally don't develop overnight. Soil horizons in sedimentary rocks such as can be seen in the Tamala aeolian calcarenite of the Western Australian coast from Shark Bay to Albany are the product of several thousand years.
Agriculture also needs reliable rainfall. The increased seasonality exhibited by an increase in extreme El Ninos and La Ninas does not lend itself to successful cropping. Nor does the increase in individual extreme rainfall events that is occurring with global warming. Changes in the time of year rain occurs can play havoc with ripening for winter grown summer harvested wheat and grapes.
The preference expressed in the article above for conditions typical of the last 9,000 years is based on the proven success of the development of human agriculture over that period. Most of that time was close to current conditions. The article talks of optimal practical conditions rather than an ideal temperature. I'll leave the idealism to Scott Pruitt. There is no inferred ideal global temperature but simply a sensible temperature to grow crops and maintain our ecosystems as best we can.
Human activities in the form of fossil fuel combustion is the cause of the warming which would if continued take away from optimal agricultural conditions. Treating the cause of that non-optimal warming by reducing fossil fuel combustion is simple practical common sense. This transition will require contributions from human activity to reduce fossil fuel combustion. There is no inference that it won't involve human activity.
Your reasoning or imagining that such an inference exists is far more intellectually bankrupt that the article above which quotes scientists Stefan Rahmstorf, Katherine Hayoe, Michael Mann and Naomi Oreskes who are motivated by science not politics.

""Sea ice is declining over much of the Arctic. In Hudson Bay the ice melts completely each summer, and advances in break-up have resulted in longer ice-free seasons. consequently early break-up is implicated in declines in body condition, survival and abundance of polar bears (Ursus maritimus Phillips, 1744) in the Western Hudson Bay subpopulation. We hypothesised that similar patterns would be evident in the neighboring Southern Hudson Bay (SH) subpopulation. We examined trends 1980 -2012 in break-up and freeze-up dates within the entire SH management unit and within smaller coastal break-up and freeze-up zones. We examined trends in body condition for 900 bears captured during 1984-86, 2000-2005, and 2007-2009 and hypothesised that body condition could be correlated with duration of sea ice. The ice-free season in SH increased by 30 days from 1980-2012. Body condition declined in all age and sex classes, but the decline was less for cubs than for other social classes.

You seem strangely coy, given that you think its such a terrific concept, and far more keen to piffle off-topically about Trump. I'm all ears.....""
BQENDJames, to simplify this, everyone claims that the planet warming is a disaster. They have more difficulty explaining why. Asking the question about ideality is important because it puts them on the spot and makes them think this stuff through. The Alarmists have picked all sorts of emotive examples in order to try to focus public attention and alarm (Polar Bears; Bangladesh; The Marshall Islands; New Orleans & Eastern Seaboard USA; agricultural productivity; melting ice at the poles; the Great Barrier Reef; etc) most of which are highly questionable, and some (eg Bangladesh) complete nonsense.
Dana forgets himself to such an extent (again) in this article, that his wail of alarm is about the human warming component (he says: ""... to minimize the risks associated with rapid human-caused climate change ..."") - which is evidently rubbish, because the source of the warming does not affect its consequences. Or perhaps this was yet one more of Dana's political statements - because this blog is about politics not science.
So, Dana infers that what is wrong is because it is caused by human activity. 
If we were in the middle of the Little Ice Age, and someone asked the question about ideal conditions, would anyone suggest that ideality would be 1.5°C warmer on average? I am damn sure they wouldn't, because a) they would lack the objective experience to be able to comment, and b) they would be biased in the belief that the status quo is the ideal and any change is against God and Creation (pretty much as now).
Looking objectively at the planet, a significant proportion of the area of the Earth is given over to deserts: both sandy ones like the Sahara, Gobi, etc; and icy ones such as Greenland; most of Siberia; much of Alaska and northern Canada; and of course the Southern Continent. If the objective measure of ideality were the maximisation of biomass, then we should perhaps be looking for a warmer, wetter world with ice-free poles, an additional available continent, huge potential agricultural area in Siberia and Greenland, and more rain on the Sahara and other dry deserts.
The only characteristics of ""ideality"" inferred in this article are : • something close to current conditions• no contribution from human activity

BQEND?????
Why are you asking me this question? I have no problems with us reducing emissions of CO2. The amount invested, and the rate of change, is something that needs to be on the basis of relative priority. I must have made this comment and criticised the stupid binary logic that you guys espouse any number of times - but you simply dont learn.
I hold no brief for Trump.
And I see the amount of investment that is going into some sensible and some completely stupid projects to capture non-fossil based energy. So clearly all the claims that ""nothing is being done"" are complete crap.
So what exactly is your argument here?
Once one removes your binary posture, you all look like naked political demonstrators, trying to create debating advantage by misrepresenting the positions of others in order to savagely attack straw men of your own creation.
So tell me again about how I elected Trump, and how I claim that warming is not occurring! Because I have done neither.

You talked instead about cyclone intensity and mentioned that Kerry's introduction and review of work on cyclones said that up until his paper there had been no measurable increase in tropical cyclone intensity. Unfortunately we can't read the detailed findings of Kerry's study as presented in that paper as free access currently only allows us to see the first page containing the abstract and the introduction. However the abstract says as follows.
""Here I define an index of potential destructiveness of tropical cyclones based on the total dissipation of power, integrated over the lifetime of the cyclone, and show that the index has increased markedly since the mid 1970s. This trend is due to both the longer storm lifetimes and greater storm intensities. I find that the record of net hurricane power dissipation is highly correlated with tropical sea surface temperature, reflecting well-documented climate signals, including multidecadal oscillations in the North Atlantic and North Pacific, and global warming.""
The upper troposphere effects are related to those northern ocean oscillations and the the lower temperature gradient from the poles to the tropics (with polar amplification due to global warming) affecting the energy of the jet streams causing them to meander resulting in weather patterns staying in place for longer which can effectively lock cyclones in one position for longer as happened last summer over Houston. A cyclone is initially a response to local tropical sea temperatures and a flatter temperature gradient would result in less transfer of of heat energy from the tropics to the poles, resulting in more dissipation of that energy in the tropics and nearby subtropics and hence more cyclone destructiveness.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1516665371000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'global warming', u'effect': u'tropical cyclones to spend more crossing a particular area'}, {u'cause': u'both the longer storm lifetimes and greater storm intensities', u'effect': u'this trend is'}, {u'cause': u'global warming', u'effect': u'polar amplification'}, {u'cause': None, u'effect': u'weather patterns'}, {u'cause': None, u'effect': u'more dissipation of that energy in the tropics and nearby subtropics and hence more cyclone destructiveness'}, {u'cause': None, u'effect': u'less transfer of of heat energy from the tropics to the poles'}], u'author_id': u'12483673', u'in_reply_to': u'111184347', u'id': u'111187335', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'BuzzBloodOhio space', u'text': u'""In theory, the peak wind speed of tropical cyclones should increase by about 5% for every 1degreeC increase in tropical ocean temperature""', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1516660954000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'17722198', u'in_reply_to': u'111149939', u'id': u'111185075', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'BuzzBloodOhio space', u'text': u'*g cyclone intensity increases.

BQSTART
The world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, China, has launched the world’s biggest ever mechanism to reduce carbon, in the form of an emissions trading system. 
China’s top governmental bodies on Tuesday gave their approval to plans for a carbon trading system that will initially cover the country’s heavily polluting power generation plants, then expand to take in most of the economy.
“This is a game-changer,” said Nathaniel Keohane, vice president at the Environmental Defense Fund, a US-based environmental group. “This shows global leadership on the part of the Chinese government.”

China has to reduce its emissions and as per the Paris treaty which you have misunderstood has to do so by 2030.
BQEND
All of the analyses of China's NDC that I have seen include variants of the phrase ""commits to peak CO2 emissions by (/ around) 2030"", and make much of ""per capita"" and ""per unit of GDP"" figures instead of ""total / absolute emissions"" (which result in the actual radiative forcing changes in the atmosphere).
This allows China to INCREASE emissions all the way to 2030, and only ""commits"" them to STARTING to ""reduce"" them (at an unspecified rate) AFTER that date.
Do you have a link to something saying they have updated their official position to committing to reduce them by 2030, and if so to reduce them by how much (and from which reference year) ?
There were several ""comment / opinion piece"" articles in various media outlets about a year ago saying that the ""plateauing"" of global CO2 emissions at ~10GtC per year for 3 consecutive years (2014 + 2015 + 2016) was indicative of ""Chinese emissions peaking a decade ahead of schedule"".

The climate is changing. That’s not the debate. The debate is how do we know what the ideal surface temperature is in 2100?
Pruitt’s goal is to sow doubt on behalf of his oil industry allies in order to weaken and delay climate policies. Shifting the ‘debate’ toward ‘the ideal surface temperature’ achieves that goal by creating the perception that we don’t know what temperature we should aim for. It’s in line with his boss’ recent ignorant tweet suggesting that “Perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming.” 
I spoke with a number of climate scientists who agreed that to minimize the risks associated with rapid human-caused climate change, from a practical standpoint the ‘ideal temperature’ is as close to the current one as possible.
Stefan Rahmstorf, Head of Earth System Analysis at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research pointed out that we’re not concerned about specific temperatures; it’s rapid temperature changes that cause problems:
Pruitt of course is trying to have a strawman debate, distracting from the fact that not a certain temperature as such is better or worse, but that a change from what we are adapted to is a problem, especially a very rapid change - in either direction, cooling or warming, this causes big disruption. 
We should not stray too far away from what we and the currently existing ecosystems have evolved for. That is the optimum, simply because it is what we’re highly adapted to, and any major change is going to be very painful.
Texas Tech’s Katharine Hayhoe agreed, noting that human civilization has developed in the relatively stable climate of the past 10,000 years.
There is no one perfect temperature for the earth, but there is for us humans, and that’s the temperature we’ve had over the last few thousands of years when we built our civilization, agriculture, economy, and infrastructure. Global average temperature over the last few millennia has fluctuated by a few tenths of degrees; today, it’s risen by nearly 1°C and counting.Why do we care? Because we are perfectly adapted to our current conditions. Two-thirds of the world’s largest cities are located within a metre of sea level. What happens when sea level rises a metre or more, as it’s likely to this century? We can’t pick up Shanghai or London or New York and move them. Most of our arable land is already carefully allocated and farmed. 
What happens when we can no longer grow the crops we used to, as climate shifts and water becomes more scarce in many subtropical areas? We can’t just take over new land: someone else already owns it. What happens when our water resources diminish or even run out? We can’t take over someone else’s water rights without a war.We care about a changing climate because it exacerbates the risks we face today, and threatens the resources we depend on for our future.
In fact, Hayhoe specifically answered this question in one of her ‘Global Weirding’ videos for PBS:
Michael Mann, Distinguished Professor of Atmospheric Science at Penn State also pointed out that we’re approaching some critical temperature thresholds. For example, his research has shown that at warmer temperatures, reproduction of malaria-transmitting parasites increases rapidly.
There are some absolute temperature thresholds that are important when it comes to agriculture (particularly in tropics), coral bleaching, infectious disease, and heat stress (e.g. the tropics becoming essentially unlivable).
So while it’s difficult to say what the “ideal temperature” is, there clearly is a range of temperatures suitable for human civilization and there is a real danger that we’re pushing toward the upper limit of that range.
Naomi Oreskes, Professor of the History of Science and Affiliated Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Harvard similarly noted that according to the peer-reviewed literature on climate change impacts, we’re already headed into dangerous territory:
Of course, there is no ‘ideal’ temperature so we should not accept that framing. We have strong scientific evidence that anything above 2°C is likely to be deeply problematic. Even the roughly 1°C change we have already seen is having measurable, adverse effects.
That’s why with the Paris climate accords, every country in the world except the USA has agreed to try and limit global warming to no more than 2°C above pre-industrial temperatures, and preferably closer to 1.5°C. The targets would be even more aggressive if possible, but as Oreskes noted, we’ve already caused 1°C of global warming, and transitioning away from fossil fuels will take time. From a practical standpoint, 2°C is the best we can plausibly achieve.
When speaking with the scientific experts it quickly becomes clear that the ideal response to climate change involves a rapid transition away from fossil fuels. Global temperatures are already warming at a rate more than 20 times faster than Earth’s fastest natural climate changes. It’s that rapid rate of global warming that poses an existential threat. Species can only adapt so quickly. The longer we wait to slow that dangerously fast climate change, the worse the consequences will be.
Unfortunately, the Trump Administration is doing everything it can to delay and weaken efforts to cut carbon pollution. Pruitt isn’t interested in these scientific answers to his question; he’s interested in helping his fossil fuel industry benefactors.

In November, the power consumed by the entire bitcoin network was estimated to be higher than that of the Republic of Ireland. Since then, its demands have only grown. It’s now on pace to use just over 42TWh of electricity in a year, placing it ahead of New Zealand and Hungary and just behind Peru, according to estimates from Digiconomist. That’s commensurate with CO2 emissions of 20 megatonnes – or roughly 1m transatlantic flights.
That fact should be a grave notion to anyone who hopes for the cryptocurrency to grow further in stature and enter widespread usage. But even more alarming is that things could get much, much worse, helping to increase climate change in the process. 
Burning huge amounts of electricity isn’t incidental to bitcoin: instead, it’s embedded into the innermost core of the currency, as the operation known as “mining”. In simplified terms, bitcoin mining is a competition to waste the most electricity possible by doing pointless arithmetic quintillions of times a second. 
Bitcoin is the first, and the biggest, “cryptocurrency” – a decentralised tradeable digital asset. Whether it is a bad investment is the big question. Bitcoin can only be used as a medium of exchange and in practice has been far more important for the dark economy than it has for most legitimate uses. The lack of any central authority makes bitcoin remarkably resilient to censorship, corruption – or regulation. That means it has attracted a range of backers, from libertarian monetarists who enjoy the idea of a currency with no inflation and no central bank, to drug dealers who like the fact that it is hard (but not impossible) to trace a bitcoin transaction back to a physical person.
The more electricity you burn, and the faster your computer, the higher your chance of winning the competition. The prize? 12.5 bitcoin – still worth over $100,000 – plus all the transaction fees paid in the past 10 minutes, which according analysts’ estimates is another $2,500 or so.
This is a winner-takes-all game, where the prize is guaranteed to be paid to one, and only one, miner every 10 minutes. Burning more electricity increases your chances of winning, but correspondingly decreases everyone else’s – and so they have a motivation to burn more electricity in turn.
The economic outcome of all of this is laid bare in a Credit Suisse briefing note published on Tuesday: the network as a whole will reinvest almost all the bitcoin paid out as mining rewards back into its electricity consumption. (Credit Suisse’s ballpark figure assumes that 80% of the expenses of bitcoin miners are spent on electricity).
At current prices for electricity and bitcoin, the bank calculates a maximum profitable power draw of bitcoin at around 100TWh – two-and-a-half times higher than its current rate. Any higher and the miner will lose money.
But it gets worse. If bitcoin were to become the global currency its supporters hope it will, its pricewould increase. And if its price increases, so too does the amount of electricity miners can afford to burn. 
Credit Suisse estimate that a bitcoin price of $50,000 – five times its level as I write – would increase the electricity consumption tenfold. And at a bitcoin price of $1.1m, it would be profitable to use almost all the electricity currently generated in the world for mining.
The bank views the latter prospect as not worth worrying about, for two reasons: it doesn’t think bitcoin will ever reach that value, since the competition from other cryptocurrencies is too strong; and it thinks that power consumption of mining will fall over time as better technologies are used for miners. Credit Suisse explicitly compares bitcoin to marijuana cultivation and data centres, two other industries that once sparked fears they would have huge power draws.
I’m not convinced we should be so blasé. It’s true that bitcoin may face competition from other cryptocurrencies, but almost all its competitors use essentially the same wasteful mining system it does. If they took over pole position, it would be out of the frying pan and into the fire. (One major competitor, Ethereum, has long discussed moving to a “proof-of-stake” system, which would radically change its power use for the better, but the switchover still hasn’t happened. It’s currently scheduled for mid-2018.)
And while marijuana farmers and data centre engineers managed to reduce their power demands, the fundamentally wasteful nature of bitcoin mining means there’s no easy technological solution coming. 
Mining computers have become more power-efficient, with the latest generation of machines able to do roughly 20% more useless calculations per MWh of electricity. But in the zero-sum game of bitcoin mining, that just means a miner can afford to run more machines at the same time, leaving their power usage roughly stable.
In the end, there’s only one real reason why bitcoin’s energy consumption would fall, and that is if the price of the currency drops. 
On that point, there is good news to be had: bitcoin is down to just over $10,000, almost half the level it was trading at a month ago. If it continues to fall, we might be able to return to worrying about more conventional sources of climate change, like the automotive industry, plane travel, and Donald Trump.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/17/bitcoin-electricity-usage-huge-climate-cryptocurrency

Pufferfish are considered a delicacy in Japan, often eaten raw as sashimi or cooked in soups. But if the fish are not carefully prepared they can be deadly. 
The supermarket in Gamagori failed to remove the liver from the fish before putting them on sale, and unfortunately the liver is one of the organs that can harbour the potent neurotoxin tetrodotoxin. In an effort to recall the potentially poisonous fish sold, loudspeakers across the city have been warning citizens of the danger; at the time of writing, three of the five packs of fish sold had been traced.
The risks of eating pufferfish are widely known in Japan and the preparation and sale of the fish is tightly regulated. Nevertheless, poisonings happen every year but, because the symptoms are recognised, effective treatment can be very successful and fatalities are rare. 
However, pufferfish are widely distributed in tropical waters – and those consumers and those fishing outside Asian countries aren’t always aware of the dangers. The fish has also invaded new territories in recent years posing new problems, especially for fishermen not familiar with the species. Relatively recently, the fish have arrived in the eastern Mediterranean. 
The Suez Canal when it opened in 1869 brought dramatic changes to world trade. It also brought with it invasive species from the Red Sea: 925 non-native species have been recorded in the eastern Mediterranean since the opening of the canal. Migration of species in the opposite direction is relatively rare because the Red Sea is comparatively saltier and nutrient poor. One of the invading species, the silver-cheeked toadfish (Lagocephalus sceleratus), is a type of pufferfish most usually found in the Pacific and Indian oceans. The toadfish appears to be thriving off the Turkish coast and is of particular concern for several reasons.
The main cause for concern is its economic impact. The silver-cheeked toadfish has strong teeth that it can use to bite through fishing lines and nets to get to the trapped fish. The damage to fishing gear is one thing, but the toadfish will then go on to feast on the abundance of food it finds inside the nets, meaning several kilos of the catch are often unsaleable. The financial losses to fishermen, who are already often on very low incomes, have been increasing in recent years. 
The other concern is the toxicity of the fish. Tetrodotoxin is found in several of the silver-cheeked toadfish organs, including the ovaries and liver. This powerful neurotoxin, when pure, can kill an adult human at a dosage of as little as two milligrams. It is far more potent a poison than arsenic or cyanide.
In the body, tetrodotoxin blocks sodium channels that enable nerves to fire. It kills because nerves no longer trigger muscle movement controlling breathing and the victim suffocates. The toxin can also induce heart failure. There is no antidote and treatment is to support breathing artificially until the body excretes the toxin naturally. The treatment is very successful, with many people making a full recovery. 
There is no market for pufferfish as a delicacy in Turkey but the fishermen often eat the fish they catch because they can’t sell it elsewhere. A recent survey found that 38% of surveyed fishermen had consumed pufferfish and of that group, 11% had shown symptoms of intoxication. Clearly, messages about the dangers of this fish have not been getting through. 
 The poison is not produced by the fish itself. Rather, it is a product of environmental bacteria that accumulate in the fish. Pufferfish are not the only species that can accumulate tetrodotoxin in this way. There is evidence that tetrodotoxin-contaminated seafood is spreading northwards – it has even been found off the southern coast of England. In this case it the fish involved wasn’t the silver-cheeked toadfish, as these are likely to remain in the eastern Mediterranean where the water is much warmer. Instead, tetrodotoxin was detected in molluscs – pacific oysters, native oysters, mussels and hard clams.
The studies carried out so far have been small but substantial enough to highlight a potential problem and give hints of the causes and circumstances to be wary of. For example, not all species in all conditions are affected in the same way. Pacific oysters in the summer months from shallow, low saline sites show the highest levels of the toxin. Sea temperatures of at least 15°C seem to be needed to produce detectable levels of the toxin. 
Sea temperatures around the UK coastline have already shown an increase of over 0.7°C over the last 30 years. These temperatures are likely to increase, as is rainfall, due to global warming. The speculation is that conditions will become increasingly favourable for the tetrodotoxin-producing bacteria. What is certain is that more studies need to be carried out to understand the nature of any potential problem and identify what can be done. 
Educating people about the dangers is certainly one important aspect of poisoning prevention. Screening can also help stop contaminated food from going on sale, but there might be ways of reducing the levels of toxin in the first place. For molluscs this may not be easy, but there are ways of removing the silver-cheeked toadfish from the Mediterranean and reducing the threat of poisoning there. 
Fishing for the toadfish and removing it from the environment is one method, but there are few incentives to do this. There is no market to sell the fish for food, so bounties have been proposed for each fish landed. Unfortunately, the amount offered per fish is unlikely to be enough to give financial incentive for Turkish fishermen to catch the species. 
Fortunately, there might be another market for this fish: medicine. 
Tetrodotoxin, whilst proving extremely dangerous in high doses, may have medical benefits in lower doses. Studies have shown that in some circumstances the toxin may relieve pain, particularly in cancer patients. At a time when we are increasingly looking for alternatives to opiates for pain relief, tetrodotoxin may be one candidate; it has even been shown to reduce the pain of withdrawal from opiates. It may ultimately be the case that this invasive species could provide valuable benefits.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2018/jan/17/tetrodotoxin-the-poison-behind-the-japanese-pufferfish-fugu-scare

What is the variable tolerance on this estimate, with the emphasis on the word estimate?The article finishes by telling us about planetary tipping points that have not been considered.After reading thus, I cannot fathom how the words ""Worst-case global warming scenarios not credible"" can possibly be taken seriously, if based on another 'scenario' reported here which by its own admission has not considered all aspects.Even though there is discrepancy in the temperature figures, the study underlines and confirms climate change is real.We all know weather forecasts are reliable but not 100% accurate, but, presenting it in these terms, using words like 'not credible' is fuel for climate change deniers to justify keeping their heads in the sand.', u'recommendation_count': u'15', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1516260029000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'15948484', u'id': u'110997724', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'LanceB8888', u'text': u'Don't be too alarmed.

The findings should not be seen as taking pressure off the need to tackle climate change, the authors and other experts warned. “We will still see significant warming and impacts this century if we don’t increase our ambition to reduce CO2 emissions,” said Forster. 
Even a 1.5C increase will have consequences. With a single degree Celsius of warming so far, the Earth is already coping with a crescendo of climate impacts including deadly droughts, erratic rainfall, and storm surges engorged by rising seas.

One wild card not taken into consideration by the new model is the possibility of rapid shifts in climate brought on by the planet itself. “There is indeed evidence that the climate system can undergo abrupt changes or ‘tipping points’,” Cox said. 
The collapse of the gulf stream, the thawing of carbon-rich permafrost, or the melting of ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica – any of these could quickly change the equation, and not in the Earth’s favour.

A revised calculation of how greenhouse gases drive up the planet’s temperature reduces the range of possible end-of-century outcomes by more than half, researchers said in the report, published in the journal Nature.
“Our study all but rules out very low and very high climate sensitivities,” said lead author Peter Cox, a professor at the University of Exeter.
How effectively the world slashes CO2 and methane emissions, improves energy efficiency and develops technologies to remove CO2 from the air will determine whether climate change remains manageable or unleashes a maelstrom of human misery.
But uncertainty about how hot things will get also stems from the inability of scientists to nail down a very simple question: By how much will Earth’s average surface temperature go up if the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is doubled?
That “known unknown” is called equilibrium climate sensitivity, and for the last 25 years the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – the ultimate authority on climate science – has settled on a range of 1.5C to 4.5C (2.7 to 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit).
Cox and colleagues, using a new methodology, have come up with a far narrower range: 2.2C to 3.4C, with a best estimate of 2.8C.
If accurate, it precludes the most destructive doomsday scenarios. “These scientists have produced a more accurate estimate of how the planet will respond to increasing CO2 levels,” said Piers Forster, director of the Priestley International Centre for Climate at the University of Leeds.
Gabi Hegerl, a climate scientist at the University of Edinburgh who, like Forster, did not take part in the research, added: “Having lower probability for very high sensitivity is reassuring. Very high sensitivity would have made it extremely hard to limit climate change according to the Paris targets.”
The landmark Paris climate agreement in 2015 called for capping global warming at “well under” 2C compared to a pre-industrial benchmark, and pursuing efforts for a 1.5C ceiling.
The findings should not be seen as taking pressure off the need to tackle climate change, the authors and other experts warned. “We will still see significant warming and impacts this century if we don’t increase our ambition to reduce CO2 emissions,” said Forster.
Even a 1.5C increase will have consequences. With a single degree Celsius of warming so far, the Earth is already coping with a crescendo of climate impacts including deadly droughts, erratic rainfall, and storm surges engorged by rising seas.
A 3.5 C world, scientists say, could pull at the fabric of civilisation.
Since industrialisation took off in the early 19th century, CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere have increased by nearly half, from 280 parts per million to 407 parts per million.
Up to now global warming predictions have focused on the historical temperature record.
Cox and colleagues instead “considered the year-to-year fluctuations in global temperature,” said Richard Allan, a climate scientist at the University of Reading.
By analysing the responsiveness of short-term changes in temperature to “nudges and bumps” in the climate system, he explained, they were able to exclude the outcomes that would have resulted in devastating increases of 4C or more by 2100.
One wild card not taken into consideration by the new model is the possibility of rapid shifts in climate brought on by the planet itself. “There is indeed evidence that the climate system can undergo abrupt changes or ‘tipping points’,” Cox said.
The collapse of the gulf stream, the thawing of carbon-rich permafrost, or the melting of ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica – any of these could quickly change the equation, and not in the Earth’s favour.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jan/18/worst-case-global-warming-scenarios-not-credible-says-study

the 2017 global temperature remains stubbornly high, well above the trend line (Fig. 1), despite cooler than average temperature in the tropical Pacific Niño 3.4 region (Fig. 5), which usually provides an indication of the tropical Pacific effect on global temperature7. Conceivably this continued temperature excursion above the trend line is not a statistical fluke, but rather is associated with climate forcings and/or feedbacks. The growth rate of greenhouse gas climate forcing has accelerated in the past decade.3 There is also concern that polar climate feedbacks may accelerate.8 Therefore, temperature change during even the next few years is of interest, to determine whether a significant excursion above the trend line is underway.

We take 1880-1920 as baseline, i.e., as the zero-point for temperature anomalies, because it is the earliest period with substantial global coverage of instrumental measurements and because it also has a global mean temperature that should approximate “preindustrial” temperature. 
We estimate current underlying temperature, excluding short-term variability via linear fit to the post- 1970 temperature. The result is +1.07°C at the beginning of 2018 relative to 1880-1920.

One degree C of global temperature rise doesn't sound like much, but it already took out the ice shelf constraining the flow of the Jakobshavn Glacier which drains part of the Greenland Ice Sheet.

China and the rest of the world began their industrial revolutions sometime during the past century, china around the 1950's after recovering a bit from WWII. But my point here is that we've been pouring - pouring - waste into the earth for over 150 years. And we're not just talking paper and pencils. We're talking toxic waste. The US has how many superfund sites? contaminated sites not usable by businesses? Every city deals with this in a major way. Smog? Air pollutants? Add to that the reality that fresh water isn't easily available in many areas and the fact that the ocean has been a heat sink for the planet and will hopefully continue to provide that roll for as long as humanly possible. When the ocean starts expelling the heat it's been hording, that's pretty much the massive tipping point the average human will understand because climate change won't be some ice storms in florida or some other current obvious change. No, it'll be a loss of land in florida and every other coast around the world.

In the run-up to the US president’s speech to its annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, next week, the WEF avoided mentioning Trump by name but said “nation-state unilateralism” would make it harder to tackle global warming and ecological damage.
The WEF’s global risks perception survey showed Trump’s arrival in the White House in 2017 had coincided with a marked increase in concern about the environment among experts polled by the Swiss-based organisation.
1. Extreme weather events
2. Natural disasters
3. Failure to halt climate change
4. Water crises
5. Cyber attacks
6. Biodiversity loss
7. Mass involuntary migration
8. Manmade environmental disasters
It said all five environmental risks covered by the survey – extreme weather events, natural disasters, failure of climate-change mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse, and human-made natural disasters – had become more prominent.
“This follows a year characterised by high-impact hurricanes, extreme temperatures and the first rise in CO2 emissions for four years. We have been pushing our planet to the brink and the damage is becoming increasingly clear. 
“Biodiversity is being lost at mass-extinction rates, agricultural systems are under strain, and pollution of the air and sea has become an increasingly pressing threat to human health.”
Trump has threatened to withdraw the US from the 2015 Paris agreement under which nations agreed to take steps to limit the increase in global temperature. He has said the commitments made by his predecessor, Barack Obama, would damage the American economy.
Other states have said they will keep to the pledges made in Paris, an approach supported by the WEF.
“A trend towards nation-state unilateralism may make it more difficult to sustain the long-term, multilateral responses that are required to counter global warming and the degradation of the global environment,” it said.
The survey said the extreme weather events in 2017 included unusually frequent Atlantic hurricanes, with September the most intense month on record. It was also the most expensive hurricane season.
It added that when data was finalised, 2017 would be among the three hottest years on record, and the hottest without an El Niño, the Pacific Ocean climate cycle that affects the world’s weather.
Biodiversity loss was occurring at mass-extinction rates, the WEF said, noting that the populations of vertebrate species declined by an estimated 58% between 1970 and 2012. 
“Globally, the primary driver of biodiversity loss is the human destruction of habitats including forests – which are home to approximately 80% of the world’s land-based animals, plants and insects – for farming, mining, infrastructure development and oil and gas production.”
Stronger than expected growth in 2017 meant economic risks were seen as less pressing, but the WEF said the upbeat picture masked continuing underlying concerns, including unsustainable asset prices; high levels of indebtedness, particularly in China; and continuing strains in the global financial system. 
The International Monetary Fund is likely to raise its forecast for global growth when it gives its latest economic update in Davos next Monday, and the WEF survey said the recovery underway in all major economies had to led to a sharp improvement in sentiment.
But it expressed concern that the swing to optimism might lead to complacency and a blind spot to economic risks. “There are certainly reasons to be cautious: one does not have to look far for signs of economic and financial strain”, the WEF added, calling for greater attention to be paid to the risks of another crisis erupting. 
 
The survey warned there would be limited policy firepower in the event of a new crisis. It also warned of the disruption caused by automation, noting that “for the foreseeable future, automation and digitalisation can be expected to push down on levels of employment and wages, and contribute to increases in income and wealth at the top of the distribution.”
It also highlighted the buildup of protectionist pressures against a backdrop of rising nationalist and populist politics and growing cybersecurity risks.
The WEF said cyber attacks against businesses had almost doubled in five years, and that the financial impact of cybersecurity breaches was rising.

The meeting at the luxury ski resort in the Swiss Alps at the start of each year is set to be dominated by the US president, who is due to give a special address to the conference on Friday.
The official theme of this year’s forum is “creating a shared future in a fractured world”, which could have taken its cue from Trump alone. However, it does leave enough wiggle room to take in Brexit and the growing risks from technological advances, climate change and rising inequality.
Political upheaval and rising populism will also be hot topics for the more than 2,500 delegates from the realms of business, politics, academia, the charity sector and the arts, plus the usual smattering of celebrities. These will be the themes to watch out for.
Davos is a Swiss ski resort now more famous for hosting the annual four-day conference for the World Economic Forum. For participants it is a festival of networking. Getting an invitation is a sign you have made it – and the elaborate system of badges reveals your place in the Davos hierarchy.
For critics, “Davos man” is shorthand for the globe-trotting elite, disconnected from their home countries after spending too much time in the club-class lounge. Others just wonder if it is all a big waste of time.Who is there?
More than 2,500 people – business leaders, world leaders, diplomats and the odd celebrity, such as Matt Damon – will fly in for the 49th annual Davos meeting. Most delegates are men, and although the forum boasts delegates from more than 100 countries, most hail from western Europe, followed by the US. Sir David Attenborough is one of the most notable attendees in 2019, while Donald Trump, Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron all pulled out at short notice to focus on more pressing issues at home.
The US president might enjoy the trappings of power and a billionaire’s lifestyle, like the most ardent of globalists at Davos, yet politically he has set himself up as the very opposite of the WEF and all that it stands for.
The organisers set great store in “multi-stakeholder” solutions and the idea that global problems are best solved by countries working together – which makes the event an unlikely stomping ground for a president bent on isolationism and putting “America first”. Protectionism and the potential for the disruption of world trade and cooperation will be a hot topic all week.
Klaus Schwab, the founder and executive chairman of the WEF, gave a thinly veiled warning to Trump at his pre-meeting press conference, arguing “no individual alone can solve the issues on the global agenda”. He said the world was at an inflection point where there was a “real danger of a collapse of our global systems”.
That may be no bad thing for Trump, who has shown little love for global institutions. His keynote address just before the close of the meeting on Friday will be unmissable.
Almost 10 years on from the financial crisis, and the global economy has got its mojo back. The International Monetary Fund will deliver its latest world economic outlook update on Monday from Davos, where there are sure to be questions about the sustainability of the current upswing.
The IMF’s managing director, Christine Lagarde, will deliver the update and speak on several other panels throughout the week. The prospect of rising inflation and the removal of economic stimulus by central banks will be sure to feature prominently, while the theme of the conference – creating a shared future – will raise the issues of wealth and growing income inequality.
The increasing use of artificial intelligence, robotics and the automation of jobs has been a repeating theme at Davos, and this year is no different. The impact of AI will be one of the forum’s major events, with a one-to-one interview to be held between Schwab and the chief executive of Google, Sundar Pichai.
The “fourth industrial revolution” will be a key theme once more, with a focus on how the loss of millions of jobs could undermine social cohesion. The way states respond to governing and taxing technologies and borderless business will be high on the agenda.
Although unlikely to be a major theme at Davos this year, the annual summit will present UK ministers with an opportunity to rub shoulders with European leaders just before they pile into more substantive talks on trade later this year.
Theresa May and Philip Hammond will be in attendance, while representatives from all 28 EU member states will also be heading to Davos, including the head of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, and the French president Emmanuel Macron.
Labour’s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, will be making his first visit to Davos, planning to use the event as an opportunity to explain why the rules of the global economy need rewriting. May, on the other hand, will be expected to explain how Britain still matters on the global stage as it quits the EU.
Trump moved quickly to pull the US out of the Paris climate accords in one of his first acts as president last year. At Davos, where the environment is always among the most important issues up for debate, this won’t have gone down well.
The former US vice-president Al Gore is attending and will speak on several panels, including one about how extreme weather events are proving more devastating and expensive.
The WEF’s global risks perception survey, released last week, cited climate change-related issues as the top problems facing the world, while it also issued a thinly veiled warning to the US president that “nation-state unilateralism” will make it harder to combat change and ecological damage.
In the wake of the Harvey Weinstein sex abuse scandal, gender equality and issues such as bullying and harassment in the workplace will be in sharp focus at Davos this year.
Business leaders have often talked about encouraging diversity in the past, although are also accused of having made very little headway. Women will only account for 21% of all of the participants this year.
At least three sessions will directly tackle the problems facing women at work, including one with the Microsoft executive Peggy Johnson and Canadian minister for the status of women, Maryam Monsef, titled “Gender, power and stemming sexual harassment”.
More than a third of participants come from developing or emerging economies, while the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, will address the opening plenary.
Humanitarian crises are on the agenda, with the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees out of Myanmar likely to feature prominently, as the forum considers the outlook for 2018.
The actor Cate Blanchett, who alongside Elton John has won a prize designated for artists who best represent the “spirit of Davos”, will speak to raise awareness about the refugee crisis. Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani student who fights for education and women’s rights, will also speak about the importance of education and equal opportunities.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/20/davos-2018-wef-hottest-topics-climate-change-harassment-donald-trump

CLIMATE economists refer to it as “the most important number you've never heard of”. The social cost of carbon (SCC) tries to capture the cost of an additional ton of carbon-dioxide pollution in a single number—around $47 in present dollars.Nov 16, 2017

""What value of statistical life does EPA use?EPA recommends that the central estimate of $7.4 million ($2006), updated to the year of the analysis, be used in all benefits analyses that seek to quantify mortality risk reduction benefits regardless of the age, income, or other population characteristics of the affected population until revised guidance becomes available""
It always sounds callous - but we either implicitly or explicitly incorporate some value, and I think the more we explicitly work on the estimate the better.
(As an aside, years ago in the UK when I was doing cost-benefit analysis for investment road traffic signals the was a government number you could call to get the latest value-of-life number.)
One interesting point is whether we should also include a specific ""suffering and pain"" value in the estimates - which is not normally done.

and you may not be aware that the ERSST has been updated a couple of times recently, to v3b and now v4. Strangely comparisons of the older versions and the current version produce recent warming.
BQEND
We are now on Version 5:
http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0836.1
The update from ERSST version 3b to version 4 resulted in an increase in the operational SST trend estimate during the last 19 years from 0.07° to 0.12°C per decade, indicating a higher rate of warming in recent years. We show that ERSST version 4 trends generally agree with largely independent, near-global, and instrumentally homogeneous SST measurements from floating buoys, Argo floats, and radiometer-based satellite measurements that have been developed and deployed during the past two decades. We find a large cooling bias in ERSST version 3b and smaller but significant cooling biases in HadSST3 and COBE-SST from 2003 to the present, with respect to most series examined. These results suggest that reported rates of SST warming in recent years have been underestimated in these three data sets.

One starting point is to ask: What is the optimum average global temperature for human beings?
The optimum temperature can be seen as a trade-off between the “well-being” of humans and the cost of achieving the associated temperature.
How should we measure “well-being”? Presumably it should include such things as health, GDP, and life expectancy, but, since we are focusing on climate, we might also put in a weighting directly related to human physical comfort under hot/cold/humid conditions. We can end up with a weighted index, similar to the UN Human Development Index. For the sake of argument, it could simply be labelled the Well Being Index (WBI). 
The next task would be to plot a curve that relates the Well Being Index to the average global temperature, starting on the basis of today’s technology/infrastructure/geographical dispersion. For example, what happens to the WBI if we go from 15c to 16c? How about from 16c to 17c?Given this curve, we can then say how the WBI will change over the next few decades based on current predictions for average global temperature.
Assuming we do not take any preventative actions to directly impact the man-made portion of global warming, then what would be the cost of the required “adaptions” in technology/infrastructure/geographical dispersion that we would have to make to ensure the same WBI index as now? (e,g. Flooding damage repair, net impact on crop yields, ...) 
Alternatively, what would be the cost of taking direct carbon-reduction preventative actions to reach the equivalent WBI level? How does this compare to the cost of the “adaption” actions? How do the preventive and adaptive actions interact when we combine them? Do some preventative actions have an impact on WBI beyond their direct climate impact? (We need to ensure that the specific costs of prevention and adaptation, are not double-counted in the ""GDP"" part of our WBI index.)
What will be the impact on the curve from future developments that are expected to be made anyway, regardless of climate considerations? For example, in 50 to 100 years humans are likely to have significantly “merged” with computers, in terms of both “body and brain”. How will this impact our response to climate related impacts? 
Also, are there other scientific and technological developments that we would be making anyway that would make us more or less susceptible to changes in temperature? 
Once we have determined the relationship between the WBI and temperature, then to determine the optimum we need the costs of adaptation and prevention, but we also need to monetize the WBI. For example, say we have an WBI index that goes from 100 to 98 in response to the global temperature going up by 0.5c. What is the value we should attach to this WBI change? Part of that might be estimated by using social cost factors used by various government and other organizations, such as the value of years of life.
Another consideration is: What “discount factor” should we use to reflect the fact that, for most of us, we put more value on a cost incurred now than the subsequent benefit gained by humans in 50 or a 100 years from now.
Assuming we have all the input values, we can make decisions that optimize the change in WBI versus the associated cost of adaptive and preventative costs.
One important question is to what extent we can just deal with overall global averages, versus reflecting the fact that the impacts can vary a lot more for certain groups of people based on geography etc.
The context of the above has been average global temperature, but I guess the same thinking applies to climate change in general.

Extreme weather and climate-related events occur in a particular place, by definition, infrequently. It is therefore challenging to detect systematic changes in their occurrence given the relative shortness of observational records. However, there is a clear interest from outside the climate science community in the extent to which recent damaging extreme events can be linked to human-induced climate change or natural climate variability. Event attribution studies seek to determine to what extent anthropogenic climate change has altered the probability or magnitude of particular events. 
Anthropogenic climate change provides a key challenge for mankind. The Fifth Assessment report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that ‘human influence on the climate system is clear’ and that ‘changes in many extreme weather and climate events have been observed since about 1950’.[1] Societies around the world are faced with increasing climate change risks. Reducing such risks, which requires a consideration of vulnerability and exposure to climate-related hazards, can be achieved through a combination of adaptation to those hazards that are unavoidable and climate change mitigation by reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

BQSTART
Roughly every two years we’re treated to headlines repeating the myth that Earth is headed for an imminent “mini ice age.” It happened in 2013, 2015, and again just recently at the tail end of 2017. 
This time around, the myth appears to have been sparked by a Sky News interview with Northumbria University mathematics professor Valentina Zharkova. The story was quickly echoed by the Daily Mail, International Business Times, Sputnik News, Metro, Tru News, and others. Zharkova was also behind the ‘mini ice age’ stories in 2015, based on her research predicting that the sun will soon enter a quiet phase.
The most important takeaway point is that the scientific research is clear – were one to occur, a grand solar minimum would temporarily reduce global temperatures by less than 0.3°C, while humans are already causing 0.2°C warming per decade. 
BQENDThe impact on climate would be minimal, the press have pretty much invented that part.

This is what scientists refer to as a ""tipping point."" We say that something has reached a tipping point when it switches from a relatively stable state to an unstoppable cycle. 
In this case, the Arctic would change from a carbon sink to a carbon source. If the Arctic permafrost releases more carbon than it absorbs, it would start a cycle where the extra carbon in the atmosphere leads to increased warming. 
The increased warming means more permafrost thawing and methane release. 2
BQEND
Yet the study I linked to went on the say “that 65%–85% of permafrost carbon release can still be avoided if human emissions are actively reduced.”
That would seem to disagree with the NSIDC, which indicated the process is unstoppable when the permafrost region becomes a net carbon emitter. 
This is an important question as there’s more than twice the carbon that is currently in the atmosphere locked up there.
Richard Alley has mentioned that we aren't likely to see massive methane belches from the north changing the world, but to think of is as a slow, but perhaps inexorable problem,

One of the few scientists popular with climate confusionists is Dr Roy Spencer - he's a researcher who publishes satellite temperature data. (Of course you know that)
About two years ago he said this about satellites and temperature measurements:
BQSTART
""PRT*s are used to measure the temperature of the onboard (warm-point) calibration targets. 
The cosmic background (cold point) is assumed to be 2.7 K (or something close to that..it doesn’t really matter). PRTs are laboratory standard and highly stable, each one being carefully calibrated before launch.
Those two calibration points are used to calibrate the Earth-viewing data, and the AMSR-E calibration is a special case of poor design…the warm target was made of a material with low thermal conductivity.
The instrument was designed in Japan by engineers just coming up to speed on the technology, and it should never have been approved by NASA in the first place.
But, the instrument was “free” to NASA, so there was less scrutiny.
I say all this as the AMSR-E U.S. Science Team leader.""
BQEND
* PRTs are platinum resistance thermometers.
So there are issues with this particular instrument, and no one can go to check the calibrations.

I am now going to adjust a temperature recording: 
Minus 11 degrees Fahrenheit equals -23.8889 Celsius equals 249.2611 Kelvin. 
If you do not adjust the raw-data you will run into some serious problems when you area-weighting your observations. Imagine the interesting temperature contrasts that would occur at the US/Canadian borders if one did not adjust the raw measurements a bit?
This may sound silly - but it is a real thing. I have taught this stuff on university-level (spatial ""geographical information system"" analysis); 
One of the funniest lab-classes is to make students plot (real-world) data of crashes in a city - and make them produce a risk-assessment map of where it is most likely to crash. Most students will forget to overlay buildings and structures on their map. So the highest risk of a crash in their analyses often end up to be inside a down-town department-store or office. 
This is why education is good - it provide face-palm moments that make one aware of stuff. 
Why is this important for global temperature data?
Well - imagine if scientists were so dumb that we did not adjust for the scale used to measure - and did not adjust for the altitude the measurement is taken at?
If science were not aware of the latter adjustment we would have temperature maps that would look a lot like a topographical maps - because of this thing called lapse rate that can take different trajectories depending on all sorts of things (mostly continality and moisture content - that are kind of inter-woven)
If science were not aware of temperatures in general getting hotter as we move from the poles towards equator - imagine how data would look - and why it was figured out why it is best to present said anomaly maps as ""anomaly from local mean"" 
Science have a tendency to think about such things. 
For the people having a lot of trust in the satellite-measurements of temperature. Do you think that they actually measure temperature from a probe hanging under said satellite into the mid-troposphere - or do you think they record no F, C or K but instead how exited some atom vibrated before they present the result in some easier to understand measure - after being ""adjusted"" to a scale?

The upward adjustment in GMST in the early part of the record is almost entirely due to Sea Surface temperatures, which contribute 70% to the value, because, as I explained to you earlier, a temperature index needs to be spatially averaged The sea surface record has one major bias in it, the change from using bucket measurements in the early 20th century to using readings from engine coolant intake valves in the mid 20th century. The intake valves sampled sea water closer to the surface, and had passed through the interior of the ship, so one would intuitively expect there to be a spurious warming trend in the raw data due to this change in measurement method. We can reconstruct these situations today and experimentally determine the difference. We do indeed find that engine intake measurements are warmer than bucket readings - they introduce a spurious warming trend - and so GMST reconstructions adjust the data to remove it.', u'recommendation_count': u'3', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1516394897000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'as i explained to you earlier a temperature index needs to be spatially averaged the sea surface record has one major bias in it', u'effect': u'the upward adjustment in gmst in the early part of the record is almost entirely due to sea surface temperatures'}, {u'cause': u'sea surface temperatures which contribute 70 % to the value', u'effect': u'the upward adjustment in gmst in the early part of the record is because needs'}, {u'cause': u'this change in measurement method', u'effect': u'there to be a spurious warming trend in the raw data'}], u'author_id': u'3791246', u'in_reply_to': u'111071846', u'id': u'111073796', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Erik Frederiksen', u'text': u'All hail the pussy-grabber in chief.', u'recommendation_count': u'3', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1516394631000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'15131989', u'in_reply_to': u'111073610', u'id': u'111073698', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Stephanie  Hawking', u'text': u'Maybe the Moron in the Mad House can use the bricks that Mexico is going to pay for.', u'recommendation_count': u'4', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1516394418000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'17731345', u'in_reply_to': u'111073373', u'id': u'111073610', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, ...]",1556127471692.0,1518627429000,1516289402000,"Data shows the year was also one of the hottest three ever recorded, with scientists warning that the ‘climate tide is rising fast’",False,ñ,"[https://www.theguardian.com/science/meteorology, https://www.theguardian.com/environment/elnino, https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news]","Data shows the year was also one of the hottest three ever recorded, with scientists warning that the ‘climate tide is rising fast’",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9727646f9250f47d5b763dbfb377fe85c5f6a69/136_151_966_580/master/966.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=281171e5ea91e71c4760f3f687809289,2017 was the hottest year on record without El Niño boost,article,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/18/2017-was-the-hottest-year-on-record-without-el-nino-boost,0,"2017 was the hottest year since global records began that was not given an additional boost by the natural climate cycle El Niño, according to new data. Even without an El Niño, the year was still exceptionally hot, being one of the top three ever recorded.
The three main global temperature records show the global surface temperature in 2017 was 1C above levels seen in pre-industrial times, with scientists certain that humanity’s fossil fuel-burning is to blame.
The data, published on Thursday, means the last three years have been the hottest trio ever seen, with 2017 ranking second or third depending on the small differences between the temperature records. Furthermore, 17 of the 18 hottest years recorded since 1850 have occurred since 2000.
2017 also saw extreme weather events strike across the world, from hurricanes in the US and Caribbean to heatwaves in Australia and devastating floods in Asia. Many of these events have been shown to have been made much more likely by the heat resulting from global warming.
Scientists from across the globe warned that the limit of 1.5C of warming, set as a goal by the international Paris climate change treaty, was being approached very rapidly and that it was more urgent than ever to slash emissions to avoid the worst impacts.
The three global temperature records are compiled by the UK’s Met Office and Nasa and Noaa in the United States. The Met Office said the average temperature in 2017 was 0.99C above that seen from 1850-1900, despite the Pacific Ocean moving into its cooler La Niña phase.
“While climate change deniers continue to bury their heads in the sand, global warming continues unabated,” said Prof Michael Mann, at Pennsylvania State University in the US. “And the impacts of that warming – unprecedented wildfires, superstorms and floods – are now plain for all to see. There has never been greater urgency.”
In December, the US president, Donald Trump, suggested cold weather in the eastern US undermined the evidence of climate change, a statement called “phenomenally dumb“ by climate scientist Dr Sarah Myhre.
Scientists said that the slight drop in global temperature in 2017 was unsurprising and that huge levels of carbon emissions are still being pumped out. “Global temperatures will continue to bob up and down from year to year, but the climate tide beneath them is rising fast,” said Prof David Reay, at the University of Edinburgh in the UK. 
“Despite our best efforts so far, global warming continues apace,” said Prof Martin Siegert, at Imperial College London. “This is yet another wake-up call to develop a zero carbon economy before it’s too late.” 
Dr Dann Mitchell, at the University of Bristol, said: “We are getting ever closer to the Paris agreement target of 1.5C which we are so desperately trying to avoid.”
Prof Stefan Rahmstorf said there had been a very significant increase in global temperature since the major El Niño seen in 1998: “In just 18 years, our greenhouse gas emissions have pushed up global temperature by a full 0.4C. At this rate the Paris goal of 1.5C will already be crossed in under two decades.”
The 2016 peak in global temperature caused by El Niño is over. That peak was similar to the 1998 peak, but at a 0.4 °C higher global temperature due to #GlobalWarming pic.twitter.com/F7aBZt2k2J
In Australia, the Climate Council chief executive, Amanda McKenzie, said: “The fingerprints of climate change were seen with extreme weather events across Australia in 2017. This data is yet another warning to the government to urgently slash Australia’s rising greenhouse gas levels in a bid to protect Australians from escalating extreme weather events.”
The temperature data is all compiled using many thousands of measurements from all continents and all oceans. Small differences between them largely result from how temperatures for the fast-warming but data-sparse polar regions are calculated.
The El Niño event in 2015-16 raised the annual average temperature for 2016 by 0.2C, but most scientists agree that both 2016 and 2015 would have been record hot years even without the El Niño. The 2017 global temperature was accurately predicted by the Met Office a year before, adding to confidence that scientists have a good understanding of the climate system.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/18/2017-was-the-hottest-year-on-record-without-el-nino-boost

If anyone's squirming, it ought to be you. You posted a link that patently contradicts what you keep telling us - first, that there was no warming for the majority of the last 20 years; and second, that climate predictions have failed miserably. I merely pointed that out. 
As for IPCC emission scenarios, you haven't factored in the much greater than expected reduction in emissions of halocarbons (which are potent GHGs) thanks to the great success of the Montreal Protocol. Also, your source (NOAA) is at the low end of observed warming trends, at 0.184 C per decade since 1990. Both GISTEMP and Berkeley are higher, at 0.194 C and 0.199 C per decade respectively.
So, while no one's claiming that climate models are perfect (particularly those from 30-odd years ago), they're doing pretty well.
As I've told you before, satellite data are problematic. They don't measure temperature directly but rather by microwaves that require complex analysis. Multiple major errors have been identified over the years, requiring significant corrections - far greater than the adjustments to surface temperatures that you often complain about. Most damning of all, the two major satellite series analyse essentially the same data, yet come up with very different results. In contrast, surface datasets use non-identical data, yet show good agreement.
In any event, the 1990 IPCC projections concerned surface warming, not atmospheric. The satellite datasets didn't exist back then.
BQEND
You cherry picked the last 20 years, not me, when did I say there was no warming in the last 20 years? Keep squirming. I demonstrated that we can all cherry pick if we want and showed you examples.

Also, your source (NOAA) is at the low end of observed warming trends, at 0.184 C per decade since 1990. Both GISTEMP and Berkeley are higher, at 0.194 C and 0.199 C per decade respectively.
So, while no one's claiming that climate models are perfect (particularly those from 30-odd years ago), they're doing pretty well.
As I've told you before, satellite data are problematic. They don't measure temperature directly but rather by microwaves that require complex analysis. Multiple major errors have been identified over the years, requiring significant corrections - far greater than the adjustments to surface temperatures that you often complain about. Most damning of all, the two major satellite series analyse essentially the same data, yet come up with very different results. In contrast, surface datasets use non-identical data, yet show good agreement.

Their featured business-as-usual (BAU) scenario assumed rapid growth of atmospheric CO2, reaching 418 ppm CO2 in 2016, compared to 404 ppm in observations. The FAR also assumed continued growth of atmospheric halocarbon concentrations much faster than has actually occurred.
BQEND
I don’t see anywhere in the IPCC FAR saying estimated emissions would be 418pmm by 2016 but let’s break it down. Since 1990 it’s risen by 51ppm where as IPCC Scenario A estimates (allegedly) a rise of 65ppm, so the observed change is 79% of the estimation in Scenario A, Scenario A suggests a rise of 0.3C\decade, 79% of 0.3 is 2.4C\decade, and what is the observed temperature rise from 1990 - 2016...........0.18C\decade, so even 2.4C\decade is a huge overestimation.

This article discussing the accuracy of climate models is worth a read. All five IPCC reports are included. The conclusion is that the models have done pretty well:
BQSTART
Climate models published since 1973 have generally been quite skillful in projecting future warming. While some were too low and some too high, they all show outcomes reasonably close to what has actually occurred, especially when discrepancies between predicted and actual CO2 concentrations and other climate forcings are taken into account. 
Models are far from perfect and will continue to be improved over time. They also show a fairly large range of future warming that cannot easily be narrowed using just the changes in climate that we have observed.
Nevertheless, the close match between projected and observed warming since 1970 suggests that estimates of future warming may prove similarly accurate.

Consider the initial capital spending required to replace all fossil fuel energy sources in use today with renewables*, let alone the ongoing maintenance of things like wind turbines. The sums dwarf the amount of money currently spent on fossil fuels; if they didn't, energy companies would be already adopting them without the need for government subsidies, because that way they could lower their production costs. Additionally, my understanding is that the carbon produced from nuclear (across the entire lifecycle) is also high, so if we're really to go carbon-neutral, we need to get rid of those, too. So where's our base capacity going to come from? Vast banks of batteries... all this stuff is wildly resource intensive. In fact, Google paid some engineers to look at how we could replace fossil fuels with renewables and the answer was.. we can't. At least not yet, at their current state of development.

BQSTART
RSS 3.3 (you know, the dataset that had to be modified because it wasn't following the Global warming party line)
BQEND
That's a bit rich, given that your own preferred satellite series is UAHv6 - in which warming was massively modified downward compared to its previous version. (Those sort of adjustments don't bother you at all, do they?)
BQSTART
By the way, the IPCC predicted 0.3C/decade
BQEND
It's been pointed out to you previously that this only applied to a scenario in which GHG emissions were greater than what have actually occurred. For the actual emissions since 1990, the best estimate of surface warming in the 1990 IPCC report was 0.2C per decade. Your own source and others confirm that warming from then to now has been very close to that projection.
 
BQSTART
when the data has to be 'adjusted' to match a theory there is a serious problem
BQEND
Even hardcore denialists acknowledge that temperature data must be adjusted to correct for things like equipment changes, site moves, changes in the time of day that measurements are made, etc. The procedures used to accomplish this are freely available, so anyone can pick holes in them and suggest specific changes to the methodology. But no one ever does. We both know why.
Satellite data are important but must be approached with caution, as they have had many errors identified over the years, requiring very significant modifications - far greater than any changes to the surface data.', u'recommendation_count': u'6', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1516708216000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u""it was n't following the global warming party line"", u'effect': u'that had to be modified'}], u'author_id': u'15902664', u'in_reply_to': u'111201688', u'id': u'111204260', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Knightmare26', u'text': u'Hi, PD!', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1516684403000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'13137767', u'in_reply_to': u'111153728', u'id': u'111191731', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Breeal', u'text': u'BQSTART
Your own source (again) confirms that recent warming has been about 0.2C per decade - as forecast by the IPCC more than a quarter of a century ago.
BQEND
Oh, are we allowed cherry pick? Because if we use RSS 3.3 (you know, the dataset that had to be modified because it wasn't following the Global warming party line) from 1995 - 2015 you get a rate of 0.04C/decade. By the way, the IPCC predicted 0.3C/decade, that's nearly 8 times the observed warming, it's very easy to cherry pick.

Lastly, can I (again) ask you to explain which steps in the temperature adjustment methodology are wrong, and how they should be changed?

Now - explain to us - what is ""an order of magnitude and how many order or magnitudes difference is there between the numbers for CH4 and CO2 - and what does this tell you about the instrumental quality of CO2 measurements? 
Just because a number sounds small - or big - do not let yourself get fooled by it. 
Some things could be just a single parsec as well. (You will know this if you promise to never think about a light-year as a unit of time or as a quantum-leap as a truly amazing leap in terms of distance). 
Science is for example happy here on earth to talk about a 2 Sverdrup change in volume transport. You may be used to litres or even gallons are good numbers for volume. And you can lift many many many litres or gallons when in need. So one Sverdrup does not sound so much. 
How about I telling you that Sverdrup is not just volume - but volume-transport. It is the movement of 1 million km^3 in a second (264,000,000 USgal/s) So when an ocean current drop with one Sv - it is a lot. Even if it sounds like something tiny. 
Please stop using the feeling that things sounds small is ""proving"" that things is small (in effect or impact of reality).

The answer is of course ""Painful death"". And it has nothing to do with temperature dropping with around 7 degrees per kilometer. Oh no - it is not the large change of temperature that will kill you. It is really not that cold on that peak. 
Let us talk millibars here. We are talking of a drop of only around 250 of them in change that cause your death. I mean - 0.025 bars difference causing death - while a cycles tyre is more than happy to stay perfectly fine while rapidly being deflated by 2000 millibar.

At the moments, you are only excelling in showing how low knowledge science deniers have - and that is kind of worth a price on these pages. 
I do not blame you - it is allowed to be less knowledgeable on topics. But then a good human being should search the knowledge, instead of spreading own misunderstandings. 
Hint (the plant in your living-room is breathing out CO2 during the night . We know because of science). You are also a carbon based life-form - though you work a bit different from plants. 
The global dry biomass of all humans living now is ca 100 million tons. 
The biomass of earth-worms (also breathing oxygen) is around 10-20 times larger. 
See a problem here with your argument - in comparing burning fossil fuel with carbon life? 
Hint - your fossil fuels once was breathing air too - carbon fixing life. That got buried. Like forests does today. 
Now we are burning decades of years worth of fossil rain-forest/swamp/bogs carbon capture every year. And we ask the living forests to soak it up every year. 
Plants do fantastic! They soak up about 25% of the extra carbon we introduce by restringing buried carbon every year. The ocean is working on high gear and put another 50% of the Co2 into solution (with it's known side effects)
My point is that science over the last 200 years has figured out in principle - from physics and chemistry and life-sciences worked out how this works to a pretty amazing level. Science has also been busy in the side-branch that measure it to an amazing level. So well that science started to model these things half a century ago. 
Trust me - science understood 50 years ago that carbon based life breathing out is not a source of increase in atmospheric CO2 in the carbon cycle. 
I am not really sure where to guide you to understand this better (I have a feeling you do not really search information of why science can know) - but if you are open minded - try https://skepticalscience.com/
The give simple information - and always with in depth links for those that doubt - so they can find why claims are made, just a hyperlink away. 
I would not be surprised if they have a well-linked article about why ""breathing"" is not adding CO2 to the atmosphere. 
Finally - here is a prediction made by climate scientists with models 18 years ago - compared to how it happened until 2017 was measured. 
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DT-4EzkX0AAG6Z9.jpg
Remember - models are not reality. Seems like science is guessing rather educated and well, would you not say? 
There is nothing ""leftish"" about physics. Just hard-core physics. I wish you on the right started to dare to understand it. I guess it makes many fear - since it is ruthless when you solve equations wrong. Political ideology is much nicer like this - as social science like ""perspectives"". Maybe that is why so many choose ideology instead of the nature of reality as a topic for study? And start to argue like politicians (or the ""swamp"", as it has been known) - instead of arguing with hard facts and deep understand that takes a decade or two to understand. 
I kind of like people who handle facts. One learn to be humble when sitting in at enough math, chem and physical exams until one is around 30 years old and after that venture into the world of discovering reality under the ideology of being proven wrong (the Principle of Falsifiability).', u'recommendation_count': u'8', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1516665515000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'science', u'effect': u'we know'}], u'author_id': u'4706143', u'in_reply_to': u'111184401', u'id': u'111187392', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'John Samuel', u'text': u'Thanks for a Google search guaranteed to bring out crackpots.

Lloyd’s will start to exclude coal from its investment strategy from 1 April. The definition of what is a coal company and the criteria for divestment will be set over the coming months. 
The firm has long been vocal about the need to battle climate change, with insurance one of the worst affected industries by hurricanes, wildfires and flooding in recent years.
The insurance market decided last month to implement a coal exclusion policy as part of a responsible investment strategy for the central mutual fund that sits behind every insurance policy written by the Lloyd’s market. 
Inga Beale, Lloyd’s of London chief executive, said: “That means that in the areas of our portfolio where we can directly influence investment decisions we will avoid investing in companies that are involved mainly in coal. 
“Is there more the insurance sector could be doing to help the world transition to a low-carbon economy by choosing sustainable or low-carbon stocks?”
Lloyd’s does not underwrite operations directly, but offers a marketplace to almost 90 syndicates of other insurers.
Lloyd’s has been slower to take action than others. Other big UK and European insurance companies, including Aviva, Allianz, Axa, Legal &amp; General, SCOR, Swiss Re and Zurich, have been shifting away from coal and other fossil fuels due to concerns about climate risks. About £15bn has been divested by insurers in the past two years, according to a recent report from Unfriend Coal Network, a global coalition of NGOs and campaigners including 350.org and Greenpeace. It said 15 companies – almost all in Europe – have fully or partially cut financial ties by selling holdings in coal companies and refusing to insure their operations.
France’s Axa was one of the first financial firms to reduce investments in coal in May 2015 and is still leading the way. It said last month it was ditching investments and ending insurance for controversial US oil pipelines. After being criticised by campaigners for applying a threshold of 50% of revenues to define coal companies, it lowered the threshold to 30%.
The Church of England has gone further, pulling out of investing in companies that make more than 10% of their revenues from thermal coal or oil from tar sands.
Analysis by the ClimateWise coalition of the world’s biggest insurers published in December 2016 found that more frequent extreme weather events were driving up uninsured losses and making some assets uninsurable. The report concluded that the “protection gap” – the difference between the costs of natural disasters and the amount insured – had quadrupled to $100bn (£79bn) a year since the 1980s.
Insurance companies are perhaps also mindful of the danger that they could suffer a huge loss if their investments in fossil fuel companies were rendered worthless by action on climate change, as the Bank of England warned in 2015. However, some banks are still investing in coal plants, according to research from campaign groups.
Beale told the Guardian that she would be discussing the group’s new investment strategy at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos this week.
Climate change and what investors can do will feature prominently at the meeting of political and business leaders. Beale said: “It goes beyond climate change. The broader issue is how we clean up the planet.”

EV drivers are not paying the true costs of their vehicles (partly because of ZEV credits which is not my point here) but partly because most roadway bridge and tunnel infrastructure costs are paid for out of gasoline revenue taxes. At least here in the US.
BQEND
Incorrect.
In the US, vehicle taxes including fuel cover about 48% of the road infrastructure costs.
This ignores the hidden costs as well.
In the UK, the revenue raised from VED and fuel taxation is pooled in with general taxation and has been since 1937. Only a third of it is effectively used to maintain the road infrastructure (which explains the p!ss poor state of the roads...as a councillor I regularly have to explain this to people), the rest is spent elsewhere.
BQSTART
So as EV's become cheaper and start replacing ICEs on the road, gas tax revenues from ICEs will plummet and the government will start looking for an alternative tax revenue stream.
BQEND
On the other hand, there will be a reduction in external costs associated with fossil fuel pollution, like NOx health issues.
BQSTART
And they might decide to transfer that cost back to the costs of buying or running an EV vehicle.
BQEND
There are only two things that are inevitable in life: death; and taxes.
The reduction in taxation for EVs is to help kickstart a new industry, and reduce the external costs of fossil fuel consumption.

This is a bit like saying someone is a real hard core dieter, as they have cut down from three double cheese burgers, to two double cheese burgers and one ordinary cheeseburger.

This is a nutty suggestion. Fossil fuel companies dominate the top ranks of the global lists by value, unlike environmental NGOs which don't get a look in.
Shale gas is opposed outside (and inside) the US due to the many other environmental concerns, as well as the simple fact it is still a fossil fuel. 
Shale gas in the US has enjoyed both lax environmental laws, and until recently the inability of the producers to ship it abroad, so effectively they have had a captive market.

I agree. But I suspect it's more likely to be hedge investing, not commitment investing. And some of that R&D might not be purely in support of breakthrough technologies in EV manufacturing.

There is a fundamental difference between electing and hiring, and the difference is this (my definition, but I am sure it won't be difficult to find more authoritative sources) :
- Electing means to choose someone who can exercise power over the electorate. By election, the people agree that the person elected can a) exercise power over them or b) represents them in a body that can exercise power over them : government
- Hiring means to take on a worker who agrees to be bound - within reason/the law - to work as directed.

That's okay, let me explain. That comment was in reference to automaker's marketing departments. They're very bullish (wishful thinking) on the prospect of more EV car sales. But it's the Automaker Sales Departments that are reporting that they just aren't seeing all this predicted command.
One thing to keep in mind is a little understood concept called Zero Emission Vehicles credits. California and 9 other states have adopted this concept which allows a company like Tesla to sell offset credits for automakers turning out ICE vehicles. It's very lucrative, and is the only commodity Tesla sells that makes a profit. There are millions of dollars annually in revenues to be gained from these credits so the market is incentivized to ""predict"" greater and greater demand for the EVs that produce the,

Oh dear, squirm much? I found your 2005 paper, this is what it says – “
This index is similar to the ‘accumulated cyclone energy’ (ACE) index19, defined as the sum of the squares of the maximum wind speed over the period containing hurricane-force winds.” So it’s similar ACE, if you look at figure 1 in your paper it actually shows a drop from 1930 – Mid 1990’s, followed by spike up to 2005. Now look at the ACE
graph, it shows the exact same spike followed by a drop off, but the long term trend is flat, ooops.

Fair enough Bernie. But I've shown that a whole load of serious institutions, including oil companies, believe there will be rapid adoption of EVs.

You're banging your head against a brick wall, I fear.
As an aside.
I was recently dabbling with wireless network extenders, and I found one that suddenly failed to function as it previously did. A factory reset/reinstall failed to correct the problem. The main wireless switch declared the correct configuration. Everything looked as if nothing had changed. But something had.
So I reconfigured the main switch with the same settings (select 'configuration', make no configuration changes, select 'apply') and let the underlying script run. Everything started to function as before. The displayed configuration was the same as it was before.

You're the only person talking about tropical cyclones or hurricanes becoming more frequent. 
The peer reviewed paper that I referred to that was published in a proper scientific journal examined the destructiveness of tropical cyclones or hurricanes based on solid data from all over the world, and found that tropical cyclones or hurricanes had become more destructive over the 30 year period from the early 1970s to the early years of this century.
In reference to tropical cyclones or hurricanes over that that 30 year period, the author said that ""the expected increase in PDI"" (Potential Destructiveness Index) ""is around 40%, taking into account the increased duration of events. This is still short of the observed increase.""
This 13 year old paper still stands and the graphs you linked to of tropical cyclone or hurricane frequencies and Accumulated Cyclone Energy don't contradict its findings in any way. The absence of any landfalling tropical cyclones over the non-tropical US mainland over a short time period during negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation means nothing as it would be expected to happen due to randomness with such a short temporal sample.

No country and no sector in the US is decarbonizing quickly enough. When the article says ""American power generation is already rapidly decarbonizing, "" I'd characterize it as about 1/10th the speed we can and need to do it, at best.

That means it needs to be done in less than 7 years, with enough efficiency and extra generation built in to cover electrified transport, heating and other primary energy (industrial processes, etc.) so we reduce our GHG emissions by at least 90% in that time. (reforestation and the transformation of agriculture will also have to be done enough in that time to reduce the same amount.) The parts that seem harder now--concrete and steel, trans-ocean transport, etc.--should be solved by that time and can be reduced shortly after. Some changes will be slower--changing over the last of the vehicle stock, inefficient housing stock, and landscape changes (working and living closer, eg).

And finally the task? You're placing the cart before the horse. The task is emission reductions in accordance with science and equity, NOT maintenance of our lifestyles. Science says that if countries follow INDCs to 2030, then post 2030 emissions need reduce at 5.5%/yr, assuming SLCPs were tackled starting in 2020. There is no proof nor confidence in capitalism being able to manage -5.5%/yr, none whatsoever. And even if that could be managed, there's a 15% chance warming will be above 3C, WAIS' collapse will still accelerate, the Arctic will be still be ice free in the summer by 2040 and warming may end up beyond 4C due to other tipping points such as methane release from melting permafrost and Arctic seabeds.

Noting changes thus far to the cryosphere, coral reefs, the dramatic increase in extreme heat and increase in monetary cost of natural disasters, it's absurd to think we can almost double warming the current warming of 1.1C and remain within a supposed ""guardrail"". 2C is BS.
According to Mann, if one factors in aerosols, 2C corresponds to 405 ppm CO2. And what is the current value of global mean CO2? Yep! 405 ppm. LMAO @ the Guardian's 2C BS.

But where are people's dysfunctional heads at? I comment about a safe climate at the end of a climate change associated article and the reply is Huh? FFS. Mass ignorance.
Anyhow, here have some quotes from a published paper:""In the 1960s summertime extremes of more than three standard deviations warmer than climatology were practically absent, covering less than 1% of the Earth’s land surface.""
""By 2020, the global land area experiencing temperatures of 3-sigma or more will have doubled (covering ∼10%) and by 2040 quadrupled (covering ∼20%). Over the same period, more-extreme events will emerge: 5-sigma events, which are now essentially absent, will cover a small but significant fraction (∼3%) of the global land surface by 2040. These near-term projections are practically independent of emission scenario.""
""Under the low emission scenario (RCP2.6), the number of extremes stabilizes at 2040-levels. This implies that in the tropics, including South America, western Africa and the Maritime continent, 3-sigma heat effectively becomes the new norm (about 50% of summer months, see figure 3) and 5-sigma heat will be common (about 20% of summer months). In the extra-tropics, 3-sigma extremes will also increase, occurring for example in western Europe in roughly 20% of summer months, but 5-sigma events will still be essentially absent. In the southern hemisphere, the increase in monthly heat extremes is essentially independent on the season.""

The Trump Administration has taken every possible step to undo the Obama Administration’s climate policies, including announcing that America will be the only world country to withdraw from the Paris agreement, and trying to repeal the Clean Power Plan.
In 2020, the next American president will have to make up the lost ground and come up with a plan to rapidly accelerate the country’s transition away from fossil fuels. Currently, transportation and power generation each account for about 30% of US greenhouse gas emissions, so those sectors represent the prime targets for pollution cuts. 
But the power sector is already rapidly decarbonizing because coal can’t compete in the marketplace. In some regions, new wind and solar with battery storage have already become cheaper than continuing to operate existing coal plants, and the International Renewable Energy Agency has concluded that by 2020, “all the renewable power generation technologies that are now in commercial use are expected to fall within the fossil fuel-fired cost range.”
American power sector carbon emissions had exceeded those from transportation from 1979 until 2016. But because coal power plants have rapidly been replaced by natural gas and renewables, US power sector emissions have fallen rapidly since 2007, and are now below 1989 levels. US carbon pollution from transportation, on the other hand, has been on the rise since 2012. It remains higher than in 2000, nearly 20% higher than 1989 levels, and has surpassed power sector emissions.
The transportation sector thus represents a prime target for cutting American carbon pollution, with light-duty (passenger) vehicles accounting for 60% of those emissions and medium- and heavy-duty trucks accounting for a further 23%. These emissions can be significantly reduced by transitioning from the internal combustion engine to electric vehicles (EVs).
Comparing carbon pollution between gasoline- and diesel-powered cars to those of electric vehicles can be tricky, because it depends on the source of the electricity generation, which varies from place to place. However, based on the average US power grid mix, the Department of Energy estimates that EV carbon pollution is 60% lower than that of gasoline-powered cars. In a clean energy state like California, it’s 80% lower. And even in a state like Wyoming, which gets 96% of its electricity from coal, EV carbon emissions are still 17% lower than gasoline-powered cars (although they’re 50% higher than hybrids).
Moreover, EV carbon emissions will only decline as clean energy continues to expand due to its aforementioned rapidly-falling costs and widespread adoption. At some point, the US will inevitably implement climate legislation that includes a price on carbon pollution, which will accelerate clean energy deployment faster yet.
Cost and battery range have been the two barriers to widespread EV adoption. However, both have rapidly improved over the past several years. In 1996, the GM EV1 was the first modern mass-produced EV. It had a range of approximately 100 miles (160 km) per charge at an estimated price of $34,000 ($50,000 in 2016 dollars), which amounts to $500 per mile of range. Tesla produced its first car – the Roadster – starting in 2008, with a range of 244 miles (393 km) at a price of around $100,000 ($410 per mile). Nissan first sold its electric Leaf in 2011 for $33,600 with an 84-mile (135 km) range ($400 per mile).
All three companies have since dramatically improved their EV prices per mile of range. The 2018 Nissan Leaf sells for $30,000 with a 150-mile (240 km) range ($200 per mile). The Tesla Model 3 will sell for $35,000 with a 220-mile (354 km) range or $44,000 with a 310-mile (500 km) range ($140–160 per mile). The Chevy Bolt sells for $36,620 with a 238-mile (383 km) range ($154 per mile).
The price per mile of range has fallen by about 60% in less than a decade, excluding tax credits (which survived the recent tax bill) and additional state incentives that make EVs more affordable to consumers. Crucially, with the introduction of the Chevy Bolt and Tesla Model 3, ranges of reasonably affordable EVs have more than doubled over the past few years. These trends will continue – carmakers have invested $90 billion in batteries and EVs, and most of the major auto companies plan to roll out numerous new EV and hybrid models over the next few years.
EVs also have the benefit of lower fuel and maintenance costs. In the US, fueling a 30 mpg sedan costs twice as much as charging a comparable EV, on average. For the average American driver (13,500 miles per year), the switch would amount to about $600 in fuel savings per year. And EVs have fewer fluids to change and moving parts to break; maintenance rarely amounts to more than rotating tires and changing air filters.
American power generation is already rapidly decarbonizing. To fulfill its responsibility for helping the world stay below the 2°C temperature guardrail, the transportation sector is America’s next clear big target. It’s an area where the country’s carbon pollution hasn’t improved since the turn of the century, and where rapidly improving technology can make a big difference. All major automakers recognize that the shift from fossil-fueled cars to EV is inevitable, and are investing accordingly.
A price on carbon pollution would accelerate the transition.

In an open letter addressed to Justin Trudeau, more than 250 scientists from 22 countries highlight their concern over the imminent end of the C$35m Climate Change and Atmospheric Research program. 
Launched in 2012, the program funded seven research networks that explored issues such as the impact of aerosols, changing sea ice and snow cover, as well as atmospheric temperatures in the high Arctic. 
Much of the research emerging from the program was focused on Canada’s Arctic, yielding data sets that were used around the world by scientists seeking to better understand climate change and its impacts. 
The government’s decision came as a surprise to many in Canada, said Dan Weaver of Evidence For Democracy, the research advocacy group who published the letter on Monday. 
“The government has taken great effort to engage with policies around climate and climate education, green energy and a lot of these great things,” he said. “But somehow along the way, the support for the atmospheric science – the underlying science of the issue – has been overlooked.”
Scientists in Canada first sounded the alarm last spring after noticing that the 2017 federal budget did not include funding for the program. Amid public outcry the government said it would extend funding for one of the program’s projects; a one-of-a-kind research lab located some 1,100 km from the North Pole. 
While the Polar Environment Atmospheric Research Laboratory now has funding until the fall of 2019, the six remaining projects are bracing for their funding to dry up in March. 
The loss of these projects will be felt globally, says the letter. Canada’s scientists are uniquely positioned to research the Arctic, arguably the world’s most critical region when it comes to quantifying how and why the climate is changing, said signatory Gloria Manney, a senior research scientist at the Northwest Research Associates in the US. “Continuous, stable funding support for Canadian atmospheric and climate science is thus crucial to advancing understanding of our planet.”
As the Trump administration seeks to devalue climate science, Canada’s commitment to climate research is needed now more than ever, said signatory Benjamin D Santer, a senior climate researcher at the US Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories. “The world is looking to Canada for political leadership that the United States is currently unable to provide,” he said.
While Trudeau government’s stated support for climate science and the Paris climate agreement has been encouraging, “such support cannot be limited to fine-sounding words”, he said. “It must be backed by a real commitment to preserve and sustain the unique climate measurement, climate monitoring, and climate modeling capabilities that Canada possesses.”
In response to the letter, Canada’s minister of science pointed to the additional C$70m her government had set aside for climate research in the last budget, adding to the C$37m provided annually by federal research granting councils. “We are doing more to combat climate change than any Canadian federal government in history,” Kirsty Duncan said in a statement. “Our government will continue to support and invest in the actions necessary to address climate change.” 
Weaver welcomed these efforts, but he said they should be paired with long term funding for research. “If Canada isn’t contributing this key piece of the puzzle, no one else can,” he said.
“The Trudeau government is taking concrete actions on climate and science in a variety of ways, but it’s missing a critical piece,” he said. “And that’s what this is all about – ensuring that this gap is filled in some way or another.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/22/canada-climate-science-faces-looming-crisis

They may run it on some cores of a super-computer when using it for paleoclimate simulations - though. 
Though this is all fun - it is also valuable. Models are often tested by applying them to very strange conditions. To check how robust the core physics is. 
As noted in the paper - the model needed a bit of smoothing because it overshot dynamics in the southern ocean (not so strange). 
Remember - several climate model cores have been transposed to Mars, for example. And it is useful for many reasons - as it indicates how sensitive of the compiled code to changed boundary conditions. 
Remember also - these models are used on our own home planet - to assess the effect of the relatively fast uplift of the Himalayas and the Tibetan plateu over the last ca 50 million years. 
In other words - when one use climate models to look at the PE thermal Maximum ca 55 million years - the earth would have looked ""alien"" to an astronaut time-traveller. 
So beside being ""fun"" - it is also important in ""reality"". 
All this comes down to the very core scientific principle of physics being universal. Hence - gravity should work on the moon as well as on Earth as well as on Jupiter, for example.

A lot of time is spend with models running on a water-planet, for example - where the fluid dynamics of the atmosphere and the ocean are free to respond to each other without the messy effects of topography and bathymetry. 
Secondly - modellers reshape the global landscape all the time. 
For example, paleoclimatology and isostatic analyses say that there is a 4000 meter thick huge ice-sheet in USA 25,000 years ago - that also lowered global sea-level by 120 meters - created no ocean circulation across the Bering Strait. The UK is also part of the European main-land - has a small isolated ice-sheet in the north - in addition to the two main ice-sheets located in Europe and in Scandinavia - etc etc etc. 
So the fun fact one does with all these data is that one can for example go and change one of these things/leave other things out - and see what makes the biggest impact on the dynamics. Fair to say - that big thick thing in North America is high enough to push the jet-stream, for example. So what one can do is to study if it is the change in topography that is more important - or if it is the change in albedo that is most important - for example. 
Going even further back - it is interesting that the big ice-cycles over the last 2.5 million years (earlier called ""quarternary"" coincide with the creation of a land-bridge between the North and South America. In the process shutting down water exchange between the Pacific and Atlantic just north of Equator. Something that is quite important - because it disrupt the north-south pole-to pole ocean circulation (the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. Hence models are excellent in analysing what happens when one gradually (over millions of year) shawl the ocean where Latin America is at present. 
Going even further back - it is know that Antarctica started to grow substantially associated with the opening of the Drake Passage between South America and the Antarctic continent. So one obviously want to look at the dynamics associated with the ocean can start to run circum-Antarctic - compared to what happened when it could not do this. 
Now - to model this one also have to reconfigure the continents (North Atlantic was still opening at the time - it was a huge shallow ocean-connection between the North Atlantic and the Indian Ocean (not ""Mediterranean"" but the final stages of the Tethys ocean closing) while India was loading up to crash into Asia and start to lift up the Tibetan plateau to its current 4-5 km above sea-level - and fold up the Himalayan mountains to reach 8 km altitude. 
This is no different than to shape continents as outlined by a fantasy book for fun - to see how the physics would work on such a hypothetical configuration (and assuming that the physics in GoT is not massively influenced by magic). 
We have to acknowledge that the maps of GoT are not global though. It is a bit like making a climate model from a 13th century map - not knowing about America, such that the Pacific Ocean stretched from China - all the way to Europe. If we wish to be nerdy. 
I find this as a lovely example of how models are used to make sense of geological/paleoclimatic findings in a dynamical context (it is really difficult to reconstruct the dynamics from paleo-climatology - instead one have static patterns that one can backtrack to a dynamical context - and that is tested with models - to shed light on the total constellation of stuff. One can even use the models to start looking for evidence at some location - because models say that ""in this situation it should be very wet/dry/warm/cold/windy (etc) in this region"" - so geologists/palaeontologists/paleaoclimatologists etc can be guided to look for such parameters in the region from the time in question.

In regards to climate models, they are checked against what has happened in the past, can they replicate it? And they are checked against modern observations of changes, can they replicate current changes?
The better the models are able to replicate climate history and modern observations, the more confidence we have when we run them out into the future and make projections.
In the 19th century a chemist calculated, with a pencil and paper, the rise in global temperature we would see if we were to double preindustrial CO2 and his result was in the ballpark of what modern supercomputers come up with.
Regarding ice sheet models, in 2016 DeConto and Pollard, following Alley's advice, added some previously under appreciated physics into their ice sheet model and were finally able to replicate the high sea levels of the Pliocene and accurately track current observed glacial flow rates.

Furthermore, the model also sheds light on many mysteries surrounding the climate of the lands of Westeros and Essos – including the likely hibernation zones of White Walkers and the similarities between The Wall and Lapland.
You might well wonder why I and other climate science colleagues from Cardiff and Southampton universities have recently spent some of our spare time creating climate models of a fictional world.
After all, is it helpful to know, as the model suggests, that due to the nature of the winds between Westeros and Essos, an attack on Westeros (whether by dragons, ships or both), would probably come via the south (from Dorne or Storm’s End) in winter, but more northerly (Vale of Arryn, or direct to King’s Landing), in summer?
And what of the revelation from the model that that the Iron Fleet’s naval prowess can be explained by very strong winds in the region of the Iron Islands? Or the knowledge that the temperatures predicted by the model indicate that in summer, the only places north of The Wall that are below freezing are the high-altitude regions of the Frostfangs, perhaps indicating the likely summer hibernation zones of White Walkers? 
Apart from the fact that we found it fascinating to flesh out this fictional world with our model, it’s also a nice way to illustrate how climate models work and to highlight some fascinating climate science going on in the real world. For example, the SWEET project is currently using novel techniques to reconstruct the climate of super-warm states of Earth’s past – which in turn will help to test state-of- the-art climate models under conditions of high atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations similar to those expected by the end of this century.
In our Game of Thrones model, by comparing the climate of places in the real world with those predicted by the model for the world of Game of Thrones, it could be seen that The Wall, where the land of Westeros is guarded from the White Walkers, has a climate in winter similar to that of Lapland. In contrast Casterly Rock, the stronghold of the scheming Lannisters, has a climate similar to that of Houston, Texas, and Changsha in China.
But how did we create the model in the first place? When carrying out this “work”, which is written up in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of King’s Landing and the Twitter account of @ClimateSamwell, the first step was to modify a “normal” climate model so that the land and ocean was laid out as in the maps provided by George RR Martin in the Game of Thrones books.
 
The model was then modified to have the characteristic “extended seasons”, which the books and TV series describe as lasting several years. In the real world, the tilt of the spinning axis of the planet is at a fixed angle throughout the year, resulting in our characteristic four seasons. One way that seasons can be made to last longer is to allow this tilt of the spinning axis to change throughout the year, so that the Earth “tumbles” on its axis – a bit like a spinning top. If the Earth tumbles exactly once in a single year, then the spin axis always points towards (or away) from the sun, and the winter (or summer) is then permanent.
Interestingly, a very similar tumble – but occurring on much longer timescales of tens of thousands of years – causes major changes to the climate of our own planet. For example, 6,000 years ago it resulted in plants in the middle of what is today’s Sahara desert, and contributed to the ice age cycle that caused much of the UK to be covered in thick ice 20,000 years ago.
We also modelled the global warming that would occur if concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere were to be doubled, perhaps due to increases in CO2 and methane emissions from dragons and the excessive use of wildfire. The model estimates a global warming of 2.1C for a doubling of CO2 in the world of Game of Thrones. 
The work illustrates that because climate models are based on fundamental scientific processes – many of which have been known since the days of Isaac Newton – they are able not only to simulate the climate of the modern Earth, but can also be easily adapted to simulate any planet past, present, future, or imagined, as long as the underlying continental positions and greenhouse gas concentrations are known. 
Furthermore – and this is what I do in my “day job” – for some super-warm time periods in Earth’s past, there is geological data available that indicates what the climate actually was like, so we are able to test the climate models under high carbon dioxide conditions, similar to those we might expect by the end of this century if we continue emitting greenhouse gases at the current rate. 
Such testing of climate models under super-warm greenhouse conditions is crucial if we are to have confidence in their predictions of the future – either for Earth or Westeros.

Blended finance is the term given to the use of public or philanthropic capital to spur private sector investment in projects aimed at achieving the sustainable development goals. Already, this market is worth about $50bn globally, but experts said on Tuesday this sum could double within the next three to four years.
In a report to be presented on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, the Business and Sustainable Development Commission found that private sector investors could take advantage of blended finance to gain access to rapidly growing markets in the developing world.
The commission has set up a taskforce specifically to consider blended finance and how to encourage growth in the sector. In its report, the taskforce found that there was great fragmentation across the market and called for public and private investors to pool their resources to create more giant funds, worth more than £1bn each, to take over from the smaller funds, of about $100m in size, which currently dominate the blended finance landscape.
There would still be a place for smaller funds, the taskforce said, but the creation of very large finance vehicles would facilitate bigger projects than are currently possible.
Lord Malloch-Brown, the former UK diplomat who chairs the commission, said: “Action is needed end-to-end across the whole investment system to scale up the use of blended finance, if we are serious about closing the funding gap for the sustainable development goals.”
He said gaining more private capital would be essential to achieving the sustainable development goals, especially regarding infrastructure in emerging economies.
The commission found that the market for blended finance had already doubled in size in the last five years, and that countries in the developing world wishing to take advantage of the funds available should prioritise investment in infrastructure that would increase resilience to climate change and provide environmentally sound economic development.
The group estimated that about $6tn a year would be needed to meet the sustainable development goals fully, and that a large proportion of this could be met by blended finance, if the market for the latter is spurred on by governments and companies.
Jeremy Oppenheim, founder of Systemiq, a financial institution focusing on sustainable development, and programme director at the Business and Sustainable Development Commission, said private sector banks and other financial institutions could benefit by pooling their resources with organisations from the public sector, such as development banks.
“There is a window of opportunity for institutional investors to increase their exposure to emerging markets infrastructure by taking advantage of the risk mitigation offered by blended finance,” said Oppenheim. “Momentum is growing – it is possible that the blended finance market could double again in the next three to four years.”
The paper produced by the taskforce, entitled Better Finance, Better World, is now open to consultation, which will be completed by the middle of March. After that, a report taking the responses to the consultation into account will be produced at the April meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.
The Business and Sustainable Development Commission was set up to further the sustainable development goals, and is funded by public sector organisations including the UN and World Bank, philanthropic bodies such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and private sector companies including Unilever.
The sustainable development goals were adopted in 2015 by the UN, and include goals on ending poverty, protecting the planet and its resources, and ensure the long-term prosperity of humanity. All of the goals included in the package are supposed to be met by 2030.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/23/blended-finance-is-key-to-achieving-global-sustainability-goals-says-report

I wrote no such thing John. There very definitely are scientists who accept the AGW hypothesis. It's not clear to me why they do since there's no emprical evidence to support it and all of the models based on it fail to predict. But there are certainly some scientists who accept and even champion the hypothesis. There are many who don't. Quite a few actually. 
Climate scientists themselves aren't unanimus on the subject by a long shot. If you look at the most recent surveys performed (see: ""The Bray and von Storch 5th International Survey of Climate Scientists 2015/2016"", there may be a more recent one but that's what I have), you'll find only 47% of scientists working in the field strongly agree that climate is being effected by human activity. If you include those that somewhat agree, mildly agree, etc. you can get to a significant fraction, but only 47% appear positive about it.
When you go outside the field, the fraction who strongly agree drops sharply. 
Multiple letters have been written on the subject, mostly by people who's expertise is in statistics and design of experiments. I believe the most famous is the one written by Steve McIntyre, a statistician who took issue with the methods used by Mann et al. to construct the infamous ""hockey stick"". McIntyre has his own criticisms and I'm not entirely familiar with them so I can't say I support them or not, but the letter is quite famous, I'm surprised you aren't familiar with it.
I have written letters and also engaged in public debate with some scientists involved in the field, I've summarized my criticisms fairly well in these transactions. My background is measurement and my criticisms are in that area. I find many of the measures used to be highly speculative at best, some are downright wrong and I feel confident in that assessment. Others have reviewed my criticisms and I've yet to hear a substantial defense.

It also leads to stratospheric cooling which is also observed.

Accuracy? Precision? How do you know these things?
I'll give you an example; dendrochronology, the practice of scrying conditions many many years ago based on tree rings, has been calibrated by comparing measures obtained using the technique with modern instrument readings over the time those readings are available. They're based on empirical regression models.
But we all know one thing for certain; it's never valid to extrapolate from an empirical model. It's a truism that's been beaten into our heads so completely that should we ever attempt it, it's likely various body parts would shrivel up and fall off.
But that's exactly what dendrochronologists (and other members of the class of scientists who attempt to see into the deep past with their crystal balls) are doing. In general, the further back in time you look, the less accurate and precise your vision. This holds true for every known method of measuring and dating past events.

It's impossible to make that claim so I won't even bother asking for a reference.
The proxy measures of tropospheric temperatures available prior to the invention of the thermometer (~400 years ago) don't have the temporal resolution to detect high frequency changes occurring over a 50 year time period. The data simply don't exist and can't. To make a sweeping statement to the effect ""climate has warmed at a rate faster than anything seen"" is complete nonsense, no one was standing around with a thermometer taking notes 2000 years ago.

the CO2 levels rise - after an oceanic timelag of 800 years
BQEND
Only in one geological context.
That lag is seen in cores from ice sheets, specifically as glacial stages end, and it's clear the initial warming was due to astronomical cycles.
That warming drove CO2 out of oceans.
This CO2 then boosted the warming - most of the warming that changes glacial stages into interglacials comes from that CO2 in the second phase.
The current situation is different, because most of the extra CO2 now comes from burning carbon-rich fuels.
We're not currently coming out of a glacial stage, and the astronomical cycles are in a different phase at present.
I've seen this misunderstood over and over again, because it's quoted by people who don't understand the geological context.
The MWP has nothing to do with this.

""These glaciers were almost just as big during the Medieval Warm Period as they were during the Little Ice Age in the Baffin Bay and Labrador Sea region,"" Young said. ""It probably wasn't all that warm during the Medieval Warm Period.""

The Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age were concepts introduced about 50 years ago by early climate researchers, particularly Hubert Lamb, based on evidence available at that time, but the more they are investigated the more ephemeral they become.
Various sources give different dates for the start and end of the LIA, for example, and it's increasingly disputed that it was a global event.
Many researchers now think the whole concept of the 'Little Ice Age' is misleading as the changes were small-scale and seasonal.
For example, true ice ages involve snow remaining throughout summers across large areas, which didn't happen during the so-called Little Ice Age.
Glacial inception requires summer temperatures in the northern hemisphere to be low enough for snow to build up year on year, starting mainly on north-facing slopes of mountain ranges.

We have no such reliable models of climate, just as we don't have predictive models of dynamic fluids. In general we have difficulties with predicting the behavior of any system of differential equations, which is the principal reason none of even the most recent batch of climate models (the CMIP-5 set) have been able to predict the behavior of climate, and have progressively diverge from observation over the past several decades to the extent actual observation no longer falls within the 95% confidence limits of those models. The IPCC itself have admitted that it's currently not possible to accurately model climate.

Russell Coope actually had trouble believing the results of his first investigations using fossil beetles, because like all geologists he'd been taught the Principle of Uniformitarianism.
Uniformitarianism became a key paradigm in geology slightly over 200 years ago.
Uniformitarianism suggested that stability was the norm, and that all changes are geologically slow - of course, uniformitarianism was a paradigm shift from the concept of Catastrophism, which was based on biblical concepts such as the Noachian Flood.
Coope and others discovered that uniformitarianism is only part of the story.
The clues were actually always there in the geological record, in the form of the clear cut-offs that provide a reason to divide the geological column into eras and periods.

""Below that value"" of ""180 ppm CO2 even the most hardy plants die."" 
Provide a reference to a peer reviewed scientific paper published in a proper scientific journal showing that to be the case. 
Note that atmospheric CO2 has never got below 190 ppm at any time in the Earth's history and at 400 ppm there is no danger of atmospheric CO2 at 180 ppm occurring any time soon.
Commercial greenhouses grow rainforest vines such as cucumbers which are specially adapted to grow during the high levels of local atmospheric CO2 found at nightin tropical and warn subtropical rainforest due to the level level of metabolic activity from plants, animals and decomposers. Most of our food plants do not come from such environments and either reduce or have no increase in their yield with increasing levels of atmospheric CO2.
Photographs of seasonally arid areas show an increase in leaf cover during wetter times. This could well be a adaptation of desert plants have to the increased seasonality produced by warming - wetter wet seasons and ENSO phase years and drier drier seasons and opposite ENSO phase years. From the point of view of pastoralists in such regions the increased variability in feed availability makes stock management more difficult.

The real situation, of course, is that the quoted 'sea level' for various localities is actually 'relative sea level' -in relation to the land. Land level varies, because we are living on a number of mobile tectonic plates which make up the surface of the globe. The substructure beneath these plates behaves like a very viscous liquid. Where two plates collide, one is forced under the other, causing land level changes. 
The maximum change of level need not be at the place of subduction - which might be under water - because the tilting effect can extend for very long distances.

Alarmists always roll out Miami as example of SLR, but it’s been debunked so much it’s ridiculous. 
So Miami is not spending more money on flood defences ?
Miami is not enacting new laws on planning ?
“Climate change is the biggest challenge for Miami and we need to think outside the box, to come up with innovative solutions that may not be so obvious at first,” said Tomás Regalado, the Miami city mayor.
Let's try Boston, instead.
Amazing how all these places are experiencing highest tides recorded, changing planning laws and spending on sea defences. It's almost like something has changed.
BQEND
The global sea level is rising naturally at the rate of about 1.8mm/year according to NOAA, it makes sense to plan for it. Cities have higher rates of SLR than less densely populated area, this is expected. Boston has a rate of 2.8mm/year but just up the coast in Seavey island it’s only 1.76, exactly what NOAA says the long term trend is. And Boston recorded its highest tide in nearly 100 years, so the high tide was higher 100 years ago! What a complete chancer.

It says it “supports scientist who sweats for the real innovation &amp; discovery”.
If that’s a little too sweaty for you, then how about another new journal, also called the International Journal of Earth and Environmental Sciences?
Or, if you’re a discerning (and sweaty) scientist looking for a publisher that “endeavours to provide a notable and discern forum to publish” then maybe the International Journal of Research in Earth and Environmental Sciences is the notable forum for you?
No? Just one more. There’s also the International Journal of Environmental Sciences which “expecpt high quality research articles” that are free from plagiarism, but maybe not typos. 
These journals, and hundreds more like them, are mostly based in the Indian subcontinent or China and are part of a ballooning online industry offering to give academics a place to publish their work in return for a fee and minimal, if any, quality control.
Some have been identified as “predatory” because of the way they target academics, often through spam emails, without properly disclosing fees or claiming to provide a peer review service that would give their research the scrutiny needed. 
Journals that are “open access” make their money by charging academics or institutions a fee for peer reviewing and checking submitted academic manuscripts, and then publishing them. There are many reputable publishers working this way.
But this murky world has a predator of its own – climate science deniers looking to take advantage of the questionable quality controls in return for getting their work published in what the publishers claim are “peer-reviewed journals” but that, in reality, are not.
One climate science denier has targeted at least six journals for his research claiming that sea levels around Fiji and other Pacific islands are not rising. 
[None of the research] would have passed the reviewing process for more reputable journals
The author of the research, Dr Nils-Axel Mörner, has acknowledged that the work was paid for by the CO2 Coalition, a climate science denial group that has links to the US president Donald Trump’s administration (coalition member Kathleen Hartnett-White is Trump’s pick to head the White House Council on Environmental Quality and a director, Prof Will Happer, has been touted as a potential chief science adviser to the president). 
According to Prof Kurt Lambeck, a geophysicist and sea level expert at the Australian National University, none of the research “would have passed the reviewing process for more reputable journals”.
One journal targeted by Mörner was the Bangalore-based International Journal of Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences which describes its mission thus: “We encourage authors, who always have shown more interest to publish his work in the prestigious journals, and avail them the freely to the scientific community.”
Another of the publishers used by Mörner, known as Juniper Publishers, was one of those to be caught in a hoax in 2017 when it accepted a “Dr Doll” on to its editorial board. Dr Doll was a fake veterinary surgeon created by Curtin University’s Prof Mike Daube with a profile based on his dog, a Staffordshire terrier.
Daube told the Huffington Post he had orchestrated the hoax “to expose shams of this kind, which prey on the gullible, especially young or naive academics and those from developing countries”.
The US government’s Federal Trade Commission has brought deception charges against one of the world’s biggest “open access” publishers, Omics International. The FTC has accused the Hyderabad-based Omics Group of what amounts to deceptive marketing practices among the more than 700 “open access” journals it publishes and the 3,000 “conferences” it organises.
Among the accusations, the FTC alleges that Omics fails to carry out genuine peer review, uses the names of academics without their consent and uses other academics names to promote conferences when those academics have not agreed to appear. Omics has denied all charges. 
Omics also took on a climate science denier to be the editor-in-chief of its journal Environment Pollution and Climate Change, which published a handful of odd papers arguing that climate change wasn’t being caused by humans.
Prof Steve Sherwood, director of the University of New South Wales Climate Change Research Centre, described one of the papers as “laughable”.
Dr Arthur Viterito, a retired college geography professor, is also a policy adviser to the notorious Heartland Institute – famed for its billboard campaign comparing people who accepted human-caused global warming to a serial killer. To be fair, it did issue an important qualifier that, “of course, not all global warming alarmists are murderers or tyrants”.
Viterito told me via email earlier this month that he had “agreed to assume the role as editor-in-chief for one year and my year was up” and that he would now go on to concentrating on his research. 
Omics and its associated companies also organise hundreds of meetings and conferences each year. 
Mörner managed to organise one meeting, through Omics, in Rome in October 2017, and then load the program with fellow climate science deniers.
One email sent to several Australian climate scientists by Omics company ConferenceSeries LLC was designed to entice them to attend the Rome conference. Here is the how that irresistible word salad read: 
Climate Change 2017 is specifically premeditated with a unifying axiom providing pulpit to widen the imminent scientific creations. The main theme of the conference is ‘Today’s Progress and Tomorrow’s Climate Challenges’ which covers a broad array of vitally key sessions.
While all the serious Australia climate scientists seemed bemused by this “unifying axiom” the meeting did go ahead and, according to the estimates of two people who attended, there were between 80 and 100 people in the room at the start (somewhere short of the “more than 500” that Omics had said in its marketing that it expected).
I was appalled by the first speaker, who was indeed a climate denier, much to my surprise
In an interview posted on YouTube, Mörner said the conference had been a great success and expressed his delight at being able to expose junior academics to the views of deniers. “Everybody left happy,” he said.
Prof Joseph Tomain, a law professor from the University of Cincinatti, didn’t leave happy. He left shortly after the first tea break.
Tomain was the second speaker at the meeting but accepted he should have checked the credentials of the organisers more carefully before agreeing to travel.
“I was appalled by the first speaker, who was indeed a climate denier, much to my surprise,” Tomain told me via email. “At the break, I spoke with other attendees who were clearly in the same camp. Quite honestly, it was not my cup of tea and after that break I decided to enjoy Rome rather than stay stuck at a Holiday Inn on its outskirts.”
Dr John Hunter, a sea level expert at the University of Tasmania, told me there was a “systemic problem” in academia where younger scientists were being pushed to publish more papers which had “lowered the standards of submitted papers”.
“There has been an explosion of online journals, and also the ability to publish hardcopy journals far cheaper than previously. As well as producing good journals, this has led to a proliferation of ‘predatory’ and ‘vanity’ journals with poor reviewing standards.” 
But the effort to target these journals is also a neat way to sidestep the legitimate and valid criticism levelled at deniers that many have little to no history of publishing research in peer-reviewed journals.
Now, anyone can publish anything in a journal with a name that sounds official but in fact offers none of the checks and balances of legitimate journals.
That’s how a paper with the title Get Me Off Your Fucking Mailing List can be accepted for publication in the International Journal of Advanced Computer Technology, or the Urology &amp; Nephrology Open Access Journal published by MedCrave (another publisher targeted by Mörner) can be easily hoaxed with a paper about a non-existent condition based on a 1991 episode of Seinfeld and written by Dr Martin van Nostrand (let’s Google that for them).
That’s also how papers that dismiss the well-established science linking between fossil fuel burning to dangerous climate change can get published in an “international” and “peer-reviewed” journal.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2018/jan/24/murky-world-of-science-journals-a-new-frontier-for-climate-deniers

Not so for intrepid botanists who discovered 532 species of wildflowers in bloom across Britain and Ireland around New Year’s Day.
According to the Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland (BSBI), which organises the annual New Year Plant Hunt, this rainbow of midwinter colour is a far cry from botanical textbooks of several decades ago which indicated only a few dozen species should be blooming in midwinter.
This unexpected blooming included robust favourites such as daisies, dandelions, groundsel and gorse, but also “autumn stragglers” including ragwort, hogweed and yarrow, which normally flower after midsummer but well before midwinter.
Botanists suggest that climate change bringing milder early winters may be a factor in the January colour, but so too is an increased search effort and the sharing of pictures on social media, as well as a burgeoning number of non-native flowers that have escaped into the wild. Nearly half – 46% – of the midwinter blooms were non-native.
“If you believe the textbooks, only about 10% of the species we found in flower should be in flower,” said Dr Kevin Walker, BSBI’s Head of Science. “It could be climate change but it could also be because people didn’t used to go and look for flowers in midwinter.”
According to Walker, urban areas tend to have more non-native flowering species than rural areas, with cities and towns providing more sheltered places with warm microclimates where plants that have escaped from gardens can thrive.
Perhaps reassuring for lovers of a traditionally bleak winter, the 2018 tally was significantly lower than the 611 flowers recorded during the exceptionally mild winter of 2016.
And there was no sign that the floral riches herald an early spring: only 14% of the species recorded were springtime specialists such as primrose and lesser celandine.
“We’re not finding plants flowering earlier, we’re finding things are flowering later or just straggling on because the milder early winter is not killing them off with frosts,” said Walker. 
More than 1,000 people – a record number – participated in the plant hunt from Caithness to Guernsey, with pictures shared on social media, including BSBI’s increasingly popular “wildflower hour” on Twitter on Sunday evenings. 
The most floral place in Britain and Ireland during this bleak midwinter was Phillack in Cornwall, which boasted 114 different species in flower.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/24/hundreds-of-wildflower-species-found-blooming-in-midwinter

Landslides took place on Wednesday along two commuter lines, including the main route between Glasgow Queen Street and Edinburgh, plus Glasgow Central to Carlisle and the Newcastle line via Dumfries.
The latest landslip led to the closure of the heavily used Edinburgh to Glasgow line near Winchburgh in West Lothian, forcing ScotRail to lay on replacement buses.
The incidents followed the closure of the West Highland line north of Fort William, after a train to Mallaig became stuck in a heavy landslide on Monday.
Trains from Glasgow Central to Carlisle and Newcastle via Dumfries were delayed on Wednesday morning after a landslide affected services and the A76 near Kirkconnel, south-east of Kilmarnock. 
Flooding near Edinburgh earlier in the day had already delayed trains to and from Glasgow Queen Street, as well as services from Edinburgh to Dunblane and Stirling, while flooding and debris affected signals for trains near Livingston North, affecting services to Helensburgh and Glasgow Central.
The problems led to delays during the morning commute. The Scottish Green party said it highlighted the urgent need to prepare for worsening weather brought by climate change.
John Finnie, the Scottish Green MSP for the Highlands, said: “Without action, climate change will continue to bring increased risks of this sort, not just to rail lines but also to other infrastructure.”
Network Rail, which maintains infrastructure, said it was spending £25m-£30m a year in Scotland on reinforcing hillsides and rock faces, bolstering bridges and strengthening tracks to prepare for extreme weather.
Meanwhile, high wind warnings have been extended as Storm Georgina batters the UK, with gusts of up to 90mph (145km/h) possible around the Western Isles. 
Met Office yellow warnings for high winds across northern Scotland were extended to 5pm. 
A gust of 85mph was recorded on South Uist in the Outer Hebrides on Wednesday morning, while there were 75mph winds at The Needles on the Isle of Wight and on Anglesey. 
Forecasters said gusts of 70mph-80mph were likely in northern and western parts of the Highlands.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/24/scotland-railway-lines-flooding-landslides-weather-winds-storm-georgina

The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved its symbolic Doomsday Clock forward 30 seconds, to two minutes to midnight, in a reflection of how the scientists view the dangers facing the world. 
The only other time the clock was set so close to catastrophe in its 71-year history was in 1953, after the US and the Soviet Union detonated their first thermonuclear bombs. 
In the immediate aftermath of the cold war, the clock was set back to 17 minutes to midnight, but optimism about humanity’s future has steadily eroded since then. 
“To call the world’s nuclear situation dire is to understate the danger and its immediacy,” said Rachel Bronson, the bulletin’s president and CEO, told journalists in Washington. 
In explaining their decision on Thursday, scientists from the bulletin’s widely respected science and security board said that they were disturbed by the rising tensions on the Korean peninsula, the increasing emphasis and expenditure on nuclear weapons by major powers, the absence of arms control negotiations around the world, and the wavering political will to combat climate change.
In the year since the hands on the Doomsday Clock were last adjusted, North Korea has carried out its sixth nuclear test, the most powerful to date and almost certainly its first hydrogen bomb. It has also made three successful tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles, the third of which, in November, appeared to be capable of reaching New York or Washington.
At the same time, Trump has engaged in a highly personalised exchange of insults with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un. He has threatened “fire and fury” against the nation, and vowed to “totally destroy” if Pyongyang continued to threaten the US American strategic bombers have flown north of the 38th parallel that divides the peninsula, along the North Korean coast.
The bulletin’s scientists repeatedly singled out the Trump administration as a major factor behind the increased risks to the planet, pointing out the president’s volatility as expressed in his tweets and statements; the inconsistency of the administration’s foreign policy; and its apparent disdain for science, reflected in its high-level appointments, which have included climate change deniers.
“Our allies and adversaries alike are being forced [into a] thicket of conflicting policy statements, from a US administration weakened in its roster of foreign policy professionals and unable to develop, coordinate and clearly communicate a coherent foreign – much less nuclear – policy,” said Robert Rosner, the chair of the bulletin’s science and security board. “This inconsistency constitutes a major challenge for deterrence, alliance management and global stability.”
Sharon Squassoni, a professor at George Washington University’s institute for international science and technology policy also pointed to Russia’s role in heightening tensions. Last year, for instance, it fielded ground-launched cruise missiles, violating the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty.
“Russia has engaged in provocative and illegal behaviours thought to be part of cold war history,” Squassoni said. 
Some experts argue that the comparison with the height of the cold war was an exaggeration. 
“During the height of the cold war there was a nontrivial risk of global nuclear annihilation,” Vipin Narang, a North Korea and nuclear expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, wrote in a tweet. “Today, the risk of single use may be higher but it’s unlikely to threaten global destruction.”
The bulletin scientists said that climate change also weighed heavily in their deliberations. After flattening out for some years, global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise and the levels of the polar ice caps are at new lows. 
“Here in the US, the incoming President Trump promptly appointed a cadre of avowed climate denialists and quickly started reversing existing climate measures,” said Sivan Kartha, a senior scientist at the Stockholm Environmental Institute. 
Trump was also criticised for downgrading the science in his administration. Lawrence Krauss, the chair of the bulletin’s board of sponsors, said that 2017 marked that the first time since the position was created more than a half-century ago that there was no presidential science adviser. 
“The White House office of science and technology policy is essentially not staffed,” Krauss said. “The official mechanisms to tie public policy to reality are currently absent.” ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/25/doomsday-clock-ticked-forward-trump-nuclear-weapons-climate-change

More than 200 scientists have put their names to a letter that urges the museum to “end ties to anti-science propagandists and funders of climate science misinformation” and axe Mercer from its board of trustees, a position she has held since 2013.
A separate missive also calling for Mercer’s dismissal has been circulated among the museum’s own curators amid growing concern that the New York institution risks having its mission subverted by Mercer.
The Mercer family is headed by billionaire rightwing benefactor Bob Mercer, a computer scientist and hedge fund CEO. In 2015, The Washington Post named Mercer one of the 10 most influential billionaires in politics, and by conservative estimates he has donated more than $35m to political campaigns over the last 14 years.
Mercer also invested at least $10min the 'alt-right' news website Breitbart.com in 2011, anointing his relationship with the then executive chairman, Steve Bannon, the self-described “nationalist” who was a pivotal figure in Donald Trump’s election campaign and briefly a strategist in the Trump White House.
Rebekah Mercer, Bob’s daughter, mostly serves as the public face of his political donor activities. Bob himself is notoriously reclusive and has few public statements to his name.
In the bestselling book Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, author Michael Wolff describes the Mercers as “tak[ing] over” the Trump campaign in August 2016 and “installing” Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway, now counsellor to the president, atop a floundering operation. “Trump wouldn’t be President if not for Bob,” a former Mercer employee told The New Yorker.
In the wake of controversy over Bannon and rightwing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos, Bob distributed his ownership stake in Breitbart to his daughters, including Rebekah, citing “personal reasons”.
Jamiles Lartey
Freshly obtained donation records, shared with the Guardian, show that the Mercer Family Foundation, overseen by Rebekah and her billionaire hedge fund father, Robert, funneled more than $2m to organisations that actively deny or obfuscate mainstream climate science during the election year.
The donations include $800,000 to the Heartland Institute, a conservative group famous for its regular conferences for those who dismiss the scientific consensus that human activity is changing the climate, and half a million dollars to the Heritage Foundation, a free market group that promotes fossil fuel extraction and claims that spells of cold weather demonstrate that the planet is not warming. 
In 2016, the Mercers funded two other groups for the first time – giving $125,000 to the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and $150,000 to the CO2 Coalition. Both groups seek to sow doubt over the consequences of climate change. The CO2 Coalition’s chairman is William Happer, a Princeton University physicist who has been touted as a potential science adviser to Trump.
The Mercers were a crucial backroom force behind the political rise of Trump. Steve Bannon, Trump’s former chief strategist, last year said: “The Mercers laid the groundwork for the Trump revolution.” Brietbart News, the rightwing outlet previously run by Bannon, has also received large donations from the Mercer foundation.
“Since Trump’s election, the Mercer family has been flushed out of the shadows and revealed to be major supporters of the climate denial machine,” said Kert Davies, founder of a climate-focused transparency group who analysed the donations’ declarations. “Their support for climate deniers appears to be growing over time.”
The Mercer foundation’s 2016 donations also include $200,000 directed to the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine, a group founded by Arthur Robinson, a biochemist who helped set up a widely discredited petition of purported experts denying that global warming is harmful. 
The signatories had no vetting, however, prompting green groups to add singer Geri Halliwell and the entire cast of M*A*S*H to the list. More recently, Robinson has been storing thousands of samples of human urine in the belief that he will find a way to extend lifespans. Rebekah Mercer has reportedly suggested to Trump that Robinson be the president’s chief science adviser. 
In their letter, concerned scientists and curators warned the American Museum of Natural History that while it is a “treasured and influential institution”, it could suffer a “loss of public trust” through its association with Mercer. As well as being a trustee, Mercer has donated more than $4m to the museum since 2012, records show.
“Rebekah Mercer is one of the greatest funders of the bad faith attacks on climate science and climate scientists,” said Michael Mann, a Pennsylvania State University climate scientist and one of the letter’s signatories.
“It is an abomination for her to be sitting on the board of trustees of any science-themed institution let alone one of the greatest natural history museums in the world.”
 Katherine Hayhoe, another prominent climate scientist who signed the letter, said it is imperative that museums “convey … information accurately, without either explicit or implicit pressure to downplay or even alter the facts”.
Museums and galleries have come under increasing scrutiny as they attempt to balance the need for funding with concerns over climate change. In 2015, the Science Museum in London said it would not continue a controversial sponsorship deal with Shell, although BP continues to back several of the city’s major cultural institutions, such as the British Museum, National Portrait Gallery and the Royal Opera House.
This month, the American Museum of Natural History was criticised for an exhibit in its dinosaur wing that said warmer periods, such as the current one, are caused by variations in the Earth’s orbit around the sun and that there is “no reason to believe another ice age won’t come”. The wing is funded by David Koch, a high-profile funder of climate change denying groups, although the museum said Koch had no influence over the content, which was merely outdated.
“This country is having a crisis of trust, museums are the last bastions of trust and we have to be very careful of preserving that,” said Jon Foley, executive director of the California Academy of Sciences, which doesn’t accept money from fossil fuels. 
“The American [Museum of Natural History] is one of the best museums in the world and it’s sad that we are talking about this rather than their great work.
“It’s troubling if donors are supporting museums on one hand and funding anti-science on the other. Public science institutions need to pick people aligned to their mission, not just for their wealth. We are in a hypercharged atmosphere at the moment, science is under attack. This is an issue museums will have to navigate.”
Foley, not a signatory to the scientists’ letter, said he gets calls “all the time” from donors about exhibits based on issues such as climate change or evolution. “The job is to listen and relay that the exhibits are based on the best available science,” he said. “You never let donors or trustees micromanage the content of exhibits. It’s more about the perception. But that perception is important.”
A spokesman for American Museum of Natural History said the museum “deeply respects” the work and views of scientists and affirmed that the institution accepts that human-driven climate change is “well supported by scientific evidence and one of the most serious issues currently facing our planet”.
“The museum itself, however, does not make appointment decisions concerning staff or trustees based on political views,” the spokesman said. 
“It’s not the role of trustees or donors to make decisions about scientific and educational content. At the museum, those decisions are made by scientists and educators based on evidence, facts, and research.”

I'm retracting nothing. The Trenberth paper has a table showing the ocean heat gain (Table 1, Column 6) in W/m^2 on a globalized basis based on different ocean heat databases. The average heat gain is 0.60W/m^2 (I get 0.59 W/m^2 2005 to 2014 inclusive using the NODC quarterly data which is essentially the same number). That would mean that ocean heat gain to 2000 m, which according to some peer-reviewed research is ALL of the heat gain, is only 67% of the claimed 0.9W/m^2 energy imbalance.
It' makes no sense if the claim of ocean heat gain is 92% of the energy imbalance. However, it does if you realize that Trenberth is doing exactly the same thing as you claim I am, cherrying picking the high end of the spectrum in an attempt to get the actual energy imbalance to match the models.

Standard Deviation

BQSTART
In statistics, the standard deviation (SD, also represented by the Greek letter sigma σ or the Latin letter s) is a measure that is used to quantify the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of data values.[1] A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be close to the mean (also called the expected value) of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a wider range of values.

However, as per this paper from Trenberth et al 2016. Here's the money quote: ""Global standard deviations of EEI of 0.64 W m−2 based on top-of-atmosphere observations therefore substantially constrain ocean contributions, given by the tendencies of OHC."" There's a big difference between 1.1W/m^2 modeled and 0.6W/m^2 measured.
BQEND
Looking at the paper you cite, it appears that you have cherry picked completely the wrong value to make your comparison with.
The standard deviation of a measurement is not the same thing as the measurement itself.
Reading all the way to the end of the abstract, Trenberth concludes:

BQSTART
The EEI is estimated to be 0.9 ± 0.3 W m−2 for 2005–14.
BQEND
The value you claim is predicted by the models is well within the range given by Trenberth et. al.

Models say 1.1W/m^2, Trenberth says 0.9 ± 0.3 W m−2.

Nice try, but I'm not talking about hindcasting models ending in 2005 (which is the your linked paper and also the starting point of when we get good data below 700 m for ocean heat). I'm talking about what's happened in the period since using the forecasting CMIP5 model runs.
It's an irrefutable fact that these models (the ensemble) show a ~1W/m^2 energy imbalance TOA starting in the mid 1990s, being over 1 starting about 2009 or so. However, as the Trenberth paper shows, observations are well below that.
One annoying feature of the paper you linked is that it uses 1992 as the start of it's recent period. That period has the best data, however, that leverages the models apparent accuracy since it tracks the heat gain post Pinatubo. Vulcanism is one of the things the models actually get half ways right.
Since collated heat content numbers from the CMIP5 runs seem hard to come by, it's not easy to check observations vs models. However, I believe the .nc files from CMIP5 are out there so it's a matter of getting the right software and doing it yourself.

Not saying they are accurate. I used 7.2E17 m^3 for the ocean volume * 1.028 density of salt water at 5C for a mass of 7.4E20 kg. The volume above 2000 m must be > 50% (your number) since a 2000 m thick volume slab is greater than a 3700 - 2000 or 1700 m thick slab, areas being equal. But areas aren't equal. The volume of the 2000 m depth can be very roughly approximated by the area at 1000 m by 2000 m thick. But the area at 1000 m is much greater than an area halfway between 2000 and 3700. 
You get the point I'm sure.

With 40 years between cause and effect, it means that average temperatures of the last decade are a result of what we were thoughtlessly putting into the air in the 1960’s. It also means that the true impact of our emissions over the last decade will not be felt until the 2040’s. This thought should send a chill down your spine!""
BQEND
This refers to the change in surface temperature.
It takes a long time for the surface to warm from the initial release of CO2 as the energy accumulates, mostly in the oceans.
This does not imply that all of the heat will magically jump out of the ocean 40 years later.
The 40 year lag is a simplistic descriptive term for the complex relationship described in the article. Rather like a newspaper headline, it is a simplification.

BQSTART
The reason the planet takes several decades to respond to increased CO2 is the thermal inertia of the oceans. Consider a saucepan of water placed on a gas stove. Although the flame has a temperature measured in hundreds of degrees C, the water takes a few minutes to reach boiling point. This simple analogy explains climate lag. The mass of the oceans is around 500 times that of the atmosphere. The time that it takes to warm up is measured in decades. Because of the difficulty in quantifying the rate at which the warm upper layers of the ocean mix with the cooler deeper waters, there is significant variation in estimates of climate lag. A paper by James Hansen and others [iii] estimates the time required for 60% of global warming to take place in response to increased emissions to be in the range of 25 to 50 years. The mid-point of this is 37.5 which I have rounded to 40 years.
BQEND
This is what the ""40 year lag"" refers to, this is what it actually means.
Following a release of CO2 it takes ~40 years for 60% of the temperature increase to occur.
It's an
increasing exponential decay function.
It takes a further 40 years to realise 60% of the remaining temperature increase, and so on.

They LOSE heat via IR radiation, so if that shedding of heat is blocked by increased CO2 they can't cool off as effectively and warm up.
BQEND
Don't mind TT.
You don't have it quite right, but then again neither does he.
There are several mechanisms by which the oceans exchange heat with the atmosphere, radiation, evaporation and conduction.
The increased downwellign IR does act in opposition to the increased upward emission from the ocean surface, but that is not the whole story.
There is an interesting piece on it here.

Ocean-Atmosphere Coupling

BQSTART
Net Back Radiation: The ocean transmits electromagnetic radiation into the atmosphere in proportion to the fourth power of the sea surface temperature (black-body radiation). This radiation is at much longer wavelengths than that of the solar radiation (greater than 10 micros, in the infrared range), because the ocean surface is far cooler that the sun's surface. The infrared radiation emitted from the ocean is quickly absorbed and re-emitted by water vapor and carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases residing in the lower atmosphere. Much of the radiation from the atmospheric gases, also in the infrared range, is transmitted back to the ocean, reducing the net long wave radiation heat loss of the ocean. The warmer the ocean the warmer and more humid is the air, increasing its greenhouse abilities. Thus it is very difficult for the ocean to transmit heat by long wave radiation into the atmosphere; the greenhouse gases just kick it back, notably water vapor whose concentration is proportional to the air temperature. Net back radiation cools the ocean, on a global average by 66 watts per square meter.

In this paper, we extend and improve a recently proposed mapping strategy (CZ16) to provide a complete gridded temperature field for 0- to 2000-m depths from 1960 to 2015. We carefully evaluate the estimate by comparing the fully analyzed temperature signals with those based on a “subsample test,” in which subsamples of data in the Argo era are colocated with historical ocean observations and used to assess sampling error. The time scales for which reliable estimates are obtained are quantified. Using this improved reconstruction, we derived an updated historical (1960–2015) ocean energy budget and contributions to Earth’s total energy budget.

Your question presumes a false premise.
The warming of the ocean does not depend on IR penetrating to any depth.
We know that it cannot, and yet the ocean clearly is warming.
Even without considering the precise mechanism, it is obvious that the oceans must warm from simple thermodynamics.
Given the energy imbalance due to increased CO2, the earth's surface temperature must increase until it is hot enough to radiate away that imbalance.
About 70% of the surface is ocean, so the ocean surface must also warm to achieve equilibrium.
For the surface temperature to increase, the temperature must also increase to some depth.

That information can only come from the oceans, because almost all heat is stored there. If you want to understand global warming, you need to first understand ocean warming.
This isn’t to say other measurements are not also important. For instance, measurements of the air temperature just above the Earth are really important. We live in this air; it affects us directly. A great commentary on 2017 air temperatures is provided by my colleague Dana Nuccitelli. Another measurement that is important is sea level rise; so too is ocean acidification. We could go on and on identifying the markers of climate change. But in terms of understanding how fast the Earth is warming, the key is the oceans. 
This important ocean information was just released today by a world-class team of researchers from China. The researchers (Lijing Cheng and Jiang Zhu) found that the upper 2000 meters (more than 6000 feet) of ocean waters were far warmer in 2017 than the previous hottest year. We measure heat energy in Joules. It turns out that 2017 was a record-breaking year, 1.51 × 1022 Joules hotter than any other year. For comparison, the annual electrical generation in China is 600 times smaller than the heat increase in the ocean.
The authors provide a long history of ocean heat, going back to the late 1950s. By then there were enough ocean temperature sensors to get an accurate assessment of the oceans’ warmth. Their results are shown in the figure below. This graph shows ocean heat as an “anomaly,” which means a change from their baseline of 1981–2010. Columns in blue are cooler than the 1981-2010 period, while columns in red are warmer than that period. The best way to interpret this graph is to notice the steady rise in ocean heat over this long time period.
What is interesting is that from year to year (or over the span of a few years), the heat in the oceans may increase or decrease. This is because there are natural fluctuations that can transfer extra energy to or from the waters. One such natural event is the well-known El Niño/La Niña cycle in the Pacific Ocean. During an El Niño, the Pacific Ocean tends to have very warm waters at the surface, which causes heat loss to the atmosphere (so the ocean cools and the atmosphere warms). Conversely, during a La Niña, the reverse process occurs. 
There are other fluctuations and natural occurrences like volcanic eruptions and other changes in ocean currents. But it just means we don’t want to take any one year as proof of global warming. The fact that 2017 was the oceans’ hottest year doesn’t prove humans are warming the planet. But, the long term upward trend that extends back many decades does prove global warming. The graph above is the most important image to show someone who denies the reality of a changing climate. 
It’s interesting to look at the top five years on record in terms of ocean heat; they are listed below.
Note that these are the five hottest years ever recorded. Truly astonishing.
The authors went a bit further and investigated how the heat was input into the oceans by region. They found that in 2017, a lot of heat was deposited in the Atlantic and Southern Oceans. The authors also calculated that all this heat resulted in approximately 2 mm rise in sea level (as water warms, it expands and so that ocean levels rise). 
Further consequences of this heating include declining oxygen levels in the oceans, bleaching of coral reefs, and melting of both sea ice and ice shelves (the latter of which which will also raise sea levels). We are observing these effects. Arctic ice is undergoing a long-term decline, and it’s possible the Arctic will become ice-free. Massive coral bleaching events have been recorded, particularly in the waters off of Australia. The point is, the effects of global warming aren’t just academic; they are real.
The consequences of this year-after-year-after-year warming have real impacts on humans. Fortunately, we know why the oceans are warming (because of human greenhouse gases), and we can do something about it. We can take action to reduce the heating of our planet by using energy more wisely and increasing the use of clean and renewable energy (like wind and solar power).",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jan/26/in-2017-the-oceans-were-by-far-the-hottest-ever-recorded

Trump was met with global condemnation when he announced in June 2017 that the United States was pulling out of the Paris climate agreement, painting it a “bad deal” for the US economy.
While the president remains firm in his criticism of the historic accord, which was signed by his predecessor Barack Obama, he said he would be willing to sign up to a revamped deal.
“The Paris accord, for us, would have been a disaster,” he told Britain’s ITV channel in an interviewed to be aired late on Sunday in the UK.
“If they made a good deal … there’s always a chance we’d get back,” Trump added, describing the current agreement as “terrible” and “unfair” to the US. 
The landmark treaty was agreed by 197 nations in 2015 after intense negotiations in Paris, where all countries made voluntary carbon-cutting pledges running to 2030. 
“If somebody said, go back into the Paris accord, it would have to be a completely different deal because we had a horrible deal,” Trump said, according to extracts of the interview.
“Would I go back in? Yeah, I’d go back in … I would love to. I like, as you know, Emmanuel [Macron].”
Trump suggested the climate had been cooling as well as warming and asserted – wrongly – that ice at the poles has not been shrinking as predicted.
“The ice caps were going to melt, they were going to be gone by now, but now they’re setting records,” he said.
That assessment remarks does not match what data shows and scientists say. 
The world has not been cooling except for normal day-to-day weather variations; it has been just the opposite. And there have been far more records for shrinking ice on the top and the bottom of the world than growing, despite what the president claimed.
Earlier this month Trump said the US could “conceivably” return to the deal under more favourable terms, raising questions about whether he was bluffing about pulling out of the Paris deal in a bid for easier emissions targets.

The US president said his country could join the international accord if it had a “completely different deal” but called the existing agreement a “terrible deal” and a “disaster” for the US.
In remarks on Brexit that will add to the pressure on the prime minister, Trump said he “would have negotiated it differently” and that he had “a lot of problems” with the European Union, warning of a trade battle between the US and the bloc. He also said that the US would look to strike a “great” trade deal with the UK as soon as EU restrictions ended and the UK could open talks on new trading agreements.
Trump made the comments in an interview with Piers Morgan for ITV, which was broadcast on Sunday night.
In a preview of the interview released on Friday,  showed Trump said he was prepared to apologise for retweeting inflammatory videos posted by the deputy leader of the far-right group Britain First.
He also told Morgan he had “tremendous respect for women”; often posted on social media from his bed; and had not received an invitation to the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. He said he was happy for the couple – despite Morgan noting that Markle had described Trump as a divisive misogynist.
The US president met with global condemnation when he announced in June 2017 that the US was pulling out of the climate agreement. The landmark treaty was signed by 195 nations after intense negotiations in 2015, with countries making voluntary pledges to cut carbon emissions in an attempt to restrict an increase in global temperatures to less than 2C this century.
Trump said in the ITV interview that he was a “believer in clean air and clean water” but the Paris agreement would have been a disaster for the US. However, despite initially saying he was “completely out” of the accord, Trump said there could be a way back for the US.
“First of all, it was a terrible deal for the US. If they made a good deal there’s always a chance we’d get back. But it was a terrible deal for the US. It was unfair to the US,” he said.
“I believe in clean air. I believe in crystal-clear, beautiful … I believe in just having good cleanliness in all. Now, with that being said, if somebody said go back into the Paris accord, it would have to be a completely different deal because we had a horrible deal.
“As usual, they took advantage of the US. We were in a terrible deal. Would I go back in? Yeah, I’d go back in. I like, as you know, I like Emmanuel [Macron]. I would love to, but it’s got to be a good deal for the US.”
Asked if he believed in climate change, Trump said: “There is a cooling, and there’s a heating. I mean look, it used to not be climate change, it used to be global warming. That wasn’t working too well because it was getting too cold all over the place. The ice caps were going to melt, they were going to be gone by now, but now they’re setting records. They’re at a record level.”
Trump’s comments about Brexit will add to the pressure on May amid growing rumours of discontent in the Conservative party over her approach.
“Would it be the way I negotiate? No, I wouldn’t negotiate it the way it’s negotiated,” Trump said.
“But I have a lot of respect for your prime minister, and I think they’re doing a job. I think I would have negotiated it differently. I would have had a different attitude.
“I think I would have said that the EU is not cracked up to what it’s supposed to be, and I would have taken a tougher stand in getting out. I have a lot of problems with the EU.”
The US president described the relationship between his country and the EU as a “very unfair situation”, adding: “We cannot get our product in. It’s very, very tough. Yet, they send their product to us – no taxes, very little taxes. It’s very unfair. I’ve had a lot of problems with EU, and it may morph into something very big from that standpoint, from a trade standpoint.”
Trump was also asked in the interview to speak out in defence of women and clarify previous remarks that have provoked a backlash against the president. “Well, I think we have to evolve,” he said. “If we don’t evolve, there’s something missing. But I have tremendous respect for women.”
Asked if he was a feminist, Trump said: “I wouldn’t say I’m a feminist. I think that would be maybe going too far. I’m for women, I’m for men, I’m for everyone. I think people have to go out, they have to go out and really do it, and they have to win. Women are doing great, and I’m happy about that.”
Trump told Morgan that he wrote his own tweets, sometimes when lying in bed. “Well, perhaps sometimes in bed, and perhaps sometimes at breakfast, or lunch, or whatever. But generally speaking, during the early morning or during the evening, I can do that. But if I’m very busy during the day … and I’ll sometimes just dictate out something really quickly, and I’ll give it to one of my people to put it on.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/28/donald-trump-says-us-could-re-enter-paris-climate-deal-itv-interview

You spot Hughes and Constable as first in the Acknowledgements and off you fly! All they did was make their information available. It's available to you - this is what it says:
""...The normalised load factor for UK onshore wind farms declines from a peak of about 24% at age 1 to 15% at age 10 and 11% at age 15. The decline in the normalised load factor for Danish onshore wind farms is slower but still significant with a fall from a peak of 22% to 18% at age 15. On the other hand for offshore wind farms in Denmark the normalised load factor falls from 39% at age 0 to 15% at age 10. The reasons for the observed declines in normalised load factors cannot be fully assessed using the data available but outages due to mechanical breakdowns appear to be a contributory factor...""

The truth is, if you want to power civilisation with fewer greenhouse gas emissions, then you should focus on shifting power generation, heat and transport to natural gas, the economically recoverable reserves of which — thanks to horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing — are much more abundant than we dreamed they ever could be. It is also the lowest-emitting of the fossil fuels, so the emissions intensity of our wealth creation can actually fall while our wealth continues to increase. Good.

As turbines grow in size the costs should come down given the cost of installation is cheaper as the current round is 6-8 MW and these will be replaced with 10-12 in the 2020s [A huge cost is the special ships used for installation- these will evidently be bigger in 25 years, and more numerous]', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1517681944000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'4738374', u'in_reply_to': u'111710056', u'id': u'111711580', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'prismsuk', u'text': u'""...as for turbine wear things have moved on and research determines that actual wear...""
Yes, Jules - research [of the real variety, taking into account confounding factors] has moved on.

So MEOW's owners publicise that the 950 MW installation will power 950,000 UK homes [at 3,300 kWh each p.a.], without revealing to investors, the media, politicians and the general public that in its 25th year it will only be able to power 645,000 homes.
Wind power companies blatantly lie to us all and over-represent the truth by 20%. Search for: ""wind power companies and bodies lie""

as for cost of dismantling you cite one study that cites one decommissioning of one small offshore farm- noting the turbines only last a few rather than 25 years- the reason was simply lack of spares and it was an early offshore farm. it was simply economics.
and your maths is rather reliant on extremely high decommissioning costs and O & M costs- MEOW cost £1.8 billion, so having as much again when the fuel is free seems to be looking for the most extreme examples.
As for O&M the study you link to actually says-
BQSTART
The operation and maintenance costs account for 25% of the life cycle costs of offshore wind farms, where the majority of costs are associated with unplanned corrective maintenance actions. As shown in Figure 4 the unplanned maintenance costs are contributing to 90% of total O&M costs, where 28% of that is due to the weather downtime and revenue losses.

Nuclear never was cheap, it was only ever feasible with generous state support. The market would not touch Hinkley C with a bargepole, it is only the government driving it.
BQEND
Nuclear is cheap in many places in the world, it is just not particularly profitable compared to gas because it accepts the lowest price on the market, whereas gas can choose to wait for the highest electricity price if gas prices are high; or run baseload when the gas price is low.
If you advocate a market based approach for selecting the solution then you advocate gas.
The vast majority of renewables receive govt support also. They can be cheap but the value of their electricity is low so they often need subsidy to be profitable; and they need gas to fill the voids.
Certainly a combination of wind/solar + gas could be cheaper and more profitable than wind/solar+gas+nuclear in some circumstances; but it would never be cleaner.
You also seem to be assuming that nuclear will never be cheaper than Hinkley, but there is no reason to believe that. The price of Gen III nuclear will drop as more is deployed, just as nascent renewables drop when their deployment grows. Sizewell C is expected to be at least 20% cheaper (before any consideration of better financing options which could reduce the strike price further).

BQEND
Economics has not killed nuclear anywhere. It is not even ""unwell"" except possibly the US where cheap shale gas is hard to beat. The only situation where it is being phased out in any country is due to anti-nuclear politics. Not economics.
Going back to the point of the article, gas is not an acceptable solution. It cannot be a bridging fuel, despite that fact that anti-nuclear groups promote it as a bridging fuel.
But the Greens support gas. Anybody who does not support nuclear power must support more gas (or coal) whether they acknowledge this or not.

As for your baseload beliefs:
BQEND
It is not a matter of belief it is a matter of observation. There is a certain level of demand which is always present. That is the baseload.

Sure you can provide it more cheaply in some places with wind or solar plus gas but that's dirtier. Or you can provide it at much, much greater expense with storage.
Bust the lowest-cost route to decarbonisation is to include some nuclear for the baseload. The NAO confirmed this, and that's why the UK is doing it, and I expect that is why most other govts are doing it too.

It may be that places like the United States are just not that good at this sort of thing any more, which seems a common theme; but the potential is there. It's like a muscle, you have to exercise it.
Also I made no claim that renewables were replacing nuclear, just a simple observation of where the energy is coming from. It's still primarily fossil fuels. So you are right that it is more complicated than that. For starters, it is cheap fracked gas that is undermining the economics of nuclear (just as with coal). The difference is that if you care about climate change, this should bother you. Many (most even) environmentalist types either don't care, or studiously ignore it. That's not good, and they will live to regret it.
Then we need to be clear about the symbiotic relationship between gas & renewables. You can run a power grid off mostly gas; you can't do the same with mostly renewables without gas (not unless you are already blessed with excessive hydro). This is where the original article is deficient. Waving your hands in the air claiming renewables + storage will displace gas is highly non-credible. We have Germany as the poster child of trying to do renewables with limited gas use. Massive over capacity of generation assets (by about 100GW, though a lot of that is low CF renewables) which unsurprisingly leads to over generation & spillage. So lucky Germany has so many neighbors it can give its electricity to; but if you are a German rate payer, you are footing the bill & this should annoy you. Also they forgot to kill coal.
Bottom line is we are carelessly drifting into a gas as transition fuel phase. One that we will find is extremely difficult to transition out of.

Nuclear is declining, and renewables are increasing, but the correlation between the two does not necessarily imlpy that renewables are replacing nuclear. It's far more complicated than that.

BQEND
Thanks for eventually answering the question I asked.
Your link is a fine example of the
Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy.
Nuclear is declining, and renewables are increasing, but the correlation between the two does not necessarily imlpy that renewables are replacing nuclear.
It's far more complicated than that.
Coal is also declining and gas is also increasing.
Ignoring half of the facts has led you to draw a false conclusion, that renewables are only displacing nuclear.
If this were true, it would give the lie to another core belief of nuke fans, that renewables
cannot provide baseload.
What is actually happening is that cheaper sources are replacing more expensive sources.
Unfortunately, I don't think this is being driven by any genuine concern for reducing CO2 emissions, that is just a minor side effect of renewables as far as the market is concerned.

If, and it is a very big if, you think this can be done solely off the back of renewables like wind & solar, and at the expense of nuclear... you'd better not be wrong. A lot of people will get hurt if you are wrong.

Sorry that you backed the wrong horse, but blaming me won't fix it.
I have zero influence on decisions made by governments and financiers.
I don't think nuclear can deliver on time or to budget, I don't think it can scale.

BQENDI completely agree - and as batteries and intermittent supplies drop in cost then I believe that more and more will be co-located for peaking/EFR services.
That's great for countries like Australia but, as you say, at the higher latitudes the power has to be guaranteed to come from somewhere throughout the year.
I'm less convinced about home batteries and very doubtful about the use of EVs for DNO/local supply power (other than some industrial penetration)There are too many practical hurdles/limitations especially as arbitrage becomes progressively less viable when overnight cheap supplies get gobbled up.
What will be interesting is what happens to pumped storage economics - as baseload comes off the system and overnight charging of EVs removes the economics of reliable cheap rate then PS, which is already as cheap as it can be, may disappear or receive substantial subsidies.Pumped storage in Germany is already facing this; something I think you raised the other day.https://www.icis.com/resources/news/2014/09/03/9817356/german-pumped-storage-in-crisis-as-solar-crushes-economics/', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1517481743000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'it has a regular daily cycle and little seasonal variation', u'effect': u'it will be solar'}, {u'cause': u'wind is not nearly regular enough', u'effect': u'it is not likely to be wind'}, {u'cause': u'solar is too seasonal there', u'effect': u'at high latitudes it is more likely to be nuclear'}], u'author_id': u'14842422', u'in_reply_to': u'111610230', u'id': u'111613703', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'ComfortablyPlumb', u'text': u'BQSTART

These figures included all the primary energy use from mining, transport. Engineering, food production, etc and are not simply focused on electrical generation, hence why you may be confused. Simply focusing on electricity ignores so much of the other fossil fuel consumption that drives climate change.
But if we look at electrical generation, I think that focusing solely on wind and PV is an extremely risky proposition, since the effects of burning fossil fuels to the equivalent of 11,354,000,000 tonnes of oil per annum for decades is (for me anyway) adequately demonstrated by our changing climate.

The renewable energy share of final global energy consumption is about 20.1%, and electricity is about 25.5%, moving forward at just over 1% per year (which is likely to accelerate). 
The IEA have been making an accounting anomally which counted primary energy for fossil fuels (which can lose ~70% of their energy through combustion), and secondary energy (the electricity produced only) for renewables.
This means that the IEA have been documenting fossil fuels as having three times the energy they actually produce in comparison with renewables.
The IEA are obviously paid by the fossil fuel industry, however this doesn't stop many people treating the annual WEO booklet/pamphlet like the bible, with Fatih Birol sitting on high.
The issue was recently brought to the attention of the world and examined, although its common knowledge that the IEA's forecasts are without fail completely skewed in favour or ever greater fossil fuel consumption while effectively trying to quash any sense that renewable energy could pose a significant threat to the hegemony. Lies upon lies upon lies. Truly laughable - although there are no other 'official' data sets so thats all there is to go by.
The article is here http://energypost.eu/iea-underreports-contribution-solar-wind-factor-three-compared-fossil-fuels/, and its really worth reading. The IEA should really have been punished in some way but there you go - I suppose if they can live with their consciences. Explaining it is difficult; but its worth it: say a coal plant has a capacity factor of 40%, and solar has a capacity factor of 15% - they count the coal as the energy which has 100% energy, whereas the solar stays at 15% (its actual output) - quite a large difference.
Its sick, I'm really surprised more hasn't been made of it, but you start to understand when you see these figures of 2-3% renewables globally, going around.', u'recommendation_count': u'2', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1517438335000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'that', u'effect': u'a lot of damage'}], u'author_id': u'17280722', u'in_reply_to': u'111583610', u'id': u'111596088', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'guest90', u'text': u'Coal is dead or dying as in most regions the cost of keeping a currently operating coal power plant stocked with fuel and operational is more than the cost of decommissioning it and replacing the energy supply with renewables and interconnections, or storage. HVDC prices are high, but falling fast around the world.
The real issue is gas; as fossil energy companies scramble to persuade policymakers that their product has an ongoing relevance to electricity generation, or other further uptake going forward. However; even if we look at the gas turbine industry; senior management have had to explain that ‘the market is burning to the ground’ and that ‘the power generation industry is experiencing disruption of unprecedented scope and speed’. 20-30,000 layoffs by the three major turbine manufacturers mean that electricity generation from gas is now largely a thing of the past. https://www.carboncommentary.com/blog/2018/1/26/burning-to-the-ground-the-carbon-bubble-in-gas-turbines
However it is a recent report by the well-respected Oil Change International that most effectively debunks the many myths surrounding gas as a 'bridge fuel'. For example, the idea that new gas is needed to back up system reliability just doesn't hold water when existing modalities will cover all eventualities for a decade or more, when other forms of energy storage or alternatives (such as power-to-gas and perhaps fuel cell technologies) are likely to be cheaper and more prevalent. Fuel cells are already a cost-effective option although the lack of serious industrialisation has prohibited the kind of growth possible as of yet (although Exxon is now starting to plan hundred MW+ installations by 2019). http://priceofoil.org/content/uploads/2017/11/gas-briefing-nov-2017-v5.pdf
The necessity for new gas to replace renewable energy just isn't there - wind and solar will always be cheaper: the report states 'the operator of the electrical grid in northeast Germany says the country’s grid can handle up to 70 to 80 percent wind and solar even without additional flexibility options such as storage.' So locking in 40 years of new gas, as endorsed by even the EU Commissioner Miguel Arias Cañete, is foolish in the extreme - we know that gas has to be replaced and certainly for electricity; the factory closures and layoffs should go far enough in explaining the situation.', u'recommendation_count': u'3', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1517433938000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'17280722', u'id': u'111592324', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'James Holland', u'text': u'""So maybe a little less self-congratulation.""""Dripping with misanthropic spite.""No, not really.

Personally the distinct down shift in production across all of the fields is not a normal field decline, and suggest economic or geo political reasons.
A quick google reveals that it took a bit of time for the oil price crash to kick in, but by 2015/16 60 or so small operators had gone bankrupt - and the big operators were struggling and the drill count went down.The more interesting thing is it demonstrates the tight oil/gas tap has a very short delay, if the drilling stops the wells quickly dry up - the red queen race.It demonstrates the industry is extremely vulnerable with the depth of loans it carries and any issues with price or interest rates sees business in trouble. It really is a business living on the edge.But on the plus side it is a highly adaptive industry and able to cut costs and remodel its operations to stay in business.
But my view for sometime particularly after the oil price drop way back in in Jan 2016 is that the US oil industry defies expectations- of course things may improve for it- with oil climbing in this year- or it may bump around.

Investment can be channelled into the wrong thing - QE for instance did very little money movement in those who needed it and instead those that had the money invested in commodities or property had more to do the same with little trickle down. [and that wast half a £trillion].
The economics of fracking have been called into question as to offering consumers any savings- and being part of euro gas market any cheap frack gas is going to make money for the investors [who ever they are] who will not be necessarily reinvesting that in the future of UK energy.
But as I said we should be fixing leaks not investing in buckets- gas industry want us to debate the colour of buckets and argue their red bucket is so much better than their green one.
As for the scale of the task at hand YES, its huge and government needs to take an active role and not just leave it to the market.
when it comes to imports then Norway natural gas vs imported investment, jobs and equipment and management of the fracking industry probably makes for little actual change in balance of payments - so far no country has remotely come close to duplicating the US experience [which also includes record levels of bankruptcies 60 or so in 2016 and massive piles of junk loans].

US coal power production has dropped by 44% (866 terawatt-hours [TWh]). It’s been replaced by natural gas (up 45%, or 400 TWh), renewables (up 260%, or 200 TWh), and increased efficiency (the US uses 9%, or 371 TWh less electricity than a decade ago).
In other words, of the 866 TWh of lost coal power production, 46% was picked up by natural gas, 43% by increased efficiency, and 23% by renewables. 
While the shift away from coal is a positive development in slowing global warming by cutting carbon pollution, as Joe Romm has detailed for Climate Progress, research indicates that shifting to natural gas squanders most of those gains. For example, a 2014 study published in Environmental Research Letters found that when natural gas production is abundant, it crowds out both coal and renewables, resulting in little if any climate benefit. Part of the problem is significant methane leakage from natural gas drilling.
...abundant gas consistently results in both less coal and renewable energy use […] the quantity of methane leaked may ultimately determine whether the overall effect is to slightly reduce or actually increase cumulative emissions […] only climate policies bring about a significant reduction in future emissions from US electricity generation … We conclude that increased natural gas use for electricity will not substantially reduce US GHG emissions, and by delaying deployment of renewable energy technologies, may actually exacerbate the climate change problem in the long term.
Similarly, another 2014 study found that based on the latest estimates of methane leakage rates from natural gas drilling, replacing coal with natural gas provides little in the way of climate benefits. Though it’s been touted as a ‘bridge fuel’ to span the gap between coal and renewables, this research suggests natural gas isn’t significantly better than coal in terms of global warming effects, and thus may not be suitable for that purpose. The ‘bridge’ doesn’t appear to achieve its goal of steadily cutting our greenhouse gas emissions.
California has been a national leader in clean energy. The state generates very little of its electricity from coal, but natural gas does supply more than a third of the state’s power. A quarter is generated by renewable sources like wind, solar, and geothermal plants, and another 10% comes from hydroelectric dams, on average. In 2017, renewables’ share increased by about 10%, displacing natural gas in the process.
In fact, California has an excess of natural gas power generation capabilities. Some natural gas plants are still essential for ensuring local grid reliability, but in many cases, clean energy resources like a combination of solar and storage can meet reliability needs.
In one recent example, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) ordered Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E) to procure energy storage (batteries) or “preferred resources” (renewables or increased efficiency and conservation) to meet a local reliability need in northern California. The order stemmed from an issue with a “peaker” natural gas plant (so-called because they switch on to meet high, peak electricity demand) operated in northern California. The operator (Calpine) was concerned that the plant was no longer economical, because it’s too infrequently used due largely to an abundance of renewable power. The contract they could receive for providing generation capacity to ensure grid reliability would not be high enough to cover costs to maintain the plant. 
Instead of bidding their plant into the program overseen by the CPUC to ensure local reliability, Calpine went directly to the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) and requested a “reliability must-run resource” contract, which is a much higher payment than they would have received through the CPUC program. CPUC decided instead to require PG&amp;E to fill the local reliability need with cleaner alternatives. The costs of renewable energy and battery storage have fallen so fast that the clean alternatives might now be cheaper than gas. 
In another example, a proposed natural gas peaker plant in Oxnard, California was rejected when it was shown that the CAISO was using outdated battery storage costs from 2014. Given how quickly those prices have fallen, they could now potentially be competitive with natural gas peaker costs.
The redundancy and potential replacement of natural gas with cleaner alternatives extends far beyond these examples. Most electrical service providers in California are now required to develop integrated resource plans. These are electric grid planning documents that outline how the utilities will meet a number of California’s goals, including a 40% reduction in carbon pollution below 1990 levels and 50% electricity production from renewable sources by 2030. Meeting these goals will require replacing non-critical natural gas plants with renewable power.
And California is already installing battery storage systems at record pace. Tesla, AES Energy Storage, and Greensmith Energy Partners have all installed large battery storage facilities in California within the past year. Within 4 years, batteries are projected to be as cheap as natural gas “peakers,” and consistently cheaper with 10 years. 
It’s important to bear in mind that power plants built today can continue to operate for decades to come. The decisions we make for today’s grid are long-lasting. That’s why there are similar pushes from groups in Michigan, Oregon, Connecticut, North Carolina, and South Carolina for utilities to scrap plans for new natural gas plants and instead consider cleaner and potentially cheaper renewable alternatives. Renewables also don’t face the uncertainty associated with fluctuating natural gas prices.
Of course, were there a national price on carbon pollution, renewables and battery storage would win in the marketplace even sooner. As it stands, natural gas prices don’t reflect the costs that we incur from the climate change caused by their greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, as Union of Concerned Scientists senior energy analyst Laura Wisland put it, 
Fortunately, rapidly falling costs are already making renewables and battery storage cost-competitive with natural gas, and cheaper than coal. If we’re going to succeed in avoiding the most dangerous climate change consequences, that transition away from all fossil fuels and towards clean energy can’t happen soon enough.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jan/29/natural-gas-killed-coal-now-renewables-and-batteries-are-taking-over

It has been known for a long time that condensation nucleus are important for storms. We have used it for weather modification since the mid 20th century. 
In the last decade, even tiny particle emissions from the rain-forest itself in ""pumping"" (recycling) rain deep into the continent has been scrutinised. 
As short as this little article is - with so little background and context - I am not sure it should be opened for comments. Especially since the scientific article itself will be behind a paywall for most readers. 
To my fast reading - the paper point to that micro-micro particles have enhanced effect in regions that otherwise are depleted in particles:

In areas where aerosols are otherwise limited, such as remote regions of the Amazon rainforest, ultrafine aerosol particles can have a surprisingly strong effect

In a study conducted over the Amazon rainforest, scientists have shown that tiny particles – smaller than one-thousandth of the width of a human hair – cause storms to intensify, and potentially have knock-on effects for weather around the world.
Jiwen Fan, from the US Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory studied storm formation near the Brazilian city of Manaus. Its 2 million people make Manaus the largest city in the Amazon, and the busy streets and smokey chimneys produce a near permanent pollution plume. 
Fan and her colleagues were able to show that the tiniest particles in this plume spawn massive droplets, leading to heat release, followed by powerful updrafts and super-charged storms. 
Previously, these tiny particles were thought to be too small to aid droplet formation. In pristine areas (such as the Amazon and over oceans) tiny particles could be having a significant effect. 
“The results suggest that, from pre-industrial to the present day, human activity may have changed storms in these regions in powerful ways,” says Fan, whose findings are published in Science.

At that rate the entire UK fleet will be replaced in, oh, 40 years. So, how does that invalidate my point that replacing the entire fleet is going to take ages and be really hard?
BQEND
Because the remaining vehicles that are not EVs will be hybrid and emissions from the total fleet will be minute compared with today's.

Norway will only sell electric and hybrid vehicles starting in 2030.The Netherlands said it will only sell electrified vehicles starting in 2025.India has ambitious goals for electrification, saying it will only sell electric and hybrid vehicles starting in 2030.China has said it will eventually only sell electric and hybrid vehicles, but has yet to set a concrete timeline.The United Kingdom said it will ban the sale of petrol and diesel cars starting in 2040.France has said it will ban the sale of gas and diesel cars by 2040, with the aim of being carbon neutral by 2050.Cities like Barcelona, Copenhagen, and Vancouver all plan to ban gas- and diesel-powered cars by 2030.
This is going to happen - it won't be hard, with manufacturers committing to only build cars with electric motors as well (eg Volvo, Jaguar Land Rover)
I don't think there is a fundamental disagreement on electricity generation.... we can get to 30% penetration of renewables with remarkably little overhead. Expanding the nuclear fleet should provide baseload, and smart demand management will help. We've just seen that the UK has continued to see a downward trend on electricity demand, so I am confident that the mix of sources and management will meet the peak demand without grid degradation.
As for ""things"" I'm not going to read any pages from any source without you explaining what they are. They might be - from your follow-on comment - smart demand management, transmission grid, but it's hard to tell.
On jobs being a cost, they only exist because they bring in more money than they cost. Thinking of jobs as a cost is like a business running by only looking at its expenses and not looking at its revenue or margins. This is basic stuff. It also only looks at jobs from the pov of a commercial organisation and not from the pov of the employee, or from a broader societal angle.

Basic economics again – same output, more people required to produce it = value destruction.
BQEND
It may be basic economics, but you don't understand it. People costs are not the entire cost of a project. Suppose you costed Hinkley C only on the basis of the number of people employed to build and run it. You wouldn't be looking at all the costs, would you ?
Secondly, comparing coal plants (as an example) with wind turbines (as another example), you might conclude that the wind turbines + backup would cost more than running an existing coal plant. But if you then consider the carbon trading floor, that puts a different spin on the costings. And if you consider coal's role in premature deaths in the UK (between £2.5bn and £7bn ) you can see that your ideas about costing are way too simplistic.

Your original assertion (implying that economic reversals were inevitable in a decarbonising world have been shown to be wrong, so you move the goalposts. Now it's too difficult.”No, I quoted _your own source_ back at you that shows that the next phase will be a lot more difficult than the last. The IPCC have built the negative economic impacts of decarbonisation into their models – apologies, I don’t have time to dig it all out but from memory there is mention in Table 1.1 here: https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/spm/sres-en.pdf “The EV revolution is going to hit the car market even harder and faster than BNEF predicted a year ago. EVs are on track to accelerate to 54% of new car sales by 2040. Wow, by 2040 there just over half of new cars will be EVs. At that rate the entire UK fleet will be replaced in, oh, 40 years. So, how does that invalidate my point that replacing the entire fleet is going to take ages and be really hard?“Why does decarbonising the electricity generation system mean a) brownouts b) completely reorganising ""things"" ? (Could you possibly have been less specific ?)”Its complex, but basically Zero carbon sources for base load take a long time to come online, as at the moment we only really have nuclear and pumped storage. The others (PV, wind etc) show significant variation. We have interconnectors, but then you’re just pretending you’re zero carbon when you’ve pushed the CO2 emissions elsewhere. It can be done without brownouts at peak useage, but that will take time to build and CO2 emissions will remain higher during that period. Or you can decarbonise quicker before the base load capacity is in place and accept brownouts at peak times. For more details on reorganising ‘things’ I suggest you start reading on page 62 of the document that you provided a link to and go from there. Transmission network, smart grid monitoring (our domestic and small business smart meter programme is a big missed opportunity there) etc etc. It’s a Guardian CiF comment, there’s no space to go into the engineering specifics but they are very interesting (as I found when working on the smart meters programme).
“Do you have a job ? How silly of me to think that my job benefits me”It does, but the money to pay your wages has to come from somewhere. It’s very basic economics that at a macro level jobs are a cost and if you’re arguing that they are not then I’d start with reading some Keynes and maybe Marx (if you’re a masochist, his translated prose is awful).
“Did you ever hear of innovation and invention ? Obviously not”
Oh dear. Sarcasm. My feelings are hurt. I shall have to go and have a lie down. “Where is the evidence to support this claim ?”
Simple : the output is energy for the country – it is served well by the current infrastructure. We need to spend lots of money on new infrastructure due to external costs not currently priced in to the cost currently paid. Therefore, same good (i.e. energy to do stuff) for a greater cost. Basic economics again – same output, more people required to produce it = value destruction.

""these pauses"" are a long term weather phenomenon due to the phase of the interdecadal Pacific oscillation.
Yesterday where I live, yesterday it was 35 degrees C and 100% humidity. Today it was 25 degrees C. That change in the weather was predicted a few days before it occurred.
Where I live, last summer was the hottest summer since records have been kept with more days in the mid 30s than in the low 30s. This summer has been much cooler with more days in the low 30s than in the mid 30s and now a day in the mid 20s.
This change in the weather from neutral ENSO phase to LA Nina phase was able to be predicted from the Southern Oscillation Index last July.
The neutral ENSO phase year of 2013-14 was much warmer than the neutral ENSO phase year of 2012-13 showing the change in the interdecadal Pacific oscillation and predicting the warmer weather of the coming years.
Weather and weather patterns can be predicted at different increasing periods of time related to the length of time that the weather and the weather patterns occur for. I can't predict the weather for the end of this month. I can't predict the ENSO phase for 2018-19. I can't predict the interdecadal Pacific oscillation for the 2020s.

CFD programs have included temperature and heat transfer parameters as long as I can remember, even if phase change is still only covered with top end packages. More advanced multiphysics simulators add all sorts of other things, such as chemical reactions and EM fields to the simulation.

The rise in atmospheric CO2 causes a rise in the temperature of both the atmosphere and of the oceans. After all the oceans cover 70% of the Earth and have a far greater heat capacity than the atmosphere on account of their very much larger mass.
Over the 15 years from 2000 to 2014 the interdecadal Pacific oscillation was in its negative phase resulting in greater trade wind activity and greater wave mixing of heat down into the deep intermediate ocean waters. During those 15 years more of the extra heat due to global greenhouse warming went into the oceans than usual leaving the atmosphere cooler than usual. So while atmospheric temperatures still rose, they did not rise as fast as they had during the previous 12 years and the following three years during which the interdecadal Pacific oscillation had been in its positive phase and trade winds, consequent wave mixing less and movement of heat into the oceans less.', u'recommendation_count': u'2', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1517485596000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'the rise in atmospheric co2', u'effect': u'a rise in the temperature of both the atmosphere and of the oceans'}, {u'cause': None, u'effect': u'greater trade wind activity and greater wave mixing of heat'}, {u'cause': u'global greenhouse warming', u'effect': u'the extra heat'}], u'author_id': u'12483673', u'in_reply_to': u'111590529', u'id': u'111617284', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Walsunda', u'text': u'Interdecadal Pacific oscillation was in its negative phase.', u'recommendation_count': u'3', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1517483823000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'12483673', u'in_reply_to': u'111590529', u'id': u'111615665', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Walsunda', u'text': u'You keep talking about the ""pause"" but you don't say what has paused.
Is it the pause in global temperature over a period of 10 to 15 years that happened at the start of this century? That was caused by the negative phase of the interdecadal Pacific oscillation which skews ENSO phases toward the cooler La Nina end of their spectrum. A change in the weather over a period of 15 years or so that has happened before.
The models you mention predict global climate temperature. Global climate temperature is the average temperature over a 30 not 15 year period. What happened over the 15 years from 2000 to 2014 does not affect the continued rise in climate temperature as the three years that followed that cooler 15 years and the 12 that preceded it to make up the 30 years that determined the climate temperature up to 2017 were times of positive interdecadal Pacific oscillation phase which contained the the strong and hence hotter El Nino year of 1991-92 and the very strong El Nino years of 1997-98 and 2015-16. That's why global climate temperature has continued to rise this century at the rate at which or greater than the rate at which it rose in the second half of last century. 
Anyone such as you who expects global climate temperature models to predict the global temperature has lost contact with reality. You need 30 years to measure global climate temperature.

This is what the IPCC says (and unlike you, I provide a link, so you can see for yourself [hollow laugh]).Climate is generally defined as average weather, and as such, climate change and weather are intertwined. Observations can show that there have been changes in weather, and it is the statistics of changes in weather over time that identify climate change. While weather and climate are closely related, there are important differences. A common confusion between weather and climate arises when scientists are asked how they can predict climate 50 years from now when they cannot predict the weather a few weeks from now. The chaotic nature of weather makes it unpredictable beyond a few days. Projecting changes in climate (i.e., long-term average weather) due to changes in atmospheric composition or other factors is a very different and much more manageable issue. As an analogy, while it is impossible to predict the age at which any particular man will die, we can say with high confidence that the average age of death for men in industrialised countries is about 75. Another common confusion of these issues is thinking that a cold winter or a cooling spot on the globe is evidence against global warming. There are always extremes of hot and cold, although their frequency and intensity change as climate changes. But when weather is averaged over space and time, the fact that the globe is warming emerges clearly from the data.

Hard to say though, as a slower warming trend is more easily swamped by the noise in the data (ENSO, etc). Hence the lack of statistical significance.
Over a slightly longer period, however, the picture becomes clearer. Over the 20 year period 1998 to now (note: this includes the entire 15 year ""pause""), the surface warming trend is very much statistically significant, and it is also larger - around 0.18C per decade, even with the cherry pickers' favourite start date of 1998.
The fact that the trends over a short period can vary a lot depending on your choice of of dates highlights the importance of the long term trend, rather than the bumps along the way.
Because the short term effects that cause these ""bumps"" tend to work in both directions and exhibit no trend, they don't have a significant effect on the long term trend. That is why the models are working pretty well over extended periods. Not perfect, of course, and they will undoubtedly get better.
As you have pointed out previously, CO2 isn't the only thing that affects temperature - other things do too, and if they suddenly kick in, things could change. However, they haven't been doing that and we have no reason to think they will anytime soon. And of course, if they did, they could just as easily cause more warming, not less (uncertainty works both ways).

""Highly variable Northern Hemisphere temperatures reconstructed from low- and high-resolution proxy data"" - Moberg et al, 2005
The Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age were concepts introduced about 50 years ago by early climate researchers, particularly Hubert Lamb, based on evidence available at that time, but the more they are investigated the more ephemeral they become.
Various sources give different dates for the start and end of the LIA, for example, and it's increasingly disputed that it was a global event.
Many researchers now think the whole concept of the 'Little Ice Age' is misleading as the changes were small-scale and seasonal.
For example, true ice ages involve snow remaining throughout summers across large areas, which didn't happen during the so-called Little Ice Age.
Glacial inception requires summer temperatures in the northern hemisphere to be low enough for snow to build up year on year, starting mainly on north-facing slopes of mountain ranges.
The LIA was quite different to a true ice age, and if you are interested:

Since 1988, it has overseen thousands of scientists pulling together tens of thousands of academic papers on atmospheric physics, meteorology, geography, marine science, economics, land-use and much more. A multi-layered process of expert assessment takes place every six or seven years where a set of carefully worded statements is approved by representatives of 120 of the world’s governments, specifying what we know about the defining challenge of the 21st century: climate change.
It is an incredible, perhaps unprecedented undertaking – but until recently, it has been woefully underserved on the crucial issue of communicating its findings beyond specialist scientific and policy circles. And partly as a result of this, the organisation has historically been saddled with a reputation for being dry, bureaucratic and secretive. 
But things are changing – which is good news for the climate. The IPCC has now recognised that it should take the same approach to communications as it does to science: go with the evidence base.
In a handbook commissioned by the IPCC (Working Group 1, Technical Support Unit) and released on Tuesday, my colleagues and I at Climate Outreach provide social science-based guidance for IPCC scientists to use in their communication and public engagement.
This is the first time advice like this has been produced for the world’s most prestigious climate science organisation, and it represents a timely and welcome shift. The IPCC’s next report will set out in greater clarity than ever before if – and how – we can avoid a rise of more than 1.5C in global temperatures above pre-industrial levels. 
Communicating effectively around this crucial publication is essential, and our handbook sets out six well-established principles to achieve this, including the importance of ensuring the powerful human stories buried deep in the IPCC assessments are not swamped by the “big numbers” that define the science-policy discourse.
Although they are the go-to metrics for scientists and politicians, global temperature targets or atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases are unlikely to be understood or seen as personally relevant by a majority of the public. Starting with the everyday things that climate change is now profoundly influencing – tourism, health, important places – is a better approach, providing a solid grounding in shared values and local interests.
There’s also a big focus in the handbook on showing the “human face behind the science”. By and large, scientists are highly trusted because of their independence, specialist expertise, and credibility. But trust is also about speaking authentically, as a relatable individual, with personal experiences and perspectives (not just a compelling grasp of the data). Who are the IPCC scientists? What are their stories? What is involved in an IPCC process at a human level?
Another exciting development is that the social science of human behaviour is now increasingly making its way into the IPCC assessments themselves, addressing a long-standing blind spot in the long list of topics included in the IPCC’s remit. 
The more social sciences can be integrated into assessments of the causes and consequences of climate change, the better – because one of the biggest uncertainties in any climate model is human behaviour. To properly understand how the climate is changing, and how likely we are to keep its most dangerous effects in check, we need to understand it as a social and cultural challenge as much as a scientific one.
There will no doubt be a small group of hardliners who object to the very idea of scientists being more effective communicators, or including social science research in the assessment reports. But their argument that scientists should refrain from speaking about the societal implications of their vital research is an outmoded and increasingly discredited position.
The science of climate change communication is a much-needed addition to the IPCC’s canon – and an essential next step in the evolution of this unique organisation.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/30/communicating-the-science-is-a-much-needed-step-for-un-climate-panel

The British oil firm’s venture arm has invested $5m (£3.5m) in the US firm Freewire Technologies, which will provide motorbike-sized charging units at forecourts to top up cars in half an hour.
The move follows a bigger move by BP’s Anglo-Dutch rival Shell, which has been on a buying spree of electric car infrastructure companies and has already opened charging points at its service stations. 
While BP would not put a number on how many forecourts would see the chargers, it confirmed the trial would start in the UK during February and March before expanding to European locations later in the year.
Tufan Erginbilgic, the chief executive of BP Downstream, said: “EV charging will undoubtedly become an important part of our business, but customer demand and the technologies available are still evolving.”
The oil firm recently returned to solar power with the $200m investment in a solar developer, and is due to announce its first overarching carbon target soon, as it plays catch-up with other oil majors such as Shell. 
But today marks the company’s first step into electric cars, which it expects to rise a hundredfold by 2035 but not to seriously affect oil demand.
There are around 130,000 electric and plug-in hybrid cars in the UK, but Britain’s biggest charging point firm predicts that number will grow rapidly. 
Chargemaster Plc told an audience in London on Tuesday that it projected the nearly 50,000 plug-in car registrations in 2017 would jump to 70,000 new cars sold in 2018, which it said was a conservative estimate.
Charging infrastructure falls into three categories: slow (less than 7KW, up to 8 hours to charge a car), fast (7-22KW, 3-4 hours) and rapid (50KW and above, typically 30 minutes or less). 
Tom Callow, director of strategy at the group, said the sort of rapid chargers that BP plans to install will be a niche market in the UK. 
“Fast charging is absolutely dominating ... [there is] a smaller circle of people who need rapid charging. The idea you need rapid chargers everywhere, all over the UK, is simply a fallacy... You then have a much much smaller circle of people who need super-rapid charging [350KW],” he said.
However, National Grid, which runs the UK’s electricity transmission network, said that it was in talks with BP, Shell, Ford, BMW, Tesla and other companies about building infrastructure for super rapid chargers at motorway service stations.
Graeme Cooper, the project director of electric vehicles, said that the company had mapped traffic, population and roads and identified 50 sites to ensure most people are in reach of such chargers.
“Fifty strategic locations means to an extent that 96% of UK drivers would be able to drive in any direction from any location in the UK and be in 50 miles of an ultra rapid small charger … To an extent we can probably allay range anxiety,” he said. 
The grid infrastructure for such a plan would cost £0.5-1bn, or around 60p a driver per year if all motorists shouldered the cost, Cooper said. He was dismissive of “doom-mongers” who suggest the UK energy system cannot cope with the cars.
Nissan, whose new longer range Leaf electric car arrives on UK roads in coming months, said on Tuesday that it would fit 1,000 charging points for a trial to test how plug-in cars’ batteries can help power grids, by returning electricity at times of need.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/30/bp-charging-points-electric-cars-uk-petrol-stations

Although motor manufacturers said new models coming on to the market were on average about 12% more fuel-efficient than their older versions, campaigners said a higher proportion of gas-guzzling vehicles leaving the forecourt had led to a 0.8% increase in the average amount of C02 generated per new car. 
Falling consumer confidence has affected the lower end of the car market, with sales of the smallest, cheapest vehicle down by more than 10%. 
The Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders said an “anti-diesel agenda” was contributing to the rise in CO2 emissions. Diesel registrations fell by 17% last year after the emissions scandals. Diesel engines have tended to have greater fuel efficiency than petrol engines, but have been responsible for a rapid rise in NOx emissions and severe air pollution in urban areas. The SMMT said the decline in diesel would make it harder for the UK to hit its CO2 reduction targets.
Its report acknowledged that cheaper running costs may have encouraged committed diesel drivers to buy bigger models, noting: “Consumers appear to have often used the improved efficiency of the products to enable them to move into larger and higher value vehicles.”
Greg Archer, of the cleaner transport campaign group Transport &amp; Environment, said: “The principal reason CO2 emissions are rising is that carmakers are selling more gas-guzzling SUVs. Blaming the slump in diesel sales is a smokescreen that hide their failure to fit fuel efficiency technologies to the new cars they are selling.”
The SMMT said sales of electric cars were disappointing and thatlong-term incentives would be needed to achieve cuts in CO2 emissions of almost 6% a year until 2021 under EU requirements. The industry said confusion over government policy was causing buyers to hold back, particularly tax changes that took effect last April and more announced in the autumn budget. Despite long-term hopes for electric and hybrid vehicles, 95% of the UK’s 2.5m new cars sold were still either petrol or diesel. 
Average emissions for a new car rose to 121.0g of CO2 per kilometre, which was the same as 2015 levels. However, the levels were 33% lower than those in 2000. Estimates of CO2 emissions of the average new car are likely to be 20% higher from September 2018, when tests designed to better reflect normal driving comes into force. 
Total CO2 emissions from all cars in use on UK roads are down just 7% since 2000, according to the SMMT report. This is despite the gradual replacement of vehicles with more efficient models. Emissions have risen over the last three years owing to increased traffic on UK roads. 
Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the SMMT, said: “The industry shares government’s vision of a low-carbon future and is investing to get us there – but we can’t do it overnight; nor can we do it alone. The anti-diesel agenda has set back progress on climate change, while electric vehicle demand remains disappointingly low amid consumer concerns around charging infrastructure availability and affordability. 
“To accelerate fleet renewal, motorists must have the confidence to invest in the cleanest cars for their needs – however they are powered. A consistent approach to incentives and tax, and greater investment in charging infrastructure will be critical.”
Sales of new cars declined by 5.7% last year after five years of growth, with plunging diesel sales after the government signalled tax changes on company cars and cities considered punitive measures to tackle air quality after the VW diesel test-rigging scandal.

Under the green manifesto, new diesel cars will be taken off the car market in Ibiza, Majorca, Menorca and Formentera from 2025 – the same year that all street and road lighting will be replaced by LEDs.
Solar panels will be installed on all buildings with roof spans of more than 1,000 square metres – car parks, hospitals, supermarkets and sports stadiums – coal plants will be phased out and, by 2035, all car hire fleets on the islands will be electrified.
Francina Armengol, the president of the Balearics’ socialist-green government, said their territorial limits made them “an ideal space to promote electromobility and to expand renewable energy so that it eventually becomes our only source of power.” 
“We are very aware that plenty of the measures in the law we are announcing today demand efforts from the public and private sectors,” she said. “It has to be this way if the law is to be more than a mere statement of intent.”
Joan Groizard, the islands’ director-general for climate change said the move put them on a path to confrontation with Madrid, and his government was studying the legal implications “very carefully”. 
“There is a live debate about what regions can and can’t do, and we are working very practically on the legal side of this,” he told the Guardian.
“We can’t ratify the Paris agreement on our own but we can take a decision to adhere to it. Climate change is already having a big impact on our islands and hopefully our actions can have a knock-on effect elsewhere.”
Water bills on the archipelago have surged recently due to more frequent droughts and storms, while warming waters have brought seasonal jellyfish plagues and degraded marine ecosystems.
Spain’s prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, has promised to bring forward a delayed national climate plan this year, as climate change concerns have grown. 
But environmentalists have been alarmed by governmental attempts to seek a royal decree preventing the shutdown of coal plants in the country’s north.
A ministry spokesperson said that public consultations for a draft climate law were still under way and that Spain maintained an ambitious renewables policy, despite biting cuts to subsidies.
“In the Balearics, the difference [is that] the cost of energy production is subsidised and included in the electricity bill of all the Spanish citizens,” the official said. “Therefore, the energy policy [requires] consensus between the different Spanish administrations.”
The question of whether Madrid or Spain’s regions exercise responsibility for energy policy will ultimately determine the fate of the Balearics climate plan.
Last month, Spain’s constitutional court froze a similarly ambitious climate change act passed by the restive parliament in Catalonia.
The Balearics government says that if its climate plan is blocked, it will refuse to upgrade its Alcúdia coal plant in Majorca in time to meet a 2020 deadline for new EU emissions limits.
Most of the Balearics’ energy comes from this complex – whose planning permission approvals are controlled by the islanders’ government, according to Groizard. 
“If we sit on our hands and do nothing then on 1 January 2020, the plant will not be able to work, because it will be in breach of the EU legislation,” he said. “We are hoping it won’t go that far. But we do have pockets of sovereignty – or power – that we’re planning to use if we need to.”
Groizard argues that rather than spend €100m in compliance costs for a polluting plant, the money should be invested in clean energies. The Balearics’ plan would close one half of the coal plant by 2020 and the other half by 2030, after consultations with plant workers.
Juan López de Uralde, a Green MP in Madrid said the plan had the potential to stir a wider rebellion. “If the government continues with its paralysis [on climate change], a united front could happen,” he said, citing Andalucia – currently drafting its own climate plan – Castilla La Manca, Valencia and Catalonia as potential allies.
Marta Subirà, Catalonia’s environment minister, said climate shocks from rising sea levels and damage to two local deltas – along with heatwaves and forest fires – provided “a reason for this kind of [united] front”.
The governments of Catalonia and the Balearic Islands have already combined to prevent offshore drilling along their shared coast, and the Balearics had taken Catalonia’s climate law as “a role model”, Subirà said.
“It is an alert to the Spanish government to tell them that this is the moment to act,” she told the Guardian. “They can’t hide anymore and we are ready to do it.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/15/balearics-launch-pioneering-plan-to-phase-out-emissions

Although it has been well below freezing as athletes prepared for the Winter Olympics in South Korea this week, winter temperatures in the Alps, where many British competitors train, could rise by up to 4C by 2100. By then, only six of the past 19 Winter Olympics venues could be sufficiently cold to act as host cities.
The Met Office has warned the skiing industry in Scotland could collapse within 50 years as winters become too mild for regular snowfall.
The Team GB snowboarder Aimee Fuller, whose annual training venue in Switzerland has undergone huge change in the past decade, said: “Snowboarding is really susceptible to the impact of climate change and we can see the impact on our sport in the mountains on a daily basis.”
In the UK, the governing bodies of cricket and golf are growing increasingly concerned about the effect of extreme weather related to climate change. According to the England and Wales Cricket Board, 27% of England’s home one-day internationals have been played with reduced overs since 2000 because of rain. At least 175 days of play, equivalent to around 16,000 overs, have been lost in five of the past 10 years in the County Championship.
Some of the most famous golf courses in the country, including St Andrews, are at threat from climate related coastal erosion, according to the report from the Climate Coalition, which also notes the toll extreme weather is taking on junior football.
The future of county cricket is in jeopardy, according to Dan Cherry, the head of operations at Glamorgan, where the rate of rain-affected matches has more than doubled since 2011.
“Our experience is becoming the norm for almost every club and it’s difficult even for first-class counties to be commercially viable with such an impact,” Cherry said. “It’s been worst in recent years – during the 2017 season five of our seven T20 Blast fixtures were badly affected by rain, with three being totally abandoned. T20 Blast is a great way to get new people through the gates but they won’t come back if this keeps happening and it’s damaged the club to the tune of £1m. If we don’t take it seriously, climate change will fundamentally alter the game.”
Sea-level rise poses the most serious threat to golf in the UK, including at St Andrews, known as the home of golf. Some believe a 20% decline in golf club membership since 2005 can be partially ascribed to worsening weather trends.
Steve Isaac, the director of sustainability at the R&amp;A, said: “Golf is impacted by climate change more than most other sports. We are witnessing different types and timings of disease, pest and weed outbreaks.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/07/golf-cricket-snowsports-threat-climate-change

Well nuclear power plants do not emit CO2 in operation AND they chuck away a lot of heat. So not only do you stop CO2 emissions in electricity generation with nuclear power you also get waste heat like this..........https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beznau_Nuclear_Power_Plant#Refuna_nuclear_district_heating142GWh of thermal energy for next to nothing from just one fairly small plant.Now that the CO2 has been ""captured"" how to sequester it? Turn it into a building product.http://www.calera.com/beneficial-reuse-of-co2/process.htmlTurning it into a building product simultaneously stops emissions from the cement production industry.So where do you get the alkali and calcium to drive this process? Yet more waste.https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652615013396Notice that two of the bullet points are that 2 billion tonnes of alkali waste are produced annually and that it is good for CO2 sequestration.The biggest source of alkali waste is Aluminium smelting which also generates raw calcium in the refining (Bayer process)So join it all up - Nuclear power plant runs the aluminium smelter, waste heat traps CO2 from the atmosphere using Climeworks amine adsorption, CO2 permanently sequestered into the built environment using Calera process and smelter waste. A whole load of bad products and waste both stops CO2 emissions and withdraws CO2 from the atmosphere and makes profit throughout the system. Pie in the sky?

going through the list is interesting - the first three- Tranatomic, Terrestrial and Martingale are offering CAD versions of the Oak Ridge reactor- there seems very little actual novelty and their websites make a point that there is no new designing and hence no research is needed. 
Feb 2017-Nuclear energy startup Transatomic Power has backed away from bold claims for its advanced reactor technology after an informal review by MIT professors highlighted serious errors in the company’s calculations, MIT Technology Review has learned.and the list also includes MIT who built the first.
all of the companies doing molten salt are selling their version of MIT and seems at least one didn't get its maths right.
Arc are going for the EBR II- and appear to be teaming up with HitachiGen4 energy are going with a Los Alamos design.
and on it goes- interesting certainly but these all seem paper designs based on decades old research and even the original public funded labs part of the process.
and with none [except the S Prism] even remotely being planned for construction.There are numerous start up companies looking at different battery chemistries and there is probably $million wrapped up in each but EV enthusiasts have all heard of these wonder batteries- they have their press releases and stands at shows- and the general view is they will believe it when they see it.
My OP was simply that [with the exception of Rosatom in Turkey{ a unique deal that raises eyebrows}] there is no private money going into nuclear builds.It is a fact, the days of investment seen in the US in the 1970s is over- right or wrong - nuclear is built by governments.Some loose change is going into quite speculative start ups- and with a tight field 50 companies would rapidly reduce down to a handful.

But let's look at the actual report- it says 'committed $1.5 billion', that is not actual $1.5 billion - the normal term for actual money is 'invested'. But say the money is in the bank- divided between 50 companies is a staggering .......$30 million each. that does not build much reactor or even build a test rig. It is the kind of money used for advertising. 
to put that number into context - according to Bloomberg investments -
The numbers for the July-to-September quarter mean that investment in 2017 so far is running 2% above that in the same period of last year, suggesting that the annual total is likely to finish up close to, or a little ahead of, 2016’s figure of $287.5 billion

frankly BS.
Fast breeder research has a mixed history- the French was a technical nightmare- it cost fortunes, took ages to get up to speed and caused a huge amount of public hostility.
Japan's Monju has been an expensive disaster with cover ups of accidents.
The UK test reactor caused very little public concern but it was the industry who moved on.
The Russians seem to have quietly got on with having an almost commercial version
The EBR II ran tests for decades and the accumulated learning was a success, allowing for the potential of a commercial version.
And like putting a satellite in space or having nuclear weapons or whatever leading technology is seen to be world leading the Chinese and Indians are building their own fast breeder reactors.
The main concern for PRISM in the UK is not from the public, it is the nuclear regulators who feel there is little evidence of the skills and technology required to produce the fuel and run the project.
I just think it is telling that cost either of the build or electricity supplied is mentioned.

Again just plain wrong and indicative of a cavalier attitude to facts and the truth . The technologies used in PRISM were developed at the Argonne National Laboratory and the EBR-II was on the Idaho campus (now Idaho National Lab). Technologies such as the successful implementation of metal (rather than oxide, carbide, and nitride) fuel that did not exist in the 1960s. Metal fuel is key to the passive safety of PRISM. Other reasearchers had tried and failed with metal fuel. Pyroprocessing for recycling of spent fuel did not exist in the 1960s. These are key technologies and pretending that PRISM is just a rework of a 60's reactor is the height of ignorance and dishonesty.
The Argonne work remains a huge landmark in nuclear energy. It demonstrated, for the first time and at engineering scale:
* Passive, walk away, safety. No external safety systems, no power needed and no operator intervention needed.
* Full demonstration of fuel recycling and a closed nuclear fuel cycle.
Which is of course why anti-nukes try their best with misinformation and falsehoods to belittle these achievements.

there is no new reactor design- even pebble fuel reactors that have been presented as new cutting edge safe technology is pretty ancient with all the engineering limitations unresolved.
BQEND
The greens have blocked reactor development for decades and now criticise the industry for not having new, safer and more economic designs.
The Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactor (LFTR) is a breeder design. (Though not a ""fast"" breeder as it uses slow ""thermal"" neutrons.)
It breeds thorium into U233 which is then used as fuel. The design is passively safe and cannot meltdown. It can also burn high level waste from spent fuel rods (high level waste) from the current reactor fleet. The waste produced from the LFTR design requires a much more reasonable 300 years of isolation storage.
There are other molten salt liquid fuelled reactor designs in development, but due to the fear and loathing in the west none will be developed here. They will be developed in China and perhaps India. When greenhouse warming starts to produce undeniable catastrophes, the world will scramble to install them to try to avert utter disaster. Probably too late.

BQSTART
.So the material streams flowing into and out of nuclear reactors are small, relative to fossil-fuel streams. “Small is beautiful,” but the fact that the nuclear waste stream is small doesn’t mean that it’s not a problem; it’s just a “beautifully small” problem.

Is this accepting decommissioning is an expensive aspect of nuclear?Economics of cleanup
BQSTART
What’s the cost of cleaning up nuclear power sites? The nuclear decommissioning authority has an annual budget of £2 billion for the next 25 years.E The nuclear industry sold everyone in the UK 4 kWh/d for about 25 years, so the nuclear decommissioning authority’s cost is 2.3 p/kWh.E That’s a hefty subsidy – though not, it must be said, as hefty as the subsidy currently given to offshore wind (7 p/kWh).

So to stay still and extract a little each year we need to grow about 15 billion cu metres of wood each year.To give an idea of scale the amount of carbon currently locked up in trees, plants and forests -
BQSTART
Forests store nearly 1200 billion tonnes of carbon globally: 350 billion tonnes in vegetation (including the roots) and 800 billion tonnes below ground in the soil. This is more than the total amount of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (750 billion tonnes carbon).
BQEND
but part of the contribution to CO2 AGW is 6 billion tonnes from of forest being lost, or soil losing carbon.
Each tonne of carbon in a tree, is about 3 tonnes of carbon 'sucked' out of the atmosphere but as trees have a lot water it is about 1 cu metre of tree = 1 tonne of CO2.
So the first thing is to stop adding by stop felling forests.
But lets imagine the whole of the Sahara could be planted, and that the amount of energy required to desalinate sea water- pump it to the desert, build the roads, house and feed the foresters and instal all the infrastructure was cost free [or cheap] and provided with solar panels.So each hectare will soak up at least 5 tonnes a year up to 10 tonnes as the forest matures- but effectively stop after maturity is reached- i.e 500 tonnes.The Sahara is 900 million hectares - and if planted it could absorb about 5 billion tonnes each year- but any fire, any death in the forest would see that carbon released.
So 5 billion tonnes a year out our total each year that remains in the atmosphere is big chunk- of the 15 billion give or take that needs to be removed.The Sahara is a big desert- but what of the other deserts? Well most are either too high or too cold - The Kalahari, the Great Australian and the Arabian make up about half the size of the Sahara- so perhaps another 2.5 billion tonnes of CO2 could be extracted.
So we simply run out of land.Greening a desert is no easy task- it would certainly be exciting and great human effort, and a lot of desert is rock- it simply will not grow forest.China over 30 years ago started to green Inner Mongolia’s Kubuqi Desert, around 18,600 sq km 1,860,000 hectares mainly to stop shifting sands burying fertile land- and they have re greened about a third although returning it to grassland steppe.So anything is possible- to a degree but planting trees is not going to save us- not cutting them down is the first thing to address.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1517513251000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'4738374', u'id': u'111639506', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'ComfortablyPlumb', u'text': u'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/14/plankton-explosion-turns-istanbuls-bosphorus-turquoise#comment-100479002

From simply planting trees to filtering CO2 out of the air, the technologies that some hope could be a “silver bullet” in halting global warming either risk huge damage to the environment themselves or are likely to be very costly.
Virtually all the pathways laid out by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to reach the targets in the Paris agreement require huge deployment of so-called negative emissions technologies (NETs) in the second half of the century. 
This is because cuts in CO2 are expected to be too slow to hit zero emissions quickly enough, so the overshoot has to be recaptured later by NETs. The IPCC calculates that about 12bn tonnes a year will need to be captured and stored after 2050 – the equivalent of about a third of all global emissions today.
“You can rule out a silver bullet,” said Prof John Shepherd, at the University of Southampton, UK, and an author of the report. “Negative emissions technologies are very interesting but they are not an alternative to deep and rapid emissions reductions. These remain the safest and most reliable option that we have.”
The new report is from the European Academies Science Advisory Council (EASAC), which advises the European Union and is comprised of the national science academies of the 28 member states. It warns that relying on NETs instead of emissions cuts could fail and result in severe global warming and “serious implications for future generations”. 
The report assesses the range of possible technologies, including “bioenergy with carbon capture and storage” (BECCS), on which the IPCC scenarios rely heavily. BECCS involves growing trees, which take CO2 from the atmosphere, and then burning them to produce electricity while capturing the emissions and burying them.
But Prof Michael Norton, EASAC’s programme director and another author of the report, said: “There are severe drawbacks.” These include the huge amount of land needed and the energy need to produce and deliver the fuel. Furthermore, it could worsen the enormous loss of wildlife – the sixth mass extinction – already occurring. “The biodiversity impact at the colossal scale envisaged would be severe,” Norton said.
Planting new forests and improving soils could take CO2 out of the air at relatively low cost, the report found, but currently the world is losing trees and soil and reversing these trends is already a major challenge.
The most high-tech prospect is filtering CO2 directly out of the air, but only one such plant currently exists in the world, trapping just 1,000 tonnes a year. As well as the technical difficulties, there is also no widespread or significant tax on CO2 emissions. “At the moment no one will do this, as no one will pay,” said Shepherd.
Nonetheless, the report says research and development on NETs must continue because they could play an important, smaller role in dealing with emissions that are very hard to avoid, such as those from the global aviation industry. 
“People are now talking about electric aircraft but I don’t expect to fly in one in my lifetime,” said Shepherd. “It may be cheaper to find a way of removing it from the atmosphere and letting the planes continue to fly.”
“The new report is scientifically sound and politically important,” said Phil Williamson, at the University of East Anglia, UK. 
“Its main message is clear enough: don’t put off the clean-up for 50 years, as is currently the case in most emission-scenarios that avoid climate chaos. The key issues are now of scale: the scaling-down of the unrealistic use of negative emissions in climate models and the scaling-up of ambition to achieve net zero emissions, as rapidly as possible.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/01/silver-bullet-to-suck-co2-from-air-and-halt-climate-change-ruled-out

The table I provided shows all countries that pledged had paid into the fund by June 2nd 2017
BQEND
The Trump statement (on June 1st, not June 2nd !) was about withdrawing from ""The Paris Agreement"". The specific quote was about ""The Global Climate Fund (GCF)"".
There is room for confusion here, and if you are talking about ""countries THAT PLEDGED"" funds to the GCF then the use of ""most of them haven’t even paid anything"" is indeed incorrect.
However, from your PDF of the status on 23/6/2017, 3 weeks after Trump's statement, there is an ""Amounts Announced but Not Yet Signed"" table straddling pages 64 and 65 showing that Colombia, Finland, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, Mongolia [ ""Pledged -> Announced"" = $0.0 million ??? ], Peru and Vietnam had all ""pledged"" money but not actually paid it yet (""disbursed / deposited"" it to the UN).
Not only is your claim that ALL ""pledges"" had been paid by June 2017 incorrect, only Mongolia (with a ""pledge"" of 0.0 !) had moved to the ""Amounts Announced, Signed, and Disbursed"" table by 29/1/2018, the ""Amounts Announced but Not Yet Signed"" table still contained the other 7 country names (although they only account for $153.9 million of the ""Grand Total"" pledged of $10,302.2 million).

Anyway a constitutional republic and a democratic state are not mutually exclusive concepts. So what on Earth are you talking about?

AR5 prefers the term ""Medieval Climate Anomaly"" (MCA) to ""Medieval Warm Period"". Chapter 5, section 5.3.5.1 discussed work since AR4 on the MCA and LIA. It notes that the timing and spatial structure of the MCA and LIA are complex, with different reconstructions exhibiting warm and cold conditions at different times for different regions and seasons. A combination of NH temperature reconstructions shows mostly warm conditions from about 950 to about 1250 and colder conditions from about 1450 to about 1850, which are taken to represent the times of the MCA and LIA. 
They express high confidence that the mean NH temperature of the last 30 or 50 years exceed 30- or 50-year means of the past 800 years, and medium confidence that the last 30 years were likely the warmest 30-year period of the last 1400 years.[5]

I not sure which ""Mann's graph"" you're referring to, but I'm referring to the graph of annual Northern Hemisphere temperature over the last 1,000 years attributed to Michael Mann from the 2001 IPCC report and reprinted in the New Scientist of 16 May 2007. It shows Northern Hemisphere annual temperatures declining slowly from 1000 AD to the late 19th century with variations up and down of at most 0.3 degrees C over periods generally less than 30 years. Maybe you regard a slowly declining annual temperature with that degree of variation as stable. It could be seen as such when compared to the steep and much larger rise in annual temperature seen since the late 19th century.
""So it was a straight line that eliminated the MWP"" (medieval warm period) ""and LIA"" (little ice age) ""out of existence.""
Once again I'm not sure what graph you're looking at. The one I'm looking at attributed to Michael Mann from the 2001 IPCC Report is not a straight line and has the variations that I described just above.
The medieval warm period is defined as the period in this graph from 1000 AD to 1250 AD. As the overall trend from 1000 AD to the late 19th century is one of a slow decline in temperature the period from 1000 AD to 1250 AD is warmer than the period from 1250 AD to the late 19th century. Michael Mann's graph also shows a slow rise to a temperature peak at 1100 AD and a steeper rise to a higher peak at 1175 AD. You have not said what you mean by a medieval warm period but these two peaks could be regarded as evidence of such a time.
The little ice age is attributed to the period between 1300 AD and 1870 AD, a period cooler than the current annual temperatures due to the downward slope of that temperature trend from 1000 AD to 1870 AD and the subsequent steeper rise of about 1 degree C. Steep troughs occur at 1300 AD and 1400 AD with shallower troughs at 1600 AD, 1700 AD and the first 70 years of the 19th century. You have not said what you mean by the ""little ice age"" but these troughs could be regarded as evidence of such a time.
""That has now been corrected in AR 5 the graphs we were talking about."" The graph attributed to Michael Mann that I've been talking about (as well as the graphs from AR5) is from the IPCC 2001 report AR3. I don't know which ""Mann's graph"" you're talking about but from your description in does not resemble the one from the 2001 IPCC report reprinted in New Scientist in 2007. The 2001 graph shows the annual temperature peaks of the warmer times from 1000 AD to 1250 AD sometimes referred to as the medieval warm period and the troughs of 1300 AD to 1970 period sometimes referred to as the little ice age; all occurring around a slowly declining trend in annual temperatures.', u'recommendation_count': u'8', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1517801843000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'it shows stable temperatures right up until modern times', u'effect': u""well walsunda mann 's graph was called the stick""}, {u'cause': u'the downward slope of that temperature trend from 1000 ad to 1870 ad and the subsequent steeper rise of about 1 degree c. steep troughs', u'effect': u'the current annual temperatures'}], u'author_id': u'12483673', u'in_reply_to': u'111770939', u'id': u'111772081', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'reinhardpolley', u'text': u'It’s true that real, inflation-adjusted wages are rising under Trump — up 1.1 percent during his first 11 months.

Tommy Tucker used the below quote from the IPCC 2013 in a response to me. Go up and read the thread for full context.

Changes in many extreme weather and climate events have been observed since about 1950. Some of these changes have been linked to human influences, including a decrease in cold temperature extremes, an increase in warm temperature extremes, an increase in extreme high sea levels and an increase in the number of heavy precipitation events in a number of regions.

By all means. We'll stick to peer-reviewed scientific papers as a reputable source of predictions and we'll see that they have been remarkably accurate. Sorry that this will offend your religious beliefs, but let's remember that they (religious beliefs) are founded on untestable faith, whereas climate science is clear, consistent and has no serious challenges.

It was difficult to raise an eyebrow when the story broke that Trump paid off a porn star to remain silent about their affair, which happened just after his third wife had given birth to his fifth child, because it’s Donald Trump – of course he did.
Likewise, when Trump made a number of grossly ignorant and wrong comments about climate change in an interview with Piers Morgan last week, my first reaction was ‘it’s Donald Trump – of course he did.’
But that’s not okay. Donald Trump is the leader of the country most culpable for the existential threat that we’ve created by rapidly changing Earth’s climate. His administration is alone in the world in declaring that we need not worry about that existential threat. We need to hold him to account for his ignorance on this critically important issue and demand better.
Trump’s climate comments in the interview were so ridiculously misinformed that even late night comedians were able to debunk them:
They’re claims you might expect from a YouTube troll, not the leader of the country that produces some of the best climate science research and data in the world. It would be easy to laugh them off as Trump’s usual buffoonery, but he should be held to a presidential standard. So, to briefly debunk each of these myths:
In his State of the Union speech this week, Trump didn’t even mention climate change. His only related comment was that “we have ended the war on beautiful clean coal.” It’s another completely nonsensical statement. There was arguably a ‘war on coal’ (which coal lost), but there’s near-universal support for ‘clean coal’ technologies (those which reduce and capture coal’s various pollutants, most notably carbon dioxide). Does Trump understand the difference? It’s Donald Trump – of course he doesn’t.
Trump’s misinformed comments in the Morgan interview extended beyond climate science into the realm of climate policy:
I believe in clean air. I believe in crystal-clear, beautiful … I believe in just having good cleanliness in all. Now, with that being said, if somebody said go back into the Paris accord, it would have to be a completely different deal because we had a horrible deal.
Trump may “believe in” clean air and water, but his EPA has taken countless steps to weaken regulations of air and water pollutants. Regardless of what he believes, his administration’s actions are creating dirtier air and water.
As for the Paris accord, it could not have been a better deal for America. In the agreement, the US committed to reduce its carbon pollution at approximately the same rate it was already declining. To meet that pledge would simply have required following through with existing American climate policies. Instead, Trump and his EPA administrator Scott Pruitt decided to take every possible step to undo those climate policies. Not only did they repeal the Clean Power Plan – America’s most robust effort to tackle climate change – but they even went so far as to erect posters at EPA buildings gloating about it:
EPA has put these posters up at agency buildings. Celebrating regulatory rollbacks pic.twitter.com/vwGHy54oq9
However, even if Trump and Pruitt succeed in increasing American carbon pollution, there would have been no penalties for missing the Paris targets. The agreement was non-binding. In short, America could easily have met its pledges had the Trump administration so desired, but failing to do so carried no concrete consequences. How can a deal get any better than that?
The answer is that Paris was a great deal, but Trump campaigned on bluster that every deal entered by the Obama administration was the worst in world history (also see the Iran deal), and thus essentially forced himself to withdraw from those deals. Trump’s claims that he may re-enter the Paris agreement if America gets ‘a better deal’ are nonsensical.
While this is all behavior that we’ve come to expect from Donald Trump, that doesn’t make it okay. He may be America’s worst-ever president, but he’s still the leader of one of the world’s most powerful countries, with some of the world’s best scientific resources at his disposal. That his science advisor is effectively Fox News, as Andrew Freedman put it, is unacceptable and dangerous.
Americans clearly made a terrible mistake in electing him president (though 61% of voters did realize Trump is unqualified for the job), but it’s a mistake they won’t be able to remedy until 2020. Congress could act as a co-equal branch and pass climate legislation, but Americans put Republicans in charge of that institution as well, and with the exception of the party’s 34 Climate Solutions Caucus members, they’re also content to ignore the existential threat of climate change. However, Americans will have the opportunity to remedy that mistake this November.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/feb/01/its-not-okay-how-clueless-donald-trump-is-about-climate-change

Bizarrely the Number 1 policy initiative for this gop cult to date has been to deliver Tax-Relief to the 'donors' & the less than 1% * of the American population. Add to this the cynical strategy of saddling the next non-gop administration with such an enormous National debt that the next administration will be unable to adequettly support a social security net which includes Medicare for the elderly & Medicaid as well as other significant funding programs for the working class and middle class that would see some of their tax-payer dollars coming back to them. *Tax relief for working & middle class Americans has been designed to run out by 2020.

It seems rather bizarre to portray the Sierra Club as a champion of clean energy.Time magazine revealed that the Sierra Club had taken over $25 million in secret donations from the gas industry to promote the ""bridge fuel"" agenda for gas:

Exclusive: How the Sierra Club Took Millions From the Natural Gas Industry—and Why They Stopped TIME, 2 Feb 2012 
TIME has learned that between 2007 and 2010 the Sierra Club accepted over $25 million in donations from the gas industry, mostly from Aubrey McClendon, CEO of Chesapeake Energy — one of the biggest gas drilling companies in the U.S. and a firm heavily involved in fracking.
The news of the gas industry donation — which had been kept anonymous until now, as many of Club’s gifts from individuals and corporations are — is particularly worrisome for the Sierra Club because its former executive director Carl Pope had been vocal in supporting natural gas as an alternative to coal. 
BQEND
They're still at it. They're now opposing carbon taxes. In November 2016, Washington state voted on a measure — Initiative 732 — to introduce a revenue neutral carbon tax. The measure was defeated after opposition by the Sierra Club.
BQSTART
You’d think the Sierra Club would back carbon-cutting I-732 — but you’d be wrong Seattle Times, September 30, 2016 
The Sierra Club is grappling with a backlash from Washington state members over a decision to withhold support for Initiative 732, the carbon-tax measure on the November ballot.
The Sierra Club is a powerhouse group in Washington state, with some 24,000 chapter members. But the club’s “do not support” position on Initiative 732 has caused some longtime members to quit.
“To me, this is the issue of our time and we’re shooting ourselves in the foot. It’s a tragedy,” said Erika Shriner, a Bainbridge Island climate activist and 20-year member who resigned from the Sierra Club.

Here's how,article,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/01/climate-change-action-trump,0,"The most telling item in Donald Trump’s State of the Union address may have been what wasn’t there: any mention of climate change, the greatest problem the world faces. And just as telling was the fact that official Washington seemed barely to notice.
Understandably preoccupied with his vile attacks on immigrants (or cheering his ability to actually stay with one task for one hour), press, pundits, and other politicians treated the omission as not even worthy of note. The Democratic response from Representative Joe Kennedy didn’t touch on global warming, either, though it did avoid Trump’s oddly intimate ode to “beautiful clean coal”. This means many things, but for climate campaigners one of them should be patently clear: if we’re going to make progress on climate change it’s not going to come through Washington DC – not any time soon. 
Even if Democrats manage to take back the House and Senate in the midterm elections, they wouldn’t be able to get meaningful legislation past Trump – and there’s nothing much to suggest they’d try very hard. 
Winning those elections is crucial in other ways – it will help the effort to play defense on issues including the environment – but since global warming is an immediate battle with enormous consequences, we dare not wait for Washington to return to sanity. 
And happily, we don’t have to. 
The strategy that’s been evolving for US climate action – and for action in many other parts of the planet – bypasses the central governments as much as possible. That’s because the oil industry is strongest in national capitols – that’s where its money is most toxically powerful. But if frontal attack is therefore hard, its flanks are wide open. 
Consider what happened in mid-January, for instance, when New York City declared war on the oil industry, pledging to divest its $200bn pension funds of fossil fuel stocks and announcing that it would sue the five biggest energy majors for the damage they knowingly inflicted by not ’fessing up to their knowledge of climate change. 
This fight is going aggressively local, and fast
New York City is not as big as the federal government, but it’s big enough: it’s got lawyers aplenty, and the resources to do real damage. And it won’t be alone. We’ve just launched a huge Fossil Free US campaign, designed to make sure there are a thousand New Yorks working on a thousand fronts. 
It has three main components.
The first – joining in work pioneered by groups like the Sierra Club – is to persuade towns, cities, counties, and states to pledge to make the transition to 100% renewable energy. This is now easy and affordable enough that it doesn’t scare politicians – cities from San Diego to Atlanta have joined in, and they will help maintain the momentum towards clean energy that the Trump administration is trying so hard to blunt. 
Job two is to block new fossil fuel infrastructure. In some places, that will be by law: Portland, Oregon, recently passed a bill banning new pipes and such, over the strenuous objections of the industry. In other places it will take bodies – tens of thousands have already pledged to journey to the upper midwest if and when TransCanada decides to build out the Keystone XL pipeline that Trump has permitted. 
And third is to cut off the money that fuels this industry – by divestment, which has now begun to take a real and telling toll ($6tn worth of endowments and portfolios have joined the fight, and studies show it is cutting the capital companies need to keep exploring for oil we don’t), and by the kinds of lawsuits that New York, San Francisco and a host of other cities have already filed. 
Those actions keep the industry off balance, affecting its future plans and weakening its balance sheet even as solar and wind get cheaper all the time. If you want a shorthand version: Sun, Sit (in) and Sell/Sue. 
Yes, it would be easier if the country, and the planet, were acting together – if Washington were leading the fight the way the planet’s superpower obviously should. But since it isn’t, the pressure will find other outlets. 
This fight is going aggressively local, and fast. ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/01/climate-change-action-trump

The heat has led to a shortage of fans that prime minister Jacinda Ardern jokingly referred to as “fan-ageddon”. Ardern said that while many people were probably enjoying a great summer, they also needed to consider the long-term consequences of climate change, including sea-level rise.
Figures released by the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research indicate the average temperature during January was 20.3C (68.5F). That was more than three degrees above normal and beat the previous record of 19.6C set in February 1998. Record-keeping began in 1909.
Gregor Macara, a climate scientist with the weather agency, said that warmer seas, generally settled weather and more winds from the tropical north had led to the higher temperatures. He said climate change was an underlying and contributing factor.
February began on a different note as New Zealand was hit by a tropical storm that brought heavy rainfall, flooding and cooler temperatures. But Macara said the agency still anticipates temperatures for the month will be higher than normal.
New Zealand has a relatively mild climate that is moderated by the surrounding ocean.
The warm temperatures and lack of rainfall in parts of the South Island have prompted the government to declare a drought in those areas.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/02/january-hottest-month-ever-recorded-new-zealand

It needs looking after’,article,http://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/feb/02/astronaut-thomas-pesquet-earth-is-just-a-big-spaceship-with-a-very-big-crew-,0,"As divisions between them widen on Earth, space must be where countries show they can work together for a common good, France’s best-known astronaut has said in a powerful plea for international cooperation beyond the final frontier.
“From up there, the Earth seems so small, so tiny, so … the same,” said Thomas Pesquet, who spent 196 days, 17 hours and 49 minutes in space on the 50th and 51st expeditions to the International Space Station (ISS), returning in June last year. 
“There are no borders. Even your own country – it’s impossible to make out where France ends, and Germany begins. You just realise, very strongly, how much we all share the same problems, how much we are, all of us, almost identical.”
Pesquet, who arrived on the ISS six months after his friend, Britain’s Tim Peake, left it, said the joint project between the US, Russian, Japanese, Canadian and European space agencies was a potent symbol of how countries can cooperate above the Earth even as below, interests diverge and tensions mount.
“Today no single country can go into space on its own,” he said. “The days when even the US could do that are long gone. And of course, up there, it’s very clear: you can only work together. You may have different views, but you have to get along. You have to make it work, every day, because you’re on the same spaceship.”
Pesquet, 39, said his spell in space – which made him so famous in France that a semi-serious campaign was launched for him to enter the presidential race – had brought home to him the urgent need for more, not less, international cooperation in the face of the planet’s “extraordinary fragility”.
Known as the overview effect, the experience of observing from 250 miles up the reality of Earth in the vastness of space has long been known to produce a cognitive shift in some astronauts. It transformed Pesquet into a militant environmentalist. 
“I was already concerned about climate change and global warming,” he said, “but in a general way, like everyone else. But it’s happening on such a vast scale that from close up, it’s hard for us to grasp. In space, you take this huge step back. You experience it, fully. That really changes something.”
Throughout his entire half-year stay, Pesquet said, he had been unable to take a clear picture of Beijing. “You see the air pollution: it’s right there,” he said. “You see the river and sea pollution. You see the clear-cutting in the Amazon. You see how much smaller South America’s glaciers are than they were a few years ago.”
Viewed from orbit, what Pesquet called our “tiny, fragile planet, this delicate band of atmosphere that holds all of life, with nothing else all around it for billions of light years” prompted an obvious if startling comparison. 
“The Earth is actually just a big spaceship, with a very, very big crew,” he said. “It really has to travel sensibly, be maintained and looked after properly, or its voyage is going to come to an end. That’s how it felt to me. That was my experience.”
The obvious need for international cooperation – despite “frictions” created, for example, by Britain’s vote to leave the EU, Russia’s annexation of Crimea and Donald Trump’s decision to pull the US out of the Paris accords, which Pesquet has publicly dubbed irresponsible – has made high-profile projects in which countries “work visibly together” all the more important, Pesquet said. 
While he regrets the Brexit vote, Pesquet, who was in London to take part in an embassy event marking France’s Night of Ideas, said he did not necessarily expect it to have a major impact on the Britain’s space programme beyond UK involvement in EU-run projects such as the Galileo GPS programme (whose back-up security monitoring centre, it was announced this month, is to be relocated to Spain). 
The European Space Agency is not an EU body and Britain, Pesquet said, should continue to play its part. “I certainly hope so,” he said. “As things stand, Europe has always been a relatively small player in space – Japan has a bigger stake in the ISS on its own than all of Europe.”
International space strategy over the coming years, he said, would aim to “open the door” for commercial operators, such as SpaceX’s Elon Musk and Virgin’s Richard Branson, to start operating in “near space”, while the professional agency astronauts push further into “deep space”.
The primary objective would be to send a smaller ISS into an elliptical orbit round the moon. “The moon is the focus for now, not Mars,” Pesquet said. “It’s a sensible, immediate step. We can explore and research. Test the technology three days from Earth, rather than 300.”
But whatever happens, the voices of the astronauts will be important, he said. Like Peake, who gained a big UK Twitter following during his ISS mission, Pesquet was huge on social media in France (“Much bigger than Tim,” he grinned. “You should write that. At one point I had five million followers on Facebook.”) 
He lists the benefits of space exploration: modern navigation, communications, satellite and weather forecasting technologies are all by-products of man’s journeys into space. Of the 50 variables scientists use to monitor the Earth’s atmosphere and climate, more than half can only be measured from space; there is vital scientific research, notably in medicine, that can only be done in space.

Neither source, thanks. We shouldn't need to be burning so much gas by now.
BQENDIndeed and efficiency savings will make some difference
BQSTART
we could've been getting shot of the whole gas infrastructure in the near future.
BQEND sadly not - we have an 800,000GWh gas demand of which 60% is imported.
23 million homes rely on gas and half our electricity supply is gas powered -
gas supports intermittent solar/wind supplies and NG supplies 95% of our hydrogen supply and output of NorthSea gas (for UK and Norway) is falling fast.
It will take many decades to wean off gas even if we start now... and we have not started.
So given we need to cut emissions immediately we have a fixed choice whilst we begin the process through to 2050.. imported LNG is almost three times higher carbon (21.05kgCO₂ (e)/GJ) whereas domestic natural extracted gas is 7.71 kgCO₂(e)/GJ

Losing out on a capacity market contract sounded the death knell for Eggborough, which supplies power to 2m homes and employs around 170 people, about 130 of whom are expected to be laid off. About 40 will be kept on for decommissioning and demolition.
“Already on the ropes, Eggborough missing out on a capacity market contract was the final straw for this once-great power station,” said Jonathan Marshall, energy analyst at the ECIU thinktank.
The plant is run by Czech power firm EPH, which bought two of British Gas owner Centrica’s large gas plants last year, and also owns an old power coal plant in Northumberland which it is converting to burn wood. 
The firm said Eggborough was no longer economically viable without the support from the scheme, the government’s key insurance policy for keeping the lights on.
Adam Booth, managing director at Eggborough Power Ltd, said: “With the age of the plant and the current government’s policy that all UK coal-fired power generation must cease by 2025, Eggborough has been under threat of closure for the past few years.”
Prospect union, which has members at the plant, said it was deeply disappointed at the decision.
Eggborough has been generating electricity for more than half a century. After it shuts, there will be just six coal plants left in the UK, as Northern Ireland’s last coal plant is also due to close in May after it failed to win a contract in Ireland’s new capacity market.
The economics of coal have become increasingly untenable because of a government carbon tax and the relatively low price of gas, causing three plants to shut in 2015. 
The government, which has committed to phasing out coal by 2025 to cut carbon emissions, had predicted at least one coal power station would shut this year. The fossil fuel is rapidly dwindling as a source of electricity, providing a third of the UK’s power in January as it did for January 2017.
Eggborough’s owners said they are still committed to their aspiration of building a gas plant on the site, which would be capable of powering 2m homes.
But one green group said it would be crazy to swap one fossil fuel for another. “Curtains for coal must not be a free pass to switch these plants to giant gas units,” said Dominique Doyle at environmental law firm ClientEarth.
The capacity market is crucial for the economics of coal and gas plants, and this week’s auction saw £34.7m of contracts awarded to operators for next winter. 
Three quarters of those winners were for gas plants, including big-six firm SSE’s Peterhead, which is Scotland’s last fossil fuel power station. It had been threatened with closure last year after missing out on a contract but will now continue operations.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/02/yorkshire-coal-plant-to-close-with-loss-of-200-jobs-eggborough

The number one problem is not technology, it is not cost. It is not even the environmental impact of the technology (BECCS), albeit all of these are challenges. It's intriguing, it's terribly irritating, in this article as in many others of the kind in the Guardian and elsewhere as well as in work published by scientists: Totally missing is what should be the key observation: Nobody will pay for the extra cost of net negative emissions, involving CCS. Not even today, any company or nation is ready to shoulder the marginal cost of CCS from flue gases, when there are still polluters who could (and should!) reasonably be held accountable and could be made pick up the bill (they call it polluter pays principle; yet they don't enact it —too expensive for the economy, they think, and their voters think so, too). Missing is the observation that Carbon Dioxide Removal tech must be developed and implemented as long as there are polluters who can be made pay for it: Fossil fueled power plants, airlines and all the other emitters. Once the CO2 emitters are gone, nobody will pay for CDR —for sure. There is no world government —and there won't likely be in 2050— that will force nations or individuals to pay for the cleaning up of the atmosphere for others. Why doesn't any intelligent journalist conclude that? Instead they get lost in numbers and tech details and call on so called experts who are totally blinded by their research (or payed, as we learn) or have some strange kind of fear of flying and thereby belittle the problem (he'll never get it, I'm afraid).

2. Who's spotted the order of magnitude calculation error? One zero to many, there. Guardian, Guardian, you can (and should!) do better than that. It's expensive, but not that much. If, say, CO2 from flights had to be removed from the air and the polluter held accountable, ticket prices would only change little. But that is perhaps a calculation or conclusion too inconvenient for a hard core guilt driven anti-consumption scientist in the field. That's on the one hand.

If you read the article, you would know that it is NOT a plan to ""scrub the atmosphere"". It's a project to develop the production of carbon neutral liquid fuels by taking carbon from the atmosphere. The obvious goal is to replace some of the burning of petroleum products with carbon neutral liquid fuels and thereby reduce emissions from oil. Whether they succeed and in particular whether they can make synthetic fuels at a competitive cost remains to be seen. Nevertheless, it is a worthy objective.

Carbon dioxide is not a waste fuel. If hydrogen from renewable energy is posited as the primary energy for carbon reduction, even if there is surplus renewable capacity to produce hydrogen it would be smarter to burn that fuel directly than to convert CO2 to carbon and then burn the product carboniferous. If you have low grade waste heat available, better to use that for direct space heating than play with pyrotechnics.

Hansen would say that is a load of bollocks and the task is insurmountable without a lot more nuclear power. And Hansen is right. For example, where is the clear path showing solutions to decarbonizaing aviation and transport? It does not exist. Even for electricity generation no large industrialized country is anywhere near getting most of it's electricity from intermittent renewables. Silly energy plans get turned out like sausages, but nobody actually knows how difficult it is to power a large developed country mostly from solar and wind because it's never been done. Even more alarming, nobody knows when it actually will be done (if ever). To say that this is a big risk is something of an understatement.
It's not just a matter of resources as there are plenty of renewable resources or nuclear resources to power the planet. It's a matter of practicality, economics AND environmental impact other than GHG emissions. No doubt biomass could be scaled up a lot, but at what environmental cost.
This 100% renewables story is crude. Basically it assumes that all forms of energy production are fungible. It's not even true in electricity generation where the value of electricity is dependent on when and where it is produced. It's completely wrong when you start talking about, for example, shipping.
If you look at the historical spend on energy R&D in developed countries as % of GDP, it's hardly changed. You could be forgiven for thinking there is no climate problem.

""poleward shifting of warm climate belts.""
means that the equatorial regions will become increasingly inhospitable.

It could also make Harvard superstar physicist David Keith, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and oil sands magnate Norman Murray Edwards more money than they could ever dream of.
The idea is grandiose yet simple: decarbonise the global economy by extracting global-warming carbon dioxide (CO2) straight from the air, using arrays of giant fans and patented chemical whizzery; and then use the gas to make clean, carbon-neutral synthetic diesel and petrol to drive the world’s ships, planes and trucks.
The hope is that the combination of direct air capture (DAC), water electrolysis and fuels synthesis used to produce liquid hydrocarbon fuels can be made to work at a global scale, for little more than it costs to extract and sell fossil fuel today. This would revolutionise the world’s transport industry, which emits nearly one-third of total climate-changing emissions. It would be the equivalent of mechanising photosynthesis.
The individual technologies may not be new, but their combination at an industrial scale would be groundbreaking. Carbon Engineering, the company set up in 2009 by leading geoengineer Keith, with money from Gates and Murray, has constructed a prototype plant, installed large fans, and has been extracting around one tonne of pure CO2 every day for a year. At present it is released back into the air.
But Carbon Engineering (CE) has just passed another milestone. Working with California energy company Greyrock, it has now begun directly synthesising a mixture of petrol and diesel, using only CO2 captured from the air and hydrogen split from water with clean electricity – a process they call Air to Fuels (A2F).
“A2F is a potentially game-changing technology, which if successfully scaled up will allow us to harness cheap, intermittent renewable electricity to drive synthesis of liquid fuels that are compatible with modern infrastructure and engines,” says Geoff Holmes of CE. “This offers an alternative to biofuels and a complement to electric vehicles in the effort to displace fossil fuels from transportation.”
Synthetic fuels have been made from CO2 and H2 before, on a small scale. “But,” Holmes adds, “we think our pilot plant is the first instance of Air to Fuels where all the equipment has large-scale industrial precedent, and thus gives real indication of commercial performance and viability, and leads directly to scale-up and deployment.”
The next step is to raise the money, scale up and then commercialise the process using low-carbon electricity like solar PV (photovoltaics). Company publicity envisages massive walls of extractor fans sited outside cities and on non-agricultural land, supplying CO2 for fuel synthesis, and eventually for direct sequestration.
“A2F is the future,” says Holmes, “because it needs 100 times less land and water than biofuels, and can be scaled up and sited anywhere. But for it to work, it will have to reduce costs to little more than it costs to extract oil today, and – even trickier – persuade countries to set a global carbon price.”
Meanwhile, 4,500 miles away, in a large blue shed on a small industrial estate in the South Yorkshire coalfield outside Sheffield, the UK Carbon Capture and Storage Research Centre (UKCCSRC) is experimenting with other ways to produce negative emissions.
Critics say these technologies are unfeasible. Not producing the emissions in the first place would be much cleverer
The UKCCSRC is what remains of Britain’s official foray into carbon capture and storage (CCS), which David Cameron had backed strongly until 2015. £1bn was ringfenced for a competition between large companies to extract CO2 from coal and gas plants and then store it, possibly in old North Sea gas wells. But the plan unravelled as austerity bit, and the UK’s only running CCS pilot plant, at Ferrybridge power station, was abandoned.
The Sheffield laboratory is funded by £2.7m of government money and run by Sheffield University. It is researching different fuels, temperatures, solvents and heating speeds to best capture the CO2 for the next generation of CCS plants, and is capturing 50 tonnes of CO2 a year. And because Britain is phasing out coal power stations, the focus is on achieving negative emissions by removing and storing CO2 emitted from biomass plants, which burn pulverised wood. As the wood has already absorbed carbon while it grows, it is more or less carbon-neutral when burned. If linked to a carbon capture plant, it theoretically removes carbon from the atmosphere.
Known as Beccs (bioenergy with carbon capture and storage), this negative emissions technology is seen as vital if the UK is to meet its long-term climate target of an 80% cut in emissions at 1990 levels by 2050, according to UKCCSRC director Professor Jon Gibbins. The plan, he says, is to capture emissions from clusters of major industries, such as refineries and steelworks in places like Teesside, to reduce the costs of transporting and storing it underground.
“Direct air capture is no substitute for using conventional CCS,” says Gibbins. “Cutting emissions from existing sources at the scale of millions of tonnes a year, to stop the CO2 getting into the air in the first place, is the first priority.
“The best use for all negative emission technologies is to offset emissions that are happening now – paid for by the emitters, or by the fossil fuel suppliers. We need to get to net zero emissions before the sustainable CO2 emissions are used up. This is estimated at around 1,000bn tonnes, or around 20-30 years of global emissions based on current trends,” he says. “Having to go to net negative emissions is obviously unfair and might well prove an unfeasible burden for a future global society already burdened by climate change.”
The challenge is daunting. Worldwide manmade emissions must be brought to “net zero” no later than 2090, says the UN’s climate body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). That means balancing the amount of carbon released by humans with an equivalent amount sequestered or offset, or buying enough carbon credits to make up the difference.
But that will not be enough. To avoid runaway climate change, emissions must then become “net negative”, with more carbon being removed than emitted. Many countries, including the UK, assume that negative emissions will be deployed at a large scale. But only a handful of CCS and pilot negative-emission plants are running anywhere in the world, and debate still rages over which, if any, technologies should be employed. (A prize of $25m put up by Richard Branson in 2007 to challenge innovators to find a commercially viable way to remove at least 1bn tonnes of atmospheric CO2 a year for 10 years, and keep it out, has still not been claimed – possibly because the public is uncertain about geoengineering.)
The achilles heel of all negative emission technologies is cost. Government policy units assume that they will become economically viable, but the best hope of Carbon Engineering and other direct air extraction companies is to get the price down to $100 a tonne from the current $600. Even then, to remove just 1% of global emissions would cost around $400bn a year, and would need to be continued for ever. Storing the CO2 permanently would cost extra.
Critics say that these technologies are unfeasible. Not using the fossil fuel and not producing the emissions in the first place would be much cleverer than having to find end-of-pipe solutions, say Professor Kevin Anderson, deputy director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, and Glen Peters, research director at the Centre for International Climate Research (Cicero) in Norway.
In a recent article in the journal Science, the two climate scientists said they were not opposed to research on negative emission technologies, but thought the world should proceed on the premise that they will not work at scale. Not to do so, they said, would be a “moral hazard par excellence”.
Instead, governments are relying on these technologies to remove hundreds of millions of tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere. “It is breathtaking,” says Anderson. “By the middle of the century, many of the models assume as much removal of CO2 from the atmosphere by negative emission technologies as is absorbed naturally today by all of the world’s oceans and plants combined. They are not an insurance policy; they are a high-risk gamble with tomorrow’s generations, particularly those living in poor and climatically vulnerable communities, set to pay the price if our high-stakes bet fails to deliver as promised.” According to Anderson, “The beguiling appeal of relying on future negative emission technologies is that they delay the need for stringent and politically challenging policies today – they pass the buck for reducing carbon on to future generations. But if these Dr Strangelove technologies fail to deliver at the planetary scale envisaged, our own children will be forced to endure the consequences of rapidly rising temperatures and a highly unstable climate.”
Kris Milkowski, business development manager at the UKCCSRC, says: “Negative emissions technology is unavoidable and here to stay. We are simply not moving [to cut emissions] fast enough. If we had an endless pile of money, we could potentially go totally renewable energy. But that transition cannot happen overnight. This, I fear, is the only large-scale solution.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/04/carbon-emissions-negative-emissions-technologies-capture-storage-bill-gates

As we watch temperature records falling around the world we might ask where are we now, long before feeling the full effects of a rise in temperature of just over 1 degree C, due to lags in the system.
We are seeing numerous impacts catching many scientists by surprise with how soon they are occurring. In 2014 two independent teams of scientists reported that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is likely irreversibly retreating. 3.3 meters of sea level rise equivalent of ice there is being destabilized by warming oceans and energy is going into the net melting of ice all over the planet. 
The paleoclimate record shows that increasing global temperature by just 1.5-2 degrees C commits the system to an eventual 6-9m of sea level rise.
Corals may not survive this century of warming and acidifying oceans, and droughts and floods linked to global warming—and conflict linked to those droughts—are already causing four countries to face famine.
Because of the decades to millennial long lag between a climate forcing and our feeling the effect, due to the thermal inertia of the ocean and response time of the ice sheets, the effects we are feeling now are largely just the beginning of the result of emissions from the 20th century. And emissions have been increasing steadily for decades.
We are also seeing numerous amplifying feedbacks: loss of albedo (heat reflectivity) from ice melt, permafrost melt, methane release and massive wildfires; the Earth is starting to wrest any possible further human control of the climate away.

The then Baird government’s determination to guard the interests of the private sector is nowhere more obvious than in its approach to those who protest against coal and coal seam gas developments.
Legislation passedincreased tenfold the fines faced by protesters to $5500 and provided for jail for up to seven years for “unlawful aggravated entry” to mine sites. The new laws also gave police new search and seizure powers and allowed them greater latitude under “move on powers” to break up demonstrations.
“This changed laws in place since 1901,” the chief executive and principal solicitor with the state’s Environmental Defenders Office, Sue Higginson, says.

The Australian Panel of Experts on Environmental Law has launched a blueprint for a new generation of environment laws and the creation of independent agencies with the power and authority to ensure they are enforced. The panel of 14 senior legal figures says this is motivated by the need to systematically address ecological challenges including falling biodiversity, the degradation of productive rural land, the intensification of coastal and city development and the threat of climate change. 
Murray Wilcox QC, a former federal court judge, said the blueprint was a serious attempt to improve a system that was shutting the public out of the decision-making process and failing to properly assess the impact of large-scale development proposals. 
“We found the standard of management of the environment is poor because everything is made into a political issue,” Wilcox said. “Nothing happens until it becomes desperate. 
“We need a non-political body of significant prestige to report on what is happening and have the discretion to act.” 
The legal review, developed over several years and quietly released in 2017, resulted in 57 recommendations. It was suggested by the Places You Love alliance, a collection of about 40 environmental groups that was created to counter a failed bid to set up a “one-stop shop” for environmental approvals by leaving it to the states. The panel undertook the work on the understanding it would be independent and not a piece of activism. 
Its work helped inform a motion passed by 250 Labor branches calling on the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, to put stronger national environmental laws and the introduction of an independent watchdog at the centre of his election pitch.
The Australian Panel of Experts on Environmental Law convener, Rob Fowler, an environmental lawyer for more than 40 years and adjunct professor at the University of South Australia, said a key finding was that cooperative federalism – different tiers of government working together to solve common problems – had not worked in protecting the environment. 
“It’s slow-moving, unwieldy and leads to compromised outcomes,” he said. 
Fowler said devolving responsibility for environmental protection to the states had been popular with politicians, having been proposed by both the Gillard Labor government and the Coalition under Tony Abbott, but not the public. The 2014 constitutional values survey conducted by Griffith University found nearly 45% of respondents believed Canberra should be solely responsible for protecting the environment. Just 16% said it should be left to the states.
He said the body of expert opinion was strongly in favour of the commonwealth taking responsibility. The panel believed a future government should introduce a mechanism that required states to act in line with plans and strategies developed by a commonwealth environment commission. If they failed to comply, they could be overridden.
Wilcox, who before becoming a judge was president of the Australian Conservation Foundation from 1979 to 1984, said creating an environment commission was the panel’s most important recommendation, likening it to the Reserve Bank. “It hopefully would involve people of considerable ability and achievement,” he said.
It would develop both national strategies and regional plans to protect biodiversity, and oversee a system of environmental data monitoring, collection, auditing and reporting. Where it did not do the monitoring itself, it would be required to ensure the work was done to a higher standard than currently, backed by federal funding.
Wilcox said the national Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, which was introduced by the Howard government in 1999, was an advance at the time but now “well and truly out of date”.
The environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, has said the existing act continues to be the best mechanism for the federal government to protect the most important and sensitive matters. The opposition environment spokesman, Tony Burke, said the push to introduce national laws would be considered at ALP conference this year, and he was consulting about updating the act.
Wilcox said the public should have a greater say in response to developments. He said state planning systems were good at handling small neighbourhood development problems but larger proposals tended to be “waved through by governments mesmerised by the corporate dollars”. 
He cited the hotel and casino complex being developed at Barangaroo in Sydney. “Anything that did come out about that was released for political reasons. That story just applies again and again and again.
 “If you believe in a democracy, then you believe ordinary people should be encouraged to get in and have a say, and that’s not the case at the moment. If anything the opposite is the case.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/06/everything-is-made-into-a-political-issue-rethinking-australias-environmental-laws

there’s evidence of superstorms which moved boulders 10 times the size current storms move. 
There some controversy about his conclusions
BQEND
There is at least an order of magnitude difference to account for to suggest modern estimates on Aran, which gets some of the highest waves in present day climate from long-fetch high-powered mid-latitude N. Atlantic storm systems and where the cliff height is nearer 10 metres (I have been there myself), are a useful and useable analogue here. Meteorologically, fetch for Aran is likely substantially longer than for the location of the Boulders in question (I type this as the synoptic situation is a 4000Km straight run of SWrlys at 80-120Kph), arguably allowing more energetic ocean waves than meteorologically attainable in the subtropical location in question (wave energy being a function of wind speed, duration, and fetch), even with the strongest hurricanes...
I would note that Michael Wehner’s currently unanswered comment provides published evidence that we can expect hurricanes to increase in intensity with warming SSTs at most 10%. This provides a potential upper bound on storm intensity and size from which to infer meteorologically possible wave characteristics. Perhaps ancient storms were stronger still, but if so, the mechanisms would need elucidating with supporting references...
etc.

The stormy winter of 2013-14 along the west coast of Ireland produced waves so powerful they tore great slabs of rock out of coastlines and shoved them inland. Among those boulders was a 620-tonne colossus, equivalent to more than three blue whales, which was shoved several feet inshore, setting a new world record for the largest boulder ever known to have been moved by storm waves.
Scientists from Williams College, in Massachusetts, examined photos of shorelines before and after the violent storms and discovered many coastal sites had been completely rearranged. Boulders the size of houses and weighing 100 tonnes or more had been lifted up by waves, tilted over and bulldozed along cliff tops or shorelines, up to 220 metres (722ft) inland and up to 29 metres (95ft) above high water. It was a shocking revelation – previously it was thought that only tsunamis had the power to move such huge rocks.
The study published in Earth-Science Reviews also revealed that the storm waves had created many of the boulders by tearing the rocks out of cliffs, or peeling them out of rocky shores.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/feb/05/weatherwatch-storm-waves-that-can-roll-great-slabs-of-rock

Nasa confirmed the news after a new study looked directly at ozone-destroying chemicals in the atmosphere.

The In 2015, the author reported that the atmospheric temperature at any height depends upon the presence of dominant solar emission there produced by γ, β, and X-ray emissions. Solar UV dips the temperature to minus zero degrees Centigrade, while EUV causes further steep fall in temperature. Bharat radiation and visible light maintain almost the same temperatures of EUV present at slightly greater height from earth. Near infrared radiation raises the temperatures from 5000 to 20000 near 500 km height above earth, while it combines with visible light and raises the atmospheric temperature just to -580 to 17 0C within 10 km height above earth that helps sustenance of life. Solar γ, β, and X-ray emissions and the successive Bharat Radiation, EUV, UV, visible light, and near infrared radiation reach different heights depending upon energy. They produce these series of emissions twice and finally reach around 10 km height above earth. Notably, γ, β, and X-ray emissions with relatively high energy produce enough Sunlight and heat in tropical regions such as South India, South Africa etc on earth. The γ, β, and X-ray emissions with relatively low energy reach regions such as UK, Europe, Canada etc. on earth somewhat close to North pole, generate UV, as a result temperatures fall to minus zero degrees, At North and South poles they generate EUV and causes steep fall in temperatures. The current explanation reveal that previously believed Ozone layer does not exists.

The greatest losses in ozone occurred over Antarctica but the hole there has been closing since the chemicals causing the problem were banned by the Montreal protocol. But the ozone layer wraps the entire Earth and new research has revealed it is thinning in the lower stratosphere over the non-polar areas. 
Reduced protection from cancer-causing UV rays is especially concerning towards the equator, where sunlight is stronger and billions of people live. The reason for the falling ozone at lower latitudes is not known, though scientists suspect a chemical used in paint stripper and a change in atmospheric circulation caused by climate change.
“The study is in lower to mid latitudes, where the sunshine is more intense, so that is not a good signal for skin cancer,” said Prof Joanna Haigh at Imperial College London, a member of the international research team. “It is a worry. Although the Montreal protocol has done what we wanted it to do in the upper stratosphere, there are other things going on that we don’t understand.”
Anna Jones, an atmospheric chemist at the British Antarctic Survey and not involved in the new study, said: “To identify what action might be needed to prevent further decreases, it is extremely important to understand what is causing the observed downward trend.” Scientists say budget threats to US satellite monitoring programmes must be reversed.
The new research, published in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, carefully combined measurements of atmospheric ozone from 11 different datasets to produce a record of the last 30 years. It looked at ozone levels between the 60th parallels, an area that ranges from Scandinavia, Russia and Alaska in the north to the tip of South America. (London is 51 deg N, Sydney is 34 deg S and New York city is at 41 deg N.)
The stratosphere stretches from 10km above the Earth to 50km and ozone is slowly rising in the upper stratosphere, back towards the levels seen before CFC chemicals caused their damage.
But in the lower stratosphere, when there is the most ozone, levels are falling. Overall, the effects balance out but this means the ozone layer over the area studied is remaining in its depleted state. 
The cause of the decline is unknown but might be the result of global warming. Ozone is produced by chemical reactions in the atmosphere over the tropics and then distributed towards the poles world by large air circulation currents. But warming trends could be strengthening these currents, moving more ozone to the poles and leaving less at lower latitudes.
Another suspect is so-called “very short lived substances” (VSLS) - industrial chemicals that destroy ozone. It was thought they broke down too quickly to reach the stratosphere, but that may need to be re-examined. 
Research published in July by Ryan Hossaini, at Lancaster University, UK, and colleagues showed that levels of a key VSLS, called dicholoromethane and used in paint stripper and aerosol sprays, have doubled in the last decade. It is not banned by the Montreal protocol and little is known about where it is leaking from or why emissions have risen so rapidly. 
William Ball, an atmospheric scientist at ETH Zurich university in Switzerland, who led the new research, said: “The finding of declining low-latitude ozone is surprising, since our current best atmospheric circulation models do not predict this effect. Very short-lived substances could be the missing factor in these models.”
Hossaini welcomed the “important” new study, but he argues that the current concentrations of VSLS in the atmosphere are too low to explain the falling ozone in the lower stratosphere. 
“This work clearly highlights there are still unanswered questions regarding the drivers of long-term changes in stratospheric ozone,” he said. “The implications of the downward ozone trend from the perspective of surface UV and health need to be evaluated as a pressing matter.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/06/ozone-layer-not-recovering-over-populated-areas-scientists-warn

The decision was announced on Monday and followed a long student campaign. More than 60 UK universities have now divested from fossil fuels, with the University of Sussex the latest to make the move. 
Most existing fossil fuel reserves cannot be burned without causing dangerous climate change, and proponents of divestment argue this makes fossil fuel companies bad investments on both ethical and financial grounds. The risk to investments is taken seriously at the highest level, including the Bank of England, World Bank and the G20’s financial stability board, and many major investment firms have also divested.
The University of Edinburgh decided in 2015 to divest from the most polluting companies – those involved in coal and tar sands – but stopped short of full divestment. But now the university will sell its final £6.3m of fossil fuel holdings, in the companies Total, BG Group and Atlas Copco.
The University of Edinburgh’s £1bn endowment fund is the third largest in the UK, behind Cambridge and Oxford. Those universities have only committed to divest from coal and tar sands to date.
Tara Wight, campaigner at People and Planet Edinburgh and a PhD student, said: “We are thrilled that Edinburgh University has finally realised the importance of divestment, and decided to match their investment portfolio with the environmentally friendly image they present to the public.”
Prof Charlie Jeffery, senior vice-principal at the University of Edinburgh, said: “I’m very proud of the university’s decision. Climate change is one of the world’s biggest challenges. Over the past few years, we have thought hard about how to respond to that challenge. This change in our investment strategy is a vital step on that journey.”
A university spokesman said Edinburgh had invested more than £150m in low carbon technology, climate-related research and businesses that directly benefit the environment since 2010 and would become carbon neutral by 2040.
In January, New York City announced it would sell $5bn of fossil fuel investments held by the city’s pension funds. The value of investment funds around the world committed to selling off fossil fuel assets is at least $5tn.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/06/edinburgh-university-divests-from-all-fossil-fuels

There's nothing wrong with thinking particularly about the evidence presented.
""The claim is that snowpack is shrinking due to global warming per the Guardian.""
The October 2015 article in the guardian that you linked to claims that the spring snowpack of that year had shrunk to a record low level not seen for 500 years.

No. I didn't talk about a declining snowpack trend and neither did the Guardian article that you linked to. It talked about a record low snowpack in the spring of 2015. The reason the data on the chart reproduced by ARHO is irrelevant to the reality of the decline to that record low is that decline occurred after 2011 as shown in figure 1 top chart 1930-2015 on the first page of Balmecheri et al (2015).
""None of the 60 years prior"" to 2015 ""are relevant?""
The relevance of the 60 years prior to 2015 and the 1,440 years prior to them all shown in Balmecheri et al, is that they demonstrate that the last snowpack low of that extent occurred 500 years ago and that weather extremes of that extent were rare in the pre-industrial climate.  ""The point Wally, is that there is no multi-decadal declining snowpack trend in the Sierra Nevada, regardless of what the Guardian would have us believe.""
The Guardian article on snowpack in Sierra Nevada made no mention of a declining snowpack trend. It made mention instead of a record low snowpack for the spring of 2015.

This is yet another classic misrepresentation on your part. The article does NOT say that snowpack is declining overall. What it does establish is that the minimum for 2015, which coincided with extremely high temperatures, was unprecedented and therefore unlikely to be due to normal internal variability. The significance of this is that temperatures are likely to continue rising, meaning that such a 1 in 1000 year event will become increasingly common, with the obvious knock-on threat to California's water supply.

People affected adversely by the increase in extreme weather events resulting from climate change find themselves subjected to terror. The example of two teenage siblings affected by one of the extreme weather events of the 2010-11 moderate La Nina in Queensland will suffice by way of illustration.
One Saturday morning at home with their parents those two found themselves having to clamber up into the roof space of the house as flood waters rose rapidly. Their parents insisted they go first but were caught inside the house by the rapidly rising waters. The siblings then waited on the roof until a helicopter rescue crew winched them to safety. The girl was interviewed on television the next day along the creek edge and I felt uncomfortable seeing an young woman in obvious numbed shock exposed to public public scrutiny. Those two young people were subjected to horrible terror and their lives will never be the same because of what happened on that day.

The difference is that Walsunda's opinions are based on evidence and peer-reviewed scientific studies whereas yours are arrived at by dismissing the peer-reviewed science whenever it challenges your preconceptions. You can't claim credibility for your position just because you accept some of the science when you dismiss the parts you don't like; either you accept the scientific method in full or your position has no credibility at all.
Having reviewed the links you posted to ""alarmist"" newspaper articles, I agree 100% with Walsunda's comments. Although I might grant you that the title of the article on snowpack does not precisely reflect the content, the article itself does not in any way exaggerate the science and does indeed point to a likely fall in snowpack as warming continues. Please spare us the indignation over a poor choice of title; if that is really the best you can do then I'm thoroughly unimpressed!

""Boom....totally agree. So explain these then.....""
One of the features of your posts is that you almost invariably subtly move the goalposts in an attempt to get the upper hand. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and presume that you didn't notice the three words ""on its own"" in the text that you copied from KingInYellow's response! That may seem like nitpicking to you but such details and nuance are crucial in science. Your failure to respond specifically and directly to points made actually prevents serious debate.
Returning to the question you posed about how AGW made hurricane Harvey worse........
There is one element of science that I suspect you haven't grapsed: the crucial importance of deductive and inductive reasoning. This is one element that requires a better understanding of science than most bloggers possess.... and it is one of the key reasons why so many amateur ""skeptics"" don't ""get"" the science of climate change.
In short, there are some things that are so well established in science that it is safe to draw conclusions about them without data to back it up. The concept that a warming world will make tropical storms more damaging, based on sound empirical physics, is one of them. This is because higher SST will make storms more powerful, higher atmospheric temperature will increase the rainfall associated with storms and rising sea level will increase inundation due to storm surges.
It is unlikely that scientists will ever be in a position to say that a specific storm was caused by AGW, but there is sufficient evidence, backed up by empirical physics, to conclude that AGW has contributed to the damage caused by a particular storm for the reasons stated above.
Of course it is infinitely better to be able to dot the ""i""'s and cross the ""t""'s by establishing a statistical relationship, but this requires huge amounts of data, given the huge natural variability that is inherent to weather. The bottom line is that the real experts know that if we wait for this statistical confirmation before acting the problem will be far worse and much more difficult to resolve. In the meantime, they use other statistical approaches, as described in the articles you linked to.

BQSTART
Record rainfall amounts were recorded during Hurricane Harvey in the Houston, Texas, area, leading to widespread flooding. We analyze observed precipitation from the Global Historical Climatology Network with a covariate-based extreme value statistical analysis, accounting for both the external influence of global warming and the internal influence of El Niño–Southern Oscillation. We find that human-induced climate change likely increased the chances of the observed precipitation accumulations during Hurricane Harvey in the most affected areas of Houston by a factor of at least 3.5. Further, precipitation accumulations in these areas were likely increased by at least 18.8% (best estimate of 37.7%), which is larger than the 6–7% associated with an attributable warming of 1∘C in the Gulf of Mexico and Clausius-Clapeyron scaling. In a Granger causality sense, these statements provide lower bounds on the impact of climate change and motivate further attribution studies using dynamical climate models.

One final question...where was AGW as an influencer of stronger storms in the 12 years prior to this last season (all those season's were relatively quiet with very few strong storms)? So .... one strong hurricane season in the Atlantic is linked to AGW, yet the 12 prior seasons are irrelevant?
That's alarmism, or an over-reaction, or a hasty conclusion.....whatever. Most importantly, if it's true, there is no way given the recent climatology in that basin that you can attribute one storm (or even one season) to AGW. If you can in your mind, then I don't know where else to go since climate is a look at multi-decadal patterns (we agree on that, yes?)

Try not to over-think this stuff. The claim is that snowpack is declining due to global warming per the Guardian. So are you saying that since data on ARHO chart doesn't go past 2011, it's irrelevant to the context of AGW creating a declining snowpack trend??? None of the 60 years prior are relevant? 
The point Wally, is that there is no multi-decadal declining snowpack trend in the Sierra Nevada, regardless of what the Guardian would have us believe. You're becoming a denier of a different sort, watch yourself. Cheers!

That reason is that fossil fuels are heavily subsidised by a range of supports.
BQSTART
..World Trade Organization’s (WTO) definition of a subsidy which includes: fiscal support, such as direct spending by governments, tax breaks and income or price support; domestic, regional (EU) and international public finance through grants, loans, equity and guarantees; and investment by state-owned enterprises.
BQEND
Considering that just in Europe, their have been multiple pledges to phase out subsidies under the G7 and G20, with the latest one is to phase out 'inefficient' subsidies by 2020 - and none of these pledges have not amounted to action: it only says one thing; fossil fuels are not able to pay for themselves.
This means that rather than some kind of benign 'fee & dividend' scheme being easily slapped on the price of petrol at a local filling station; this industry actually has much more serious problems.
The EU spends
€112 billion per year on fossil fuel subsidies, and that is
not accounting for the EU ETS scheme which interestingly delivered a total of over €25 billion to the coal industry in cashable, 'unused emission allowances'; as well as similar amounts to heavy polluters such as cement.
So to say these industries need to be kept in check with a tax is to miss the point - if they were simply priced at a level that reflected the true costs involved we would not be so eager to spend all our money on them. To underline this, the cost of oil for the past few years has been quite low, at around $50 dollars a barrel; but this has meant that no-one makes any money - and only recently has the price crept up closer to $100 dollars a barrel where producers actually start to see a return on the production costs sunk into the product, its transport, bonuses and other payments. Even Russia and the Middle East don't see much profit at $50 dollars, although
fracking has never made money at any price, at all. It has
now cost almost $300 billion in debt (domestic debt; so QE - not as bad as owing to a foreign country, but still), roughly equating to about double the cost at the pump.', u'recommendation_count': u'2', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1518428219000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'17280722', u'in_reply_to': u'112103186', u'id': u'112112193', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Walsunda', u'text': u'I asked you which media articles you were talking about where the dangers of climate and climate change had been exaggerated.

Here, in Ventura County, in California, we've had one (significant) rainstorm since last April.

When rain DID come, it came as a flood in one night and killed my dear friend Peter Fleurat in a mudslide at the beginning of January. One of the only positive things I could think of during Peter's memorial was that the grasses and flowers in the burn zone were germinating, coming back. Life was finding a way.
And then we've had no rain since. During this dry month, the native grasses have withered and died. The insects that need them have nothing, the birds that feed on those insects starve or migrate far away. Our climate has become that of Baja - this is not a ""drought"" - this is climate change. All the flora and fauna in our chaparral hills is now unsupportable. Most of it will be dead in a matter of decades, save for the opportunistic weeds which can flourish anywhere - but the species adapted to the Mediterranean climate will be gone.
Besides, stupidity is not the problem: greed is. No one wants to pay higher gas taxes or risk losing their oil-rig drilling job for a global problem that only periodically affects them for now.

One of them isn't about climate change caused by greenhouse gases and the others I've looked at are not even remotely ""alarmist"". In fact, a 2m rise in sea level for 3 Celsius of warming may well be on the conservative side!
Regarding the article about Sierra Nevada snowpack, you just haven't read it carefully enough. The article points out that it isn't yet clear whether the long term impact of climate change will be less snow because of warming or more snow because of extra moisture. Also, the data you have linked to is only the instrumental record from 1959 to 2011, whereas the recent record low was in 2015 and the paper described uses proxy data to look as far back as 1500.
""The authors found that this current episode was unsurpassed in the record and exceeded the 95% confidence interval for a 500 year period.""
So this isn't alarmist at all. Indeed, all it shows is how poor your attention to detail is! It's also worth pointing out that the author Professor John Abraham is an actively researching climate scientist, so it would hardly be in his interests to use ""doctored pictures"".

Gore got some of his facts wrong in his film the ""Inconvenient Truth"", but the basic message, that we need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases as a matter of urgency, is not in doubt, so why shouldn't Mann appear on stage with Gore to add some scientific ""gravitas"" to the message?

Ok...we're done here I think. We'll go around on this for days. I am struck by your agreement of media culpability in this discussion, yet then it's OK for Mann to share a stage to support Gore's claims, vs. correct them. If truth in science is so important, then Mann should be an advocate for reflecting the entire scientific picture on climate change, he is failing in his responsibility to correct Gore, especially given their working relationship. 
You wonder why I don't question ""the mail""? I have no idea what that is. I'm in the US...is that a UK publication?

It's a great shame that it has taken you so long to acknowledge this point; if you had done so in the first instance most of what has been typed above would have been unnecessary. Sadly, the media tend to be very bad at communicating science, although the Guardian generally does a pretty good job. However, I note that while you have claimed that alarmism is a problem, you have failed to acknowledge a far bigger problem with certain media outlets (eg. the Mail) misrepresenting the science in order to play down the threat from climate change. Could this be evidence that you are not as objective as you think?
""I think it's fair to say the a mainstream conclusion is that, for example, tropical cyclones are getting stronger.""
As I've tried to explain repeatedly above, the mainstream science is the conclusions drawn from ALL of the evidence; that is how science works. In fact, as the links I posted above confirm, the picture regarding tropical storm intensity is more nuanced than you suggest and varies from region to region. THAT is why it is always crucial to look at the whole body of evidence rather than cherry-picking individual findings.
""If you want me to concede that point about reefs, fine. Not sure why you are so hung up on that.""
If you can't understand why I made that point then you clearly aren't as good at critical thinking as you appear to believe! Until the post above this one you had not once acknowledged the difference between real science and that presented by bloggers and the media. That difference is crucial because it IS science that we're discussing and as such only evidence-based conclusions are valid. You certainly appeared to be to be suggesting that there were some within the scientific community who were ""alarmist"" and you used the false claim about coral reefs to back up your argument. As I said above, context is everything and if that wasn't what you were intending to say you need to take far more care. So please stop trying to make out that my criticisms of your posts are unjustified.
""funny that you said you thought a scientist wouldn't likely use the word ""epic"". But Walsunda used it in his post.""

By the way....funny that you said you thought a scientist wouldn't likely use the word ""epic"". But Walsunda used it in his post. Maybe he meant to put it in quotations, but didn't. Not a big deal, but a small indicator of how pristine the use of terminology supposedly is, but isn't.

An alarmist is someone who exaggerates a danger. The cause and consequences of global warming and consequent climate change are described by climate scientists Scientists do not exaggerate dangers and are therefore not alarmists, let alone extreme alarmists.
With global warming so far extinctions have occurred, as has epic flooding, an increase in the length of wildfire season, and an increase in the frequency of extreme ENSO phase droughts and the rate of onset of droughts. As these things have already killed people there is no reason to suggest they will stop doing that.
Climate scientists consider future variables such as declining Northern Hemisphere high latitude summer insolation in 50,000 years time. They also consider the consequences of various CO2 emission scenarios. They do consider the possibility of future unknown variables such as bollide impacts which they know have happened in the past but don't know when and if they'll happen in the near future. As scientist they don't have a belief structure when it comes to reality but instead base what they know on evidence. Therefore they don't ignore any study or data that suggest that something contrary to their belief system, as they don't have a belief system that pertains to such studies and such data.

""Extreme alarmist says ""Climate change is our most serious issue now, and if we don't stop burning fossil fuels, extinction, epic flooding, wildfires, droughts etc. will continue to kill people.""
Although a scientist would be unlikely to use the word ""epic"", there is little doubt, based on both evidence and empirical physics, that the warmer the Earth gets, the worse these problems will become. Clearly, mankind can't just stop burning fossil fuels overnight, but the threat if we don't move away from them as quickly as possible is all too real..... especially when population is rising rapidly.
The difficulty scientists face is that it is hard to quantify the extent to which the above are already being exacerbated by our warming world, but that does NOT mean that the threat from them is imagined or overstated and most sensible people would surely use the precautionary principle as sufficient basis for urgent action.
There are, of course, those who overstate the likely consequences of climate change, but they do NOT represent the scientific community and their claims CANNOT be used to suggest that the science itself is alarmist.

What Gore did in his original work was to do what politicians tend to do.... use the ""worst case scenario"". There are many critiques of ""The Inconvenient Truth"" around on the internet. The scientific community did not ask Gore to make his film and the scientific community did not endorse it as an accurate reflection of the science.

A relatively weak greenhouse gas but the only one we have in concentrations of parts per million. Almost all of those ""stronger' ones are in much lower concentration and hence have lesser effect. They also don't hang around for as long, so have lesser effect in the long run. The most volatile though a strong greenhouse gas in your simplistic definition is water which evaporates in response to heat but soon leaves the atmosphere as liquid or solid water. The extra heat produced by the greenhouse effect of that CO2 that just keeps plugging away causes more water vapour and hence an increased if ephemeral greenhouse effect dependent on CO2 warming.
1.2 parts per 10,000 or 120 ppm increase from 280 ppm to over 400 ppm (therefore more than 1.2 parts per 10,000) is a 43% CO2 increase.

John Cook, Peter Ellerton, and David Kinkead have just published a paper in Environmental Research Letters in which they examined 42 common climate myths and found that every single one demonstrates fallacious reasoning. For example, the authors made a video breaking down the logical flaws in the myth ‘climate changed naturally in the past so current climate change is natural.’
Cook has previously published research on using ‘misconception-based learning’ to dislodge climate myths from peoples’ brains and replace them with facts, and beating denial by inoculating people against misinformers’ tricks. The idea is that when people are faced with a myth and a competing fact, the fact will more easily win out if the fallacy underpinning the myth is revealed. In fact, these concepts of misconception-based learning and inoculation against myths were the basis of the free online Denial101x course developed by Cook and colleagues.
The new paper published today suggests an even more proactive approach to defeating myths. If people can learn to implement a simple six-step critical thinking process, they’ll be able to evaluate whether climate-related claims are valid.
Step 1: Identify the claim being made. For example, the most popular contrarian argument: “Earth’s climate has changed naturally in the past, so current climate change is natural.”
Step 2: Construct the argument by identifying the premises leading to that conclusion. In this case, the first premise is that Earth’s climate has changed in the past through natural processes, and the second premise is that the climate is currently changing. So far, so good.
Step 3: Determine whether the argument is deductive, meaning that it starts out with a general statement and reaches a definitive conclusion. In our case, ‘current climate change is natural’ qualifies as a definitive conclusion.
Step 4: Check the argument for validity; does the conclusion follow from the premises? In our example, it doesn’t follow that current climate change must be natural because climate changed naturally in the past. However, we can fix that by weakening the conclusion to “the current climate change may not be the result of human activity.” But in its weakened state, the conclusion no longer refutes human-caused global warming.
Step 4a: Identify hidden premises. By adding an extra premise to make an invalid argument valid, we can gain a deeper understanding of why the argument is flawed. In this example, the hidden assumption is “if nature caused climate change in the past, it must always be the cause of climate change.” Adding this premise makes the argument logically valid, but makes it clear why the argument is false - it commits single cause fallacy, assuming that only one thing can cause climate change.
Step 5: Check to see if the argument relies on ambiguity. For example, the argument that human activity is not necessary to explain current climate change because natural and human factors can both cause climate change is ambiguous about the ‘climate change’ in question. Not all climate change is equal, and the rate of current change is more than 20 times faster than natural climate changes. Therefore, human activity is necessary to explain current climate change.
Step 6: If the argument hasn’t yet been ruled out, determine the truth of its premises. For example, the argument that “if something was the cause in the past, it will be the cause in the future” is invalid if the effect has multiple plausible causes or mechanisms (as with climate change). In our example, this is where the myth most obviously falls apart (although it had already failed in Step 4).
The authors suggest that their six-step critical thinking process can be deployed via social media through ‘technocognition,’ and in the classroom. Co-author David Kinkead from the University of Queensland said:
We hope our work will act as a building block for developing educational and social media resources, which teach and encourage critical thinking through the examination of both misinformation and fallacious reasoning.
Lead author John Cook envisions that educators and others can use this approach to neutralize climate myths themselves:
Our critical thinking process is a useful tool that scientists, educators, and communicators can employ to identify fallacies in misinformation, which they can use to create inoculating messages that neutralize the myths. This approach is practical, achievable and potentially impactful in both the short-term (e.g., in social media applications) and long-term (incorporating this kind of content into curriculum). Misinformation needs short, sharp, immediate inoculation. Our paper provides a blueprint into how to write these inoculations.
Climate denial suffers badly from a lack of critical thinking, which has spread all the way to the White House. Teaching people to think critically can help prevent it from spreading even further.

However, while the chief executive, Bob Dudley, said the industry was in a period of major change, he made clear that hydrocarbons would remain the core of BP’s business.
“It’s not a race to renewables, it’s a race to lower greenhouse gas emissions. As fast as renewables and clean energy can grow, faster than any fuel in history, the world is going to require oil and gas for some decades to come,” he said.
The company reported on Tuesday that higher oil prices and growing crude production had pushed up profits 139% in 2017 to $6.2bn (£4.5bn) on an underlying replacement cost basis, the company’s preferred measure. 
Dudley said the firm had enjoyed its most successful year for exploration since 2004. The company said it would start six new oil and gas projects this year, up from five previously, as it outlined a plan to return to growth into the next decade.
But much of the company’s strategy update focused on clean energy, which BP said would amount to around $0.5bn of its $15bn-$16bn capital expenditure programme. The carbon targets, including one for methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, will be announced by BP in the next two months.
Discussing the shift to green energy, Lamar McKay, the deputy chief executive, said: “Our industry is changing faster than any of us can remember, certainly in my career.”
BP recently bought a $200m stake in Europe’s biggest solar developer, returning to solar power six years after it quit the sector, and is reportedly eyeing other bigger solar investments. 
The oil company is not the only one active in diversifying its business. In the last three months of 2017, its Anglo-Dutch peer, Shell, bought a Dutch car-charging network, partnered with the electric car charging firm Ionity and bought First Utility, one of Britain’s biggest energy suppliers.
One of the most eye-catching energy innovations of the last year – the deployment of the world’s first floating windfarm – was undertaken not by a renewables developer but Norway’s state-owned oil company, Statoil. Meanwhile, France’s Total took a 23% stake in the renewable energy firm Eren for €237.5m (£211m).
Big oil has flagged a switch to greener energy before. In the early 2000s, spurred by investor pressure, the international oil companies appeared to be pivoting to move their businesses away from crude. 
BP memorably tried to reinvent itself in 2000, promising that in the future its initials would stand for Beyond Petroleum, as the chairman, Sir John Browne, told the world: “We are not an oil company.” Shell also moved heavily into renewables. But not long after the financial crash, Shell stopped investment in wind and solar, and BP shut its alternative energy HQ.
Later, around 2016, the oil giants began to take baby steps back into the world of renewables, and take greater notice of the rapid growth of electric cars. 
Valentina Kretzschmar, the director of research at oil analysts Wood Mackenzie, said although activity had intensified in recent months, it was still small-scale. “It’s buzzing, but the amount of money spent is still peanuts compared to their core business,” she said.
Shell is seen by many industry watchers as the leader in this transition. The chief executive, Ben van Beurden, last week defended the company’s $1bn-$2bn spend on clean energy as modest but “not a pittance”.
“Ultimately, the only thing that matters to society is the carbon intensity of energy. How much we invest in aspects of our portfolio is only a secondary concern,” he said, in a message similar to BP’s.
Investor pressure, consumer attitudes and governments’ climate change policies are all driving big oil’s transformation. But increasingly it is the economics of renewables and electric cars that are key.
“For many of them, when they started diversifying it was because of investor pressure … but I think now it’s the market forces that are making them look into diversification,” said Kretzschmar.
However, she noted that returns for renewables were still lower than for oil and gas. Irene Rummelhoff, the head of Statoil’s low carbon unit, agreed that returns were lower but were often fixed at a set level, so diversifying made a “huge difference” to cutting risk from volatile oil prices.
“That’s one of the advantages we are seeing in the renewable world; the risk profile is very different,” she said.
But the rate of change is slow. Big oil companies own less than 1% of solar and wind capacity globally, according to Wood Mackenzie.
Jeremy Leggett, a former petroleum geologist turned solar entrepreneur, said: “All this is beyond greenwash, but far short of retreat consistent with the Paris [climate] agreement. The oil and gas companies and are essentially taking out hedge bets.”
Still, observers think that big oil might really be serious about moving beyond petroleum this time round, for existential reasons.
“It is different this time around,” said Kretzschmar. “This [the rise of renewables, electric cars and other clean technologies] is for the first time starting to pose a threat to their oil and gas businesses. That wasn’t the case in the early noughties.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/06/bp-aims-to-invest-more-in-renewables-and-clean-energy

Exponentially, we'll be feeding an extra 3 million next year and more the year after that and so on.

In the late 1970s, the waterway was dammed to create the biggest reservoir in South Africa’s Western Cape. Behind the thick walls of the Theewaterskloof dam lay the capacity to hold 480 million cubic metres of water, nearly half of Cape Town’s water supply.
“When I got there, it was mostly dust,” Candy says.
Candy, a post-doctoral research fellow in sustainable food systems at the University of Melbourne, was in the city for food security conference. Every conversation, with everyone from other delegates to her Airbnb hosts, turned back to the water crisis.
The city has been in drought since 2015. Its population has almost doubled since 1995, from 2.4 million to 4.3 million, putting pressure on the urban water system. At the end of last year’s dry season, the water behind Theewaterskloof dam was less than 13% full.
Day Zero, when municipal water supplies will officially run out, is looming. The local government say the taps will be turned off on 11 May. At that point, people will only be able to collect a daily allowance of 25 litres from 149 points around the city, marshalled by the police and military.
But experts believe this is a crisis that could easily face other major urban areas with similar population and climatic characteristics to Cape Town.
“Cape Town is the canary in the mine,” says Candy.
In Australia, the millennium drought, which parched the country for the first decade of the new century, left cities such as Melbourne a year away from running out of water.
This experience has put the country, and institutions like the University of Melbourne, at the forefront of cross-disciplinary research into water security.
“Experts overseas expect Australia to be one of the first developed countries to be really hit by climate change in terms of drought,” says Candy. “We already have been. The world is watching to see how we deal with climate change – either how badly or how well.”
Her own research in modelling future scenarios around food security and greenhouse gas emissions points to one major recommendation: the wholesale switch from fossil fuels to renewables in energy generation.
Agriculture accounts for the biggest use of water in most countries. But Candy has found the amount used in energy production is projected to leap to similar levels, fuelled by power demands from coal seam gas production.
“If you switched to 100% renewable energy generation, in the future we could save the same amount of water that we currently use in agriculture,” she says.
Expanding distributed, or decentralised, systems is another solution, she adds. It allows people to reduce the distance between collecting and using water. Rainwater tanks are the best example. The millennium drought saw nearly a third of households in Victoria install them.
“These are good, not just because they take pressure off existing infrastructure and resource by having a technological solution, but also by making people more aware of what they are using,” says Candy.
Any intervention in water security comes at a cost. With climate change amplifying both flood and drought, the risk of getting it wrong is also heightened.
Professor Andrew Western is part of the hydrology and water resource group in the University of Melbourne’s department of infrastructure engineering. He has been running simulations to help city authorities hold future Day Zeros at bay without going bankrupt.
Key to creating a buffer in a city’s water supply is having more than one source, he says. Reservoirs alone will not suffice for cities with highly variable climates like those in Australia or South Africa.
“You need diversity of water supply to get security,” says Western.
At the height of the millennium drought, Melbourne built a desalination plant and a pipeline to divert water from the Goulburn river in the rural north. Both were expensive – the plant cost $3.1bn – and politically contentious. But combined they now have the potential to supply more than half of Melbourne’s water needs.
Using reservoir levels as a key indicator, Western’s work will help cities know when to start using such technological interventions and what the associated costs – capital, operating and social – will be. The aim is to help authorities avoid panicked, costly decisions.
“It’s worth spending money to have really good plans in place for when crisis situations are emerging. With Cape Town, this is probably where it has fallen down,” he says.
Meenakshi Arora is also part of hydrology and water resource group. The senior lecturer in environmental engineering has run detailed simulations of the water demand caused by household activities such as cooking, laundry, toilet flushing and showering.
She recommends that houses should have two different water streams: drinking water for cooking and showering, and non-drinking water – including harvested rain and storm water and treated waste water – for toilet flushing, laundry and garden irrigation.
Urban water scarcity is a problem produced by social institutions. It is an issue of transition
Changing the water quality to suit the task would reduce demand for clean drinking water, lessen the risk of floods and reduce the amount of contaminated rainwater draining into rivers.
“In most established communities we are still flushing our toilet with drinking water,” she says.
The University of Melbourne’s chemical engineering department is also doing work on diversifying the mix of water. The team there is looking at advanced water treatment, converting sewage into drinking water, which uses less energy and produces more water than desalination plants. The real cost is political and social. It is a hard sell with most populations.
However, Professor John Langford, from infrastructure engineering, suggests that cities with water supply issues should follow the example of Singapore, which already mixes some recycled water into its drinking supply.
“The key point is they have a long-term plan of community engagement, so if Malaysia did turn off the tap [the city state is reliant upon its neighbour for most of its drinking water] Singapore could quickly take over the supply,” he says. “My argument would be, which has had no success with the politicians, is to have a long-term program of community engagement here in Australia so we also have that option.”
There is nothing natural about a city running out of water, according to Professor Jon Barnett, an expert on vulnerability and adaption to climate change from the school of geography.
“There are plenty of solutions to solve these problems,” he says. “It’s not like we don’t know what to do or that there is a shortage of options. Urban water scarcity is a problem produced by social institutions. It is an issue of transition.”
But what if cities don’t adapt?
 Barnett says examples already exist.
“You will get shadow markets,” he says. “Water barons move in to control the allocation of water as they would drugs or illegal tobacco and alcohol during periods of prohibition.”
Less clean drinking water means people will resort to using poorer quality, with all its attendant health risks. “There are still more than 2,200 children that die each day because they can’t access good-quality water,” he says.
But there is some good news. Scarcity of water is unlikely to provoke war. There have been more than 10 times as many treaties on shared waters and rivers than there are international rivers in the world, says Barnett. “Basically, the incentives to conflict are very low, the incentives to cooperate are very high.”
Despite this, action is needed. Increasingly volatile climates and booming populations will mean that more cities will have their own Day Zero.
“We’ve already seen it in Australia and there are huge issues in Brazil,” says Barnett. “These are problems that require a lot of organisation, a lot of leadership, a lot of willingness to change. And if that isn’t there, then all the inhibitors to change will prevail. And you end up with Cape Town.”

The case is brought by a community group from the tiny Hunter Valley village of Wollar, which it says has been devastated by the development and gradual expansion of the Wilpinjong coalmine over the past decade.
Mine owner Peabody Energy won approval last April to further expand the mine, which sits between the towns of Mudgee and Denman, to extend its life by seven years to 2033.
In a case starting on Thursday, the Wollar Progress Association will argue the decision was unlawful as it did not properly consider the impact of the increased greenhouse gas emissions, including “downstream” emissions when the coal is burned in NSW and overseas power plants.
It says the state also did not look at whether the extension was in step with state and national climate change policies and targets, including Australia’s commitment under the 2015 Paris agreement to keep warming below 2C.
 Lawyer David Morris, from the Environmental Defenders Office NSW, said the association would argue 2007 legislation covering extractive industries was explicitly designed to ensure these two points were considered before decisions were made on whether projects could go ahead.
 “What is the point of commitments and targets if they are not factored into and reflected in decisions about projects which contribute to emissions?” he said. 
“We say it is a landmark case. When you think about a coalmine in 2017, it is difficult to think of a more important consideration than its contribution to climate change.”
The secretary of the Wollar Progress Association, Bev Smiles, said the mine had gradually grown from approval in 2006 to mine 9.5m tonnes a year to the current 13m tonnes. She said the proposed expansion would bring it to within 1.5 kilometres of the village.
She said many landholders had sold to the company, and the population had fallen from about 300 to 70.
“The impact from noise, dust and blasting has been extreme,” she said. “What happens under government processes is we are left to our own devices up against people who have a lot more resources than we have, and the treatment of people over time by this company has been quite disgraceful.”
 A spokeswoman for Peabody Energy said the company had been through a comprehensive process and the case related to the approval process by the state’s Planning Assessment Commission, not the merits of the extension project. She said the mine generated jobs and invested in the Mudgee region, employing 413 people.
 Peabody Energy is also applying for an exploration licence over more than 1,600 hectares of land east of Wollar.
 The case starts in the land and environment court on Thursday. The planning minister, Anthony Roberts, declined to comment while the issue was before the court.
 Separately, Smiles and two others will be in Mudgee local court on Friday facing charges relating to a protest at the mine last April.
While the case is believed to be the first time a mine approval has been been contested over its climate impact under the 2007 NSW law, at least one decision has been challenged on similar grounds under federal legislation. In 2016, the federal court dismissed a case brought by the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) against the federal government’s approval of Adani’s Carmichael mega-coalmine.
The ACF argued the mine’s approval was inconsistent with the country’s obligations to protect the world heritage values of the Great Barrier Reef. The court found the then environment minister Greg Hunt had considered the impact of the emissions from burning the coal on the reef, and that Australia had latitude under the World Heritage Convention as to how it carried out its obligations.

40 years ago Exxon had advice from their own scientists that burning fossil fuels was heating the planet at a dangerous rate. Their response was to ignore those findings and to start funding a campaign of denial. They intentionally lied to stop people taking action. Since then a whole industry of liars has sprung up spouting bizarre conspiracy theories that virtually every climate scientist on the planet was either corrupt or incompetent. Every single time they came up with new 'proof' that climate scientists had got it wrong it turned out that it was them that were wrong. The denialists have a perfect 100% failure rate to prove their case.

So you stand by your open lie that 50% of peer reviewed scientific papers in reputable journals are false. 
You have a serious problem with honesty.
BQEND
You are so mired in your own opinion that you cannot comprehend much at all, not sure why I`m bothering but here goes.A change in formatting is usually a give away that the poster is quoting, further I said it was ""from a link in an article"" another give away that it was a quote and then in a subsequent post I also said ""Quote my friend quote"" another give away. So that means they are Peter Ridds words not mine.Anyway considering how scathing you were of Peter Ridd lets look at the claim 
BQSTART
We called for the establishment of an Institute for Science-Policy Quality Control, and while we’ve had support, we’ve also been criticised by the scientific establishment, including the Royal Society in Queensland. 
The “Replication Crisis”, well-reported in peer reviewed articles, shows that when scientific papers are checked, around 50 per cent of recently published science is wrong.
BQEND
Even to me 50% seems to high although it has been claimed for several years that peer review is ""broke"" BBC News: http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-39054778
BQSTART
Science is facing a ""reproducibility crisis"" where more than two-thirds of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments, research suggests. 
BQEND
Nature:
1,500 scientists lift the lid on reproducibility

BQSTART
More than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments.
BQEND
Specifically has a pretty little graph of the different fields of science and put earth sciences at 50%.
PLOS medicine:
 How to Make More Published Research True

BQSTART
Given the abundance of data, research on research (i.e., meta-research) can derive empirical estimates of the prevalence of risk factors for high false-positive rates (underpowered studies; small effect sizes; low pre-study odds; flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, analyses; biases and conflicts of interest; bandwagon patterns; and lack of collaboration) [3]. Currently, an estimated 85% of research resources are wasted [5].
BQEND
That is the result of 5 minutes on google, looks like Peter Ridd is right. Maybe you should recant your remarks about the man and BTW I am still waiting for you to quote these ""wingnut conspiracy theories"" that you credit to him.

 The report by the Climate Council, based on 200 source documents and articles, says while tourism is growing at an extraordinary pace – an 8% jump in visitors last financial year – not enough is being done to prepare for damage to the country’s greatest drawcards.
 The five biggest attractions as reported by Tourism Australia – in order: beaches, wildlife, the Great Barrier Reef, unspoilt natural wilderness, national parks including rainforests and other forests – are all considered threatened by climate change.
 The report says federal and state governments have mostly underplayed or ignored the risk to tourism. The government’s national Tourism 2020 plan makes no mention of the need to cut greenhouse gas emissions or improve sustainability in the industry.
 Last month, the head of Queensland’s Association of Marine Park Tourism Operators, Col McKenzie, called climate scientist Terry Hughes “a dick” and urged the federal government to cut research funding due to his public comments about rising water temperatures harming the reef. McKenzie said it had turned tourists away.
 Ecologist and report co-author Prof Lesley Hughes said it should not be controversial to discuss the threat climate change posed to the industry.
 Beyond the often cited back-to-back years of bleaching on the reef in 2016 and 2017, she cited as examples beach erosion due to rising sea levels and a projected accelerating growth in extremely hot days in the red centre and the Top End across this century.
 “Most government and industry plans on tourism are focused on growth but they don’t also look at the other side of the coin, which is the risks,” she said. “When people come here they might do other things – cultural things such as visiting the Sydney Opera House – but really the overwhelming attractions are natural icons and it’s very clear they are all already being affected.”
 Government data cited in the report underlines the extent of the tourism boom. International visitors spent $40.6bn last financial year and were served by a tourism industry that employs 580,200 people, 5% of the country’s total workforce. The government estimates that, for every dollar generated by the tourism industry, a further 90c is spent elsewhere in the economy.
 New Zealand provided the most visitors, though Austrade expects it will be overtaken by second-placed China this year. Britain, the United States and Singapore round out the top five. Tourism Australia this week launched a major advertising campaign in the US during the Super Bowl based on the Crocodile Dundee movie franchise. Starring actors Chris Hemsworth and Danny McBride, the campaign emphasises Australia’s natural beauty.
 The industry’s growth has made tourism Australia’s second-largest export after iron ore. It is a significantly larger employer than coalmining or oil and gas extraction, which in 2014-15 employed 39,000 and 22,000 people respectively. 
 Hughes said, despite this, the future of fossil fuel industries and jobs received far more attention in the national conversation. “It’s cognitive dissonance at its most extreme,” she said.
 Examples of industries already being affected by global warming include ski tourism, which has seen a trend of increasing reliance on artificial snow as seasons she shortened over the past 25 years.
 “That’s a classic illustration that tourism industries will need to adapt and diversify to find other ways to bring people to those regions,” Hughes said.
 The report highlights some hotels, resorts, airlines and zoos have taken steps to cut pollution but says a national plan is lacking. Hughes called on more tourism operators to lobby governments to help the industry adapt and diversify. 
“I would also like to see operators be part of the lobby for better climate and energy policy,” she said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/08/climate-change-tourism-is-australias-least-prepared-industry-report-says

The group, which represents church organisations with combined investment assets of about £17bn, has told companies listed on the FTSE 350 index it will refuse to re-elect directors at firms failing to make sufficient progress in key areas.
“The best companies contribute to the common good through their products and services and the way they treat their employees,” said the Rev Canon Edward Carter, chair of the CIG.
 “Their directors understand that if they are not doing something about fairness and about the risks facing us today, they are part of the problem and risk losing the confidence of the public and ultimately their licence to operate.”
The group’s members have invested in companies including Tesco, Royal Dutch Shell, AstraZenca and HSBC. It backs investment policies based on Christian ethical principles and represents institutional investors from mainstream Christian church denominations and charities, including the main investment bodies of the Church of England and the Methodist church.
Outlining its new voting policy, the CIG said its members would vote against executive pay packages where pay ratios are not disclosed, excessive pensions for chief executives or where financial services or pharmaceutical companies do not pay the living wage. 
It will also scrutinise a company’s record on gender diversity, voting against the re-election of nomination committee chairs if women make up less than a third of the board. If the proportion of women drops below 25%, CIG members will vote against all directors on the committee.
According to the latest figures published by the government-backed Hampton-Alexander review – which aims to increase the number of women on FTSE boards – there were 301 firms in the FTSE 350 at the end of June 2017 where the proportion of women on the board was less than 33%. 
A total of 170 firms would have failed the CIG’s test of having female board representation equivalent to less than 25%, including BP, Barclays, Prudential and Just Eat.
The proportion of women on boards falls to just 9% at the pub and restaurants group Mitchells &amp; Butlers, and there are no women at all on the board of Sports Direct, the retailer founded and run by Mike Ashley.
Stefan Stern, director of the High Pay Centre, welcomed the new voting policy adopted by the CIG, and said the group was “putting some teeth into the issues, which is necessary”.
Climate change is the third key area for the CIG, which said its members would vote against the re-election of the chair if a company is making little progress on the transition to a low-carbon world.
“Church investors have long sought to address excessive executive pay and encourage the adoption of the living wage,” said Stephen Beer, chief investment officer of the central finance board of the Methodist church. 
“Our new policy will enable us to send a clear signal to companies that we expect them to consider fairness when setting executive pay levels. We encourage the wider investment community to hold directors accountable and ensure more responsible stewardship on this critical subject.”
The 2018 annual meeting season gets into full swing in spring, and last year the CIG did not support 60% of remuneration reports put forward by FTSE 350 companies. It recommended against 37% of nomination committee chairs.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/07/churches-warn-firms-over-pay-gender-and-climate-change

In Hansen's scenario B, the atmospheric CO2 and N2O levels in 2016 were pretty close to the actual 2016 values. But the methane, CFC11 and CFC12 levels were significantly over-estimated.
The result, as Hausfather shows, is that scenario B overestimated the actual radiative forcing to 2016 by about 10%.
So even scenario B was destined to overestimate warming (which it did by about 30%). Yet, you insist on using scenario A! This is clearly inappropriate.
As Hausfather points out, there is another, even more significant reason for the paper's warming overestimation, and that is the 4.2C climate sensitivity figure employed. But the paper made it very clear that there was considerable uncertainty as to the true value.
When adjusted for the actual radiative forcing and the current best estimate for climate sensitivity (3C), Hansen's model is in fact pretty accurate.

Hansen: Some things do change gradually because of the inertia system. The global average temperature, if you average it over several years, is going up pretty smoothly, since the middle 1970s. January/February of this year, global temperature is now 1.3 degrees above the 1950-1980 average, but that was just two months. Averaged over the year, it’s going to be about 0.9 degrees Celsius, and that’s pretty much on this almost linear increase over the last four decades. 
Locally and regionally you get abrupt events, which are the ones that have the biggest impact on people. The frequency and severity of extreme events increase as the planet continues to get warmer. Sea level and ice-sheet disintegration is also a very nonlinear process. It’s going to lead to rapid change within the next several decades.

Counterintuitively, sea level rise is not uniform globally for many reasons such as land subsidence and lift, ocean currents and winds and even the strong gravitational field of the massive ice sheets.

All crops in all countries except for maize in Burkina and millet in Burkina and Senegal showed accelerating yield trends when the last 20 year trends was compared to the trends since 1961.

You must ponder how to convert BC (or CE) to ""Before Present"" or ""ago"" as you call it). This is mathematically not difficult if you think about it. 
Not Even Norway (polar amplification and all that) was 2 degrees warmer for most of the time of the Holocene - and I am sure you have forgotten that the general cooling trend over the Holocene is caused by the same mechanism that cause and end ice-ages. But it is still true. 
CO2 remained nice and stable though - while the orbit of our planet slowly changed. It is important to remember in this context that the orbit of Earth is still changing. The amplitude of these changes are obvious not very striking on decadal time-scales. It is why it is easier to record over thousands of years. 
Secondly, in the times of Brexit - it is worth remembering that even the huge nasty EU cover a not particularly big proportion of the world. 
Now we all know that 70% of the planet is ocean - and Africa is a tiny place - until we think about it:

Based on many studies covering a wide range of regions and crops, negative impacts of climate change on crop yields have been more common than positive impacts (high confidence). The smaller number of studies showing positive impacts relate mainly to high-latitude regions, though it is not yet clear whether the balance of impacts has been negative or positive in these regions (high confidence). Climate change has negatively affected wheat and maize yields for many regions and in the global aggregate (medium confidence). Effects on rice and soybean yield have been smaller in major production regions and globally, with a median change of zero across all available data, which are fewer for soy compared to the other crops. Observed impacts relate mainly to production aspects of food security rather than access or other components of food security. See Figure SPM.2C. Since AR4, several periods of rapid food and cereal price increases following climate extremes in key producing regions indicate a sensitivity of current markets to climate extremes among other factors (medium confidence).

From this analysis by Zeke Hausfather:
BQSTART
Hansen et al [1988] presented three different scenarios associated with different future greenhouse gas emissions. Scenario B is shown in the chart below as a thick black line, while scenarios A and C are shown by thin grey lines. Scenario A had exponential growth in emissions, with CO2 and other GHG concentrations considerably higher than today. 
Scenario B assumed a gradual slowdown in CO2 emissions, but had concentrations of 401ppm in 2016 that were pretty close to the 404ppm observed. However, scenario B assumed the continued growth of emissions of various halocarbons that are powerful greenhouse gases, but were subsequently restricted under the Montreal Protocol of 1987. Scenario C had emissions going to near-zero after the year 2000.
Of the three, scenario B was closest to actual radiative forcing, though still about 10% too high. Hansen et al also used a model with a climate sensitivity of 4.2C per doubling CO2 – on the high end of most modern climate models. Due to the combination of these factors, scenario B projected a rate of warming between 1970 and 2016 that was approximately 30% higher than what has been observed.

Now - what are the potential causes of increased crops?
Well - good temperature and precipitation with the right crop for the conditions of climate and soil is of course the old gold standard. 
However at present, a lot more comes into play with intensive farming. 
Good nutrients and soil management are imperatives. And huge advantages are being made here - with high-science innovations on combining natural nutrients (manure or lifting crops back into the soil) with mineral and artificial nutrients (nitrogen, urea, ammonia chemics for example)
Huge scientific advances has also been made on soil-stress - by resting the soil by use of different crops every few years. 
We must also remember breaking of new land (usually by cutting down forest). 
Pesticides is of course widely used - and GM-crops is of course also becoming more and more important. 
Artificial irrigation is opening for wider crop-intensification - as well as better ploughing techniques to optimise permeability and lower nutrient wash-out - and new technology, including use of helicopters to break inversion layers during odd frost-days are innovations being used. 
Finally - the loss during harvesting - it is going down. These corn-harvesters these days run on effing GPS guiding. 
So - just as tree-ring scientists knew a century ago - sure - temperature is a strong. 
But as farming science has known for centuries - one can fool that climate by being smart. 
Finally - you must take a discussion with your sceptical friends below - because they blame the additional CO2 growth on out-gassing from vegetation.

For those unfamiliar with Hansen and might wonder about KS's smear of an excellent scientist, he is one of the planet's most accomplished climate scientists with a long track record of accurate projections and ran NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies for over 30 years, arguably the planet's premier Earth science organization. 
The following is from a 1981 paper by him that at the time hit the front page of the NY Times, all the projections in it have either come to pass or are well underway.

Potential effects on climate in the 21st century include the creation of drought-prone regions in North America and central Asia as part of a shifting of climatic zones, erosion of the West Antarctic ice sheet with a consequent worldwide rise in sea level, and opening of the fabled Northwest Passage.

From early on, the significance of Hansen’s insights was recognized by the scientific community. “The work that he did in the seventies, eighties, and nineties was absolutely groundbreaking,” Spencer Weart, a physicist turned historian who has studied the efforts to understand climate change, told me. He added, “It does help to be right.” 
“I have a whole folder in my drawer labelled ‘Canonical Papers, ’ Michael Oppenheimer, a climate scientist at Princeton, said. “About half of them are Jim’s.”

Yes I do.
You ask about optimal temperature - I answer that all of science say that ""rate of change"" indicate that it must be kept very low. 
We can discuss this even from the scientific concept of the ""Goldilocks zone"" for planets. Liquid water is of course important. 
So that define a bit of stuff. 
We know that Mars had liquid water on the surface. It stopped to have liquid water. Mars also never had a bit moon - hence the orbital parameters of Mars are kind of chaotic. The axis that Mars rotate around are wiggling like a lot, for example. So where our planet a little - enough to make the odd ice age - Mars is wiggling a lot since it does not have a decent moon. 
And that seems to not be great for evolution and intelligent life as far as science knows. Fact is that it seems that Mars never made life.

Pruitt, who has previously erred by denying that carbon dioxide is a key driver of climate change, has again caused consternation among scientists by suggesting that warming temperatures could benefit civilization.
The EPA administrator said that humans are contributing to climate “to a certain degree”, but added: “We know humans have most flourished during times of warming trends. There are assumptions made that because the climate is warming that necessarily is a bad thing.
“Do we know what the ideal surface temperature should be in the year 2100 or year 2018?” he told a TV station in Nevada. “It’s fairly arrogant for us to think we know exactly what it should be in 2100.”
Pruitt said he wanted an “honest, transparent debate about what we do know and what we don’t know, so the American people can be informed and make decisions on their own”.
Under Pruitt’s leadership, the EPA is mulling whether to stage a televised “red team blue team” debate between climate scientists and those who deny the established science that human activity is warming the planet.
Donald Trump has also repeatedly questioned the science of climate change, tweeting during a cold snap in December that the US “could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country, but not other countries, was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against”.
The EPA itself is unequivocal that warming temperatures, and resulting environmental changes, are a danger to human health via heatwaves, smoke from increased wildfires, worsening smog, extreme weather events, spread of diseases, water-borne illnesses and food insecurity. 
This array of health-related challenges has prompted the medical journal the Lancet to state that tackling climate change will be “the greatest global health opportunity of the 21st century”.
National security experts, including those at the Pentagon, have also warned that climate change is set to create a sprawling humanitarian challenge, as millions of people look to escape failing crops, inundated land, drought and conflict. 
Research has pointed to some potential benefits in certain areas of the world, such as areas of the Arctic opening up to agriculture and shipping as frozen soils thaw and sea ice recedes. Deaths from severe cold are also expected to drop, albeit offset by rising mortality from heatwaves. 
Human civilization has, until now, developed in a relatively stable climate. Rising temperatures, of around 1C since the industrial revolution, are pushing humanity into an environment it has never previously experienced. The last time sea surface temperatures were as high as now was around 120,000 years ago, when sea levels were up to 9m higher than today’s average.
“As the evidence becomes ever more compelling that climate change is real and human-caused, the forces of denial turn to other specious arguments, like ‘it will be good for us’,” said Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State University. 
“There is no consistency at all to their various arguments other than that we should continue to burn fossil fuels.”
Since being installed by Trump to lead the EPA, Pruitt has overseen the repeal or delay of dozens of environmental rules, including the Obama administration’s clean power plan, which sought to curb greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants.
“There was a declared war on coal, a war on fossil fuels,” Pruitt said in his Nevada interview. “The EPA was weaponized against certain sectors of our economy and that’s not the role of a regulator. Renewables need to be part of our energy mix, but to think that will be the dominant fuel is simply fanciful.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/07/epa-head-scott-pruitt-says-global-warming-may-help-humans-flourish

The key is it’s retreating on bedrock that, as Jonathan noted in many places, is sloping down into the continent toward the continent, not down toward the ocean. 
It's on what we call a reverse sloped bed, so the grounding line has just gotten thicker, which means it turns out that we can actually start to pump more ice through the grounding line. 
And it's really interesting, the amount of ice that can flow through the grounding line is related to how thick the grounding line is, that's pretty intuitive, but it's an exponential relationship. 
So if the grounding line gets just a little thicker, as it starts to retreat, you start pumping an exponentially greater amount of ice out of the ice sheet, in that as you could see will just lead to a runaway retreat where once that grounding line starts to come back onto that reverse slope bed the system just takes off.

Again - important to make clear that the mechanisms involved are still not well understood.
Many of the key processes inherent to the dynamics of retreating marine ice sheets are not well understood, either from lack of basic knowledge, or more commonly, from lack of detailed site-specific data for model calibration and parameterization. These processes include:...(3) ice-cliff processes, including ice cliff strength, fracture processes, the role of surface melt, and mélange processes that may slow the progress of cliff failure; 
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092181811630491X
The idea of the marine ice-cliff instability is still fairly controversial amongst glaciologists (NOT to be confused with the marine ice sheet instability, which is not controversial and is another reason that West Antarctica is vulnerable to rapid ice loss). A recent paper in Nature3 suggests that there is observational evidence from ancient iceberg tracks, but not all glaciologists are convinced that this new data fully supports the marine ice-cliff instability. Whether the marine ice-cliff instability is something that is likely to occur in Antarctica is still debated amongst scientists.

Once an ice cliff calving retreat begins, a glacier typically accelerates & thins, which can lead to reduced frontal ice height below the critical limit.

Furthermore, it's worth remembering that the higher values from Pollard and De Conto are dependent on us following RCP8.5 (ie doing nothing to reduce emissions), which many consider unlikely to happen.

Simply one fact from his paper would show the first title was the correct one.
BQEND
This change has been variously discussed e.g. here amongst many others. I see no way that the original title could remain given:
 - The speculative nature of the freshwater injection (amount, rate and method)  - Open questions over interpretation of the supporting observational and in particular palaeo-evidence and its interpretation
 - The non-deterministic nature of the climate system  - The fact that the findings contravene accepted science based upon many decades of research and publications by many respected and established groups and individuals
The title was (and has to be) a reflection upon the paper contents and not on whether 2C does or does not reflect dangerous interference with the climate system. Those who willingly or unwittingly conflate these two issues are falling into a very obvious and dangerous (no pun intended) logic trap. The title should reflect the paper and not be a position statement upon whether some nominal departure from pre-industrial is safe or not. The two are completely seperate issues.

That’s if the acceleration rate remains the same as today. ( although Rignot said that our current rate of acceleration of ice sheet mass loss puts us on pace for a meter by 2100, if the rate doesn’t increase.)
BQEND
One of your favourite quotes from Rignot is the suggestion that perhaps other scientists are ""chicken"" - he actively investigates potential upper bounds - yet I don't believe I have ever seen you add the following paragraph:
It’s essential not to overlook Rignot’s caveat — that nature may create certain speed limits for the deterioration of ice sheets. The problem is that we don’t know those limits. In late July, James Hansen, a scientist whose testimony before Congress in the 1980s called national attention to global warming, declared in a paper that sea-­level changes driven by ice-­sheet collapses could well exceed six feet within 50 to 150 years. Rignot does not think the oceans will rise quite so considerably

It is all about balance and framing. You cannot provide that by simply quoting what a single scientist said in a media article.

Very low values and very high values of equilibrium climate sensitivity are now out of the frame.
The lowest number, 2.2, is not good, of course.
If doubling CO2 from 280 ppm to 560 ppm is going to increase average global temperatures by 2.2 C deg at least, this is certainly worrying
2.8 C deg for a doubling of CO2 is bad news indeed, and up to a possible 3.4 C deg would be very serious.
However, it does mean we need to look again at the graph in Emanuel's article:

Were you as expert in hydrology as you suggest, you would long since have known that the UK and its neighbours are receiving increasingly intense winter rainfalls and that these add to the flood prevention problem. You'd also have known that these deluges are a predicted consequence of global warming and, coupled with accelerating sea level rise (another AGW) consequence will be making hydrologists' lives even more interesting, so you wouldn't be trying to disrupt discussion of an article relating future flooding risks to CO2-induced warming if you were a proper hydrologist.
I do agree that current lax attitudes to the destruction of flood plains and loss of tree cover need urgent attention, but we need science to be investigating and discussing all factors which are steadily impairing our ability to safely conduct all the rain we receive from where it fals and down to the sea.
Right now large UK catchments have no plans for how to drain their more extreme precipitations before they flow damagingly through the lives of people and places, and HMG has no plans to invest to even a fraction of Dutch expenditures to prevent the resulting erosion, wreckage and mayhem, preferring to plan nothing, spend peanuts, impede rational management of rivers large and small and let different communities take the hits as they come.

Got that?
So I was pleased to hear the physics of glaciers described in layman's terms (see Richard Alley on any of a number of excellent presentations on YouTube)
Here is all you need to know about the physics of glaciers, (according to Alley anyway) A pile spreads under its own weight. A kilometers thick ice sheet spreads under its own weight, losing mass at the edges, calving ice into the ocean and gaining mass in the middle through snowfall. (Greenland also has surface melt involved)
Like pancake batter it spreads, a bit slower than water does. Pancake batter spreads even slower on a waffle iron than a skillet because of the bumps, like in Greenland's topography.
It also spreads slower if you hold it back with a spatula, the spatula is like the floating ice shelves which slow the spreading of the ice sheets by providing additional friction.
If you speed up the spreading by removing the ""spatula"" then the mass of the ice sheet shrinks and the ocean rises. Add grease to the pan (lubrication from supraglacial lakes breaking through to bedrock) and the spreading speeds up.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1518566238000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'the bumps', u'effect': u""pancake batter spreads even slower on a waffle iron than a skillet like in greenland 's topography""}], u'author_id': u'15131989', u'in_reply_to': u'112187504', u'id': u'112192341', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Erik Frederiksen', u'text': u'From the Penn State scientist Michael Mann recently:

BQEND
1. Accepting that floods have always ocurred and always will
2. Accepting that there is, to date, no evidence of more or greater rainfall events outside normal and natural variability.
3. Recognising that the impacts of flooding have been getting worse over the past 60 years or so, due to manmade causes.
4. Understanding which are the most significant of manmade causes: building on floodplains (which both puts buildings at risk and causes diversion of flood impacts to other places, up and downstream, which were previously at lower risk).
5. Understanding of how land use changes increase the risks of flood impacts: removing vegetation, paving over land, etc
6. Accepting that we can never and will never stop floods causing damange, sometimes seriously, and sometimes causing loss of life.
7. Implementing land use controls to both reverse these changes and to prevent them getting worse. This includes applying the Environment Agency's policy of not allowing new building on flood plains; preventing the new channelling of rivers and streams; reversing the chanelling of rivers and streams to more natural meandering; preventing the removal of essential vegetation; requiring the replanting of such vegetation where feasible; working with farmers to reduce uncontrolled run-off from their fields; encouring infiltration of run-off waters instead of chanelling them via drains to rivers (which then become more inondated and cause more flooding).

But, the Pollard-DeConto work specified a maximum retreat rate that has already been exceeded in Greenland for short times, and the wider glaciers and deeper beds of Antarctica will likely allow faster or much faster retreat than has been achieved in Greenland. No serious studies have yet assessed the fastest retreat--we're working on it, but don't hold much hope of really quantifying it well in the near-term--but if you shift some of that melt between 2100-2200 to shorter times because of the likelihood of faster retreat, you may get a lot of rise by 2100.

The Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age were concepts introduced about 50 years ago by early climate researchers, particularly Hubert Lamb, based on evidence available at that time, but the more they are investigated the more ephemeral they become.
Various sources give different dates for the start and end of the LIA, for example, and it's increasingly disputed that it was a global event.

Incorrect.You are reading something in to what Alley said that isn't there, in order to bolster your claims of a 20' SLR that does not exist in the scientific literature.
Should there be a paper published making that claim, and receive support and achieve Consensus as Fundamentalists comments, then you will have a case (aqs would Alley).
To date this has not happened.
The nearest is Hansen's paper that is still subject to critical feedback for 6m (18'), and the other Evidence(TM) provided shows that it is in the C22 that such a SLR would occur.
Just as I am willing to critique the dismal claims of the deniers, so I will critique the claims of those who over step the mark on the negative effects of AGW and who unwittingly fulfil the ""alarmist"" slot the deniers are all too eager to tout as a way of undermining the totality of accepted science.

Incorrect.As both I and others have pointed out, there are many articles on the other issues resulting in flooding from multiple sources.
Better flood management schemes in the form of afforestation, dredging and so on are all frequently featured in the MSM and more importantly in the scientific arena.
However, these measures will not affect the changes in climate that will increase the probabilities of flooding, which is what the ATL article is about.

But isn't it amazing how the deniers reject the conclusions of the IPCC yet quote the bits that suit their purpose. Also, if you want cutting edge science you go to the scientists at the coal face.

Incorrect.
Alley is not saying that.
He is at best suggesting that the SLR will be at the upper bounds of published science. And this opinion is just that. It needs to be verified by the normal peer reviewed process.
Just as Kent31 claims need to be thoroughly examined so do your claims as you are both cherry picking the leading and lagging ends of the bell curve of scientific projections.
Either of them may be true, but being conservative we need to hedge our bets and go with the mainstream and not cherry pick the results that serve our preconceptions.

We see that warming everywhere – in the atmosphere, in the oceans, with rising sea levels, and melting ice. But while we know conclusively that humans are causing the warming, an equally important question is, “so what?” Really, we want to know the consequences of warming so that we can make informed decisions about what to do about it. We really have only three choices: mitigate, adapt, or ignore and suffer the consequences.
A very new study was just published that helps answer this question of “so what?” The research was conducted by lead author Lorenzo Alfieri (European Commission – Joint Research Centre, Italy), Richard Betts (University of Exeter and Met Office, UK), and their colleagues.
In the study, the authors used what are called Impact Models to assess the risks of large-scale flooding. They focused their attention on Europe partly because there is a lot of hydrological information there, flood reporting is easily available, and predictions of future climate there are plentiful. The authors compared estimates of flood risk in Europe from three recent case studies; their comparison incorporated changes to future climate, expected damage, and population that will be affected in the flooding zones. 
I think of this as a three-part study. First, the authors obtained climate projections for Europe using state-of-the-art climate models. Next, they input the future climate into calculations that quantify flood risk and the impacts. Last, they compared the results that they obtained from their different damage calculation algorithms. The authors looked for areas where the calculations agreed or disagreed with each other. At the end of the day, they wanted to answer two key questions:
1. Is it possible to identify trends that are consistent among the models to help Europe prepare for changes to flood risk?
2. Are there differences in the models and if so, why?
I communicated with Professor Betts who told me:
Our results give the clearest picture yet of climate change increasing the risk of flooding. We did two new sets of model calculations and compared them with a third set from previous work. With all three methods, the result is higher flood risk in Western and Central Europe under a warmer climate, even at just 1.5 degrees C global warming. 
Lead author, Lorenzo added, 
In support to Richard’s statements, the strength of our results comes from the variety of climate projections, methods and models included in this comparison work. The three studies we have considered cover a wide range of variability in projections of flood impacts, thanks to the use of 11 independent climate scenarios, 11 hydrological models, 3 inundation models and 2 impact models. Nevertheless, they all agree on a significant increase in flood risk in most European countries, at all global warming levels. 
So where did the models agree and where did they disagree? The answer is shown in the figure below from the paper. Red colors signify agreement between the models on an increasing flood risk, and green indicates agreement on a reduction of flood risk. Light colors and white indicate disagreement on future projections. The left-most column corresponds to temperature increases of 1.5°C, the middle column is for 2°C temperature increases, and the right is for 3°C increases. In summary, the models all agree that flood risk is increasing and will increase for Western and Central Europe. 
This means the researchers are quite certain regarding increased risks in the central and western parts of Europe but less certain about what will happen in the east. But the authors went a step further; they calculated the expected economic damage from future flooding for the three different temperature increases. They found that regardless of which model was used, there will be significant economic damage (in the range of tens to hundreds of billions of Euros per year) in the warming future. They also showed that the population affected in Europe by future flooding will grow significantly in the future. Roughly estimated, 500,000 to 1 million people are expected to be affected by flooding in the future climate.
What I like about this study is it tries to tackle the problem of quantifying a cost of climate change. We know humans are warming the planet. What we really want to know is what the effect is. Only by comparing costs of action to costs of inaction can we make wise decisions. So far, the research is telling us that it is much wiser to take action now to reduce warming (mitigation) than just ignore greenhouse gases and try to adapt to a harsh future climate. 
Studies like this give lie to people who claim that it is too expensive to take action on climate change. What this study shows is it may be too expensive to do nothing.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/feb/08/climate-change-is-increasing-flood-risks-in-europe

In December 2015, Happer was targeted in a sting operation by the environmental activist group Greenpeace; posing as consultants for a Middle Eastern oil and gas company, they asked Happer to write a report touting the benefits of rising carbon emissions. Happer asked the fee to be donated to the ""objective evidence"" climate-change organization CO2 Coalition, which suggested that he reached out to the Donors Trust to keep the source of funds secret; hiding funding in that way is lawful under US law. Happer acknowledged that his report would probably not pass peer-review with a scientific journal.

Two weeks into her life the Brisbane floods arrived. It was a gut-wrenching slap in the face for me. Not because we were terribly affected but because it was the compounding evidence I needed to understand what climate change would mean for my beautiful fragile newborn.
Before having her, I understood that climate change was real and extreme weather events were only going to get worse and occur more often as the global temperature increased. With an extraordinary deluge of water falling from the sky, holding my newborn, I realised that my daughter was in the firing line and climate reality struck. 
Seven years on, with my second child in tow, politicians continue to fail us. The notion that our government supports opening up the largest coal basin in the southern hemisphere is dumbfounding. That opposition leader Bill Shorten is still unable to take a stand against this dangerous project is also shocking. 
So on Sunday night, I travelled down to Canberra on a very packed bus with my two-year-old from the mid-north coast of New South Wales. An incredible bunch of newly met “climate protectors” travelled with me on this mad rush to Canberra, determined to gather on the first sitting day of parliament to demand our government #StopAdani. 
We travelled for 11 sleep-deprived hours, arriving 15 minutes before the start. It was wonderful to see the passionate people calling for leadership, but our leaders weren’t there to address the crowd.
Our parliament, elected by the people of Australia, hardly listens to the will of the Australian people. Two-thirds of Australians want to stop Adani’s coalmine. Do politicians believe they are immune to climate change? That this is a great big hoax, one to be turned into light comic relief in parliament? 
A year ago today Scott Morrison brought a lump of coal into the chamber, shouting “this is coal, don’t be afraid” to overzealous eruptions of laughter. Other politicians see fit to laugh about sea level rise occurring to Pacific neighbours or at the notion of coral reef scientist crying in despair at the death of our precious reef. 
And where is the opposition? Bill Shorten stands idle, sitting on the fence. An opposition party must give voters a different option. 
If you would like to be the next leader Bill, then you must lead now. You must tell the people about the true threats we are facing. You should visit those being directly effected. You must talk about the future that could be. That you want every coalminer to be supported and retrained so they can build the energy future we so desperately need. That you will carry them into the just transition. 
After half a day of Canberra madness on parliament’s lawn, we all crammed back on that bus and spent another 11 hours driving home. My two-year-old had a wild ride with these wonderful people who showed so much passion and love for a child they had only just met. They were standing up for her future. And I know they will continue to turn up because once you understand what we are facing, you can’t not act. 
As the years go on, every extreme weather event, dire coral bleaching event, kelp forest die-off, mangrove die-off, extreme catastrophic fire, flood, storm, will exacerbate my fear for my daughters’ future. What will we leave our children? How will they survive and thrive as the extremes play out? Will life be only about surviving?
Our children deserve a safe climate. They deserve to see the beauty of the natural world as we do today. They deserve to thrive and survive. They deserve better. That is why we must Stop Adani.

The trash that we have dumped into the oceans or that has separated from various satellites in orbit are important problems. Emissions from planes and rockets into the atmosphere are also serious problems. I do not minimize these problems in any way.
But our knowledge of these problems as well as potential solutions for them require the information, perspective, and data that can only be obtained from satellites in space. As I have stated in previous comments, the SpaceX launch this week was the first test of a new rocket system that reuses components instead of trashing them. SpaceX had estimated a 50% possibility of failure for this first test and could not risk the enormous costs of a destroyed satellite or much worse, the lives of astronauts if the launch failed. The car was an advertising opportunity that was irrelevant to the primary purpose of the first test of the new rocket.
I understand that many people view this event as a selfish and wasteful vanity project. I see work that is as essential as it is unprecedented: reusable rockets that return to a launch pad, electric vehicles with an with an EPA-rated range of 335 miles on a single charge, a mega-battery that can store solar or wind energy and protect the power grid in South Australia. The price for moving from fossil fuels to renewable resources is not trivial as demonstrated by the unprecedented loss that Tesla also announced this week.
I also believe that posing a false dichotomy between investments in new technology and investments in remediation of existing problems will not help anyone. Both are necessary and are often interdependent. People who opposed funding for NASA in the 1960’s could not imagine the discoveries, inventions, or the interconnected world that funding made possible. You and I and every human being alive are the direct beneficiaries from millenia of what you devalue as a “fetish” to discover, explore, and understand the universe in which we live.
How can we determine the environmental consequences of anything if we examine only discrete elements or events but not the systems or processes within which they occur? Acknowledging pollution from ground, air, and space vehicles is honest; pretending that everyone can return to pre-industrial modes of transport and life is not.

This has led to a global debate about how we manufacture and dispose of plastics. The Scottish government announced that it is to host an international conference in 2019 to discuss action on marine litter. It’s ideal territory for any government seeking to be regarded as edgy and cool on this year’s fashionable cause. No one could disagree with its aims and purpose and, more importantly, nothing that emerges from it will commit anyone to spending money or risking the growth of emerging industries.
Perhaps soon our marine technology will have advanced to the stage where we can actually interpret what whales and dolphins are saying and begin to solicit their views on the subject. These creatures are believed to possess remarkable intelligence. If we reached the stage where we could converse with them, perhaps we could appoint some of them as environment tsars in western governments: that would sort the wheat from the chaff in all the chattering about human impact on the health of marine life.
As the debate about our slatternly disposal of plastics was raging down on Earth we were all acclaiming a fresh addition to the garbage dump swirling above us in space. The billionaire car manufacturer Elon Musk launched one of his Tesla Roadsters to Mars in a rocket produced by his company, SpaceX. According to people who know about this stuff, it was the biggest and most powerful rocket launched since the Apollo series and Saturn V. We further learned that the rocket, the Falcon Heavy, uses 27 Merlin rocket engines to develop 22,819kN of thrust. I’m assured that this can carry a 64-tonne payload into low Earth orbit or geosynchronous orbit: more than sufficient for propelling a sports car to Mars. I won’t pretend I understand the science but let’s just say that Musk won’t be getting invited to address an environmental summit in the near future.
You might be tempted to dismiss this as an expensive publicity stunt by a billionaire playboy with too much time on his hands. But in reality it’s an important step towards a time when space travel for your average indolent millionaire will become commonplace. It will probably become another way of managing your finances when Mars inevitably becomes the ultimate off-shore tax haven.
You might be tempted to dismiss this as an expensive publicity stunt by a billionaire playboy with too much time on his hands
Quite what our fetish for space exploration and spending billions on the technology required to feed this does to the environment is a serious matter. There’s a dissonance emerging here. On Earth, we’re organising summits and setting up carbon footprint-reduction targets all over the shop. Yet, up in yonder outer space we’ve established a giant garbage dump replete with huge hulks of rusting metal and, as of last week, a $200k American sports car.
Indeed, the whole issue of rocket emissions needs to be considered if we’re serious about the environment. These emissions deliver gases and particles into the Earth’s upper atmosphere and this will be addressed later this year at the UN’s quadrennial global ozone assessment conference. Martin Ross, a senior project engineer for civil and commercial launch projects at the Aerospace Corporation in California, told the online journal Space.com that rocket soot accumulates in the upper stratosphere, where the particles absorb sunlight. “This accumulation heats the upper stratosphere, changing chemical reaction rates and likely leading to ozone loss.” He added: “The 2018 assessment is really the first one to have a substantial section on rocket emissions, not just a passing thought… we now understand that the climate and ozone impacts of rocket exhaust are completely intertwined.”
And if we’re discussing space, then we ought to be discussing the impact of all these rockets on our potential neighbours in the galaxy. I’ve always found it curious that despite spending even more billions over decades trying to locate other forms of intelligent life we’ve had nary a cheep back; not even a single intergalactic WhatsApp message. So either our neighbours are a rude shower or they simply don’t exist. But what if there’s another, more sinister explanation: that they do exist but are so far ahead of us in intelligence that they’ve created the means to put themselves out of our reach, perhaps with a giant jamming device.
This would explain all those sightings of extraterrestrial spacecraft and kidnappings. Every so often, they check us out to see if we’ve advanced to a stage where they feel they can have a reasonable chat with us. Such visits are bound to have left them disappointed. In recent months, I can imagine one of their scouts reporting back: “Look, 2,000 years ago, the leader of the civilised world in Rome gave his horse a seat in his cabinet; now the most civilised country in the world has appointed some medieval bampot called Trump. They’re still savages.”
I can only imagine, too, how resentful they’re getting at us disfiguring their neighbourhood with obsolete metal junk. If I was them I’d be sorely tempted to invade us to sort this out or simply send a short, sharp reminder that our actions have consequences.

Catherine Mitchell, a professor of energy policy at the University of Exeter, said poor gender diversity meant the industry was less open to new ideas, in particular the move to a lower-carbon energy system.
“I absolutely do think that the fact that the industry is so dominated by men and particularly older white men it is slowing down the energy transition,” said Mitchell, who has worked on energy issues for more than 30 years and advises the government, regulators and businesses.
An energy conference featuring women-only panels is being held next month to address the lack of visibility of female leaders in the sector. 
“I thought we really need to have something where all these women who are great get to speak,” said Mitchell, who has helped organise the event.
She admitted it was not a given that women are more progressive on energy issues than men, but noted that the “conventional” parts of the sector – fossil fuel power generation and energy networks – are more male-dominated than greener, innovative companies.
“The fact we are not moving is not good for Britain, is not good for the environment,” she said of attitudes slowing the transition to renewable and decentralised energy.
Juliet Davenport, the chief executive of the energy supplier Good Energy, said the argument was credible. “The energy sector is lagging sorely behind other industries in terms of diversity, meanwhile sustainable [green] businesses are very balanced. So the idea that lack of diversity is contributing to the issue of transition to renewables is very plausible,” she said.
Nearly two-thirds of the leading 89 energy companies in the UK have no women on their boards and industry events with men-only panels, or just one woman, are common. 
One female energy expert said she had been disinvited from a panel of chief executives at an annual event after a company deputised a female executive. 
“It became a panel of CEOs, with a woman, and so they did not ‘need’ another woman,” she said.
Sometimes it is a case of being the only woman in the room. One senior female executive said she was the sole woman at a meeting hosted by an influential male government adviser in London. 
Sexual harassment is not unknown either: one female leader, who did not want to be named, said she was groped by the head of a trade body at an awards event several years ago.
Felicity Jones, a partner at the renewables and energy storage consultancy Everoze, recalled being in a speaker’s room at a conference when a fellow speaker asked for a coffee refill, assuming she was one of the catering staff.
“That kind of thing happens, but I laugh it off. Because it works both ways: often my gender gives me an advantage. I do a lot of business development and pretty much all of my counterparts at competitors are men. That means that I stand out,” she said.
Occasionally, the lack of gender diversity breaks out in public. During a recent questioning of energy chiefs by MPs on the impact of a price cap, the Conservative MP Antoinette Sandbach said: “I am quite struck by the panel. We have four men here.”
Sandbach went on to scold the retail chief executive of SSE, Stephen Forbes, for the company’s 19.4% gender pay gap, a figure he attempted to defend.
Some in the industry are making an effort to address the problem, such as the big six lobby group Energy UK, which has banned men-only panels at its events. “The energy sector is undergoing a huge period of transition, which brings with it a huge opportunity to increase gender balance,” said the group’s external affairs director, Abbie Sampson.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/11/the-energy-industrys-power-problem-too-few-women

Because gas was more profitable. Seriously who's side are you are arguing for?
Did FoE campaign against gas in the 1990s? Did any anti-nuclear group campaign against gas? No they supported gas because it was not nuclear.
Look at FoE's ""Bright Future"" report from 2006. Their ""Good Mix"" plan (p9) shows that around 50% of their solution is based on gas (CCGT and CHP are gas based). They phase out nuclear completely, because that is their policy.
Seriously, with all respect, this appears to be a gap in your knowledge. The anti-nuclear movement promoted coal, and then gas, in order to avoid nuclear. FoE, Greenpeace et al did nothing to oppose coal until gas came along; and nothing to oppose gas (apart from fracking) thereafter.

The point is that 100% renewables is a less attainable route to decarbonisation than renewables+nuclear. It may even be unattainable. But in practical terms 100% renewables is not the direction that the world is heading in.

For clarity: There are a small number of nuclear at any cost posters, derailing the discussion on Pruitt and Trump's denial of basic science.
These posters are derailing the discussion to attack renewables in order to promote their favoured power source - nuclear.
After 7 days none of these usual suspects have in any way shape or form attacked the basic denial of AGW by Pruitt and Trump, nor attacked their advocacy of fossil fuels.
Instead, they have devoted a considerable amount of time and energy spreading the greenwash lies of the fossil fuel industry, and attacking the renewable energy sector.
BQSTART
Hansen aggressively promotes nuclear over renewables. You think he is not sincere about CO2 reduction?
BQEND
As Lochnessmunster commented, Hansen is a climate scientist, but not an expert on energy. His motives are well meaning, and as I have pointed out, I also believe nuclear is going to be part of the mix of low carbon energy in the future.
However, using him as a proxy or cover for aggressive nuclear expansion is an argument from authority by certain people.
BQSTART
Equally, the evidence shows that the fossil industry perceives an existential threat from nuclear power, and opposes it; whereas it does not perceive the same existential threat from renewables - in fact its strategy is to work alongside renewables to prolong the use of fossil fuel.

Until you and the other nuclear at any cost groupies actually start challenging the existing status quo of fossil fuels that Pruitt and Trump are protecting you'll get short shrift. 
As I have pointed out repeatedly, I have no problem with nuclear power per se, but I do have a problem with the aggressive promotion of nuclear power over renewables.
BQEND
WIth respect, it is not clear what your point is here.
""Aggressive promotion of nuclear power"" implicitly challenges the ""existing status quo of fossil fuels"".
Hansen aggressively promotes nuclear over renewables. You think he is not sincere about CO2 reduction?
You need to ask yourself why you have this problem with aggressive promotion of nuclear power. I agree it is quite legitimate for you to back a combination of renewables and nuclear; and I would agree with you that this is the pragmatic and plausible route to decarbonisation. But we also know from the evidence that aggressive pursuit of nuclear power is a viable route to deep decarbonisation for a major economy (because France did it). It is less clear that this is possible with renewables absent nuclear power (except for small countries with large hydro).
Equally, the evidence shows that the fossil industry perceives an existential threat from nuclear power, and opposes it; whereas it does not perceive the same existential threat from renewables - in fact its strategy is to work alongside renewables to prolong the use of fossil fuel.
Unless you start positing some evidence to the contrary it is not clear how you can defend your accusation that nuclear supporters are ""useful idiots"" for fossil fuel. In fact the evidence shows the opposite: nuclear opponents are patently the useful idiots. Why be an apologist for them?

100% Renewable Electricity Worldwide Is A New Cost-Effective Reality
BQSTART
A global power system fully based on renewable energy is no longer a long-term vision, but a tangible reality. Yet critics of renewable energy and fossil fuels, as well as nuclear lobbyists, often use solar and wind fluctuations as their major argument to hold on to the old system.
BQEND
and
BQSTART
The first of its kind study* simulates a global electricity system based entirely on renewable energy on an hourly basis throughout a whole year. Its results prove that the existing renewable energy potential and technologies, including storage, are able to generate sufficient and secure power supply worldwide by 2050. Under favorable political conditions, a full decarbonization and nuclear phase-out of the global electricity system can succeed even earlier than that. 
The study proves that 100% renewable electricity is more cost effective than the existing system, which is largely based on fossil fuels and nuclear energy. Total levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) on a global average for 100% renewable electricity will decline to 52 €/MWh (megawatt-hour) by 2050 (including curtailment, storage and some grid costs), compared to 70 €/MWh in 2015.
BQEND
and
BQSTART
The study shows that there is no reason to invest any single dollar in fossil fuel or nuclear power production. It also proves that energy transition is no longer a question of technical feasibility or economic viability, but of political will.

KingInYellow - Interesting the nuclear at any cost brigade are out in force on this one, the fossil fuel lobby's useful idiots.
BQEND
To better understand where the fossil fuel lobby's useful idiots are, let's take a look at the career timeline of Robert Orville Anderson, one of the wealthiest oil tycoons in the world:
BQSTART
Robert Orville Anderson (1917–2007) was an American businessman and philanthropist who founded Atlantic Richfield Oil Co. 
After graduating, he worked for the American Mineral Spirits Company, a subsidiary of Pure Oil. In 1941, his father helped him and his brothers buy a refinery in New Mexico.
By 1950 Anderson owned several refineries, had built a pipeline system and had become a wildcatter. He entered the top ranks of independent oil producers in 1957 with a major find at the Empire-Abo field in New Mexico.
In 1963, Anderson merged his company into the Atlantic Refining Company of Philadelphia. In 1966, as Atlantic's chairman and chief executive, he merged with Richfield Oil of Los Angeles, forming Atlantic Richfield Company (later shortened to ""ARCO"". 
In 1967, he approved recommendations from ARCO. His approval led to ARCO's discovery of still the largest oil field yet found in North America at Prudhoe Bay on Alaska's North Slope.
In 1969 he founded Friends of the Earth as an anti-nuclear group. He contributed $200,000 in personal funds to launch FOTE. FOTE main mission was to lock up and prevent further development of nuclear energy.
Soon after, due to the wealth gained by the finding of Prudhoe Bay oil, he merged again with Sinclair Oil, forming the United States' seventh-biggest oil company.
Anderson also led the seven-company effort to develop the Alaskan oil pipeline in 1974.

Anderson was a ruthlessly successful oil tycoon, yet he also found the time to set up an anti-nuclear environmental organisation.

""The level of agreement between climate model simulations and observed surface temperature change is a topic of scientific and policy concern. While the Earth system continues to accumulate energy due to anthropogenic and other relative forcings, estimates of recent surface temperature evolution fall at the lower end of climate model projections. Global mean temperatures from climate model simulations are typically calculated using surface air temperatures, while the corresponding observations are based on a blend of air and sea surface surface temperatures. This work quantifies a systematic bias in model-observation comparisons arising from differential warming rates between sea surface temperatures and surface air temperatures over oceans. A further bias arises from the treatment of temperatures in regions where the sea ice boundary has changed.

Here's RWE explaining how its new lignite power station goes so well with renewables:
BQSTART
About BoAplus RWE Power is planning the construction of a new power plant block in Niederaussem. BoAplus is to become the most modern and most environmentally friendly lignite power station of the Rheinische Revier, which will set standards worldwide with its construction, efficiency and environmental technology. 
Partner of renewablesRWE Power supports the Energiewende, for example, by expanding wind power and biomass utilization in the Rhineland district. The planned BoAplus power plant is also an active contribution to the modernization of the energy system because it is designed for highly flexible operation. Through large and rapid changes in performance, it helps to cushion the fluctuating feed-in of renewable energy sources.

The interviewer brought up the topic of climate change, and virtually everything Pruitt said in response was wrong, and was often refuted on his own agency’s website, until he started deleting it.
To begin, Pruitt claimed that we don’t know ‘with precision’ what’s causing global warming. 
Our activity contributes to the climate changing to a certain degree. Now measuring that with precision, Gerard, I think is more challenging than is let on at times.
Here’s what the EPA website said about that a year ago, before Pruitt got a hold of it as part of the Trump Administration’s systematic deletion of government climate change websites:
Research indicates that natural causes do not explain most observed warming, especially warming since the mid-20th century. Rather, it is extremely likely that human activities have been the dominant cause of that warming.
To support this statement, the EPA referenced the latest IPCC report. The IPCC concluded with 95% confidence that humans are the main cause of global warming since 1950, with a best estimate that humans are responsible for all of the global warming during that time. That’s what the scientific research has overwhelmingly concluded: 
Similarly, the EPA’s Student’s Guide to Climate Change (which has survived the Trump purge) says:
The Earth is getting warmer because people are adding heat-trapping gases to the atmosphere, mainly by burning fossil fuels … People are causing these changes, which are bigger and happening faster than any climate changes that modern society has ever seen before.
Analysis: Why scientists think 100% of global warming is due to humans | @hausfath @_rospearce https://t.co/9DqrYVMnBj pic.twitter.com/oGN5J8a1PO
Pruitt later shifted gears to repeat the third most popular climate myth:
I think there’s assumptions made that because the climate is warming, that that necessarily is a bad thing.
This is not a matter of assumptions – it’s a conclusion supported by a vast body of scientific research. The EPA website likewise tackled this one, until Pruitt got his hands on it:
Scientific studies indicate that extreme weather events such as heat waves and large storms are likely to become more frequent or more intense with human-induced climate change.
And the EPA’s Student’s Guide to Climate Change addresses it:
The negative impacts of global climate change will be less severe overall if people reduce the amount of greenhouse gases we’re putting into the atmosphere and worse if we continue producing these gases at current or faster rates.
The EPA’s Climate Change Indicators page likewise lists a number of dangerous climate change consequences. Quite simply, more intense droughts, floods, and hurricanes, and coastal inundation from sea level rise are all very bad outcomes. And even the rosiest analyses conclude that any further global warming will be bad for the economy.
In fact, not only did Pruitt suggest the consequences of global warming won’t be bad, he seemed to think they’ll be good and humans will “flourish.”
Is it an existential threat - is it something that is unsustainable, or what kind of effect or harm is this going to have? We know that humans have most flourished during times of, what, warming trends? … Do we know what the ideal surface temperature should be in the year 2100 or year 2018? It’s fairly arrogant for us to think we know exactly what it should be in 2100.
I asked climate scientists to answer this ‘ideal temperature’ question last month. They all agreed that the ideal climate is a stable one. Pruitt is wrong to say humans flourished during warming trends – we flourished during times of relatively flat temperatures without rapid trends. Climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe explained:
There is no one perfect temperature for the earth, but there is for us humans, and that’s the temperature we’ve had over the last few thousands of years when we built our civilization, agriculture, economy, and infrastructure. Global average temperature over the last few millennia has fluctuated by a few tenths of degrees; today, it’s risen by nearly 1°C and counting.
Why do we care? Because we are perfectly adapted to our current conditions…
Pruitt’s goal with these answers is clearly to manufacture doubt – to make people think that we needn’t take urgent action to slow global warming because the outcome might not be so bad. But that argument ignores the vast body of scientific evidence that clearly shows the net consequences of continued rapid climate change will fall somewhere in the range of bad to catastrophic. I summarized some of those consequences in this Denial101x lecture:
Toward the end of the interview, Pruitt let slip his allegiance to the fossil fuel industry:
Renewables need to be part of our energy mix, but to think that’s going to be the dominant fuel, or dominant energy source on how we generate electricity, I think is simply fanciful … There was a declared war on coal. The EPA was weaponized against certain sectors of our economy – fossil fuels generally - and that’s not the role of a regulator.
First of all, under the Obama administration, the EPA regulated carbon pollution because it was legally required to do so under the Clean Air Act, according to the Supreme Court. That’s not being ‘weaponized’ against fossil fuels, it’s called enforcing the law to protect Americans’ health.
Second, there is no reason why renewables couldn’t be the dominant fuel in our energy mix. In fact, several states have renewable portfolio standards and goals to make that happen. For example, Hawaii aims for 100% renewable energy by 2045, and California and New York have targets of 50% renewables by 2030. California is even ahead of schedule, on track to meet that goal a decade early, by 2020.
As if his misinformation about climate science and clean energy weren’t bad enough, Pruitt really laid it on thick when asked about the Paris climate accords.
[Paris] was a bad business deal for this country … it was not about CO2 reduction. If it was about CO2 reduction, they would not have let China and India take until 2030 to reduce their CO2 footprint.
In reality, the Paris agreement couldn’t have been a better deal. America needed only to follow through on existing climate policies to meet its Paris targets, and because the agreement is non-binding, there would be no consequence to missing the targets anyway. Moreover, because China and India are rapidly developing countries, cutting carbon pollution is much more difficult than in a developed country like the US. In fact, China pledged much more aggressive climate action than America in the Paris agreement.
And it should go without saying that claiming the Paris climate agreement is “not about CO2 reduction” is utterly absurd nonsense.
It bears remembering that Pruitt heads the Environmental Protection Agency. It’s easy to forget, since he seems to think it’s his job to undo as many regulations protecting the environment and public health as possible, and to maximize fossil fuel industry profits. That’s clear from his constant peddling of climate myths and misinformation. As climate scientist Michael Mann told The Guardian, “There is no consistency at all to their various arguments other than that we should continue to burn fossil fuels.”
Pruitt isn’t in charge of the labor department or the pollution council or Koch Industries. His job is to protect human and environmental health, and it’s hard to imagine anyone doing the job any worse.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/feb/12/the-epa-debunked-administrator-pruitts-latest-climate-misinformation

Storm Desmond brought the first deluge in December, turning the river into a raging torrent, sweeping through many properties, and cutting the village off from the outside world for a full two days. Storm Eva barrelled in a few weeks later, and Glenridding ended up awash three times in the space of four weeks.
So what is going on? Are extreme climate events becoming more frequent, or were the residents of Glenridding suffering a series of unlucky rolls of the dice?
To answer this question, Wouter Berghuijs, from ETH Zurich, and colleagues have been analysing streamflow statistics from all over the world, and totting up the number of extreme events in each catchment. 
They have found that European rivers have experienced a 44% increase in extreme floods since 1995, suggesting that global warming has played a role. 
Writing in the journal Environmental Research Letters, the scientists conclude that flood history is not a reliable predictor for future flood risk, and climate change needs to be taken into account too.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/feb/12/weatherwatch-extreme-flooding-on-rise-in-europe-over-past-20-years

While enjoying an early bit of colour in window boxes, gardens and local wild spaces, many expressed concern that a warming climate was to blame.
Below are some of the pictures and stories we’ve been receiving through the project – you can see more and add yours here.
Daffodils in Rachel’s garden in Cornwall have been flowering along verges since late December. “The image above was taken on 11 January 2018 in the village of St Tudy, North Cornwall. Snowdrops are everywhere; primroses too in sheltered spots near St Agnes on the north coast. The magnolia tree in our south facing garden has had buds growing since the end of last year.”
“This photo was taken in utter disbelief back in November and is the tip of the iceberg,” writes Brian, who lives in Torquay. “I’m aware the south coast is warmer than much of the rest of the British Isles, but wild snowdrops in November? I’m in my 60s, and this is a first.”
Reader John Harris, a photographer at Capel Manor Gardens, Middlesex, sent the above image of an early season red admiral.
The species is more commonly seen from around March but is the UK’s most popular. In 2017, red admiral numbers were seen by the Big Butterfly Count to have thrived, so they might be looking forward to an even better 2018.
“Almost everything is out now, from snowdrops to daffodils,” writes Sylvia Clare from the Isle of Wight. “My hellebores orientalis were especially weird this year, flowering from mid October through to a second fuller flush now – more than one of them too. In the picture above you can just make out the older fading blooms under the taller newer ones. I’ve seen them in December before, but never October.”
These early crocuses surprised a reader in Stourbridge. 
And Verna Evans was walking in York House Gardens on 8 February and saw this as a sign spring had come early.
“Iris in January?” asks a reader in Dumfries and Galloway. “Could the blue moon have anything to do with it? So many questions!” 
Liyana Azmi got in touch from Glasgow. “I was lucky enough to snap this photo on a rare sunny day at Glasgow University after a heavy snowfall the night before. I’m pretty sure those are daffodil sprouts and find it quite surprising to see them around the third week of January.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/13/a-first-in-my-60-years-readers-spot-early-signs-of-spring

At the current rate, the world’s oceans will be on average at least 60cm (2ft) higher by the end of the century, according to research published in Monday’s Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences.
Based on 25 years of satellite data, however, the research shows that the pace has quickened. It confirms scientists’ computer simulations and is in line with predictions from the UN, which releases regular climate change reports.
“It’s a big deal” because the projected sea level rise is a conservative estimate and it is likely to be higher, said the lead author, Steve Nerem of the University of Colorado.
Other scientists said even small changes in sea levels can lead to flooding and erosion. “Any flooding concerns that coastal communities have for 2100 may occur over the next few decades,” said Katy Serafin, a coastal flooding expert at Oregon State University.
Sea level rise is causing by warming waters and the melting of ice sheets and glaciers. Of the 7.5cm rise in the past 25 years, about 55% is from warmer water expanding, and the rest is from melting ice.
The process is accelerating, however, and more than three-quarters of the acceleration since 1993 is due to melting ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, the study shows.
There are two factors that affect sea level rise: year-to-year fluctuations caused by natural events and larger long-term trends linked to man-made climate change. Nerem’s team removed the natural effects of the 1991 Mt Pinatubo eruption that temporarily chilled the planet, and the climate phenomena El Niño and La Niña, and found the accelerating trend.
Sea level rise rather than temperature is a better gauge of climate change in action, according to Anny Cazenave, the director of Earth science at the International Space Science Institute in France, who edited the study. Cazenave is one of the pioneers of space-based sea level research.
Global sea levels were stable for about 3,000 years until the 20th century, when they rose increasingly quickly because of global warming caused by the burning of fossil fuels, said Stefan Rahmstorf, a climate scientist at the Potsdam Institute in Germany.
Two feet of sea level rise by the end of the century “would have big effects on places like Miami and New Orleans, but I don’t still view that as catastrophic” because those cities can survive – at great expense, Nerem said.
When a storm such as Superstorm Sandy in 2012 strikes, however, sea level rise on top of storm surge can lead to record damages, researchers said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/13/melting-ice-sheets-are-hastening-sea-level-rise-satellite-data-confirms

It marks a milestone in the opening up of Russia’s northern coastline, as thawing polar ice makes industrial development and maritime trade increasingly viable.
The Teekay vessel Eduard Toll set out from South Korea in December for Sabetta terminal in northern Russia, cutting through ice 1.8m thick. Last month, it completed the route, delivering a load of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Montoir, France. Its voyage was captured by the crew in a timelapse video.
Bermuda-based firm Teekay is investing in six ships to serve the Yamal LNG project in northern Russia. A similarly designed vessel owned by Sovcomflot made the same passage last August. This small and growing Arctic-ready fleet can operate independently of icebreaker escorts, which are also in high demand.
Arctic sea ice is steadily thinning and receding, with seasonal fluctuation, as global temperatures rise due to human activity. In January 2018, ice extent hit another record low for the month, according to the US National Snow and Ice Data Center.
While polar conditions remain tough, the trend creates market opportunities. The northern sea route is shorter than alternatives through the Suez Canal for many trade links between Europe and Asia.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/13/shipping-first-as-commercial-tanker-crosses-arctic-sea-route-in-winter

In the future, they may even be viewed as a handy tool in the battle to fight climate change.
 Greenhouse gas emissions from the transport of goods could be cut if drones replace trucks in some instances, researchers have found, providing an environmental edge to the push by companies such as Amazon and Google to expand drone deliveries.
 “Drones can make a significant impact on emissions, especially now that transport is the biggest polluting sector out there,” said Joshuah Stolaroff, an environmental scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. “That last mile of getting goods to a destination is a big part of the emissions picture. There are plenty of plausible scenarios where drones can do environmental good.”
 Stolaroff and his colleagues spent three years studying the environmental difference between quad copters, a type of drone and diesel-powered delivery trucks in the US. In new research published in Nature Communications, they found that within the 4km (2.5 mile) range of current battery-driven delivery drones, the airborne devices consumed less energy per package and per kilometer than trucks for light deliveries of 0.5kg (1.1lb).
The findings suggest that drones can deliver certain items faster and with less environmental impact than trucks, which form part of a transport sector responsible for around of a fifth of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions.
 However, there are several drawbacks to drones that mean they are unlikely to displace road-based deliveries. Stolaroff’s study found that drones require additional warehouse support, due to their limited range, and struggle when it comes to larger packages, especially if the drones are recharged by an electricity grid fed mainly by fossil fuels rather than renewable energy.
 “A drone would be a good option to deliver an iPhone or a pair of sunglasses. A bag of groceries or a computer monitor? Probably not,” said Stolaroff. “A larger drone may not be a win for the environment.”
 Amazon is intent on using drones to transport goods weighing less than 2.5kg, which make up a large majority of its deliveries. In December 2016, the company said it had achieved its first autonomous drone delivery, taking 13 minutes to deliver some popcorn and a TV streaming device to a customer in the UK.
 Companies have used Europe as a testing ground because of tight restrictions on the use of drones in the US, where the device must be controlled by a human who keeps the drone in visual line of sight.
The US Secret Service announced last summer it was testing drones to keep watch over Donald Trump while he plays golf.
Concerns over the impact on commercial and military flight – in September a drone collided with an army helicopter in New York – have also cast doubt over drone use. For many companies, a shift to electric delivery vehicles, rather than drones, may be a more realistic climate-friendly move, although that helps less with traffic jams.
“There’s a lot of potential there but it’s very challenging,” said Logan Campbell, chief executive of Aerotas, a consultancy for firms that wish to use drones. “Drones make sense for medicines or some important documents, maybe, but it makes no sense to deliver milk via drones. You can do that far more efficiently and at lower cost via road.
“The regulations need to change in order for it to make sense. The safety of air travel is a big issue that no-one will want to compromise. Even Amazon, with all its money and lobbying, will find it hard to change that.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/13/drones-trucks-climate-change-carbon-emissions

The CFMEU’s national president, Tony Maher, told Guardian Australia if federal Labor took the hardline stance against the Adani coal project it was currently telegraphing, promising to stop the mine if it won the next election, then “what do you do with the next [coalmine], and the next one, and the one after that?”
“I see no reason for Labor to toughen its position,” Maher said in an interview. “Why win Batman and lose in central Queensland?
“The environment groups have worked themselves up into a passion about it. I don’t know why. Adani is just another project and it should be judged on its merits.”
The union leader expressed scepticism about whether the Adani project would ultimately proceed but he said if it did, the union would seek to make an agreement with the company.
Maher said he believed it was possible for the mine to be opened up and the world to meet the pollution reduction targets set at the Paris climate conference.
The negative comments from a significant internal stakeholder come as Labor in Canberra is continuing to deliberate on its Adani stance, mulling potential legal options it could take to stop the project.
While the ALP federally has been weighing up Adani for some months, Labor leader Bill Shorten’s recent signal that Labor was considering adopting a more hardline position coincided with a decision by David Feeney to resign from parliament because he could not demonstrate that he wasn’t a dual citizen – triggering a byelection in his Melbourne electorate of Batman.
Adani is a hot-button issue in Melbourne’s northern suburbs, where the Greens have been running a ground campaign against Labor’s initial support for Adani for months. Labor strategists are pessimistic about holding Batman in a head-to-head contest with the Greens.
While adopting a stance of public opposition to the Adani project could neutralise progressive activist campaigns on the ground in the crucial byelection, Maher’s argument is that position will trigger a broader debate in the Labor party and the labour movement about the future of coal.
With a national conference due in the middle of the year, the CFMEU will resist Labor inching towards a no new coal stance, viewing that position as alienating to the party’s traditional blue collar base.
One of the options Labor is mulling as a policy response is the insertion of a “climate trigger” in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, which could be used to prevent any new coal mines on climate grounds.
Labor is also understood to be working up a regional package designed to reassure voters in Queensland concerned about a loss of economic activity and jobs if Adani doesn’t proceed, which will focus on opportunities beyond coal. 
There are a range of internal views about how hard to go against the project. Adani was discussed by the shadow cabinet last Monday and it was thought Labor could make a decision last week, but no final position has yet emerged.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/15/labor-shouldnt-toughen-its-stance-on-adani-coalmine-cfmeu-head-warns

The deferral idea is floated in a new discussion paper about the guarantee prepared by the Energy Security Board to kick off consultations about how the Turnbull government’s proposal would work – assuming the Neg gets the backing of state governments.
The 58-page paper, released on Thursday afternoon, says retailers could be permitted to defer up to a mandated limit, perhaps 20% of their emissions in a given compliance year, to provide “flexibility” as the scheme takes effect.
It also suggests retailers would be permitted to carry forward any “overachievement” on emissions reduction, and use that in the next compliance year, rather than the counter resetting each year.
The Neg, proposed by the Turnbull government last year, would impose a reliability obligation and an emissions reduction on energy retailers and a small number of large electricity users.
The new emissions reduction target proposed for the electricity sector is 26% on 2005 levels by 2030.
The government unveiled the proposal last year, hailing it as an idea that could end the decade-long toxic climate wars, but state governments led by South Australia have resisted the proposal on the basis it is not sufficiently friendly to renewable energy.
The release of Thursday’s discussion paper sets off a very tight timetable of technical consultations with stakeholders. The Energy Security Board wants feedback by March, and will brief energy ministers in April about the design of the scheme.
The discussion paper underscores the fact the Neg will require a significant overhaul of the existing national electricity market arrangements, including a new bureaucracy to ensure compliance.
The paper makes it clear the proposed emissions reduction target – considered by a number of experts as too low to see Australia meet its obligations under the Paris agreement – will be locked in for 10 years.
While energy regulators have signalled that an incoming Labor government would have scope to quickly ratchet up the level of ambition in the emissions reduction target, the language in the paper on that option is cooler.
The paper proposes that further adjustments to the target be made at five-yearly intervals to “ensure the market has, at any time, between five and 10 years of targets available to guide investment decisions”.
The Turnbull government has floated that retailers will be able to use offsets, like international permits, to help them meet their emissions reduction obligations at least cost, but the new discussion paper suggests that use will be limited.
It suggests if offsets are in the mix, then the government could “place a limit on the volume of offsets that could be used for compliance with the emissions requirement across the national electricity market”.
The paper suggests the regulation could be a percentage limit, for example, 10% of the electricity emissions target, or an absolute limit, for example, 500,000 units of offsets per year.
The discussion paper confirms that power used by industries designated as energy intensive and trade exposed “should be effectively exempt from the emissions requirement” and it suggests other industries will “need to make up the difference” to ensure the emissions reduction target for electricity is met.
It says care will need to be taken in the design of the new scheme to ensure there is not further market concentration in the energy sector, which is already highly concentrated because generators and retailers are combined in vertically integrated businesses.
The paper also confirms that penalties will apply if market participants don’t comply with their emissions reduction and reliability targets, although it emphasises that the first resort should be a culture of compliance, rather than a civil penalty.
It suggests retailers who don’t meet their mandated requirement to supply sufficient reliable power to the market could have to meet the costs of the Australian Energy Market Operator supplying that power to the market through a reserve scheme.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/15/electricity-retailers-could-defer-emissions-reductions-under-coalition-plan

It's not clear from the report whether things like energy efficiency technologies or renewables or recycling were included in the count of climate-related news items. There probably wasn't much (particularly on Fox), but climate is implied when covering those issues and surely climate change can be brought into a lot of subjects, ecological, economic and so on, besides being associated with weather.

Those fires were the result of negligence, not climate change.
BQEND
On a technical level, you are undeniably correct. It took a spark to actually start the fires which led to the devastation which burned the hillsides which then flooded and killed my friend Peter.
On a systemic you, like many of the Libertarian ""skeptics"" or TT are making the error of confusing the individual incident with the conditions necessary to create the entire sequence of events: long term climate change, increasing volume of downpours, late-season failures of any rain thus failing to create roots to keep soils settled - all these are features of climate change in the Mediterranean climate zone here in Southern California. Individually they do not cause December fires and mudslides. Combined they are fatal.

The theory of anthropogenic global warming is established by ample evidence to be a reality. You don't indulge a reality, you accept it (which you seem to have trouble doing) and do something practical about it.
You also need to accept the evidence that shows that in reality the medieval warm period was regional and not markedly warm and counterbalanced by cooler times in my part of the world. The little ice age was also largely regional being initiated and occasionally reinforced by volcanic aerosols and maintained by export of sea ice into the North Atlantic with consequent changes in ocean current - but also underlain by the cooling trend of the last 5,000 and particular last 2,000 years due to declining Northern Hemisphere high latitude summer insolation, which is continuing.
Climate is bit one of many natural phenomena on this planet that humble those prone to pride but more importantly provide a great source of wonder to those with humility. These days we do more than theorise about climate, which is wonderful thing.

Scroll down to graphs of climate forcings over last 150 years. Note graph b is of the solar component. Noste that ir varies about a flat line. Note that the amplitude of these variations are of the order of 0.05 degrees C in their impact on global temperature. Note the the anthropogenic component of global warming has risen by almost 1 degree C since the 19 century - 20 times the amplitude of that solar variation.
There is no evidence that these small solar variations affect volcanoes and earthquakes, so to say we can ""Expect immense suffering, increased volcano and activity for example"" is just plain loopy.

In science we always question what we're told by asking what's the evidence upon which this claim is based. If the person making the claim cannot come up with the evidence the claim, like yours about ""contrarian scientists"" being refused funding, is not accepted.
So I'm questioning your claim about contrarian scientists being refused funding and insisting that you come up with the evidence or your claim will be dismissed as nonsense.
No one is ramming anything down my throat. I am free to read the scientific literature in peer reviewed published in proper scientific journals and examine the evidence they provide.
That includes where they got the data. What the data is being used to measure and what may need to be done to the data to measure what you want to measure. The first thing I learnt in year 9 high school physics was the need to check for bias and remove it when measuring.
Science is not about opinion alternative or otherwise. It's about gathering evidence and its interpreting it to discover and understand the reality around and within us. Science requires a genuine scepticism as much about your own ideas as those of others. We can and do make our own minds up but our logic, reasoning and evidence must hold water - hence the need for self scepticism.

The billions of people, in whose climb out of poverty I played a small role, are now the world's largest manufacturers of solar panel. Renewable sources of electrical energy are now cheaper than new coal fired sources.
""And the only thing you will get is a carbon tax and carbon trading markets that make big finance trillions of dollars"" 
When my country had a price on carbon, that was called a carbon tax by political extremists, big finance made no dollars out of the price but we got a reduction in CO2 emissions.
""Those of us in the West who have to endure this will pay more for energy while the top bracket can afford to pay with no sacrifice.""
I don't live in the West, but when my country had a price on carbon lower income earners didn't have to pay more for energy as they were reimbursed. The main opposition to the price on carbon came from higher income earners who had large houses, large air conditioning and in the southern parts large heating bills plus large cars which consumed more fuel. Since the price on carbon has been removed the price of electricity and the price of fuel has climbed far more than it did due to the price on carbon.
""Do you know that the western poor pay a huge amount of their income on energy?""
I am aware that the poor in such countries get very low wages. Large increases in the cost of electricity and fuel have nothing to do with any price on carbon.

Much to the faux chagrin of Trump. So, given China's role as the manufacturer of the west's desired consumer products, the ability of American and European nations to very slightly reduce their industrial emissions is hardly rocket science; they've already given the responsibility for them to China. The point is, if China starts to re-export their industry back to the US (as Trump pretends he wants), or to charge the costs for de-carbonising their industrial output to their customers (I.e., us), will you be happy to pay the price? No, of course not. Because you have a belief that the average US citizen has a right to a greater standard of living than anyone else. At least, that is the logical outcome of your postulations.

The weight that a consensus of climate scientists carries is due to the fact that their consensus is based on the evidence also published in peer reviewed papers published in proper scientific journals and summarised in IPCC reports.
The history of science is ""littered with"" some ""mistakes which were supported by an authority or consensus"" if not by the evidence. One of my old colleagues received a Nobel Prize for providing evidence of an alternative, if not mutually exclusive cause to the consensus of the time. Two causes can work in tandem.
Climate science, as found in peer reviewed papers published in proper scientific journals and summarised in IPCC reports,is a real science carried out by scientists who resist political interference as shown by their recent demonstrations against the current US regime. This is about science. It's not about the left and right of politics. Scientists like the majority of the population are by and large political moderates.

News coverage was focused on the presidential election, but the corporate broadcast networks didn’t air a single segment informing viewers how a win by Trump or Hillary Clinton could affect climate change or climate policy. That followed a slight drop in news coverage of climate change in 2015, despite that year being full of critical events like the Paris climate accords, Clean Power Plan, and record-breaking heat.
The good news is that the annual analysis done by Media Matters for America found that in 2017, network news coverage of climate change soared. 
The bad news is that most of it was focused on Trump’s historically stupid withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement.
Media Matters found that in 2017, 79% percent of the time that corporate broadcast networks spent covering climate change featured actions or statements by the Trump administration. Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement was featured in 52% of climate news segments.
The administration also brought climate denial into the news cycle. Of the network news climate segments last year, 19% mentioned that Trump has called climate change a “hoax,” and 37% of those didn’t rebut the claim. 
Many statements by the administration have focused on manufacturing doubt about human-caused global warming. For example, in a June 4 segment on CBS’ Face the Nation, when asked about Trump’s “hoax” comments, his U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley dodged the question by saying:
The president believes the climate is changing, and he does know that pollutants are a part of that equation.
Other members of the administration like Scott Pruitt have similarly cast doubt on the fact that humans are the dominant cause of current climate change. 
This happened in a year filled with expensive climate-fueled disasters including hurricanes, droughts, heatwaves, and floods. The corporate broadcast networks – ABC, CBS, NBC, and FOX – aired just four total segments that discussed these events in the context of climate change.
By contrast, PBS aired 8 news segments discussing the link between climate change and the extreme weather events of 2017. Like the previous year, PBS had far more overall climate change coverage than the corporate news networks. PBS NewsHour interviewed or quoted more scientists in its climate coverage than all the other networks combined – 29 scientists, compared to a total of 27 scientists for the others (14 on CBS, 10 on NBC, 3 on ABC, and none on FOX). PBS NewsHour also featured the highest number of climate change segments (69), followed by CBS Evening News (44), NBC Nightly News (27), and ABC’s World News Tonight (23).
It’s thus perhaps unsurprising that Trump’s proposed budget would eliminate federal funding for PBS.
CBS was the best corporate news network in its climate change reporting, with CBS Evening News providing more coverage (90 minutes) than NBC Nightly News and ABC World News Tonight combined. About two-thirds of CBS’ climate coverage was focused on the Trump administration’s actions. That left just 30 minutes of CBS’ 2017 climate coverage devoted to topics like extreme weather events, and even less on NBC (20 minutes), ABC (7 minutes), and FOX (1 minute).
Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement certainly merited widespread news coverage, and received it with 62 total segments on the corporate networks plus an additional 23 on PBS. The administration’s attacks on the Clean Power plan (9 corporate network segments plus 7 on PBS) and other environmental regulations (10 corporate network segments plus 16 on PBS) arguably deserved a similar level of attention.
While the surge in news coverage of climate change is encouraging, the networks shouldn’t rely so heavily on the Trump administration’s damaging actions in reporting on the subject. Certainly, non-Trump related events linked to climate change like the record hurricanes, droughts, heatwaves, and floods should be the subject of far more news segments.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/feb/15/news-network-climate-reporting-soared-in-2017-thanks-to-trump

BQENDGood post.
- what the article grudgingly admits is ""likely to be important"", the IPCC and UNECE call a critical technology.
Why the Guardian allows a guy with a computer science diploma to talk with authority on such a subject is beyond me.
Perhaps they couldn't find an expert who agreed with their chosen narrative.
In a similar vein of disputing scientifically accepted inconvenient truths, Greenpeace also repudiate the scientific consensus to call it a ""false solution""
BQSTART
Ignorance to these matters is astonishing,
BQENDIt isn't just ignorance - for a lot of people and even NGO's it's a conscious, deliberate setting aside of established scientific fact to shoehorn in an unsupported ideological belief.. it's an actual attack on a critical technology.
In many ways the opposition of sectors of the 'green' or pseudo environmental movement is directly comparable to the ideological non acceptance climate change contrarians.
In practical terms, is the denial of technologies to address AGW just a sub-branch of climate change contrarianism?
As George Monbiot said of a different, yet linked technology to address AGW: ❝Failing to provide sources, refuting data with anecdote, cherry-picking studies, scorning the scientific consensus, invoking a cover-up to explain it: all this is horribly familiar. These are the habits of climate-change deniers, against which the green movement has struggled valiantly, calling science to its aid. It is distressing to discover that when the facts don't suit them, members of this movement resort to the follies they have denounced.
We have a duty to base our judgments on the best available information. This is not only because we owe it to other people to represent the issues fairly, but also because we owe it to ourselves not to squander our lives on fairytales. A great wrong has been done by this movement. We must put it right.❞

A great risk associated with CCS storage is - environmentally - the risk of leakage and - financially - the consequent liability for any such leak. Then Resources Minister and Labor class traitor (though still honoured and respected Labor Party member) and now senior APPEA executive Martin Ferguson bent over backwards to give the industry everything it could want in the way of open and unconditional taxpayer-funded guarantees for CCS. Successive Rabid Right politicians' focus on CCS was neatly summarised by Macfarlane when he said ""Without carbon capture and storage there is no future for coal as a domestic energy source for our power stations in Australia as we move forward to a lower emission economy."" CCS promises to be a disastrous failure. It is still put forward - despite projects being de-funded by Rudd in Labor's last Budget - because the 'growth at any cost' Rabid Right is desperate to promote such an important example of technological determinism as the means of keeping the good times rolling. We are being sold a fraud with CCS. It is impractical. Second Law of Thermodynamics requires that any stable stored form of carbon be low-entropy, also that the process is reversible only with processes that are energy-consuming and may well increase nett emissions. CCS will therefore rarely be feasible. More than 50% of the CO2 re-emerges with enhanced oil recovery, with no legal requirement to re-capture it. Perversely oil recovery thus returns gaseous carbon to the surface, like helping a little old lady across the road then robbing them. A recent CSIRO analysis suggests that installing the current most popular trial CCS technology on just half of Australia's coal-fired power stations would cost $52 billion upfront and another $5 billion per year to operate.  Blowout of a natural gas well drilled by PT Lapindo Brantas in Indonesia in May 2006 created the biggest mud volcano in the world. Eruption is likely to continue for another 26 years, with a 10% chance that it will last for more than 100 years. Pressurised carbonated (CO2-rich) water in a saline aquifer of about the same type and the same depth as CHEVRON IS PLANNING TO USE FOR CCS (of three million tonnes of CO2 per year) for its Gorgon project is being released by the eruption.

Public ignorance ensures their tenure, supported by the media's failings.
Far more worryingly the following you have written is incorrect:""CCS is a basket of technologies, some of which are likely to be important in the future as we work to decarbonise a range of industries with stubborn emissions, such as steelmaking and cement production.""
Negative Emission Technologies (NETs) are now mandatory for a safe climate, not ""likely to be important"" as you stated. Hansen has published calculations that show emission reductions have been left so late that now for a safe climate, emission reductions alone will be inadequate and must now be combined with massive carbon sequestration this century. 
A safe climate for us is one in which global temperature is returned to the Holocene range. Fig 12 of Hansen's Young People's Burden paper shows that this is achieved by emission reductions of -3%/yr starting in 2020 AND sequestering 237PgC this century. 237PgC = 237GtC = 237*44/12GtCO2 = 869GtCO2 = 87 years worth of carbon sunk by the global ocean over the next 82 years (or -6%/yr and 58 years worth of ocean carbon sink).
Regarding rates of emission reductions, CSIRO stated in CAWCR Technical Report No. 042:""A global mitigation rate of 5%/yr, sustained for many decades, is greater than almost all observed regional emissions reduction rates for energy transitions over the last several decades. These include the managed energy decarbonisations in Sweden and France in the early 1980s (reductions of 4 to 5% per year for a few years) and the collapse of the former Soviet Union in the 1990s (reductions of around 7% per year for a few years, accompanied by widespread hardship). However, these examples have always involved regional decarbonisation as a side effect of some other event or process, not an intentional policy goal.""
Ignorance to these matters is astonishing, as stated in the World's Biggest Gamble:""The scale of the decarbonisation challenge to meet the Paris Agreement is underplayed in the public arena. It will require precipitous emissions reductions within 40 years and a new carbon sink on the scale of the ocean sink. Even then, the world is extremely likely to overshoot. A catastrophic failure of policy, for example, waiting another decade for transformative policy and full commitments to fossil-free economies, will have irreversible and deleterious repercussions for humanity’s remaining time on Earth. Only a global zero carbon roadmap will put the world on a course to phase-out greenhouse gas emissions and create the essential carbon sinks for Earth-system stability, without which, world prosperity is not possible.""
Our predicament is dire and you have understated this. Thank you and thank you Guardian.

As to coal, what of countries who cannot afford the electrical system transition to renewables/nuclear etc?CCS, once developed, could be useful as a bridge there - not ideal, but then not everyone will be able to afford 'ideal'
In pejoratively fixating on coal this article avoids mentioning that CCS isn't simply for coal -or even electricity -it's just clickbait for the OfC's of this world.
It's far to early in the game to tie one hand behind our backs in the battle to cut emissions.
With respect, what we need is a carbon tax - not ideological attacks on technologies.

To make energy with the thermal efficiency of combustion (not great) is one thing - and even less great when adding the energy needed for capture and storage and actual storage. The numbers does not even make sense with a massive carbon tax. 
Similar with clean hydrogen - first one use clean energy to make hydrogen - then one use energy to compress and store and liquefy and cool it. Then one make it into energy again - with substantial loss of energy in every step. 
It simply does not compute for most use in terms of primary energy production. 
These techs do have important potential in other sectors though. Lots of non-energy production has lots of spot emissions (like steel - or agricultural nutrients or....). Fuel-cell/battery hybrid ferries are coming online. Even fuel-cell generators are starting to do good work for many purposes - even with the cost involved. 
But for energy generation - well - the fuel-cell is not even on topic - and for CCS - it simply makes no sense when coupled to energy production - especially as the price of a watt reach nuclear cost-levels. 
To combust carbon just to use the output to catch CO2 is kind of an inverse perpetuum mobile idea. Or a ""use a leaf-blower inside the house instead of a vacuum cleaner to get dust off the floor"" idea. You may move the problem a bit maybe - but you clearly do not solve it. 
A huge amount of governments have thrown tax-payer money at the fossil industry to develop industrial scale CCS. Norway has. UK. Canada. US. And they are all pretty much shite - though with great scientific value to ponder. 
I would say ""stop that"" - and throw the billions at energy storage systems. 
Remember - hominids have made energy for millions of years. After a swim in cold water we soak the sun, we dry clothes by wind-power, we light a fire, we make haystacks (yes wind-power again)
We are not in lack of harvesting energy. But when it comes to storage energy we are kind of stupid. The only good large-scale storage system we have made is to dam water. And that is not exactly a new invention. 
So research CCS - but not for fossils - and put the rest of the research grants into storage technology. That involves highly effective grid-sharing. 
At the moment - all the great storage systems we have are pretty much kinetic in nature. Hydro is - so is flywheels. Though chemical storage (batteries) is making really good strides both on density and cost (though density is not so important for land-storage). 
Also thermal storage is moving along fast and needs research money - as they are approaching 24/7 delivery even with current tech. (thermal energy-storage has also been well known technology for tens of thousands of years - along with solar and wind - as everyone having been in a tent-sauna with heated rocks will know - an early viking viking technology that everyone who ever experienced a hot water bottle in bed is aware of)
It is all about learning physics. 
We know how to make useful energy from wind, flowing water, the sun, atoms, tides, burning twigs and fossil twigs (coal and gasses and liquids) on industrial scales for hundreds and millions of years. Energy generation capacity was rarely our limitation.

Despite this, the framing of the 2°C and (even more) the 1.5°C, goals, is fundamentally premised on the massive uptake of BECCS sometime in the latter half of the century. Disturbingly, this reliance on BECCS is also the case for most of the temperature estimates (e.g. 2.7°C) ascribed to the national pledges (INDCs) prior to the Paris COP.
The sheer scale of the BECCS assumption underpinning the Agreement is breath taking – decades of ongoing planting and harvesting of energy crops over an area the size of one to three times that of India. At the same time the aviation industry anticipates fuelling its planes with bio-fuel, the shipping industry is seriously considering biomass to power its ships and the chemical sector sees biomass as a potential feedstock. And then there are 9 billion or so human mouths to feed. Surely this critical assumption deserved serious attention within the Agreement?""

In pejoratively fixating on coal this article avoids mentioning that CCS isn't simply for coal - or even electricity.Far from it.
It is also for industry, such as cement manufacture (alone more carbon emissions than all global aviation), Steel, fertiliser, hydrogen production - and yes, gas plants to balance intermittent renewables/or/baseload.All emit large quantities of CO₂
As to coal, what of countries who cannot afford the electrical system transition to renewables/nuclear etc?CCS, once developed, could be useful as a bridge there - not ideal, but then not everyone will be able to afford 'ideal'
Or even countries like Germany who are just plain obstinate and open new lignite coal plants to balance their new renewables whilst they close their nuclear plants.A carbon tax could (and would have) forced them to clean up their act and actually cut emissions by adding CCS.

What is the difference between concrete/steel applications and a power station application of the technology?
BQENDIf you want the science, then it's the partial pressure of the CO₂ -the greater the pp the easier it is to capture the CO₂.
If you read up on the subject then I'm sure you'll understand that.
And not just steel and cement - they were just examples.Fertiliser too - and hydrogen production (95% of our hydrogen comes from Natural Gas) - a lot of CO₂ is liberated in the process (we already use that waste for things like fire extinguishers/food storage and other industrial uses.

Most of the publications focus on the immediate energy penalty of the plant.
BQENDThat's the big issue.
How about a comparison of energy penalty and cost:If you are genuinely prepared to read up on it as you say, you could tot up the numbers to compare the losses, par exemplar, of adding the carbon and financial cost of a battery to a wind farm or solar plant.The same with pumped storage - although they are only 75% efficient..a huge loss.
The thing people forget is that a battery does not produce power - it is a hugely expensive net loss of minerals and energy, the sole purpose of which is arbitrage/EFR to make the supply more adaptable to help bridge the (smaller) gaps when the supply drops off.
Now we accept the loses and costs as a necessary trade off as an integral and expensive part of the low carbon system we need to address AGW.
Nobody (who knew what they were talking about) ever claimed that addressing AGW would be cheap.
It's worth baring in mind that the people who know this stuff at the IPCC say addressing AGW without CCS is 138% more expensive.

While the agency had lots to say about the plunging costs of renewables and the need for strong market signals to encourage the retirement of old and inefficient coal generation, Josh Frydenberg, the federal environment and energy minister, seized on the agency’s support for carbon capture and storage (CCS) – despite the technology’s long history of big promises and meagre results.
Last April, Frydenberg visited the newly opened Petra Nova CCS project in Texas. In a video posted to social media the minister, decked out in the obligatory hi-vis vest and hard hat, yells above the noise that the $1bn project is “helping to reduce the carbon footprint by some 40%”.
It’d be wonderful if it were true.
An estimated 6.2% of the Petra Nova power station’s emissions are captured, compressed and then piped 130km to help extract stubborn oil out of a depleted oil field. In the process, an estimated 30% of the carbon dioxide leaks back into the atmosphere, not to mention the emissions that will ultimately be released when the extracted oil is consumed.
Last month, the Minerals Council of Australia was spruiking the “21 large-scale CCS facilities in operation or under construction around the world including in Canada and Texas”.
Sounds impressive, if you still trust the MCA’s spin. You shouldn’t – 19 of the 21 projects have nothing to do with coal; there are exactly two “large scale” coal CCS projects globally. And, no, they’re not large.
The Canadian project, Boundary Dam, has averaged only 0.591 million tonnes of carbon dioxide over each of its first three years. The $1.5bn project would need to be scaled up 31 times to capture the emissions of New South Wales’s Bayswater power station – an inconceivable investment.
The only way CCS on coal will ever be built at scale is with a carbon price so high it’d kill the rest of the coal sector.
Petra Nova and Boundary Dam were built as demonstration projects, funded in an era when optimism for CCS was high and renewables costs were two-to-three times dearer than now. The owners of both projects have declined to invest further in the technology, having learnt the hard way that CCS doubles a coal power station’s capital and operating costs and is an outrageously expensive way to cut carbon pollution.
They’re not alone – data from the Australian headquartered Global CCS Institute shows there’s not a single large-scale CCS project under construction anywhere.
Over recent weeks we’ve seen the Minerals Council of Australia, the federal government and the International Energy Agency each make an effort to put CCS back on the agenda.
The MCA’s motivation is the easiest to understand. CCS provides a fig leaf useful for the “clean coal” campaign the MCA has been running, much to the chagrin of its largest funder BHP, in a desperate attempt to arrest coal’s flagging social license.
The only way CCS on coal will ever be built at scale is with a carbon price so high it’d kill the rest of the coal sector. Despite a tweet from the MCA on Thursday that it supported a “market based approach to low-emissions technology”, the MCA has form – it would use its dying breath to undermine any real or de facto carbon price. The MCA’s support for CCS rings hollow.
The rest of the coal industry doesn’t believe in CCS either. In 2006 the sector proudly announced Coal21, a commitment to invest $1bn over a decade on low emissions technologies. Ten years on, the industry has come through with less than a third of the promised funding. The only new spending in recent years from a fund designed to “support the pre-commercial demonstration of low emissions coal technologies” has been a series of pro-coal propaganda, including the “Coal – It’s an amazing thing” TV ads.
The federal government’s support is partly just an echo of the MCA’s talking points – a depressingly common pattern. Beyond that, the Coalition clearly believes that their pro-coal, anti-renewables position is a valuable point of political difference.
Despite the talk, the government is not gung-ho on CCS. Tony Abbott’s 2014 budget ripped $460m out of the CCS Flagships program, and the once ambitious project launched by Kevin Rudd has been on starvation rations since.
As for the IEA, their actual comments in support of CCS were pretty weak – executive director Fatih Birol did little more than endorse Frydenberg’s stalled plan from last May to lift the ban on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) providing loans to CCS projects.
But while the coal-boosters sully the brand, it should be remembered that CCS is not “bad” per se. CCS is a basket of technologies, some of which are likely to be important in the future as we work to decarbonise a range of industries with stubborn emissions, such as steelmaking and cement production.
It’s inconceivable that a CCS plus coal project could pass the CEFC’s rigorous investment criteria. As such it probably doesn’t matter whether or not the CCS prohibition is removed from the CEFC legislation. It’s just politics.
A total of 13 power stations have closed in Australia over the past five years, keeping tens of millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide and other pollutants out of our atmosphere. As AGL demonstrated this week, the economics are such that hard-nosed power companies are choosing renewables over coal every time.
One way to reduce coal’s impact is to capture, compress and bury its emissions – but it’s much simpler, cheaper and safer to simply leave the coal in the ground.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/16/itd-be-wonderful-if-the-claims-made-about-carbon-capture-were-true

For a South Korean presidential hopeful, Ahn Hee-Jung is not what you would expect.
He appears younger than his age of 52 years would suggest – an age that already makes him positively youthful by Korean political standards.
He has a casual demeanour, and before sitting down with the Guardian in the lobby of a hotel in Sydney, Australia, he is stopped by Korean tourists desperate to get a selfie with him – something he appears to enjoy but his minder says regularly delays him for meetings.
And for a governor of a province – South Chungcheong – that hosts the majority of South Korea’s coal power, with 29 massive coal power stations including the biggest in the world, he’s not who you would expect to be spearheading a “coal phase-out alliance” and declaring his province “post-coal”. But that’s exactly what he’s done.
On his visit to Australia, which sells more than $6bn worth of coal to South Korea each year, he has a message for the country and its precious coal exports: the world is changing and coal will soon be history.
“After the Paris agreement in 2015, I think everything should change,” he says. “Because after all, that is the global consensus, and that is the global commitment that involved countries have made.”
During South Korea’s Democratic party primary contest in 2017, Ahn took full advantage of his relative youth, and the exploding appetite for change in Korea.
Following the scandal that led to the impeachment of President Park, and the revelations she was allowing business conglomerates (known as “chaebols” – huge family-run conglomerates such as Samsung) to meddle in state affairs, his approach struck a nerve.
“Let’s change the world together with a young president, Ahn Hee-Jung!” the Korean press reported him saying at the launch of his presidential primary campaign. “We need a young leader who can create a new world with his mind, body and actions, not just someone who talks about new things. This the beginning of a shift into a new era.”
Ahn lost by a significant margin to Moon Jae-in, who went on to win the presidency, but through the contest Ahn became famed for his Obamaesque messages and his youthful demeanour.
Ahn’s distaste for coal appears shared by his party, and by President Moon. Since winning the presidency, the Moon administration has committed to building no new coal power stations, has been looking at how to halt the construction of partially built ones, and is expanding the country’s production of wind and solar.
Beyond the moves that South Korea is taking at a national level under the leadership of Moon, Ahn has personally spearheaded a regional network of sub-national governments that is aiming to make coal a thing of the past. 
At a forum of local governments his province hosted last year, Ahn launched what he describes as a “vision” for phasing out coal throughout East Asia.
He said he was committed to creating the “East Asia Coal Phase Out Alliance,” which would be a network of sub-national governments committed to phasing out coal.
Describing the group, Ahn refers to other moves around the world to achieve similar goals. He points to the “Powering Past Coal Alliance,” which aims to phase out reliance on coal power by 2030, and includes both national governments and subnational governments including Washington and Oregon in the US.
Ahn also refers to the Under2 Coalition, which includes a large range of subnational governments who have signed an agreement aiming to radically lower emissions in line with keeping global warming below 2C by 2100.
East Asian governments are under-represented in the Under2 Coalition, and a locally organised alliance could shift the balance.
Before interviewing Ahn, the Guardian was told by an officer at the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that there was some concern there that the topic of the interview was coal.
Unease in Australian government circles about Ahn’s attitude to coal is not surprising.
Australia depends heavily on its thermal coal exports. It is the world’s second-biggest exporter of coal used for generating electricity (following Indonesia) and its exports primarily go to China, Japan and South Korea – with South Korea taking more than $6bn worth of coal each year.
But recent Australian government forecasts of increasing coal demand from South Korea have been brought into question following Korea’s anti-coal moves, and the more radical those moves, the faster Australian coal exports will decline.
Coal was no doubt among the issues Australian diplomats wanted to speak with Ahn about when they invited him. His visit was part of the “special visits program”, which the government says is targeted at “influential foreign officials … who are likely to be in positions which deal with issues of direct relevance to Australia’s foreign and trade policy interests.”

Regardless, Ahn’s message remains clear while speaking with the Guardian. Asked whether Australia should prepare for a declining market for coal, Ahn encourages Australia to take action to implement the Paris agreement.
“Australia is also signed onto the Paris agreement, so under this agreement, I’m sure the Australian government and citizens of Australia are well aware of the commitment they made, and ... will be doing their part in order to implement [this] agreement into action,” Ahn says.
“I’m also a firm believer that this kind of energy transition will bring both crisis as well as opportunities. Crisis of course for the existing coal industries, but opportunities for everyone involved in the new renewable industry, as well as citizens around the globe as well.”
Ahn calls on Australia and South Korea to stand together and take leadership in the transition away from coal.
“I think it’s clear that by leading this kind of energy transition, those countries will be able to increase more jobs and create more added value,” he says.
“So as part of the Paris agreement, I think Australia and the Republic of Korea should stand next to each other and move forward together.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/16/south-koreas-ahn-hee-jung-on-coal-trade-after-paris-everything-should-change

The increases have been quietly approved under the “safeguard mechanism”, which was introduced as part of Direct Action to ensure cuts paid for using the main part of the policy – the emission reduction fund – were not undone by emissions increasing in other parts of the economy.
Under the safeguard mechanism, government agency the Clean Energy Regulator sets an emissions limit for each large industrial site based on its highest level of emissions over the previous five years. But companies can apply to have the limit recalculated.
The regulator has signed contracts worth $2.25bn under the emissions fund, mostly with businesses that plan to plant trees and repair degraded habitat over the next decade. The idea is the vegetation will store carbon dioxide drawn from the atmosphere.
But an analysis of data on the regulator’s website by consultants RepuTex Carbon found the regulator had simultaneously allowed 57 industrial sites to increase emissions above their previous highest level.
If all sites emitted to their newly approved level, it could add up to 22m tonnes of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere each year – 4% of Australia’s annual emissions.
Based on the average price paid by the government – $11.90 per tonne of carbon dioxide – it would effectively cancel out up to $261.8m of emissions cuts a year.
Emissions growth is outpacing the abatement from the emissions reduction fund, so what has been the point?
This has prompted fresh accusations that Direct Action is doing little to curtail Australia’s emissions, which were already rising before a round of 44 industrial facilities had their emissions increases approved on 25 January.
The RepuTex executive director, Hugh Grossman, said it showed the safeguard mechanism was ineffective.
“It’s a safeguard in name only. There is no doubt emissions growth is outpacing the abatement from the emissions reduction fund, so what has been the point?” he said.
RepuTex found that by 2030, emissions from large industrial sites were projected to be 30% higher than in 2005, and 16% higher than when the safeguard mechanism was announced four years ago.
They are expected to grow to be the biggest source of Australia’s emissions, surpassing those from burning coal and gas for electricity. 
The biggest increases allowed under the safeguard mechanism have been for coalmining operations, including Whitehaven’s Maules Creek open cut mine in New South Wales, BM Alliance’s Broadmeadow mine in Queensland and Citic Pacific’s Sino Iron project in the Pilbara. Liquefied natural gas plants such as the projects of Chevron at Gorgon and Santos at Curtis Island have opened with approved emissions limits that are not offset elsewhere. 
Grossman said the industrial sector now posed a larger problem than electricity emissions, which had started to decline, though not quickly enough.
“It’s black and white – if industrial emissions are not resolved, we won’t meet our Paris commitments,” he said.
Under the 2015 Paris deal, Australia pledged to cut emissions by between 26% and 28% below 2005 levels by 2030.
The growth in industrial emissions suggests deeper cuts would be needed in other parts of the economy for that commitment to be met. But the government is not proposing deeper cuts in the electricity sector, currently the biggest emissions source. Under the national energy guarantee, it proposes to cut pollution from generators by 26% and is considering allowing electricity retailers to defer some cuts.
It is also considering making the safeguard mechanism less stringent. A Turnbull government climate policy review released in December suggested emissions limits could be loosened so they “increase with production, supporting business growth”.
The environment and energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, said the safeguard mechanism was operating in accordance with legislation, rules and regulations.
A spokeswoman for the Clean Energy Regulator said they included allowing reappraisal of how much a facility could emit if there was not enough historic data over the previous five years, or if the data did not accurately represent activity at the industrial site now. She said the safeguard mechanism was meant to make sure cuts paid for using the emissions reduction fund were not offset by “significant increases above business-as-usual levels”, but also to accommodate economic growth.
The Australian National University economist Paul Burke said the safeguard mechanism had been designed to be loose and flexible. “It is a complicated and inefficient way to approach the goal of reducing emissions,” he said.
Frydenberg said the mechanism was part of a suite of policies, including the successful emissions reduction fund, the renewable energy target and a national energy productivity plan, the details of which are yet to be released. He said contracts had been signed to cut emissions by 191m tonnes over the coming years, and the Climate Change Authority, a government agency, had found the fund was performing well.
The minister said Australia was on track to comfortably beat its 2020 target of a 5% cut below 2000 levels. He did not mention the 2030 target.
Environment department data released in December showed national emissions have increased each year since 2014, when the carbon price scheme that put a charge on greenhouse pollution was repealed. They rose 0.7% last financial year.
The department projects its current trajectory emissions will be about 2% higher in 2030 than in 2005.
RepuTex projects Australia will also fall short of its 2020 target of a 5% cut in absolute terms, with emissions expected to be at the same level as in 2000. But the country will meet its target under United Nations greenhouse accounting rules by using credits carried over from the previous target period, when Australia’s target was an 8% emissions increase between 1990 and 2012.

So clearly if voting with the LNP is your main criteria for being bad then the ALP are far worse than the Greens.
But if you want to look at policy, every case of the Greens voting with the LNP that I've looked into properly has had the Greens moving things forward in a progressive way, whilst every time the ALP have vote with the LNP (with the Greens opposing) it is moving Australia towards the right. 
I do find it sad that the ALP spin against the Greens is both that the Greens sellout to the LNP and at the same time that they Greens support ""looney"" progressive policies. 
Just think of how many ALP supporters think of Gillard's price on carbon. It seems this is both one of the major achievements of her government (no credit to the Greens) but also something she was forced to do by the Greens and thus we got Abbott. 
Perhaps there would be some logic if it were just one or the other. But what I see in the comments at The Guardian is that either mud is thrown depending on what the writer thinks will work best at that time.

The Carmicheal mine proposal is not "" just another project"" - providing the rail link opens up the whole of the Galilee Basin to mining which could result in devastating effects for our future climate. Yes, there is a future for coal for many years yet, but that future will be for the higher quality coking coal for which the Bowen Basin in Queensland is renowned. It is not for lower quality thermal coal. There are many large scale renewable projects planned for Queensland, so both Federal and State Labor would be well advised to start training the workforce for those jobs rather than propping up coal mining jobs. It is a pity that the CFMEU do not see this and start guiding their members into retraining for jobs in the renewable energy sector. This is the way to secure those crucial seats in Queensland, but there is some urgency required before the next Federal election"".

Butler has used a speech to the Sydney Institute to argue the controversial Adani coal project is “utterly exceptional” because it is the only significant export-oriented greenfields mine opening up “on the face of the planet”.
He said developing the Carmichael mine would fly in the face of current market trends, where export volumes for thermal coal had been flat for several years, and would also be inconsistent with the International Energy Agency’s advice “on what the world needs to do … to keep global warming well below two degrees”.
Butler said it was possible the Adani project “might notionally go ahead if the Turnbull government finds some way of throwing a heap of taxpayer money at it” but he argues the industry is clear Adani would have a zero sum effect, displacing “coal and jobs in existing coal regions, like the Hunter Valley”.
“For the life of me, I can’t see how that prospect is in the national interest.”
Butler’s Sydney Institute speech on Monday night addressed broad-ranging questions associated with managing climate change-related financial risk – including the impact of climate change on balance sheets, on the insurance industry and the potential for future litigation to “recover damages for losses incurred as a result of climate change from people who should have prevented those losses from occurring”.
But his public intervention comes at a time when federal Labor is mulling specific policy options on the Adani project. The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, has been signalling since late January that the ALP is inclined to toughen its stance on the Adani project.
While parliamentarians in Canberra have been telegraphing a shift, last week the powerful mining union said that adopting a hardline stance on Adani would damage Labor’s political fortunes in Queensland and also trigger a divisive debate within the ALP about the future of coal.
Shorten will spend the week in marginal Queensland coastal electorates, highlighting local infrastructure commitments and what he characterised on Monday as “real blue-collar jobs” and the next “pipeline of work”.
Before Butler’s speech on Monday evening, Shorten told reporters in Townsville there was a role for mining in Australia, and “there is a role for coal in Australia, and he echoed CFMEU national president Tony Maher’s description of Adani last week as just “another project”.
Labor’s positioning on Adani is under way as a critical byelection looms in Melbourne’s northern suburbs. The 17 March contest in Batman is a head-to-head between Labor and the Greens. The Greens have been running an anti-Adani campaign against Labor within the Batman boundaries for months, amplified by activist groups.
Butler has been pushing for federal Labor to adopt a tougher line on the Adani project for the best part of 12 months. In an interview last June with Guardian Australia’s politics live podcast, he declared it would “not be a positive thing for Australia for the Adani mine to go ahead”.
He dug in behind those arguments on Monday night. “In all of the many discussions I’ve had over recent years with different interests about the Galilee basin projects, a consensus view has been put that they are simply not financially viable – that the cost of developing the new mines cannot be recouped from a declining market with a thermal coal price projected to be in the doldrums for years.”
Butler acknowledged that jobs was a major political issue in Queensland. “There’s clearly a great deal of frustration in Queensland about the constant delays and debate about the Adani project, and whether the promised jobs will ever really happen,” he said.
“In a region that’s been hit hard by the end of the mining boom, job opportunities are crucially important.”
Butler said Shorten was not willing “to wait on Adani’s continual delays with this project – delays that will likely come to nought anyway”.
“He’s busy talking to the Queensland government and local communities about other job plans,” Butler said. “And he’s putting concrete announcements before the people of central and north Queensland as we speak – jobs that we guarantee will happen.”
On the more broadranging topic of managing climate change risk, Butler used the speech to warn that “one-eyed reliance on scenarios that pretend that the world is not changing is simply unsustainable and, potentially, legally negligent”.
“Investors are already voicing their expectations that companies do better in this area. But government and regulators clearly have a role to play in improving standards as well.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/19/labor-mp-says-adani-mine-would-displace-jobs-and-sabotage-paris-targets

But not usually as hot as last June, when the mercury at the airport one day soared above 48C. That exceeded the maximum operating temperature for several aircraft ready for take-off. They didn’t fly. More than 50 flights were cancelled or rerouted.
Thanks to climate change, soon 48C may not seem so unusual. Welcome to the precarious future of aviation in a changing climate. As the world warms and weather becomes more extreme, aircraft designers, airport planners and pilots must all respond, both in the air and on the ground. With about 100,000 flights worldwide carrying eight million passengers every day, this is a big deal.
Why is heat a problem for planes? In a word: lift.
Lift is the upward force created by diverting air around wings as an aircraft moves down the runway. It is harder to achieve when the air is scorching hot, because hot air is thinner than cold air. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) warned in 2016 that as a result, higher temperatures “could have severe consequences for aircraft take-off performance.”
Aircraft will need to jettison passengers, cargo or fuel to get the same lift on a hot day, raising costs and requiring more flights.
“Weight restrictions are likely to have the most effect on long-haul flights, which often take off near the airplane’s maximum weight,” says Ethan Coffel, an atmospheric scientist at Columbia University. “Possible adaptations include rescheduling flights to cooler times of the day or lengthening runways.”
Daytime heat is why long-distance flights out of the Middle East already regularly take off in the cool of the night. But the same will soon apply in the US and southern Europe. That will create problems in places where night and early-morning flights are restricted to help people on the ground sleep.
Future lighter and more fuel-efficient planes will help, says Coffel. But it means the anticipated economic and environmental gains from such advances may be largely offset by coping with warmer air.
Once in the air, flying will feel different too, especially in and around the jet stream, for instance when crossing the Atlantic.
“At cruising altitudes, the north-south temperature difference that drives the jet stream is increasing,” says Paul Williams, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Reading in the UK. Flying east is becoming quicker in the stronger winds that result, but flying west will be slower. Airline schedulers will need to take the altered flight times into consideration in the future – and flyers may need to be prepared for more frustrating airport announcements of delayed incoming flights.
Flights will also be bumpier, says Williams. “Stronger winds will increase the amount of shear in the jet stream,” he says. Shear creates turbulence – particularly what is called “clear-air turbulence,” which occurs away from storm clouds and is hard for pilots to spot and fly round. “The increase in clean-air turbulence has the potential to be quite disruptive,” says Williams. In other words, get used to keeping your seatbelts fastened.
Climate change will also increase the number and intensity of thunderstorms, and push them upward into cruising altitudes. That will make flying trickier and could dramatically increase the risk of one of the most worrying upper-air phenomena for pilots: high-altitude icing.
High-altitude ice is a feature of thunderstorms, and it is dangerous. The infiltration of tiny particles of ice into turbofan engines has been blamed for more than 100 engine failures in recent years.
In the most notorious high-altitude icing accident, an Air France flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris in 2009 crashed, killing all aboard, when it stalled after the autopilot disconnected when ice crystals disabled its speed sensors.
Officials of the European Aviation Safety Agency have blamed climate change – along with the failure of aircraft designers to reassess the risks – for the growing frequency of engine failures and other faults due to high-altitude icing. Worryingly, modern energy-efficient lean-burn engines may be more susceptible, Herbert Puempel, an aviation expert at the World Meteorological Organization, warned in the group’s journal.
Some of the most expensive climate-change problems for the aviation industry will be on the ground. That’s because many runways are in places they really shouldn’t be.
Take Iqaluit airport in northern Canada. The permafrost on which it was built is melting. The runway and taxiway have had to be resurfaced as a result. And the melting is deepening.
There will be other such cases. But a more frequent problem is likely to be flooding. Many airports are built on flat, low-lying land, by the ocean or in drained swamps. Such places can be hard to drain and vulnerable to rising sea levels and more intense storms.
When Superstorm Sandy hit New York City in 2012, a storm surge 12ft high inundated the runways of LaGuardia, closing the airport for three days. A tropical storm hitting so far north is widely regarded as an effect of climate change. So expect more such extreme weather.
LaGuardia certainly is. Two-and-a-half years after Sandy struck, New York governor Andrew Cuomo put aside $28m to install new flood barriers and drains at the airport.
Sandy was a wake-up call. A federal climate assessment subsequently found 13 major US airports at similar risk, from Honolulu to Miami. Included in the list are San Francisco and Oakland airports, both built on low-lying reclaimed land along the shore of San Francisco Bay.
Civilian airport authorities have been slow to address the issue, but the US military is more proactive. A Pentagon analysis of climate-related risk to military infrastructure, published in January this year, gave pride of place to threats to airfields from sea level rise, storms and high temperatures.
Internationally, there is also rising concern. The scientific consensus is that sea level rise probably won’t be more than one metre this century. But airport authorities believe that they must adapt to much higher waters during storm surges such as that experienced at LaGuardia.
Singapore’s Changi airport, one of the world’s busiest, is raising its new passenger terminal 5.5m above sea level as a precaution against future storm tides. Hong Kong is constructing a wall, eight miles (13km) long, around a new runway.
By those standards, dozens of the world’s great airports should be thinking about runway protection. Bangkok, Schiphol in the Netherlands, Sydney, both airports in Shanghai, London City airport and Kansai near Osaka all fall short.
Maybe more radical solutions are required. Back in the 1990s, Japan built a 1km floating airstrip in Tokyo Bay as a “scale model” for a full-size floating airport that could rise with the tides.
Whether the threat is too much heat for take-off, too much ice to stay in the air or too much water to land, most airports and airlines are approaching climate change as a problem they will address as it arises. But the stark truth, says Coffel, is that the future is now.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/19/climate-change-spells-turbulent-times-ahead-for-air-travel

For you it is, since this issue seems to have broken them. Think about whether isolating yourself is making the world a better place. Try to see the basic humanity in people who disagree with you. If you can interact with them within this basic framework I think you have a much better chance of convincing them to consider your arguments.
As for responding to Paul, I don't think I will. The comment on Judith Curry is fundamentally hypocritical, but Paul talks past you, not too you, so the chance you will get him to see that is nil (your comment on Curry was much worse). Neither of you have ever sat in one of her classes, reviewed her graduate thesis, nor can you see inside her mind and know what motivates her. It would be fair game if she was caught lying, or other professional conduct, but neither of you put that kind of information forward, it's just an offhand insult in your case, and vague innuendo in Paul's case.

I was trying to make sense out of glacier's comment:""So physics strongly indicate that the different volumes of water circling around it's triple point is catechism.""His English grammar is ropy so it can be difficult to follow what he's saying.

I did learn something about the concept ""triple point"" which I am still figuring out, Triple point has been described as the combination of atmospheres and temperature which governs the changes of state in elements and compounds. Atmospheric pressure in the case of the phase change from liquid to gas for example seems to apply to the distinction between CO2 as gas and as vapour. This may also be related in some way to the loss of ice where it seems ice can transform from solid to water vapour at low temperatures.

I think perhaps the most telling was some advice that Michael Mann gave David Karoly when it became obvious that there was a problem with the paper. He said of McIntyre:
""I probably don't have to tell you this, but don't trust him to behave ethically or honestly here, and assume that anything you tell him will be cherry-picked in a way that maximally discredits the study and will be leaked as suits his purposes.""
..... and that appears to be precisely the way things played out. 
What the emails show is scientists trying to do their job, who found a mistake in their work and asked for the paper to be put on hold. Indeed, as Karoly said several times in emails, the fact that they put the paper on hold is ""a demonstration that science works"".
There is nothing in the emails (which were a private and frank exchange of views) to suggest that the scientists knew of the issue via Climate Audit before they found it themselves, yet McIntyre (and hence Klapper) has found a way to make it appear otherwise on his blog. What stands out for me in this is that McIntyre only referred in passing to probably the most significant email of all that was buried 77 pages into a long pdf document: an email that he must have known would undermine his narrative..... and there were others that did too.

which is why he personally saw the benefits of using non-detrended data, where more of the original data is preserved for calibration.
BQEND
Where do they say (Karoly or Neukom) that non-detrended is preferable? Your comment that ""more"" of the original data is preserved for calibration is not true since the full time period of the instrumental calibration series is kept either way. The only benefits to the non-detrended method were that you got to keep the reconstruction that you'd already given to the IPCCAR5 paleo team; although pretty clearly the editors of the journal weren't going to let them get away with it.
Karoly said this on the subject, so it's clear where he stands:
BQSTART
 The criticism that the selection process forces a hockey stick result will be valid if the trend is not excluded in the proxy selection step.
BQEND
and:
BQSTART
I t hink that it is muc h better to use the detrended data for the selection of proxies, as you can then say that you have identified the proxies that are responding to the temp erature variations on interannual time scales, ie temp-sensitive proxies, without any influence from t h e trend over t he 20 th century
BQEND
Neukom actually agrees, but that raises the problem that not enough proxies get selected, so although he knows non-detrending will force a hockey stick he suggests (vaguely anyway) some alternatives:
BQSTART
Hi David,I agree, but we don ' t have enough strong proxy data with significantcorrelations after detrending to get a reasonable reconstruction. I also see the point that the selection process forces a hockey stick result but: - We also performed the reconstruction using noise proxies with the same ARl properties as the real proxies. - And these are of course resulting in a noise-hockey stick.
BQEND
I don't even know why I continue to argue with you about this, since in this application the detrended method is so obviously the right choice (and the one that Gergis et al started with). If you don't detrend you could theoretically select a series with an inverse relationship to temperature on a yearly basis, but gets picked because although it's really not a long term temperature proxy, it has a precipitation proxy component and in the calibration period there was a secular increasing trend in precipitation.

And here is one of the major problems with the ""climate change debate"".
Usually implicitly, but occasionally explicitly, the notion is pushed that if those terribly intelligent high priests ... sorry, I mean climate scientists (with their PhDs and all) manage to get a peer-reviewed paper published in a respected journal then IT MUST BE 100% CORRECT.
The idea that some frightful oik ... I mean stupid pleb ... I mean ordinary member of the public (phew, got the right phrase at last !) would ever DARE to even consider QUESTIONING their pronouncements is just LUDICROUS ... isn't it ?
Seriously, however, such an attitude seems designed to stifle the entirely natural human attribute known as ""curiosity"", the idea that simply asking the question ""How, exactly, did you come to that conclusion ?"" does NOT imply that the questioner is thinking ""You must be WRONG"", or even worse ""You must be LYING ! ! !"", they are simply asking ""That seems counter-intuitive to my existing knowledge / experience, SHOW ME WHAT I'M MISSING ..."".
The idea that people will be willing to ""suffer"" through the 99 times out of 100 that ""the experts"" are actually correct just for the satisfaction felt the 1 time that you realise at the end ""Holy shit ! I was right and they were wrong !?!"", even if it's over an incredibly minor point like a wrong reference, may be completely alien to your way of thinking but it isn't to mine (and, I believe, to many others).
Going through the process from ""That CAN'T be right !"" to ""Can I reproduce their results ?"" to ""Oh !

I think you're misinterpreting what he's saying here, although he did in fact make much the same point in the email I reproduced above, which is why he personally saw the benefits of using non-detrended data, where more of the original data is preserved for calibration.
As to the question of red noise and hockey sticks, I suggest that you read this:
https://andthentheresphysics.wordpress.com/2013/07/10/debunking-the-hockey-stick/
and this:
http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2006/05/how-red-are-my-proxies/
I'm no expert on this subject (and I fear that you aren't as much of one as you like to think). However, as I understand it, in a red noise time series, each year's value is correlated with the value for the year before. Neukom said he used the same AR1 properties as for the real proxy data. Therefore, as the blade of the hockey stick exists in the instrumental period, you would actually expect a red noise reconstruction to produce a hockey stick shape; I suspect that was the point Neukom was making.', u'recommendation_count': u'6', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1519489579000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'16473314', u'in_reply_to': u'112658606', u'id': u'112659649', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Klapper', u'text': u'Were you the one who up voted DennisHornes reprehensible original comment about grandchildren?

That's true for Karoly who discovers the ClimateAudit follow up thread to the ""Jean S"" post (originally on the ""Name and shame"" thread) on June 8, early morning. All three were aware of the ""Name and shame"" thread and that it related to the Australasia reconstruction they were working on.

I agree , but we don ' t have enough strong proxy data with significant correlations after detrending to get a reasonable reconstruction.

This kind of comment is out of bounds in a civil society. It's one thing to call your opponents ""Dunning Krugerites"", bloviators, fools etc., that's personal but doesn't imply a deep immorality. What you said is different. You can't say much worse to a parent then to imply they don't love their children or grandchildren.

Are the Inuit who claim the experts are wrong about polar bear health (and want to expand sport hunting) immoral too? Where does your rancour stop? Bjorn Lomborg who believes in AGW, has argued that immorality argument cuts both ways as the climate change issue is absorbing resources that should be applied to known current issues like nutrition in the 3rd world.
There's a documentary, made by climate skeptics about the issue, and the title is ""Not evil, just wrong"". Both sides should accept that someone is not evil for disagreeing with them, no matter how passionately they feel about an issue.

As has been pointed out to McIntyre and co. many times, there is only one reason why these reconstructions deliver a hockey stick shape: because it is present in the data. Clearly, most, if not all, of the ""blade"" is in the instrumental era..... and that is probably why individuals such as yourself keep trotting out this myth that you can't compare the instrumental data to the proxy reconstruction.
The blog posts of Climate Audit are not worth the paper (or ether!) they're written on; if they were McIntyre would have had his critiques published in respected journals and everyone would be doing proxy reconstructions his way. The problem is that individuals such as yourself uncritically accept what he says because he's telling you what you want to hear; as I've now shown many times, you have to be truly skeptical to spot the flaws in what he says.

BQEND
You've likely been to my link which means you would know he didn't, but you also know he gave explicit direction as to where the letter was (Page 77 in a pdf he linked to). This is likely how you ""found"" the email in question. Here' the full McIntyre statement on that particular point (note he doesn't print excerpts from the references by the team to ClimateAudit on the ""Name and Shame"" thread either, but just links the pdf with page numbers):
BQSTART
Two hours later (nearly 2 a.m. Swiss time), Gergis coauthor Raphi Neukom notified Gergis and Karoly of the error (FOI 2G, page 77). Although Karoly later (falsely) claimed that his coauthors were unaware of the Climate Audit thread, emails obtained through FOI show that Gergis had sent an email to her coauthors (FOI 2G, page 17) drawing attention to the CA thread, that Karoly himself had written to Myles Allen (FOI 2K, page 11)about comments attributed to him on the thread (linking to the thread) and that Climate Audit and/or myself are mentioned in multiple other contemporary emails
BQEND
The statement by Gergis they found the error 2 days before the ""bloggers"" is absolutely false, but could be just a memory lapse or honest mistake. As for your comment on 18 hours ahead, that's wrong, at least in this context since the email would have been stamped using the timezone of the Melbourne U mail server, which is 14 hours ahead of the time on the ClimateAudit server (in June).
Neukom is allegedly in Switzerland at the time, so his ""found error"" email was sent at 1:46 in the morning local time. The ""Jean S"" post on the Climate Audit ""Name and Shame"" thread was at 4:42PM EDT, or 10:42 PM Swiss time. My guess is Neukom saw the Jean S post late in the evening while checking on the latest on this ClimateAudit thread (for sure the team were following ClimateAudit and this thread in particular as of a few days earlier). He realized the code ""Detrend"" switch was set wrong, and got on Skype to let Gergis know, and followed up with an email to Karoly and Gergis.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1519482972000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'3638543', u'in_reply_to': u'112653463', u'id': u'112657861', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'loco_p_man', u'text': u'BQSTART

Yes I do realize that. They didn't calibrate properly, so I suppose my statement should have read: ""failure to properly calibrate"" . In the 2016 version of the Gergis et al they resorted to some ad hoc rules, whereby the calibration procedure was not necessarily the same for all series, which goes to the whole issue of Steve McIntyre calls ""ex post data selection"". 
What they should have done, and what the journal asked them to do was re-submit a paper with the original intent (detrending prior to the selection filtering), but I think that gave them a non-hockey stick climate history for Australia/NZ, which they didn't want to show, so they made a complex new series selection rule set, something to the effect of choosing any positive result from the 8 or 6 nearest instrumental data grid cells (as opposed to just the nearest cell), but even then not all series were selected by these new rules.
What McIntrye is saying in his ""ex post screening"" comments, is that scientists should make the rules for input data filtering before looking at the data, let your algorithm select the data, process, and present the results.

I have found this email from Neukom to Gergis and Karoly, dated 6th June 2012 at 09.46:
""Hi Joelle and David ,As just discussed with joelle on skype , I found a mistake in our paper in journal of climate today. It is related to the proxy screening, so it is a delicate issue. In thepaper we write that we do the correlation analysis for the screening based on detrended (instrumental and proxy) data, but in reality we did not use detrended data.The origin of the mistake is that at the stage when we were writing the paper my approaches have already evolved and I had made the proxy selection for the SB reconstruction based on detrended data . I therefore had in my mind that we had done the same for Australasia months ago and was very negligent not to check this carefully.Using detrended data would only select very few proxy records that would not allow a reasonable reconstruction. I think it is basically justifiable to do the screening without detrending but changing these words may cause troubles.Fortunately we have not received the proofs yet. So my suggestion is to write to the editor, explain the mistake and ask for permission to correct the error, if necessary via sending it out to review again . I apologize for the mistake and the troubles it may cause and hope thatwe can find a good way to correct it.""
So it is clear that the mistake was Neukom's and that it was entirely innocent. It is also clear that the intention was to contact the editor to change the paper rather than simply change a few words. Also, although Neukom may have spotted the issue after the problem was found by someone at Climate Audit, it would only have been by a few hours at most, given the time difference. So it is very unlikely that the scientists would have known the blogosphere had spotted the problem at that time.

Gergis is based in Victoria, Australia, around 18 hours ahead of North America, where Climate Audit is based.
When writing scientific papers, much of the work is done by the lead author and some authors listed on the paper may not have as much input during preparation as you might imagine. It is entirely possible that one member of the team (probably Karoly) had a different understanding of what had been done and only realised this after publication. Scientists are not automatons; they are humans with all their failings (and internal politics!).
Scientists do have different opinions too...... eg. over whether detrending is better. Just because one member of the team agrees with McIntyre that detrending is better it doesn't mean that they all do. As Dennis pointed out, it actually made very little difference.
Considered in the context of the above, the account given by Gergis at the conversation could well be correct. Clearly, it isn't a complete account, but she is under no obligation to tell the whole story. So for me the real story here, once again, is the way denialist blogs have chosen to portray what happened as an attempt to deceive rather than considering the far greater probability that it was what Gergis said it was: a simple mistake (or maybe a misunderstanding).
Finally, I would point at that you accused Gergis et al of ""failure to calibrate"", but you must surely know that they couldn't have produced a reconstruction at all without doing so.', u'recommendation_count': u'8', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1519467143000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'just one member of the team agrees with mcintyre that detrending is better', u'effect': u""it does n't mean that they all do""}], u'author_id': u'16473314', u'in_reply_to': u'112647846', u'id': u'112652003', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'SoloLoMejor', u'text': u'Nothing wrong with all that Chris except the rich will keep on doing it while the rest of us mugs have to factor in our energy usage into our everyday lives.

For now, all I will say is this:
A number of years ago I had reason to go through a whole series of blog posts at Climate Audit with a fine tooth comb. In each case I eventually found a fatal flaw that totally undermined the entire argument; the flaws were generally well hidden, but they were always there. Given that McIntyre was a reader of the George C Marshall Institute, which was deeply involved in climate science misinformation, this came as no surprise at all. So you will perhaps forgive me for not trusting the information that McIntyre has posted in this case either and we have no way of knowing for sure whether the information is even complete.
However, what I find most disturbing and distasteful is the attitude that the blog has. There is always an implicit assumption that scientists are being nefarious or deliberately hiding something rather than pursuing the respectful approach that ought to prevail. The cynic in me can't help but wonder whether this is a deliberate attempt to intimidate scientists and illicit an emotional response that can then be exploited. I note that Gergis contacted Gavin Schmidt for advice..... and frankly I don't blame her. Dennis is correct; if scientists had reason to think that McIntyre's interventions were a sincere attempt to make the science better, they would be only too happy to cooperate with him.

These are some questions that can be answered through paleoclimate studies. Paleoclimate research uses natural measurements of the Earth’s temperature. Clever scientists are able to estimate how warm or cold the Earth was far back in time, way before we had thermometers. 
Readers of this column are probably familiar with some of these paleoclimate techniques that may use ice cores or tree rings to infer temperature variations. A different method that uses plant distribution was a technique used in a very recent study published in Nature. That technique used pollen distribution to get an understanding of where plant species thrived in the past. Those distributions gave them insights about the temperatures. On the surface, it’s pretty straightforward. Tropical plants differ in major ways from plants that live in, say, the tundra. In fact, plants that thrive where I live (Northern USA) differ from plants that populate landscapes further south.
The authors used the pollen of various plants to help determine where they thrived in the deep past. I communicated with Dr. Bryan Shuman, from the University of Wyoming and I asked him why they used pollen. He responded: 
Pollen works well as a temperature recorder because plants have specific temperature ranges that they can tolerate. By combining the temperature requirements for dozens of different plants that we can recognize from their pollen, we are able to narrow down the possible temperatures at the location where the pollen was collected. 
We use pollen rather than other plant fossils because pollen is widespread each spring and settles to the lake bottom where it is surprisingly resistant to degradation. We wash the samples of lake bottom mud with acids that can dissolve minerals, but the pollen can tolerate it. It lasts up to millions of years with degrading.
What the authors found was very interesting. Using data from 642 sites across North America and Europe, the temperatures they found closely matched those expected from computer simulations. They found that throughout most of the Holocene period (the last ~11,000 years), the Earth was warming very slightly. Only in the last ~2000 years has the Earth been in a cooling period (which probably would have continued except that human emissions of greenhouse gases have now reversed the cooling). 
The authors attempted to put the recent warming (last century or so) into context. They found that the recent temperatures are much higher than temperatures over the past 11,000 years. In fact, according to their calculations, 2016 was warmer than 99.41% of all simulated Holocene years. 
This finding is profound. First of all, it means that human greenhouse gas emissions were easily able to overturn what should be a natural cooling trend. Second, the warming we have caused is far outside of the natural range. According to Dr. Shuman: 
The major significance here is temperature across two continents over the last 11,000 years. The paper provides a geologically long-term perspective on recent temperature changes in the Northern Hemisphere and the ability of climate models, such as the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration and National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) models used in the study, to predict the changes. Climate simulations do a strikingly good job of forecasting the changes.
I would say it is significant that temperatures of the most recent decade exceed the warmest temperatures of our reconstruction by 0.5 degrees Fahrenheit, having few -- if any -- precedents over the last 11,000 years. Additionally, we learned that the climate fluctuates naturally over the last 11,000 years and would have led to cooling today in the absence of human activity.
People who deny or try to minimize the importance of human-caused climate change will often argue that climate changed naturally in the past. And while that’s true, we know the climate change is now being dominated by what humans are doing. That’s one clear result of this new paper. 
We have now pushed the Earth’s environment outside of where it should be. There are consequences for this disruption. Those consequences will include significant sea level rise, changes to rain/drought patterns, acidification of ocean waters, and a warmer atmosphere and ocean. There is still time to stop some of the coming climate change, but we are rapidly running out of time. The longer we delay, the worse things will get.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/feb/19/pollen-data-shows-humans-reversed-natural-global-cooling

The plaintiff sought to prevent the educational use of An Inconvenient Truth on the grounds that schools are legally required to provide a balanced presentation of political issues. The court ruled that the film was substantially founded upon scientific research and fact and could continue to be shown, but it had a degree of political bias such that teachers would be required to explain the context via guidance notes issued to schools along with the film.

I think your position John is called ""herding"" which it appears is a not an uncommon trait: 
BQSTART
Here we show that even when scientists are motivated to promote the truth, their behaviour may be influenced, and even dominated, by information gleaned from their peers’ behaviour, rather than by their personal dispositions. This phenomenon, known as herding, subjects the scientific community to an inherent risk of converging on an incorrect answer and raises the possibility that, under certain conditions, science may not be self-correcting.

""So, as 50% of the global accumulated wealth last year went to the 1%, you want to apply an energy tax on the world's poorest,""
I was taking about a price on carbon, not a tax. That price didn't apply to all sources of energy, just those that produced net CO2 emissions.
I've lived with some of the wold's poorest people and they don't live in Australia. So the carbon price I was talking about was not affecting the world's poorest people.
In my country, the people on lower incomes were reimbursed the increase in the cost of energy due to the carbon tax.
""knowing full well the rich will just carry on with their energy rich lives knowing they can easily afford it financially.""
The rich often have large houses and cars. 
Their large houses have large air conditioners. When there was a price on carbon it applied to the wholesale price of electricity which increased the use of renewable energy sources within the Australian electricity network. So even the rich with high electrical energy use from the grid reduced their CO2 emissions.
Increased demand for fuel from the countries of my region, which once had contained the world's poorest people, increased the price on crude oil in the East. This resulted in prices increases in liquid fuel a order of magnitude greater than that caused by the price on carbon. In my country most of the rich can afford to live close to their place of work, so while they usually have parking supplied free of charge, they don't have a long commute by car.
Note my reasons for describing the advantages of our price on carbon have nothing to do with the accumulation of wealth by the 1%. Australia's richest person, who at times has been the world's richest woman, owns a large number of coal mines and opposed that price on carbon, financing the extreme right wing politicians who also opposed it.

I have not put forward a carbon tax. I have put forward a price on carbon combustion and the resultant net CO2 emissions and mentioned that when my country had a price on carbon our emissions dropped.
""which means that every joule of energy that you use will be subject to a tax.""
Every joule of energy I used was not subject to a carbon price which is not a tax. There was no carbon tax.
The rooftop solar panels, which provide the joules of energy to power the overhead fans, household appliances, this laptop and the air conditioner on days when the wet bulb temperature exceeds 35 degrees C, attracted no carbon price. Neither did the windfarms and hydro-electric power stations that feed large amounts of power into the Australian electricity network. I didn't pay a carbon price on the joules of energy that heated the water from a rooftop solar hot water system.
With an only somewhat insulated house in the warm subtropics we have no need to consume joules of energy in heating our very small house. Here the largest peaks in electricity demand occur on very hot sunny days due to domestic air conditioner use. On such days rooftop solar panels provide carbon price free joules to power our small reverse cycle air conditioner. Without rooftop solar panels our electricity grid would not have sufficient supply to meet peak demand on hot sunny days.
In the same way as a modicum of insulation reduces the need to use joules of energy in domestic heating and cooling, the generous canopy of local rainforest trees on the northwest side of the house plus the secure through ventilation in that living area eliminates the need for air conditioner use on all but the hottest days. In winter the lower angled sunlight can be allowed into the living room to provide both warmth and light. The joules of energy from that sun are free.

In the Northern Hemisphere, the atmospheric radiocarbon peak occurred in 1964 where the signal is preserved in European trees. That same peak took until late 1965 to reach the Southern Hemisphere atmosphere. With that, the signal became global, precise and detectable in the geological record, meaning it fitted the requirements as a marker for a new epoch.

""Frost fairs, sunspots and the Little Ice Age"" - Lockwood et al, 2017

Combining all the available chronicles, there are six reported severe winters in England in the 50 years prior to 1565 and six in the 50 years after. This is a much higher occurrence rate than we experience today, but it is not an ice age – little or otherwise.

Thames freeze years are slightly more frequent before the Maunder minimum began and also considerably more common 65 years after it ended. The association of the solar Maunder minimum and the Little Ice Age is also not supported by proper inspection and ignores the role of other factors such as volcanoes.

Too much of what is said about these matters is based on anecdote, rather than careful analysis.

They conclude their introductory paragraph by saying that ""they"" (their results) ""reinforce the notion that climate models can adequately simulate climates for periods other than the present day.

The warmest period during the Holocene was between 9,000 and 5,000 years before present. There was gradual cooling from 5,000 to 2,000 ybp then much faster cooling until the 19th century, which is why the early Roman period is warmer than the last millennium.
The warmth of the early half of the Holocene was the product of the shoulder of the 19,000 ybp Northern Hemisphere high latitude summer insolation (NHHLSI) peak and the consequent CO2 driven global greenhouse warming due to an increase in atmospheric CO2 from 200 ppm to 280 ppm.

Medieval times were notably mild and illustrations in manuscripts show people wearing light and loose clothes, without capes, fur or hats. That changed in the Little Ice Age, roughly spanning the 1300s to 1800s, which included some bitterly cold times.
Fashions responded, especially in the 1500s, when heavy textiles in clothes were used more widely. In Hans Holbein’s famous painting The French Ambassadors of 1533, the two courtiers wear thick dark velvets, fur-lined overcoats and fashionable caps. And some of the oldest surviving gloves, hats, capes and coats in museums come from those times. By Charles II’s reign in the second half of the 1600s, ladies’ gowns used layers of heavy fabric and gentlemen wore long coats, large breeches and wigs. And the muff handwarmer became popular, as Samuel Pepys noted on a bitterly cold day in November 1662: “This day I first did wear a muffe, being my wife’s last year’s muffe, this serves me very well.”

On Tuesday the leaders of the four most popular parties answered questions curated by OurFutureSA, a coalition of 33 climate and nature groups who say they collectively represent 130,000 members in South Australia.
“The single biggest environmental challenge in our state, the nation, the world is action on climate change,” Weatherill said. “And I’m proud to say that this state government is a leader not just in the nation but in the world.”
The state Labor leader listed his government’s achievements in renewable energy, which have attracted worldwide attention and proved popular with voters.
Weatherill said that those moves – which include shifting the state’s electricity supply from “basically 99% fossil fuels” to 48.9% – would be the dominant issues at voting booths.
“Make no mistake, this next election will be treated, whether we like it or not, as a referendum on renewable energy,” he said. “If we go down, they will be wagging their fingers at everybody around the nation, to say that’s what happens if you push too hard into renewable energy. That’s what the prime minister is trying to do and that’s what is going to happen.”
The audience applauded that statement but was less pleased when attention turned to large-scale fossil fuel expansions in the state.
Several companies including Statoil are lining up to explore for oil in the virtually pristine waters of the Great Australian Bight. The potential oil reserves there have been compared to the Gulf of Mexico, one of the world’s most productive off-shore oil regions.
Weatherill said he supported existing processes, where any application to drill for oil would be assessed by the federal regulator, the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Agency.
The Liberal leader, Steven Marshall, took a similar line, while the SA Best leader, Nick Xenophon, and the Greens leader, Mark Parnell, repeated their opposition to the proposed drilling.
The parties lined up differently when it came to another proposed fossil fuel expansion – fracking in the state’s south-east.
The Liberal party has proposed a 10-year moratorium, supported by both the Greens and SA Best. The Labor party continues to support expansion of fracking there, despite strong community opposition based on fears about contamination of the water resources in the prime agricultural region.
“A government championing its climate change credentials while also pushing for massive expansions to the fossil fuel industry is pretty disingenuous,” said Peter Owen, the South Australia director of the Wilderness Society and spokesman for OurFutureSA.
“South Australia is currently supporting massive expansions to the climate damaging fossil fuel industry in the state’s south-east, north and offshore in the Great Australian Bight.
“This could lead to hundreds of times more carbon pollution than SA’s current emissions, completely undermining the government’s leadership position on renewables. We must stop the expansion of the fossil fuel industry to have any chance of providing our children with a liveable climate.” • This article was amended on 21 February.

“US president Donald Trump doesn’t believe in the science of human-caused climate change,” reads the website for the project, launched before Trump withdrew the US from the Paris climate accord.
“So we’re planting a forest to soak up the extra greenhouse gases Trump plans to put into our atmosphere. We’re planting a global forest to offset Trump’s monumental stupidity.”
The project was launched last March and in less than a year over a million trees have been pledged from people around the world, but particularly in the US and Europe. 
The donated trees are to go towards offsetting the 650m tonnes of CO2 that will be released into the atmosphere by 2025 if the president’s plans to backtrack on US climate commitments go ahead, organisers say. 
The figure of 650m tonnes – equivalent to the annual carbon footprint of 33 million Americans – is calculated from Trump’s decision to roll back the US 2015 Paris agreement pledge to lower emissions by at least 26% below 2005 levels by 2025.
It would take 10bn trees – covering a landmass roughly the size of the state of Kentucky – to offset the full amount.
“We’re really pleased at how quickly it happened,” co-founder Adrien Taylor told Newshub. 
“We’re just pleased to see we’re not the only people in the world who care about climate change, because sometimes it can feel like that.”
The project’s co-founder, British climate scientist Dr Dan Price, said: “In 30 years from now, when people look back on the Trump presidency as an attack on the planet and on rational thought, it would be pretty cool if the history books say his actions were negligible because the global community offset the administration’s additional emissions.
“It’s clearly a big challenge, but only recently the world record was broken when India put 66m trees in the ground in a day. If we all chip in, it is a completely realistic goal.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/20/trees-for-trump-one-million-pledged-offset-climate-change

The scientists, led by the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), are trying to reach a newly revealed ecosystem that had been hidden for 120,000 years below the Larsen C ice shelf on the Antarctic peninsula.
In July last year, part of the Larsen C ice shelf calved away, forming a huge iceberg - A68 - which is four times bigger than London, and revealing life beneath for the first time.
Now scientists say it is a race against time to explore these new ecosystems before they are transformed by exposure to the light.
Marine biologist Dr Katrin Linse from the BAS is leading the mission which sets off on a voyage across the Southern Ocean from the Falklands Islands on Wednesday. They expect to reach the iceberg within a week. 
“The calving of A68 provides us with a unique opportunity to study marine life as it responds to a dramatic environmental change,” she said. “It’s important we get there quickly before the undersea environment changes as sunlight enters the water and new species begin to colonise … It’s very exciting.”
Prof David Vaughan, science director at BAS, said: “We need to be bold on this one. Larsen C is a long way south and there’s lots of sea ice in the area, but this is important science, so we will try our best to get the team where they need to be.”
He said climate change had already affected the seas around Antarctica and is warming some coastal waters.
“Future warming may make some habitats warm. Where these habitats support unique species that are adapted to love the cold and not the warm, those species are going to either move or die. How fast species can disperse, and how fast ecosystems can colonise new areas, is key to understanding where the Antarctic is likely to be resilient, and where it is vulnerable.”
Last week the Guardian printed the first images of creatures found in a previously unexplored region of the Antarctic seabed, taken during a Greenpeace research expedition to the Antarctic which is part of a wider campaign to turn a huge section of the region into the world’s biggest ocean sanctuary.
Speaking onboard the Greenpeaceship Arctic Sunrise, the group’s head of oceans, Will McCallum, said there was “still so much left to learn about ocean life here in the Antarctic”.
“From hidden ecosystems revealed by calving icebergs, to our research missions to the seafloor which have found an abundance of rare and vulnerable species - this place is bursting with life and a vast Antarctic Ocean sanctuary would help us protect it in all its forms.” 
There is growing concern about the possible impact of climate change in the Antarctic.
Earlier this month, a report revealed that melting ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica are speeding up the already fast pace of sea level rise.
The research published by the National Academies of Sciences said, at the current rate, the world’s oceans will be on average at least 60cm (2ft) higher by the end of the century.
However it found that the process is accelerating, and more than three-quarters of the acceleration since 1993 is due to melting ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, the study shows.
Experts say the area around the Antarctic peninsula has seen widespread ice shelf decay and collapse in recent decades, leading to “glacier acceleration” and increased discharge of ice from the Antarctic continent into the sea.
However scientists are wary of attributing the calving of the Larsen C iceberg directly to global warming. 
Adrian Luckman, professor of glaciology at Swansea University and leader of a project studying the state of the ice shelf, said: “Whilst the Larsen C ice shelf has reduced in area since records began, suggesting that over the long-term the environment of the Antarctic peninsula is becoming less able to support ice shelves, we have no evidence to link this particular calving event to changing conditions. Iceberg calving is a natural part of the ice shelf cycle and, whilst large, the calving of A68 is not unprecedented.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/20/scientists-race-to-explore-antarctic-marine-life-revealed-by-giant-iceberg

In Trump’s first day in the White House, the administration told the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to withdraw an Obama-era plan that would require dentists to prevent this mercury from getting into waterways. But in June, the rule was unexpectedly enacted.
This apparent change of heart followed legal action filed by green groups, part of a cascade of courtroom standoffs that are starting to slow and even reverse the Trump administration’s blitzkrieg of environmental regulations.
“The Trump administration has been sloppy and careless, they’ve shown significant disrespect for rule of law and courts have called them on it,” said Richard Revesz, a professor at the New York University school of law. 
“I expect we will see a number of further losses for the administration on similar grounds. If they keep showing the same disregard for the law, their attempt to repeal all these environmental regulations will go badly for them.”
The reversal of Obama’s environmental legacy has been spearheaded by Scott Pruitt, who heads the EPA, the agency he repeatedly sued as Oklahoma attorney general. Pruitt, who accused Obama of “bending the rule of law” and federal overreach, has overseen the methodical delay or scrapping of dozens of rules curbing pollution from power plants, pesticides and vehicles.
Ironically for Pruitt, who has touted a “back to basics” approach rooted safely within the confines of the law, this rapidly executed agenda has run into a thicket of legal problems, causing the administration to admit defeat in several cases.
In July, a federal court ruled that the EPA couldn’t suspend rules designed to curb methane emissions from new oil and gas wells. This was followed by a hasty retreat in August when the EPA agreed to not delay new standards to reduce smog-causing air pollutants, the day after 15 states and environment groups sued. 
Then, in December, a federal court told the EPA it couldn’t delay a new standard for dangerous levels of lead in paint and dust.
Other arms of the federal government have also been stymied from implementing Trump’s deregulatory agenda. The US Fish and Wildlife Service, stung by a lawsuit, listed the rusty patched bumblebee as endangered in March after initially delaying the decision. And on Thursday, a federal court told the department of energy it must implement four energy efficiency regulations it was looking to scuttle.
Many of these legal problems have stemmed from the sheer pace of the rollbacks – required public comment periods have been set aside in some cases, any rationale for repeal or delay has been missing in others. Opponents of the administration also believe there is a determination to expunge every vestige of Obama’s environmental legacy, regardless of merit.
“They are trying to score political points or attempting to grant favours to corporations who don’t want to follow the rules,” said Aaron Colangelo, the litigation director of the Natural Resources Defense Council. “It all shows that this administration won’t protect the environment unless they are sued. They have been reckless and not followed the basic requirements of the law.”
The EPA now faces a fresh wave of opposition as it looks to craft replacements for major Obama rules such as the clean power plan, which sought to limit emissions from coal-fired power plants, and the waters of the US rule, which greatly expanded clean water protections.
If the proposed replacements are, as expected, far less onerous on industry than current iterations, environmentalists and around a dozen states, headed by New York and California, will be poised to further jam up the process in the courts.
“Over and over again, the Trump administration has put the profits of multinational polluters over the health and well-being of everyday Americans,” said Eric Schneiderman, New York’s attorney general. 
Schneiderman has been prolific in opposing Trump’s environmental revisions, filing more than 50 lawsuits during the administration’s first year to, among other things, protect the clean power plan, enforce stricter vehicle pollution standards and ensure that chlorpyrifos, a common pesticide linked to neurological harm to children, is banned.
“We’ve already beaten back several of this administration’s toxic policies, from energy efficiency rollbacks to smog,” Schneiderman said. “Our fight to protect public health and our environment will continue in court.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/20/donald-trump-epa-environmental-rollbacks-court-challenges

This humble plant spreads out in lush green carpets that can stretch for miles around much of Britain’s coast. There they shelter young fish and shellfish, as well as protecting against erosion of the coast by storms and floods, by trapping sediment in their roots.And the seagrass meadows also play a big part in fighting climate change. They soak up carbon dioxide and hold tremendous stores of carbon on the sea floor, more than twice the carbon stored by a forest of similar area. And across the world, seagrasses are believed to lock away more than 10% of all the carbon buried each year in the oceans.
Seagrasses around the UK are in serious decline, though, and their immense reservoirs of carbon are being released. Development and dredging are to blame, as well as pollution from sewage and farming washing huge amounts of nutrients into the sea, which kills the seagrasses. Old sewage plants overflow with untreated sewage during heavy rainfalls, which is illegal but common. And excessive nutrients from livestock waste slurry runs off into rivers and ends up in the sea.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/20/plantwatch-seagrass-meadows-are-vital-but-in-serious-decline

But Billy Graham didn't use his ministry to exalt himself financially. When people came up to be saved and find their way back to God, they were met by workers in the aisles who asked what tradition they came from, did they feel comfortable within that tradition, and whether they'd tried the church nearest their house. From these answers, and probably other questions if the last two answers were ""no"" and ""yes"" respectively, these volunteers would help people find a church home. That may not mean much, but for people with no support network, having a church can mean the difference between life and death, joy and despair.
The author of the Op-Ed brings up some strong arguments about his being on the wrong side of history (I didn't know he'd walked back his discussions of global warming, for instance), but by integrating early, by telling people not to vote on one issue (unlike Falwell whom I hope is sizzling in hell), by giving them a path rather than mandating they walk in lockstep, Billy Graham made it possible for evangelicals to disagree with each other civilly and to think about their politics within the context of their faith.

Graham had the opportunity to lead fundamentalists into a new era. He could have pushed them to take social reform seriously as a God-given mandate to save the world from environmental destruction. He could have tackled racism, America’s original sin, by championing the federal government’s aggressive civil rights policies.
BQEND This really is leftist blather. He didn't push evangelicals on these so-called social reforms because:
- he wasn't a left ideologue, Communist or post-modernist, whose real motivation was envy and contempt for Christianity and the middle-class, not love for the working-class and poor
- he wasn't a LGBT activist/Marxist feminist/""Progressive"", hell bent on the destruction of the family because of their hatred for men
- he wasn't an intersectionalist looking for someone to blame for his own suffering
- he worshipped a God who loves all people, not the god of identity politics that seeks to divide.

On civil rights and the environmental crisis, the most important issues of his lifetime, he championed the wrong policies.
Graham was on the wrong side of history.
The world’s most famous evangelist let his apocalyptic anticipation of the coming kingdom of God blind him to the realities of living in this world.
For Graham, the Bible had a clear message for Christians living in what he believed were humans’ last days on earth. Individuals alone can achieve salvation; governments cannot. Conversions change behaviors; federal policies do not. 
These convictions shaped the evangelist’s views on civil rights.
In the late 1950s, Graham integrated his revivals and seemed to support the burgeoning civil rights movement. This is the Graham most Americans remember.
But as the movement grew, expanded and became increasingly confrontational, the evangelist’s position changed.
Once leaders like Martin Luther King Jr began practicing civil disobedience and asking for the federal government to guarantee African Americans’ rights, Graham’s support evaporated.
Within days of the publication of King’s famous 1963 Letter from a Birmingham Jail, Graham told reporters that the Baptist minister should “put the brakes on a little bit”.
He criticized civil rights activists for focusing on changing laws rather than hearts.
In 1971, Graham published The Jesus Generation, a book on the coming apocalypse. Looking for signs of Jesus’s second coming had become an obsession of Graham’s, as it was for millions of other evangelicals in the mid-20th century.
In the book, Graham praised the wisdom of young people who rejected the federal government as a tool for rectifying injustices.
Graham had the opportunity to lead fundamentalists into a new era, but he squandered it
“These young people don’t put much stock in the old slogans of the New Deal, the Fair Deal, the New Frontier and the Great Society,” he said. “They believe that utopia will arrive only when Jesus returns. Thus these young people are on sound Biblical ground.”
For six decades, Graham taught Americans that the federal government could not be an instrument of God to bring about justice, not on race matters and not on other significant issues. Although he believed in racial equality, his theology blinded him to what we now know was the best means for achieving that equality.
More recently, the evangelist denied the threat of global warming and rejected federal efforts to stymie it.
In a 1992 book focused on the signs that the world was nearing its end, the preacher suggested that if humankind were going to survive, businesses needed to reduce pollution and stop contributing to global warming.
In a revised 2010 version of the book, Graham eliminated the phrase “global warming” from the text altogether. Global warming no longer existed in the mind of Graham as a real threat.
He went on to assure readers that the earth would not “be saved through legislation”. The federal government, he indicated, had no business passing laws to protect the earth for future generations.
Graham’s positions on civil rights and the environment are not those of a rightwing crank, or of a paranoid anti-intellectual. Graham takes his Bible and his theology seriously. The political positions he has embraced derive from a careful and serious study of the scriptures.
Graham came of age during Franklin Roosevelt’s vast expansion of government power. But rather than join with social gospel advocates like Roosevelt’s aide Harry Hopkins in promoting the creation of a welfare state to serve the needy, the future evangelist was more influenced by apocalypse-obsessed, fundamentalist rabble rousers who rejected New Deal liberalism.
Graham, like most fundamentalists of his generation, determined that the New Deal state represented godless competition for the churches rather than a potential ally.
This is a message that appeared again and again in Graham’s many books on Jesus’s second coming. Only the return of Jesus would right social wrongs, he concluded.
The expansion of state power, in contrast, was a necessary precursor to the rise of the antichrist. The evangelist felt sure that as we approached the end of time, the world’s governments were going to take away Christians’ rights and liberties.
The New Deal, with its intrusive regulations, was the first step; Obamacare, with its contraception mandates, the most recent.
Yet Graham insisted that the inevitability of the second coming was no justification for indifference. “We must not feel that we are to sit back and do nothing to fight evil just because some day the four horsemen will come with full and final force upon the earth,” Graham wrote. Instead, he prodded evangelicals to elect people to office who shared his anti-statist worldview.
They did. White evangelicals have played an outsized role in recent political campaigns, supporting every Republican presidential candidate from Ronald Reagan to Donald Trump. 
Graham had the opportunity to lead fundamentalists into a new era. He could have pushed them to take social reform seriously as a God-given mandate to save the world from environmental destruction. He could have tackled racism, America’s original sin, by championing the federal government’s aggressive civil rights policies.
But he squandered it. He could not overcome the speculative end-times schemes of his cohort of evangelicals, with their anti-government hostilities.
Graham had good intentions, as his work desegregating his crusades demonstrated. But when his influence really would have counted, when he could have effected real change, real social transformation, he was too locked into last-days fearmongering to recognize the potential of the state to do good. We are all paying the price.
A different kind of last days may soon be upon us. Racial tensions are rising, the earth is warming, and evangelicals are doing little to help. That may be Graham’s most significant, and saddest, legacy.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/21/billy-graham-wrong-side-history

The study, by Newcastle University, analysed changes in flooding, droughts and heatwaves for every European city using all climate models.
Looking at the impact by the year 2050-2100, the team produced results for three possible outcomes – low, medium and high-impact scenarios.
But even the most optimistic case showed 85% of UK cities with a river, including London, would face increased flooding.
In the high-impact scenario, some cities and towns in the UK and Ireland could see the amount of water per flood as much as double. The worst affected is Cork, which could see 115% more water per flooding, while Wrexham, Carlisle, Glasgow, and Chester could all see increases of more than 75%.
The increase in severity in the predicted impact has come after the team, in a first of its kind, examined all three climate hazards together in the largest study of its kind ever undertaken.
After around three years of analysing the information across hundreds of cities in Europe, they found every outcome was worse than previously thought.
Wrexham, Carlisle, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Derry and Chester were the worst-hit UK towns and cities for river flooding, with Dublin, Cork and Waterford the worst in Ireland.
All 571 cities studied saw a worsening in heatwaves and the high-impact scenario predicted southern Europe experiencing droughts 14 times worse than today.
The lead author, Selma Guerreiro, said: “Although southern European regions are adapted to cope with droughts, this level of change could be beyond breaking point.
“Furthermore, most cities have considerable changes in more than one hazard, which highlights the substantial challenge cities face in managing climate risks.”
While southern European cities saw the biggest increase in the number of heatwave days, central European cities saw the greatest increase in temperature during heatwaves – ranging between 2C to 7C for the low scenario and 8C to 14C for the high scenario.
A co-author, Prof Richard Dawson, said: “The research highlights the urgent need to design and adapt our cities to cope with these future conditions.
“We are already seeing at first hand the implications of extreme weather events in our capital cities.
“In Paris, the Seine rose more than four metres above its normal water level. And as Cape Town prepares for its taps to run dry, this analysis highlights that such climate events are feasible in European cities too.”
Published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, the research found the European capitals worst hit by flooding would be Dublin, Helsinki, Riga, Vilnius and Zagreb.
Under the high-impact scenario, several European cities saw more than 80% increases on peak river flows.
Stockholm and Rome could see the greatest increase in number of heatwave days, while Prague and Vienna could see the greatest increase in maximum temperatures during heatwaves.
Lisbon and Madrid are in the top capital cities for increases in frequency and magnitude of droughts, while Athens, Nicosia, Valletta and Sofia might experience the worst increases in both drought and heatwaves.
Next month the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is holding its first cities and climate change science conference, after recognising the important role cites must play in tackling climate change.
Over 75% of the population of the EU currently lives in urban areas, and this percentage is expected to grow to 82% by 2050.
And already the impact is being felt, as between 1998-2009 floods in Europe caused 1,126 deaths and at least €52bn in insured economic losses.
Dawson, who sits on the scientific steering committee for the conference, said: “A key objective for this conference is to bring together and catalyse action from researchers, policymakers and industry to address the urgent issue of preparing our cities, their population, buildings and infrastructure for climate change.”
The team used projections from all available models associated with the high emission scenario RCP8.5, which implies a 2.6C to 4.8C increase in global temperature.
They found the British Isles have some of the worst overall flood projections, with the high scenario predicting half of UK cities could see at least a 50% increase on peak river flows.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/21/climate-change-will-push-european-cities-towards-breaking-point

That sulphate aerosols absorb and scatter incoming solar radiation (and hence cause cooling) is not in dispute.

We don't have extensive concentration measurements but we do have ice core data. When spikes from volcanos are removed there is good correlation with estimates of sulphate emissions.

""it`s worse then we thought"" so prevalent in the climate science debate.
BQEND
There are plenty of phenomena whose warming has been ""worse than we thought"". Unfortunately skeptics such as yourself simply refuse to acknowledge they exist.
Examples include the unexpectedly rapid melting of the Arctic ice cap, a full half-century ahead of IPCC projections in 2007.
Or sea level rise being ahead of the worst-case IPCC projections from the 1990s.
From a peer-reviewed paper on the subject:
BQSTART
Over the past two decades, skeptics of the reality and significance of anthropogenic climate change have frequently accused climate scientists of ‘‘alarmism’’: of over-interpreting or overreacting to evidence of human impacts on the climate system. However, the available evidence suggests that scientists have in fact been conservative in their projections of the impacts of climate change. In particular, we discuss recent studies showing that at least some of the key attributes of global warming from increased atmospheric greenhouse gases have been under-predicted, particularly in IPCC assessments of the physical science
BQEND
Bizarrely skeptics, such as yourself, primarily and irrationally demand that mainstream science has over-projected atmospheric warming (typically by focusing on discrete short-term cherry-picked periods which models do not project) - when temperature evolution of 0.2 °C/decade since 1990 is at the very top end of IPCC projections of 0.15-0.2C from the various IPCC reports.

How about you first demonstrating the causes (with science, not speculation) of the contradictions to the warming trend as occurred between 1940 and 1978, and from 1998 to 2012. (I suspect you'll just tell me the pause never happended)
BQEND
Asking for ""science, not speculation"" is meaningless as it sets you up as an arbiter of whether or not evidence meets some arbitrary, undefined standard. See your reply to this post for details.
Post-war temperature was suppressed by increases in aerosol pollutants which reduced the amount of solar radiation reaching the surface, known as ""global-dimming"". You can see the negative forcing of these aerosols in the IPCC graphic of forcings relative to 1750. The patterns of temperature evolution in this period provide further evidence that aerosols were a dominant factor - with days cooling but nights warming. The various clean-air acts of the 1970s reduced this pollution at a time when CO2 was rising rapidly and overwhelmed the climatic system. This has been successfully hindcasted by GCMs.
As for the period 1998-2012 - it has been known for several decades that slowdowns and speed-ups would occur during the projected warming. This was a surprise only to the so-called skeptics. It was caused primarily by the ocean-atmospheric coupling, primarily ENSO and the PDO. 1998 was an unusually warm year because of a massive El Niño event, so starting in 1998 gives a data point above the long-term trend. 1998-2012 then saw the largest pre-ponderance of La Niña events in several decades. There are further complementary explanations involving solar and aerosol activity, but bog-standard ocean-atmospheric coupling is enough to slow or speed temperature evolution by several tenths of a degree over short-term periods. Tellingly, the scientists who explained this during the slowdown made projections that warming would see a rapid increase very soon, which was followed by 3 hottest years in a row - a first in the temperature record.
Skeptical scientist Judith Curry projected the slowdown would continue until 2030, so yet another example where the explanations and projections of mainstream science are superior to those of your favoured scientific grouping.
Now, there is plenty of reading for you and there's more where that came from. Please respond to all of the evidence and provide your own in any reply.

Interhemispheric Propagation of Stationary Rossby Waves in a Horizontally Nonuniform Background Flow
BQENDIt seems to suggest some meridionial wind teleconnections (rather than zonal).

That said, if west-east progression of midlatitude weather systems has slowed then I'd expect that after tropical cyclones have moved to midlatitudes then their tracks would show less latitudinal movement. 
BQENDThis is one of my favourite images in meteorology

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Global_tropical_cyclone_tracks-edit2.jpg
The curving tracks that are especially notable in the Western Pacific and N Atlantic basins are in a big part down to trade winds (recurvature) and what is called beta drift, that is the movement to the north and west (in the N Hemisphere) from the movement of the Earth. Tropical cyclones themselves, in these latitudes, lose their orginisation as there is not enough warm water to keep the warm core low pressure pulling the air in and recondensing. Instead they break down to be frontal system, extra tropical cyclones. They do encounter the polar jet on that journey. But as always its complex. And its getting more complex. Here is where the likely impact of Arctic warming slowing the progression of Rossby Waves has its impacts. When a blocking pattern is set up you can get circumstances where the deep amplitude of the wave can pick up low pressure systems and zip them across the Atlantic with a fair old clip. 2013/14 winter and its ""storm factory"" was such a set up.

First you have to ask yourself what it is that you are talking about the warming of. In this case you appear to be talking about the warming of the Earth's climate. The temperature of the Earth's climate for any particular year is the average global temperature of that year added to the global average temperatures of the preceding 29 years divided by 30.
The global average temperature is the average of a set of temperatures representative of series of quadrants covering the surface of the Earth. On the 30% of the globe covered by land the surface air temperature is measured while on 70% covered by oceans and seas the surface water temperature is measured.
See the histogram of yearly global average temperature anomalies from the 20th average from 1880 to 2016 in the following.https://climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-temperature
Note that a change in average yearly global temperature is not a change in climate as it takes 30 years to measure climate temperature. Note also that warming of the global climate is not the same thing as global warming as more the atmosphere at the surface and the ocean surface are not the only parts of the globe that warm. More significantly the ocean warms to a considerable depth.
I suspect that what you mean by a contradiction to a warming trend is the opposite of a warming trend which is a cooling trend. Note that the period from 1940 to 1978 contains a equal balance of anomalies in the yearly average global temperature above and below the 20th century average which represents a period of neither cooling nor appreciable warming. 
Note also that the period from 1998 to 2012 shows a warming trend. Note also that a 15 year period is not long enough to affect the rate of warming of the climate as climate needs 30 years. Even though those 15 years showed a slower warming trend than the four years that followed and the 11 years that preceded them, each of which included an extreme record breaking El Nino year, the warming of the global climate has continued for those 30 years. 
That 1998 to 2012 period has been referred to as the pause but because there has been no pause in warming of the climate people will tell you there is no pause. However there was during that period a pause in the rate of warming trend of the average global yearly temperature and there was a longer and more distinct pause in the rate of warming trend in the period 1940 to 1978.

BQEND
No it's not.

When a record temperature occurs, shout about it as further evidence of the catastrophe ahead (or here already).

Record temperatures are further evidence of the long-term warming trend. Again, what is the problem? Newspapers are going to report on hottest years, there is no problem with that as long as it is context of the long-term trend, which it is.
BQSTART
When it fades into the past, then shift to a focus on long term trends (ignoring any natural contribution or variability)
BQEND
Such a shift is a figment of your imagination. For instance during a period of particularly rapid warming - 1992-2007 when the decadal rate was over 0.25C per decade, scientists cautioned us to look at the lower, longer-term trend.
Meanwhile skeptics such as yourself tell us that while short-term slowdowns in atmospheric warming are evidence that global warming has stopped, short-term speed-ups are evidence of natural variability. That is a contradiction and self-evidently hypocritical.
BQSTART
namecall those who mention the record, and downplay it, pretending you never mentioned it.

Actually I provided you with an explanation of different ways of using short-term data or single data-points, your response was to sidestep that completely.

It can be painful to shift our world view from the narrow regions we chose to recognize, to the scientific reality of the global implications of climate change. When interacting with others who chose a narrow, comfortable view of the world, we should challenge ourselves to broaden their perspective with stories or facts about a single field. Connecting climate change to weather scales that individuals are familiar with challenges the separation of hurricanes and cyclones from the environmental impacts of mining, the car industry, and sewage dumping. Vulnerable populations suffer the most consequences from tropical storm affects, but contribute very little to the climate change producing the stronger storms (1-3). Addition of another number to storm severity forces a bridge that can threaten individuals’ world view. Seeking to slowly decrease the compartmentalization can help to create a space where dialogue on structural societal shifts to reduce pollution, plastic production, and innumerable other factors to improve our local and global environments can occur.

Dyson has great affection for coal and for one big reason: It is so inexpensive that most of the world can afford it. “There’s a lot of truth to the statement Greens are people who never had to worry about their grocery bills,” he says. (“Many of these people are my friends,” he will also tell you.) To Dyson, “the move of the populations of China and India from poverty to middle-class prosperity should be the great historic achievement of the century. Without coal it cannot happen.” That said, Dyson sees coal as the interim kindling of progress. In “roughly 50 years,” he predicts, solar energy will become cheap and abundant, and “there are many good reasons for preferring it to coal.”

The Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale currently runs in severity from one to five, with five describing near-total destruction. 
But climate scientists meeting at a conference in the New Zealand city of Wellington have floated the idea of creating a category six to reflect the increasing severity of tropical cyclones in the wake of warming sea temperatures and climate change.
Climatologist Michael Mann, the director of the Earth system science center at Penn State University said the current scale could be viewed as increasingly outdated. 
“Scientifically, [six] would be a better description of the strength of 200mph (320km/h) storms, and it would also better communicate the well-established finding now that climate change is making the strongest storms even stronger,” he said.
He pointed out that category five was previously considered the highest category necessary because it led to essentially total destruction of human infrastructure. But that was no longer true owing to sturdier construction
“Since the scale is now used as much in a scientific context as it is a damage assessment context, it makes sense to introduce a category six to describe the unprecedented strength 200mph storms we’ve seen over the past few years both globally [Patricia] and here in the southern hemisphere [Winston].”
New Zealand’s climate change minister, James Shaw, said cyclone Winston in 2016 – the strongest cyclone on record in the southern hemisphere – was an example of a cyclone that could have been scaled up to a category six; if the category existed. 
“The international cyclone rankings don’t go higher than category five, the only reason it wasn’t a category-six cyclone is because we don’t have a category six, but we might need one in the future,” Shaw told the conference.
But Chris Brandolino, principal scientist at the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in New Zealand, said the ramifications of introducing another category to the scale could be complex, because meteorologists were trained in the old scale, and the public were educated about what the scale means, and how to prepare.
“Categories are engaging to the public and its easy for us to understand and communicate the severity of a storm,” said Brandolino. “I always encourage us re-evaluating the science, we should always be asking ‘is what we are doing appropriate for the time?’ But I think if we are seriously to consider this it requires a holistic approach, looking at the whole scale, not just adding a category. Maybe the whole scale gets rejigged to reflect the times.”
Mann said re-evaluating the scale or adding a category six would have implications for the preparedness of communities in the cyclone’s path, and on scientists’ ability to understand cyclone behaviour as it changes in an age of climate change.

The Labor frontbencher has effectively ruled out Labor overhauling the Environmental Protection Biodiversity and Conversation Act as part of a strategy to boost legal options of killing the controversial Queensland coal project.
While Labor has been considering a range of policy options, including the possible insertion of a climate trigger in the Act, Albanese told the ABC “certainly there has been no suggestion from Labor that that is something that we should do”.
“We haven’t said at any stage that we would do that.”
He added that the Adani project had already secured the required environmental approvals “not once, but twice. It was approved firstly and then they made a decision that what they would need to do is to re-examine it in light of the potential impacts on the Great Barrier Reef and again it was approved”.
“It has received its state approvals – both of those rounds of approvals by the way under Coalition governments, not Labor governments.”
And referencing the byelection in the Melbourne electorate of Batman, where the Greens are already escalating their ground campaign efforts against Labor on Adani – Albanese explicitly warned colleagues against making a short-term political decision that would have long-term policy implications.
“What you can’t do is look at any one electorate and say this is why we are going to determine national policy on something like mining or energy or climate change action,” Albanese said.
“What you have to do is to get the policy mechanisms right and that is what we have done.”
The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, has been publicly telegraphing a hardening of Labor’s position on the Adani project since late January, but has yet to clarify what specific options the ALP might take.
This week, Shorten has been visiting Queensland coastal electorates, and sending a positive message about the future of coal, while also highlighting his concerns about the Adani project.
Labor’s climate change spokesman, Mark Butler, delivered a much less equivocal message. On Monday he used his speech to the Sydney Institute to argue developing the Galilee Basin was not in Australia’s national interest because it would displace mining and jobs in existing coal regions, and would not help the world meet its obligations under the Paris climate agreement.
Internal views within Labor are mixed, with some key players favouring killing the project on climate grounds, but others concerned that option will expose Labor to a damaging political backlash about sovereign risk.
The mining union has urged Labor not to toughen its position on the project, because stopping Adani will trigger an internal debate inside the party about the future of coalmining, and will cost the ALP politically in Queensland.
Albanese said he did not believe the Adani project would ultimately proceed, because it would not get government subsidies, which would help the mine attract private finance.
“The conservation movement said to me repeatedly ... this project doesn’t stack up unless it gets some public subsidy through the rail line,” Albanese said.
“Now we ensured that that would not occur and indeed the Queensland Labor government has also said that they won’t support that subsidy and hence we have a project that doesn’t have any finance here in Australia, unable to raise funds in the US, unable to raise funds in China – and therefore it is hard to see this project going ahead because of the economics of the project”.
Adani has confirmed it has now abandoned its March deadline for securing financing for the first stage of the Carmichael mine.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/22/anthony-albanese-hard-to-see-adani-project-going-ahead

""Either way, it's a blatant fact that the self obsessed colonialists looked down upon both African people and African wildlife.""
BQENDExperience suggests that just about all edible wildlife disappears in a range of less than roughly a day's walk from most African villages. As a result, driving through many sub-Saharan African countries you can track the movement of villages as they migrate in response to the area around them becoming exhausted.
Some might say this is living in harmony with nature.
A similar harmony with nature can be found in the game parks, established by these evil colonials, where - for example - the military are periodically given a day off to massacre local wildlife with automatic weapons. It is a very sad sight to come across the results when driving through the game parks.

Our collective water has been assaulted for many generations to the possible point of no return. 
Our Elders foretold of a Black Snake and how the Water of Life — “Mni Woc’oni,” which is our first medicine — would be affected if we did not stop this oncoming disaster. Mni Woc’oni is part of our creation story, and the same story that exists in many creation stories around Mother Earth.
When we say “Mni Woc’oni” — Water of Life — people all over the world are now beginning to understand that it is a living spirit: it can heal when you pray with it and die if you do not respect it. We wanted the world to know there have been warnings in our prophecies and, as we see it, those warnings are now taking place. It was said water would be like gold. It was said that our spirit of water would begin to leave us. 
We are at the crossroads.
In April 2016, after receiving concerns about the construction of an oil pipeline, I was invited to Sacred Stone Camp at the northeastern border of the Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota to assist with a water ceremony. At that time, not many were there, but it was enough to create a prayer to wake up the people. I told the young people that Standing Rock is everywhere. 
Later that month, our indigenous youth set out on foot to run from the Standing Rock Reservation to Washington D.C. in an attempt to bring attention to the poisonous bitumen oil pipeline coming through our treaty territory. For our young people, it was important to explain to U.S. government leaders that this was unacceptable. 
As I look back at my experiences at Standing Rock, I think about the circle we created through prayer on December 4, 2016. Our traditional Elders asked all nations to join us and stand in prayer. Thousands, including many religious representatives, joined in prayer on that very cold day. An invitation video was made and sent all over the world. 
After the prayers were offered to the fire, I asked the people to surround the camp and ride horseback around the whole perimeter. On this day, President Obama and his administration halted the Dakota Access Pipeline by denying the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers an easement that would have allowed the pipeline to cross beneath Lake Oahe. 
The closing of the camp at Standing Rock a year ago and the continued construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline has been a great disappointment. So, too, was the November 2017 spill of 210,000 gallons of oil from the Keystone Pipeline, west of the Sisseton Wahpeton Reservation, despite the tribe’s fight against it since 2003. So, too, was the April 2011 spill of 1.2 million gallons of oil onto Lubicon Cree territory, northeast of Peace River. 
What happened at Standing Rock has awakened many of my own people, and people across the world. 
It was at Standing Rock that so many came together to share their stories and knowledge of what was happening in their territory, sharing ideas on how to move toward sustainable living in our relationship to land, water, and food. 
Standing Rock has marked the beginning of an international movement that will continue to work peacefully, purposefully, and tirelessly for the protection of water along all areas of poisonous oil pipelines and across all of Mother Earth. 
In the protection of Mni Woc’oni, it is more than oil pipelines threatening the well-being and future of our water. Near the native territory of the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate, concentrated animal feeding operations or “CAFOs” are draining and degrading the land and water. As a result, the air is toxic, swamps have dried up, and aquifers, to which the people are supposed to have water rights, are being drained. Residents have mortgaged their homes to fight these threats in court and lost. In other places — in mining spills across South America and Africa and at Fukushima — man has gone too far. 
Water is a source of life, not a resource. 
My life’s work has been to bring attention to water and to unite all nations, all faiths in one prayer. As Keeper to the White Buffalo Calf Woman Bundle, I have also brought attention to the white animals being born, signaling us of changes globally. 
As an indigenous leader, I have supported the establishment of a World Peace and Prayer Day, the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and, most recently, the Nayzul Declaration. 
In our tradition, we pray for everything we eat and drink so our minds can be good. When the environment that we live in is sick and suffering, so too are the minds and decisions of our leaders. 
We must continue to work together for the health and well-being of our water and our Earth. 
In a Sacred Hoop of Life, there is no ending and no beginning.

If by 'self-regulating' you mean to imply humans are immune to MME's, don't fool yourself. There's no reason to assume a population won't fall sharply when it's just rapidly overshot its carrying capacity.
BQEND
It's blindingly obvious that humans change the carrying capacity. It started with agriculture. Without modern agriculture, there is no way that 7 billion humans could be supported. There are no known hard limits on carrying capacity for humans. There are many identifiable risks but no known hard limits. For example, if push came to shove it would probably be possible to feed very large numbers of people using (possibly GM) algae and develop that capability quite quickly.
This is not to suggest that the huge human population does not have major adverse environmental impacts. Neither is it suggesting that indefinite population growth is desirable. It is, however, stating that crudely transcribing the notion of carrying capacity from biology/ecology to modern human societies is grossly misleading.

That is thought to be highly unlikely because of the distance from Earth to the Sun and the fact that the oceans didn't boil away during previous episodes of high atmospheric CO2 concentrations (and it would take around a billion years).
But consider that a population of a few million human hunter-gatherers was apparently beyond the carrying capacity of the planet as everywhere we showed up the megafauna disappeared.
Around 10-12,000 years ago, when large climate oscillations settled down, we developed agriculture which allowed us to double our population many times into the billions.
But agriculture faces big challenges if we don’t change our ways soon (1), as do our fisheries, and if they both decline significantly, forcing us back to being largely hunter-gatherers, history tells us that out of every 1000 people you see maybe one survives.

Really?
Actually it's a matter of evidence.
There are about 8 million research scientists in the world.
Around 70,000 or so publish research papers connected to climate change.
The websites run by so-called climate sceptics constantly quote the same handful of scientists, because they don't have anyone else.
Most of their handful are retired - and are connected to various right-wing political 'think-tanks' in the USA, and/or various fringe eccentric religious organisations.
In fact, climate change is probably the most scrutinised area of science ever, and the current scientific position meets the standards of other scientific paradigms like evolution, plate tectonics, and relativity.', u'recommendation_count': u'8', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1519684068000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u""they do n't have anyone else"", u'effect': u'the websites run by so called sceptics constantly quote the same handful of scientists'}], u'author_id': u'2923581', u'in_reply_to': u'112740683', u'id': u'112767241', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Erik Frederiksen', u'text': u'What a boring planet we’re creating.

Dotted across the grassy plain, as far as the eye could see, were the corpses of thousands upon thousands of saiga antelopes. All appeared to have fallen where they were feeding.
Some were mothers that had travelled to this remote wilderness for the annual calving season, while others were their offspring, just a few days old. Each had died in just a few hours from blood poisoning. In the 30C heat of a May day, the air around each of the rotting hulks was thick with flies.
The same grisly story has been replayed throughout Kazakhstan. In this springtime massacre, an estimated 200,000 critically endangered saiga – around 60% of the world’s population – died. “All the carcasses in this one of many killing zones were spread evenly over 20 sq km,” says Kock, professor of wildlife health and emerging diseases at the Royal Veterinary College in London. “The pattern was strange. They were either grazing normally with their newborn calves or dying where they stood, as if a switch had been turned on. I’ve never seen anything like that.”
The saiga – whose migrations form one of the great wildlife spectacles – were victims of a mass mortality event (MME), a single, catastrophic incident that wipes out vast numbers of a species in a short period of time. MMEs are among the most extreme events of nature. They affect starfish, bats, coral reefs and sardines. They can push species to the brink of extinction, or throw a spanner into the complex web of life in an ecosystem. And according to some scientists, MMEs are on the rise and likely to become more common because of climate change.
The MME that has pushed the saiga closer to extinction struck in 2015. Kock was part of an international team studying the animals as they gathered for the calving season. For most of the year, saiga are on the move, able to avoid predatory wolves and human poachers by sprinting at more than 40mph, making them one of the fastest ungulates, or hoofed animals. But once a year they put their migration on pause to calve in vast groups when the grass is at its lushest, before it is scorched by the sun.
In 2015, the main gathering in the Betpak-Dala region of central Kazakhstan, an area roughly the size of the British Isles, numbered 250,000. Nearby, other groups were thousands strong. Saiga are remarkable animals. Their bulbous noses, which hang over their mouths, give these antelopes an almost comical appearance. The nose is flexible and can be inflated, helping them to breathe warm air in the freezing winters and filter air in the arid summers as they sprint with their heads down in a cloud of dust. The species has been hit by mass die-offs before. In 1981, around 70,000 died suddenly in a few days, while in 1988 another 200,000 died. The creatures are also victims of poachers.
These reports of mass mortality events are probably underestimates in terms of occurrence and sheer magnitude
“In 2014, we believed there were about 250,000 adults and they produced a good number of calves – perhaps a couple of hundred thousand. It looked a viable population and we’d expected a population of a million soon. There was even talk of them coming off the critically endangered list,” Kock says.
But as the scientists watched a year later, the mothers fell sick and began to drop dead. “It wasn’t as if the disease started at one end and spread – there was no time for transmission of the pathogen from animal to animal. It was too quick,” he says. “Within two or three days, everything was dying. By the end of the week, every single one was dead.”
The scientists on the ground pinpointed blood poisoning as the cause, but were puzzled as to why whole herds were dying so quickly. After 32 postmortems, they concluded the culprit was the bacterium Pasteurella multocida, which they believe normally lives harmlessly in the tonsils of some, if not all, of the antelopes. In a research paper published in January in Science Advances, Kock and colleagues contrasted the 2015 MME with the two from the 1980s. They concluded that a rise in temperature to 37C and an increase in humidity above 80% in the previous few days had stimulated the bacteria to pass into the bloodstream where it caused haemorrhagic septicaemia, or blood poisoning.
The weather link raises the spectre of climate change. Just as it is rarely wise to link a single extreme weather event – whether it’s the Australian heatwave, last summer’s Hurricane Harvey or this winter’s North American cold snap – to climate change, it is equally difficult to blame an MME on global warming. But what can be said with confidence is that the sorts of extreme weather events linked to MMEs – such as the temperature and humidity rise that nearly wiped out the saiga – will become more frequent.
Australians know all about extreme weather. While much of Europe and North America has endured a bitter start to the year, the Australian summer has been a scorcher. In January, temperatures in Sydney topped 47C, the city’s highest since 1939. The toll on wildlife has been devastating. As the mercury rose, corpses of critically endangered flying foxes – or fruit bats – began to pile up under the trees in New South Wales. Horrified wildlife campaigners at one colony in Campbelltown, south of Sydney, discovered 400 dead bats. Some were still hanging from trees. Many were babies, abandoned by their parents in their own desperate search for shade.
Flying foxes are well adapted to normal Australian summers. But above 40C, they are unable to regulate their body temperature and can die from overheating. This year’s deaths were grim enough, but they were dwarfed by the MME of 2014, when at least 45,000 flying foxes were killed on one hot day in south-east Queensland. Some colonies had more dead bodies than living bats. Their corpses were piled thick on the ground as the three species there – the black, little red and grey-headed – were hit.
Events like the disaster that struck the flying foxes and saiga appear to be growing in number. The most thorough study of its kind published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2015 uncovered 727 accounts of MMEs involving 2,407 animal populations since 1940. It found that not only are reports of MMEs on the increase – by about one event a year – but the number of animals killed in each event is on the rise for birds, fish and marine invertebrates.
Adam Siepielski, an evolutionary ecologist at the University of Arkansas and a co-author of the paper, became fascinated by the phenomena after hearing a radio report of millions of sardines and anchovies dying. “These reports of MMEs are probably underestimates in terms of occurrence and sheer magnitude,” he says. “There is additionally a challenge in trying to understand whether this increased occurrence is a real event, or whether there are more people observing these things and [they are] more likely to report them. We call this the epidemic of awareness.”
The study found that disease was the biggest factor in MMEs, playing a role in a quarter of them. Around 19% were directly linked to human behaviour such as pollution. Factors linked directly to climate – including extremes of hot and cold, oxygen stress and starvation – collectively contributed to about a quarter.
Untangling the causes – and working out the role of climate change in MMEs is difficult. “In many cases, there are multiple stressors – such as, in the case of the saiga, a low-lying bacterial infection, slightly higher humidity and higher temperatures,” says Siepielski.
“There are some mass mortality events linked directly to extreme heatwaves or cold snaps. In other cases there could be indirect changes, where shifts in temperature cause diseases to be more common and which lead to an MME.”
That kind of temperature-related outbreak is now thought to lie behind one of the biggest die-offs ever observed in the natural world, in which hundreds of millions of starfish off the west coast of America began to “melt” into white gloop. More than 20 species of starfish along the coast from Mexico to Alaska were hit by the sea star wasting disease, a condition caused by a parvovirus – the group of viruses that cause gastrointestinal problems in animals. The virus left the starfish vulnerable to bacterial infection. Within one or two weeks of infection, white cuts appeared on their bodies and the creatures became listless. Some ripped off their infected arms and tried to walk away. But for most the disease was deadly. Like the bacteria that triggered the MME in saiga, the virus appears to have been present in starfish for decades – if not longer. Samples stored in museums since the 1940s tested positive.
An MME can push a species closer to extinction. But it can also have knock-on effects elsewhere in the fragile food web. In tidal pools on the west coast, where once there was a healthy mix of species, mussels – food for starfish – are starting to dominate. Off California, another source of starfish food, sea urchins, are also on the rise – causing a fall in the availability of kelp, the sea urchins’ main food source. That decline could hit species that depend on it for shelter, food and protection.
A paper published last year in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society concluded that the die-off was probably linked to warmer seas. The team, led by Morgan Eisenlord at Cornell University, looked at the links between ocean temperatures and disease in the most common species on the west coast, the ochre sea star, as well as testing the effects of warmer water in the lab. Warmer than usual water didn’t just put the starfish under stress, it also made infectious agents more prevalent, they concluded.
Kock is confident that climate change will lead to more MMEs – pushing vulnerable species closer to extinction and altering the food web. He believes that conservationists should be on the lookout for other mortality events in species such as reindeer and elk. “The tragedy is, we will probably see more events like the event that affected the saiga,” he says. “Evolution takes millions of years and if we have a shift in environmental conditions, everything that’s evolved in that particular environment is under different pressures. Microbes adapt and can respond to changes quickly, but mammals take hundreds of thousands of years or millions of years to adapt. That’s the real worry.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/25/mass-mortality-events-animal-conservation-climate-change

The modern version involves pumping large amounts of water down a well at high pressure, along with sand and chemicals that make up a tiny fraction of the volume. Together, this “stimulation fluid” fractures the rock and releases the gas or oil, which flows to the surface. The hole drilled for a well is about the size of a manhole cover.
As the UK industry body explains, the sand is there to keep fractures in the rock open. The chemicals are included for several purposes, such as lubrication and keeping bacteria out.
The other big technological development that has made fracking economical is horizontal drilling. This means that several horizontal boreholes can be drilled off one well, like tributaries off a river, maximising the amount of oil and gas that can be recovered. This spring, either Third Energy in North Yorkshire or Cuadrilla in Lancashire will become the first company to frack in the UK since 2011.
Fracking can also be undertaken on a well that has already been drilled and for which conventional techniques were unable to extract more hydrocarbons.
What chemicals are used?Under UK regulations, operators have to submit a list of the chemicals they will use to the Environment Agency, or they will be refused consent. In the UK, one of the most commonly used chemicals is diluted hydrochloric acid. A government expert told the Guardian that in the case of a leak, the risk from the chemicals used is “very low”. In the US, the Environmental Protection Agency found a median of 14 chemicals for each sample it took. The most common were methanol (an alcohol), hydrochloric acid, and hydrotreated light petroleum distillates (a combination of hydrocarbons). 
Shale formations will be fractured at depths of more than 1km below the surface in the UK, after new regulations were introduced in 2015. The Kirby Misperton one, for example, is about 3,000m deep.
Who pioneered fracking?Fracking transformed the US energy landscape, putting the country on course to becoming a net exporter of oil after output declined over the last three decades of the 20th century. That trajectory means it is now starting to create similar shockwaves globally.
The modern version of fracking came of age in the late 1990s, unlocking oil and gas reserves across more than 20 US states. As a result, US oil production has increased faster than at anytime in the country’s history, dwarfing the giddy days of the country’s black gold rush in the 19th century. About half of US crude now comes from fracking. 
The boom has also been a boon for US householders, who have enjoyed falling gas prices to heat their homes and stable wholesale electricity prices. Around two-thirds of the country’s gas is produced by fracking.
The US now has so much oil and gas that it has dropped a decades long embargo on exports and is looking to step up shipments.
Dr Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, said the US is on course to become the world’s undisputed oil and gas growth story – and it’s because of fracking.
“What is happening in the US between now and 2025 [is] a huge expansion of oil production, about 80% of the global oil production growth comes from the US. It exceeds the huge expansion of Saudi Arabia which we witnessed in the 1960s and 70s,” he told the Guardian.
Where else is fracking taking place?For several years, Europe was talked up as a new frontier for shale exploration. Poland was seen as one of the most promising prospects, attracting US companies such as Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Exxon, as Warsaw hoped to ease its reliance on Russian gas. But the geology did not prove as promising as hoped and, one by one, companies pulled out. A similar pattern occurred in Romania.
Other European countries have gone further and banned fracking: France, Germany and Ireland have all imposed moratoriums. 
Despite bans in every part of the UK apart from England, the country now stands as one of the last parts of Europe where fracking firms are still actively drilling and hoping to frack.
While no well has been fracked since 2011 due to a moratorium, regulatory changes and planning delays, at least three sites look likely to be fracked in 2018. 
But even that new wave of activity looks fragile, with the sector at risk from any change in government. The SNP banned fracking in Scotland, while the 2017 election manifestos of Labour, the Liberal Democrats and Greens all promised fracking bans. 
The governing Conservative party still officially backs fracking, but has lately been much quieter in its support, with some MPs even questioning if there is still a need for it, and Conservative-controlled local authorities rejecting shale drilling applications. 
The right geology is key to success. The British Geological Survey found the best shale oil prospects are in southern England, in the Weald Basin between the North and South Downs. For gas, the group said the best resource appears to be in the Bowland shale, which stretches beneath much of Lancashire and Yorkshire.
On the other side of the world, the industry has largely stalled in Australia. 
Concerns over scarce water supplies have seen five of the country’s eight states and territories essentially temporarily banning fracking. The federal government wants to see the bans dropped, but polls have found 49% of Australians support the fracking ban in their state, compared to 24% against it.
Elsewhere in the southern hemisphere, South Africa and Argentina have both been eyed by fracking companies. But, as in many other parts of the world, neither country is yet to see a serious exploration and appraisal phase.
Why is fracking so controversial?The UK government has repeatedly said that fracking can be done safely and without harming the environment or human health, so long as it is properly regulated. New rules mean that companies have to closely monitor and report seismic activity, as well as potential water and air pollution.
But that’s not been the case throughout fracking’s history, particularly during some of the ‘wild west’ years when it grew rapidly in the US. 
Water contamination has been one of the biggest environmental concerns and where some of the most egregious incidents have occurred. A years-long piece of research by the US Environmental Protection Agency concluded in 2016 that in some cases fracking had harmed drinking water supplies. 
Most of the cases of water pollution in the US have involved boreholes that were not built properly, or mishandling of wastewater. Images of burning taps in the 2010 documentary Gasland arguably turbocharged the anti-fracking movement in the US, even though cases of gas contaminating water supplies have been hard to prove. 
What are the other concerns?Earthquakes caused by hydraulic fracturing have been another big concern. While the two earthquakes in 2011 that led to the UK’s fracking moratorium were both ranked minor on the Richter scale, the US has experienced much stronger ones. In Oklahoma, experts have reported a millennium’s worth of quakes in two years because of fracking there.
Other local concerns listed by fracking critics include industrialisation of rural areas, noise from lorries and the air pollution impact from flaring, when excess gas is burned off.
The big picture issue, of course, is climate change. Fracking advocates have argued the technology is good for global warming because, at least in the US, gas has been displacing coal in the power mix. 
But that coal is usually still burned elsewhere in the world, meaning fracking is simply adding to fossil fuel supplies – and the stock of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. 
The UK government was warned last year by its climate advisers that, without stricter rules, fracking on a large scale would bust the country’s legally-binding carbon targets.
It is this combination of local and global concerns that has galvanised a vocal, well-organised anti-fracking movement, including public figures such as author Naomi Klein and actor Mark Ruffalo.
What does the future hold?After years of delays, whether fracking in the UK ever takes off remains to be seen, but industry claims America’s continued progress will help them. UK-based iGas, which plans to frack one well and drill several others in 2018, told the Guardian it is taking advantage of advances in technology made in the US.
In the short term, fracking looks likely to stay as a largely American story, unless China decides to seriously invest in extracting its vast shale gas reserves, which are estimated to eclipse those in the US.
“What is happening in the US is all driven by the shale revolution,” said Birol. That revolution will have profound ramifications around the world for years to come, from Europe’s reliance on Russian gas to US foreign policy and headaches for the oil cartel, Opec.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/feb/26/fracking-the-reality-the-risks-and-what-the-future-holds

BQEND
Actually most of the cities claiming 100% renewable electricity are using hydro or geothermal, so they have a reasonable claim.
But you are right, the article is disingenuous. Firstly it gives the impression that the growth in the number of cities reporting high usage of renewables is due to new renewables, when it is almost entirely due to existing hydro. i.e. it is mainly due to an increase in reporting rather than an increase in deployment.
Secondly the rep in the article says the report provides a “comprehensive picture of what cities are doing with regards to renewable energy” when, clearly, it is not comprehensive. It only covers a few hundred cities and towns (down to populations of a few thousands) who happen to self-report, so it is obviously far from ""comprehensive"".

Actually the article is about cities, which is why it is under the Cities section.
The article is about the CDP data which includes data about all sources of electricity including renewables, fossil and nuclear. CDP was formerly called the ""Carbon Disclosure Project"". Hence nuclear power should be pertinent.
For some reason you have an obvious chip on your shoulder about nuclear when it comes to comparisons with renewables.
I'm guessing part of the issue is that you are perhaps aware that most of the increase in the number of cities listed as Renewable by CDP is purely due to increased reporting, not increased deployment. A lot of cities have been heavy users of hydro for years but they only reported to CDP last year, 2017. Very little of the addition is due to wind or solar.
Furthermore the survey is almost meaningless because it is a sample of only a few hundred ""cities"" (actually towns are also included) out of a global total of potentially hundreds of thousands.

""The number of cities reporting they are predominantly powered by clean energy has more than doubled since 2015"" then what is the harm in discussing all clean energy sources?
Why the restriction?
Surely you don't maintain that the subject should be censored just because of your personal beliefs?
BQSTART
I have already stated why some technologies come with a price tag and strings that are not justified, and I do not intend to rehearse those arguments again and allow you to de-rail the argument.
BQENDYes, I'm aware that you oppose nuclear - it's not unreasonable to ask why.
Your discomfort or belief is not sufficient a reason to ban the subject.
The UK plan is for renewables supported by nuclear power (instead of gas)Pretending that isn't happening is, at best, perverse.
The solution isn't just 'renewables'
BQSTART
Secondly, an AGW contrarian disagrees with the science of AGW, which any normal person looking through my posting history could see I do not. Instead I promote the science of AGW as being correct and a serious issue for us.
BQENDIndeed - I was hoping you would note that I specifically did not accuse you of being one and went out of my way to make that clear.
My point was that the opposition to solutions to AGW hinder our chances of success -therefore they have the same net effect as people who don't want to address it at all.
BQSTART
Once again with the hobby horse. 
Anyone can read my comments about nuclear power, and as usual your selective memory loss has omitted that I accept nuclear as being part of the mix inevitably. No scientific objection here. Sorry your argument is once again a strawman of your own making.
BQENDSo what exactly is the complaint?
If your argument is contradictory and confusing then that is not my doing.
As far as I can tell all you've done is accept that you've lost the science argument on nuclear, are forced to accept it in the mix, but are now using other objections including, bizarrely, this insistence that it cannot be mentioned in a discussion on renewables.I can only go by what you say - Perhaps it's my loss but I hope you won't take this as an attack on your vanity to admit that I don't 'follow' you or read all of your comments.
BQSTART
There must be a BOGOF offer on straw men today. 
AS I have clearly stated, repeatedly, on an article about renewables, the constant drone of nuclear is an unwelcome distraction.
BQENDInteresting stance - You said you don't oppose nuclear but you oppose mention of it in the same conversation with renewables..

BQEND
Obviously you have different dictionary definitions of ""delivered"" to normal people.
The public transport infrastructure is in place. As in built, delivered, available and being used now. I had a JFDI conversation with people. We spent time and money ensuring everything was AOK including checking deeds, planning issues, HSE and as children are some of the main users looking at child protection issues (one of my councillors is a school governor and trained).
Similarly the business we approved and supported against the planners is restoring the ancient woodland and removing the monoculture larch plantation that had been planted across part of the woodland. They're a third of the way through their programme IIRC, and QUELLE HORROR they're doing it using renewables. Anathema !
The renewables are powering the eco friendly house and study centre they've built to deliver courses on woodland management.
Even the newts are happy - and yes that really was a requirement the planners threw at them.
One of my councillors has a wind turbine on her farm and our plan is to encourage more, and angle for solar panels by default on houses (we can but dream). To get this done in a rural and very conservative (and Conservative) area takes time and effort.
So yes, I've doing my bit.
Meanwhile, nuclear fan boyz flap about and can't deliver to time cost or quality.

Why not? Historically the only way that any country has ever decarbonised electricity is via central govt selection of the technology. (Typically by selecting nuclear & hydro, over coal & gas.)

As soon as you can figure out a way to get price discovery in a way that doesn't introduce all kinds of moral hazard issues, you need to let the world know. As it stands, merit-order pricing is the gold standard.
Wind & Solar always bid at $0; unless they can store the energy(which we are bravely told by some is just around the corner), there's no point doing otherwise. The nature of its supply-demand relationship makes electricity a little bit unique. They could organise amongst themselves to set a floor price, which is cartel-like behaviour and just a bit illegal. Also, in a world where they are the only providers, it's a scheme that lasts all of about 24 hours.

Sounds like a dumb market if it doesn't allow for profit and fixed costs in the bid price. The variable cost of production may be zero but basic economics/pricing theory requires a producer to recover their fixed costs and get a return.

If you have more up to date information about the Riverland solar+battery project, then I'm all ears. Similarly Andy Vesey, the CEO of AGL has tweeted about their Virtual Power Plant once since the announcement last year, and that was to say nice words about the government's plan to build another virtual plant. And which likely makes the AGL one unviable. If not, he should probably say something. Government pulling these random policy rabbits out of the hat tends to upset the private company's carefully thought out plans, and leads to plenty of re-calibration. The press announcements this year so far are largely driven by the state election currently in progress, so 1) everyone is waiting for the dust to settle, to see what really holds up post-election, and 2) more renewables or storage, damages the prospects of existing projects, more than would otherwise be the case through simple competition.
This is the important point: that more of the same, either renewable generation or energy storage, will damage their own economic viability.

We can expand the discussion to include energy storage, but it is ultimately a similar story about the diminishing effectiveness of increasing quantities of a flawed solution. Or in the case of energy storage, band-aid is more accurate. It should be pointed out that there are 2 (two) virtual power plants on the table for South Australia. The first one has gone eerily quiet lately. The boosters of such things need to be concerned. Then there are the big storage projects, announced, but dangerously poised to being mothballed.

BQENDThis response is meaningless, you are copying what others say and not thinking about it.
Whether renewables affects the rate of sea level rise is not simply ""basic physics"" but it depends on how much it impacts the rate of fossil fuel co2 released to the atmosphere.
Deploying large amounts of renewables but simply displacing where the fossil fuels are burnt will have no impact.

Data published on Tuesday by the not-for-profit environmental impact researcher CDP found that 101 of the more than 570 cities on its books sourced at least 70% of their electricity from renewable sources in 2017, compared to 42 in 2015.
Nicolette Bartlett, CDP’s director of climate change, attributed the increase to both more cities reporting to CDP as well as a global shift towards renewable energy.
The data was a “comprehensive picture of what cities are doing with regards to renewable energy,” she told Guardian Cities.
That large urban centres as disparate as Auckland, Nairobi, Oslo and Brasília were successfully moving away from fossil fuels was held up as evidence of a changing tide by Kyra Appleby, CDP’s director of cities.
“Reassuringly, our data shows much commitment and ambition,” she said in a statement. “Cities not only want to shift to renewably energy, but, most importantly – they can.”
Much of the drive for climate action at city level in the past year has been spurred on by the global covenant of more than 7,400 mayors that formed in the wake of Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris accord.
Burlington, Vermont, was the only US city reporting to CDP that sourced all of its power from renewable sources after having fully transitioned in 2015. Research from the Sierra Club states there are five such cities in the US in total.
Burlington is now exploring how to become zero-carbon.
Mayor Miro Weinberger said to CDP that its shift to a diverse mix of biomass, hydro, wind and solar power had boosted the local economy, and encouraged other cities to follow suit. Across the US 58 towns and cities, including Atlanta and San Diego, have set a target of 100% renewable energy.
In Britain, 14 more cities and towns had signed up to the UK100 local government network’s target of 100% clean energy by 2050, bringing the total to 84. Among the recent local authority recruits were Liverpool City Region, Barking and Dagenham, Bristol, Bury, Peterborough, Redcar and Cleveland.
But the CDP data showed 43 cities worldwide were already entirely powered by clean energy, with the vast majority (30) in Latin America, where more cities reported to CDP and hydropower is more widespread.
In the six months to July, Latin American cities reported having instigated $183m of renewable energy projects – less than Europe ($1.7bn) or Africa ($236m). Europe topped the list for projects open for investment, but laid claim to just 20% of the 101 cities to be predominantly powered by clean energy.
The Icelandic capital Reyjkavik, sourcing all electricity from hydropower and geothermal, was among them. It is now working to make all cars and public transit fossil-free by 2040.

I don't expect the two datasets to match perfectly on the rate of sea level rise.
So far, the main component of sea level rise has been caused by thermal expansion.
This will cause a higher rise in the open ocean than at the coast because more energy is being absorbed there, it is not evenly distributed.
It affects the height of the water column at a location, but not the weight, so there is no flow between locations due to this component.

BQENDI disagree with your critique of the comment. Instead of raising the concern about the value of the satellite altimetry readings that were being used as the basis of this analysis, it glossed over the issue by making an aside about the ""certainty of the measurement"".
Hence, given the extent to which the results are in doubt (they are roughly double the rate of sea level rise referred to by Church et al 2011, arrived at by two entirely different means - one of which was the accepted standard method until satellite altimetry apparently was adopted instead), the comment was indeed not ""excellent"", except in the sense that it agreed with some belief that you personally hold.

""Tide gauge data does show the same thing, an increase in the rate of GMSLR over the most recent period. ""
BQENDActually no. Their paper does try to give the nod to the satellite altimetry, but simply does not agree with its results.
And I quote from the Abstract: 
BQSTART
""From 1972 to 2008, the observed sea-level rise (1.8 ± 0.2 mm yr−1 from tide gauges alone and 2.1 ± 0.2 mm yr−1 from a combination of tide gauges and altimeter observations) agrees well with the sum of contributions (1.8 ± 0.4 mm yr−1) in magnitude and with both having similar increases in the rate of rise during the period.""
BQENDWhen this paper came out, the claimed rate of sea level rise from satellite altimetry was 3.3 mm/yr. Not only is this not within a bull's roar (well known scientific term) of the tide gauge result of 1.8 mm/yr, but it also does not correspond with the sum of contributions that the paper identified - which unsurprisingly agreed with the tide gauge results.
So the evidence has been there for some time that satellite altimetry is producing results that are at odds with sea level rise calculated by two independent means.
For normal science this would raise the alarm. But apparently not for the orthodoxy or for ""climate science"".

As the ATL article is about a paper linking an increased GMSLR trend to AGW (It's in the first paragraph) it is entirely relevant to include AGW in the BTL discussion.
Your original assertions of no acceleration in GMSLR trends, and then ongoing ice cap melt need to have Evidence(TM) to support them with mechanisms that do not involve AGW for them to happen.

""The heavier O18 precipitates out at lower latitudes leaving the O16 for the high lattitudes, so, as ice builds up in the polar regions the O18/O16 ratio changes. And glacial coverage is an indicator of temperature.""
First of all, O18 in water doesn't ""precipitate"". However, they key point to understand is that more O18 ends up in ice in warmer conditions because it is easier for the heavier O18 water molecule to evaporate in such conditions, meaning that precipitation will contain a slightly higher proportion of O18. From the article you linked to:
""In fact, it has been shown that a decrease of one part per million 18O in ice reflects a 1.5°C drop in air temperature at the time it originally evaporated from the oceans.""

Did you not bother to read the papers I linked to above? Although there was some warming across the northern hemisphere over the ETCW period, there was a very pronounced warming in the Arctic.

Incorrect.There is no trend of melting ice caps.
The melt of the ice caps at the end of the last glacial period happened ~10,000 years ago, often in geologically abrupt time periods. Since then ice caps have not been melting.

Twentieth-Century Global-Mean Sea Level Rise: Is the Whole Greater than the Sum of the Parts?

BQSTART
In the last two decades, the rate of GMSLR has been larger than the twentieth-century time mean, because of increased rates of thermal expansion, glacier mass loss, and ice discharge from both ice sheets (Church et al. 2011). There may also be increasing contributions to GMSLR from the effects of water resource engineering: groundwater depletion is a positive and increasing term; the contribution from reservoir impoundment was negative in the twentieth century but may now be positive, as existing reservoirs become silted up.

The heavier O18 precipitates out at lower latitudes leaving the O16 for the high lattitudes, so, as ice builds up in the polar regions the O18/O16 ratio changes. And glacial coverage is an indicator of temperature.
""""H2O is evaporated from sea water. The oxygen in the H2O is enriched in the lighter 16O. This H2O condenses in clouds, falling on land as precipitation. Thus, H2O that is part of the terrestrial water cycle is enriched in the light 16O isotope and sea water is enriched in the heavier 18O isotope. Glacial ice is therefore made up primarily of water with the light 16O isotope. This leaves the oceans enriched in the heavier 18O, or “more positive.” During glacial periods, more 16O is trapped in glacial ice and the oceans become even more enriched in 18O. During interglacial periods, O16 melts out of ice and the oceans become less 18O rich, or “more negative” in 18O"""" http://pages.uoregon.edu/rdorsey/geo334/O-isotopes.html

I had never come across the term ""ETCW"" (early twentieth century warming), but it didn't take long to google it (which you could have done rather than expecting me to look into it). I found two papers that shed some light on the subject:
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3402/tellusa.v68.28234
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00382-013-2004-5
It was clearly a temporary warming of the Arctic that appears to have been linked to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), bringing warmer than usual water into the Arctic Ocean, leading to reduced sea ice and hence arctic amplification. In other words, it is an example of natural variability in the climate system and appears to be independent of any external forcing.
As you will see from Figure 1 in the Johannessen et al paper, temperatures in the Arctic had fallen back to pre-ETCW levels by around 1970 and only started rising steeply after around 1990, which is presumably why the EEA report I linked to above showed no loss of ice in Greenland until around 1996.

No Buzz, that's complete nonsense. To be clear, you claimed that sea level has been rising ""ever since"" the last glacial maximum. The term ""ever since"" has a specific definition: it means ""throughout the period since"":
https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/ever_since
Consequently, your assertion was demonstrably false. You had the opportunity to explain that you didn't really mean ""ever since"" but instead you reinforced it by suggesting that KingInYellow would easily be able to find evidence confirming it. So your more recent attempts to claim that you meant something altogether different are not credible. Furthermore, as I also pointed out, making a binary comparison between the last glacial maximum and today and stating the obvious - that sea levels are higher today - has no scientific merit when there is so much more evidence available showing the details of how sea level has changed over the past 2500 years at least and temperature much further back.

As stated previously, your opinion ir irrelevant unless you come up with real scientific Evidence(TM).
The reason that the melt of the ice sheets at the end of the last glacial period is irrelevant is because the mechanisms that caused that melt are not in operation today. 
You have to identify a cause for the current melt that is not linked to AGW to make your claims relevant.
You are persistently failing to do so.

I specified the last 2,000 years as a subset of your 20,000, as we have better records for that period, so it should have been easy for you to show some Evidence(TM) that ice sheets have indeed being progressively melting throughout the last 2,000 years, show a mechanism that is causing that melt, and that the current observed melting is entirely in line with that rate of melt and that mechanism.
You have failed to answer that question.
Normal people know why you are now flailing around and failing to answer any direct questions.
Your original claims that ice sheets have been melting for 20,000 is untenable, as is your claim that there is no acceleration in GMSLR rise.

Now its time for me to ask a few questions here about your statements... Im intruiged by this comment. I did a quick search to find some records for Greenland temperatures, I would assume that is a pretty good indicator or melting, and I find this multiproxy one from 2016..

No Buzz. What counts is what you actually said and whether or not it is supported by the evidence.

Clearly, if you were to draw a graph of sea level with just 2 points on it at 20,000 years ago and today and then joined them with a straight line, you might be able to make it look as though sea level has been rising (and ice retreating) ""ever since"" the last glacial maximum. However, that would be just plain silly when there is clear evidence in the peer-reviewed literature showing that the Holocene optimum was reached at least 5,000 years ago and that the net change since then has been towards lower temperatures, lower sea level and increased ice cover. Indeed, scientists have concluded that the net effect of all the natural forcings in the here and now would be towards a slow cooling trend (and hence falling sea level). So the anthropogenic warming due to greenhouse gases has actually reversed a gradual downward trend in sea level.

Well you see, thats there the problem; i never said 2,000 years, I said 20,000 years - KingYellow decided to throw 2,000 years into the discussion, because he is assuming that i am somehow denying a slowdown in ice sheets melting; and he wants to catch me out, or something i dont know. . But if you look at my original post, to the original comment by Erik - there's nothing wrong with it. 
""and it rises faster when ice sheets retreat, as they are now just beginning to."""" (Erik) was a alarmist comment - and i pulled him up about it..

Incorrect! I'm not implying anything. Rather I'm pointing out what you actually said. You're just obfuscating again.
You are certainly correct in saying that your first reference to the ice sheets retreating was in response to Erik's comment:
""The ocean expands as it warms, and it rises faster when ice sheets retreat, as they are now just beginning to.""
I suspect that Erik was referring to the land ice on Greenland and Antarctica (as opposed to the sea ice in the Arctic). They are obviously important to the subject matter of this article because they increase sea level. This article, referring to a 2015 paper describes the recent history of ice loss in Antarctica:
http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2015/06/30/antarcticas-retreating-ice/
and here's an European Environment Agency report covering both Greenland and Antarctica:
https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/greenland-ice-sheet-3/assessment
Your response to Erik was indeed:
""Ice sheets have been melting for thousands of years.""
That's hardly an accurate representation of the evidence, which is why Franklin Cat questioned it. In response to this you said:
""Oh yeah!! Correction theyve been melting for 20,000.. Youre right.. My bad!!""
Then KingInYellow said:
""I take it you have some scientific Evidence(TM) to back up this claim, and that in particular over the last 2,000 years ice sheets were melting ?""
I'm sure he made this comment mindful of the evidence I have since presented to you, which is why he specified 2000 years. To this request for evidence to back up your assertion, you replied thus:
""Ever since the last glacial maximum (20,000 odd years ago) - sea level has been rising due to melting ice caps and thermal expansion. Do you really need evidence for this? if so, just google - im sure you can work out the correct terms to enter in to find a nice graph ...""

Your example of the CO2 annual cycle is a very poor analogy. Either you're being deliberately obtuse or you aren't as clever as you think. You are missing a key step in the process of ""critical thinking"": scientific reasoning.
In case you hadn't noticed, this is science we're discussing; science is specific and requires careful attention to detail. The reason why I picked you up on your assertion about sea levels rising for 20,000 years is because you were using it as part of an obvious narrative to give the impression that the present sea level rise is nothing unusual. However, when you consider the full picture, your assertion is patently false in every detail.
Empirical physics is sufficient to say that ice will retreat and sea levels rise in response to a warming of the planet. As albedo is a key positive feedback, minimum ice extent should coincide fairly closely with the highest temperatures, but sea level may well lag a little behind...... but certainly not thousands of years!
Evidence from a variety of proxy records show that the mid-Holocene ""optimum"" was reached at least 5000 years ago and that temperatures have declined a little since then:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_climatic_optimum#/media/File:Holocene_Temperature_Variations.png
Certainly, temperatures (and hence sea level) have fluctuated somewhat since this period, but the net direction of travel has been slightly down rather than up. The sea level reconstructions don't go back far enough to make this obvious. However, what is obvious is that the past 200 years have seen a comparatively rapid rise and physics dictates that this will continue unabated for as long as the Earth warms.

Some of the consequences we are familiar with – for instance, rising temperatures, melting ice, and rising sea levels. Scientists certainly want to know how much the Earth has changed, but we also want to know how fast the changes will be in the future to know what the next generations will experience.
One of the classic projections into the future is for sea level rise. It is expected that by the year 2100, the ocean levels will rise a few feet by the end of the century. This matters a lot because globally, 150 million people live within three feet of current ocean levels. We have built our modern infrastructure based on current ocean levels. What happens to peoples’ homes and infrastructure when the waters rise?
But projecting ocean levels into the future is not simple; we need good data that extends back decades to understand how fast the climate is changing. The classic way to measure ocean levels is by using tide gauges. These are placed just offshore, around the globe to get a sense of how the ocean levels are changing. The problem with tide gauges is they only measure water levels at their location, and their locations are always near shore. 
In order to get a better sense of how oceans are changing everywhere, a complementary technology called satellite altimetry is used. Basically, the satellites shoot a radar beam from space to the ocean surface and watch for the reflection of the beam back to space. From this beam, the satellite can calculate the height of the water. Satellites can emit beams continuously as the satellite passes over open oceans, and can gather data far from shorelines. In doing so, they provide the equivalent of a global network of nearly half a million tide gauges, providing sea surface height information every 10 days for over 25 years.
Just recently, in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a paper has been published that collects all the available satellite altimetry data and asks whether the sea level rise is accelerating. The authors of the paper are a well-respected team and include Dr. Steven Nerem from the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) and Dr. John Fasullo, from the National Center for Atmospheric Research. 
The authors collected data from four generations of satellites that have carried out this altimetry task. The most recent satellite is called Jason 3, launched in 2016. The satellites generate the data shown below. While in any given year ocean levels may rise a bit or fall a bit, the authors focused on the long-term trend (the white line). They found that the long-term trend is, indeed, accelerating. The rate of acceleration is approximately 0.084 mm per year per year. That may not sound like much, but were this rate of acceleration to continue (a conservative estimate), the authors project that by the end of the century oceans with rise approximately 65 cm (more than two feet). 
In the study, the authors quantified what was causing the ocean waters to rise. Part of the rise is related to what’s called thermal expansion (warmer water is less dense so it expands). In the past, this was responsible for the majority of sea level rise. More recently, however, melting ice has contributed more and more to sea level rise. As land-based ice melts, the liquid water flows into the oceans and increases the mass of water in the oceans.
The two largest ice sheets (also the two largest contributors to sea level rise) are found on Greenland and Antarctica. There are other sources of melting ice, such as mountain-top glaciers that also are contributing, but the lion’s share of melting contribution is from the Greenland and Antarctica ice sheets.
Is this acceleration very important? Well the authors answer that question. They calculate that the acceleration will cause more than half of the sea level rise that will occur by the year 2100. Right now, sea levels are rising at a rate of about 3 mm per year. If that rate remained constant until the year 2100 (no acceleration), oceans would be about 25 cm higher than they are today. But a continued acceleration would cause a rise of 65 cm. So, this seemingly small acceleration makes a huge impact. 
The authors are careful to note that if anything, their results are conservative. They don’t account for potential catastrophic losses of major ice sheets. Just recently a study appeared that showed an acceleration in land-ice loss from Antarctica. Meanwhile, at the northern tip of our planet, temperatures are soaring. If these trends continue, we may be in store for a rude awakening with a rapid destabilization in a major ice sheet that would have dire implications for coastal communities around the world.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/feb/27/scientists-have-detected-an-acceleration-in-sea-level-rise

BQENDComplete nonsense. That's Tesco thinking, you need 10 varieties of canned tomato before a customer comes through the door. Lidl showed one variety at half the price will outsell it.
EVs at the moment are hampered by not fitting the usage pattern of existing car buyers. THe life of a mid size car has to cope with several phases. Heavy use at the beginning as part of a fleet is going to see range problems. Battery leasing makes lighter use by the second or third owner uneconomic. There is a market for EV but it's a fairly narrow band. They buy new, have a regular commute distance within range and keep up that pattern of use for 6-10 years. 
Charging isn't a problem for most households, two thirds of UK households have a garage or off road parking. Public charging points are only for occasional use, it's far cheaper overnight on the drive and there's no pressure to free the space for the next vehicle.

You've hit the nail on the head here. Problem is not the range of EVs its the woefully slow ability for them to take on charge. Figures are even worse than you think. A modern forecourt pump, delivers fuel at 40 litres a minute. A high speed pump, like they have in motorway services, 80 litres a minute and the pumps used by trucks, delivery diesel at 130 litres per minute. 
So if I want to add 90 miles of range (typical range of an EV) to my old petrol ""gas guzzling"" estate... which does 30 MPG... I need 3 gallons, which rounding up is 15 litres but lets make the maths easy and be kind to the EVs... and go for 20 litres... which will take me 30 seconds to pump at your plane old fashioned petrol station.
If EV manufacturers could make their cars, as efficient as taking on energy as old fashioned petrol cars... everyone would be buying them. Who cares if you have to stop every ninety miles.... if it would only takes 30 seconds to recharge?

Look forward to hearing what car buyers think about this. 
While the range of electric car models available today is pretty small, I suspect perception about charging points is still putting people off (even though are 15,000 in the UK to the 120,000-plus EVs and plug-in EVs).

In all honesty it's not that but just that I'm not interested in EV's just now so am sticking with the combustion engine.
I'm a petrol head so am selfishly enjoying the best of what's on offer until the roar of a straight six/V8 etc. gets consigned to history.
In the interim I'm more likely to move to hybrid but only when car manufacturers actually make something for the enthusiast.

What is shamefully nutty is thinking the makers would avoid a product on which they make a profit. So far no one does, Tesla being the poster child. This is not a 'build it and they will come' business. That's how you go bust. The public is slowly catching on and yes charging stations are spreading. But this is not a burger biz where you try a jalapeno cheddar melt and if it doesn't sell you try something else. The availability of electrics has to lag demand. Apparently the Nissan Leaf is back ordered and GM's Bolt is doing well. But this is not GM's first rodeo with an electric. 
One personal feeling: I would like an electric purely for its fuel savings. To me (not a spring chicken) they have no cool factor beyond the ""look at me I'm different' which IS a factor. I no more want an electric than I want an automatic trans. I like the rumble of the exhaust and the slight vibration as the motor revs. To me a electric sports car is a contradiction. 
OK so maybe I'm a minority, but a car maker has to be very careful about tooling up based on 'cool' because it can sure change fast.

Some motoring groups and insurers have warned over the past year that the number of chargers is putting the switch to electric transport at risk. But an analysis by the Platform for Electromobility – whose 31 members include Tesla, Renault-Nissan, Brussels-based campaign group T&amp;E and industrial groups Siemens and Alstom – found there are already enough points in Europe.
Across the EU, there are about six electric cars for each public charging point, almost twice as many as the 10 cars per point recommended by the European commission. Charging infrastructure is expected to keep pace with the number of electric cars on the road until at least 2020, based on a review of governments’ plans. One fast charger is expected for every 40km of highway by 2020, well ahead of the one per 65km that Brussels wants by 2025.
Greg Archer, one of the authors of the analysis, said: “It is a myth that has been spread by the car industry to create the impression they would love to sell more electric cars but there just isn’t the charging points out there. It’s a smokescreen.”
A sufficient number of public chargers is essential if the electric car market is to grow beyond the early adopters who have access to off-street parking and can charge at home, the group said. Provided governments deliver on their plans, it’s seen as unlikely that there will be a shortfall in public points.
By comparison, carmakers have launched only a small number of fully electric models. There are just 20 battery electric vehicles on sale in Europe against 417 conventional petrol and diesel ones, according to T&amp;E.
Some of the electric models, such as the Opel Ampera-E – known as the Chevy Bolt in the US – are on limited supply and have months-long waiting times.
“The car industry has deliberately suppressed the market for electric cars, which is shameful,” said Archer. 
Next Green Car, an online guide that monitors the electric car market, expects about 13 new fully electric car models in the UK this year. These include the new Nissan Leaf, which is aimed at the mass market, and the high-end Jaguar i-Pace, the British carmaker’s first all-electric vehicle. A further 19 models are expected to go on sale in the UK during 2019.
Experts told MPs on Tuesday that a lack of models was holding back growth in electric cars, but that was likely to change soon.
“The key barriers we’re seeing is the range of vehicles on the market at the moment,” Andrew Benfield, the group director of transportation at the Energy Saving Trust, told the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee.
Mark Squires, the head of the industry group that represents car dealers, said: “There isn’t a broad range of pure electric vehicles available.”
But the choice issue is likely to be addressed in the next two years, MPs were told. “There are some very viable cars coming in the next 18 months,” said Georg Ell, director of western Europe at Tesla. He also confirmed the firm had taken UK orders for its electric semi-truck, which it unveiled last year.
However, Squires said some drivers still believed there were not enough charging points. “There is a perception, it may not be the full reality, that easy charging access is going to be an issue and that is putting consumers off,” he said.
In England, the average driver is four miles from a charging point, in Scotland it is three miles and in Wales it is 12 miles, the Energy Saving Trust has found. 
The worst area is Devon, with an average of 45 miles, and the best is London, with a tenth of a mile in some boroughs. “What we’re seeing is something of a postcode lottery,” said Benfield.
A growing number of energy companies are moving into car charging infrastructure, such as Npower’s German owner, Innogy, and Italy’s Enel, while the UK’s National Grid is in talks with carmakers to build a network of super rapid chargers at motorway service stations.
The car industry rejected the charge it was not making enough electric models available.
“Europe’s auto manufacturers undertake every effort to make e-mobility a success,” said a spokesperson for the European carmakers’ body, the ACEA. “Apart from manufacturing electric vehicles, we also need to consider factors that are beyond the auto industry’s responsibility, such as investments in the necessary recharging infrastructure.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/27/lack-of-models-not-charging-points-holding-back-electric-car-market

Can anyone explain how historically rising CO2 levels always followed rising temperatures rather than preceeding them?
BQEND
Yes.
That's the case in a specific context, which doesn't apply now.
That lag is seen in cores from ice sheets, specifically as glacial stages end, and it's clear the initial warming was due to astronomical cycles.
That warming drove CO2 out of oceans.
This CO2 then boosted the warming - most of the warming that changes glacial stages into interglacials comes from that CO2 in the second phase.
The current situation is different, because most of the extra CO2 now comes from burning carbon-rich fuels.
We're not currently coming out of a glacial stage, and the astronomical cycles are in a different phase at present.
You need to look at different geological contexts.
When igneous activity heated up coal seams in the end-Permian event, the extra CO2 produced by the process caused global warming and ocean acidification. 
There's an interesting paper on that -
""Initial pulse of Siberian Traps sills as the trigger of the end-Permian mass extinction"" - Burgess et al, 2017.
Events like the end-Permian, the PETM, the Toarcian, and the ETM2 are seen in the geochemical record as negative carbon isotope excursions.
Sudden releases of sequestered carbon, always associated with global warming and extinction events of varying severity.
The best outline of what's coming that I've seen is in a particular paper -

I understand the satisfaction in lobbing an ad hominem, but he's correct: It has been observed before. 
That doesn't mean that it can/should be written off as 'climate-as-usual'; but that seemingly 'inconvenient' observation has to be incorporated into a rational discussion.

Now consider Earth's climate history. These curves for global temperature, atmospheric CO2 and sea level were derived from ocean cores and Antarctic ice cores, from ocean sediments and snowflakes that piled up year after year over 800,000 years forming a two-mile thick ice sheet. As you see, there's a high correlation between temperature, CO2 and sea level. Careful examination shows that the temperature changes slightly lead the CO2 changes by a few centuries. Climate change deniers like to use this fact to confuse and trick the public by saying, ""Look, the temperature causes CO2 to change, not vice versa."" But that lag is exactly what is expected. 
09:20Small changes in Earth's orbit that occur over tens to hundreds of thousands of years alter the distribution of sunlight on Earth. When there is more sunlight at high latitudes in summer, ice sheets melt. Shrinking ice sheets make the planet darker, so it absorbs more sunlight and becomes warmer. A warmer ocean releases CO2, just as a warm Coca-Cola does. And more CO2 causes more warming. So CO2, methane, and ice sheets were feedbacks that amplified global temperature change causing these ancient climate oscillations to be huge, even though the climate change was initiated by a very weak forcing.
10:07The important point is that these same amplifying feedbacks will occur today. The physics does not change. As Earth warms, now because of extra CO2 we put in the atmosphere, ice will melt, and CO2 and methane will be released by warming ocean and melting permafrost. While we can't say exactly how fast these amplifying feedbacks will occur, it is certain they will occur, unless we stop the warming. There is evidence that feedbacks are already beginning. Precise measurements by GRACE, the gravity satellite, reveal that both Greenland and Antarctica are now losing mass, several hundred cubic kilometers per year. And the rate has accelerated since the measurements began nine years ago. Methane is also beginning to escape from the permafrost.

Although it could yet prove to be a freak event, the primary concern is that global warming is eroding the polar vortex, the powerful winds that once insulated the frozen north.
The north pole gets no sunlight until March, but an influx of warm air has pushed temperatures in Siberia up by as much as 35C above historical averages this month. Greenland has already experienced 61 hours above freezing in 2018 - more than three times as many hours as in any previous year.
Seasoned observers have described what is happening as “crazy,” “weird,” and “simply shocking”.
“This is an anomaly among anomalies. It is far enough outside the historical range that it is worrying – it is a suggestion that there are further surprises in store as we continue to poke the angry beast that is our climate,” said Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University. “The Arctic has always been regarded as a bellwether because of the vicious circle that amplify human-caused warming in that particular region. And it is sending out a clear warning.” 
Although most of the media headlines in recent days have focused on Europe’s unusually cold weather in a jolly tone, the concern is that this is not so much a reassuring return to winters as normal, but rather a displacement of what ought to be happening farther north.
At the world’s most northerly land weather station - Cape Morris Jesup at the northern tip of Greenland – recent temperatures have been, at times, warmer than London and Zurich, which are thousands of miles to the south. Although the recent peak of 6.1C on Sunday was not quite a record, but on the previous two occasions (2011 and 2017) the highs lasted just a few hours before returning closer to the historical average. Last week there were 10 days above freezing for at least part of the day at this weather station, just 440 miles from the north pole. 
“Spikes in temperature are part of the normal weather patterns – what has been unusual about this event is that it has persisted for so long and that it has been so warm,” said Ruth Mottram of the Danish Meteorological Institute. “Going back to the late 1950s at least we have never seen such high temperatures in the high Arctic.”
The cause and significance of this sharp uptick are now under scrutiny. Temperatures often fluctuate in the Arctic due to the strength or weakness of the polar vortex, the circle of winds – including the jetstream – that help to deflect warmer air masses and keep the region cool. As this natural force field fluctuates, there have been many previous temperature spikes, which make historical charts of Arctic winter weather resemble an electrocardiogram.
But the heat peaks are becoming more frequent and lasting longer – never more so than this year. “In 50 years of Arctic reconstructions, the current warming event is both the most intense and one of the longest-lived warming events ever observed during winter,” said Robert Rohde, lead scientist of Berkeley Earth, a non-profit organisation dedicated to climate science.
The question now is whether this signals a weakening or collapse of the polar vortex, the circle of strong winds that keep the Arctic cold by deflecting other air masses. The vortex depends on the temperature difference between the Arctic and mid-latitudes, but that gap is shrinking because the pole is warming faster than anywhere on Earth. While average temperatures have increased by about 1C, the warming at the pole – closer to 3C – is melting the ice mass. According to Nasa, Arctic sea ice is now declining at a rate of 13.2% per decade, leaving more open water and higher temperatures.
Some scientists speak of a hypothesis known as “warm Arctic, cold continents” as the polar vortex becomes less stable - sucking in more warm air and expelling more cold fronts, such as those currently being experienced in the UK and northern Europe. Rohde notes that this theory remains controversial and is not evident in all climate models, but this year’s temperature patterns have been consistent with that forecast.
Longer term, Rohde expects more variation. “As we rapidly warm the Arctic, we can expect that future years will bring us even more examples of unprecedented weather.” 
Jesper Theilgaard, a meteorologist with 40 years’ experience and founder of website Climate Dissemination, said the recent trends are outside previous warming events. “No doubt these warming events bring trouble to the people and the nature. Shifting rain and snow – melt and frost make the surface icy and therefore difficult for animals to find anything to eat. Living conditions in such shifting weather types are very difficult.”
Others caution that it is premature to see this as a major shift away from forecasts. “The current excursions of 20C or more above average experienced in the Arctic are almost certainly mostly due to natural variability,” said Zeke Hausfather of Berkeley Earth. “While they have been boosted by the underlying warming trend, we don’t have any strong evidence that the factors driving short-term Arctic variability will increase in a warming world. If anything, climate models suggest the opposite is true, that high-latitude winters will be slightly less variable as the world warms.” 
Although it is too soon to know whether overall projections for Arctic warming should be changed, the recent temperatures add to uncertainty and raises the possibility of knock-on effects accelerating climate change. 
“This is too short-term an excursion to say whether or not it changes the overall projections for Arctic warming,” says Mann. “But it suggests that we may be underestimating the tendency for short-term extreme warming events in the Arctic. And those initial warming events can trigger even greater warming because of the ‘feedback loops’ associated with the melting of ice and the potential release of methane (a very strong greenhouse gas).”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/27/arctic-warming-scientists-alarmed-by-crazy-temperature-rises

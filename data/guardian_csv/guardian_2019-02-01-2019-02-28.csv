That's a slightly different approach from the one I suggested of energy in a system, but it's an empirical definition that exists independently of the scale used to measure it.
I think what you're getting at is that this is a property that cannot be measured directly - that's different from saying it doesn't exist. You must see that it is problematic to say the thermometer is the temperature, when different thermometers operate in different ways and give different results. It would be more usual to say that temperature is always expressed in a temperature scale, derived from the thermometric properties of a second material, and it is this being measured rather than temperature directly. That doesn't mean there is some magic identity between the thermometric variable and the temperature - it's just something that responds in a predictable way to temperature. Like oxygen isotopes in snow. ""There is no way to measure temperature directly."" (The Physics Hypertextbook).
This still seems to be a largely semantic issue, and I'm no clearer why you think some thermometric properties can be measured while others cannot, nor why you would not believe a photo of a thermometer. I don't know what you are getting at by ""One would expect a science so concerned with temperature to be a little more rigorous with temperature scales and its measurement"". Who is not concerned? In what way does that impact the science? I don't see what you're saying at all. If you want to say why they're wrong you'd be better doing that than debating the nature of temperature. 
BQSTART
You gave the example of ice core isotope concentrations. Yes, undoubtebly they will vary with temperature, but how? Linearly? Exponentially? by the square power? And is temperature the only variable that the concentration varies with?
BQEND
Do you really think no-one has considered this? Perhaps you think they just assume it's linear? I'm all for challenging science if it's done intelligently. But honestly I don't see how this is better than saying ""geneticists - huh they think they're so clever, but how do genes pass information? Write letters to each other?"".
It beggars belief that you could have any genuine sense of enquiry and not either assume this issue has been explored, or take the moments it would need to answer it yourself. But - assuming good faith - see the explanation at NASA's site, or look up the Meteoric Water Line. Yes there are challenges. There are challenges in any temperature measurement.

A definition of a physical quantity has to be something you can measure. There is little point in defining temperature from the mean translational (in a gas) or vibrational (in a solid) kinetic energy of molecules, it would be impossible to measure. Kelvin actually is temperature, not a measure of it. Any 1st year undergraduate physics text will tell you.
Quoting Celsius temperature implies that you have first measured Kelvin temp. on the CV gas thermometer. Celsius is defined as Kelvin temp. minus 273.15 (the ice point of water), meaning water freezes at 0.01°C.
All other thermometers use the Centigrade scale. This assumes linear variation of the thermometric property and agrees with the Celsius scale at 0 and 100, but may not for intermediate temperatures. There is a different centigrade scale for each individual thermometer. They will nearly agree, but never totally.
One would expect a science so concerned with temperature to be a little more rigorous with temperature scales and its measurement.

There is a relatively straightforward definition of temperature - the internal energy of a system.

But if your view is right, how can a thermometer be temperature, if what it is showing is how a liquid expands with heat? or resistance in a wire increases, or the isotopic mix of oxygen in snow changes? None of those are temperature; they are all, as you say, thermometric properties that are useful because they change proportionally to temperature. 
Anyway, maybe that's still semantics. I'll take your point that an ice core is a photo of a thermometer; a fossil is a photo of a skeleton, but I don't dispute dinosaurs on that basis. Indeed most thermometers now take photos; recording snapshots of the temperature at that time. As all thermometers, like all temperature proxies, rely on thermometric variables, how do you ever know they are accurate without repeated recalibration? 
And of course it is possible to calibrate ice cores; you can measure layers from years within the recorded era, you can measure the isotopic mix in snow falling at different temperatures now, you can check your findings against other proxies. Might there be some other factor that means things happened differently in the past? Maybe. There might be some factor that means modern thermometers operate differently at night. But there's no sign of it, and the physical processes are well constrained. Ice core data tallies well with Milankovitch cycles - it seems surprising that would happen by chance.

Dear Mr President,While many of us disagree on ideology and values, we agree on practical things like obeying the constitution and not letting big corporations and the wealthy run everything.Your 35-day government shutdown was a senseless abuse of power. So too your “national emergency” to build your wall with money Congress refused to appropriate.When you passed your tax bill you promised our paychecks would rise by an average of $4,000 but we never got the raise. Our employers used the tax savings to buy back their shares of stock and give themselves raises instead.Then you fooled us into thinking we were getting a cut by lowering the amounts withheld from our 2018 paychecks. We know that now because we’re getting smaller tax refunds.At the same time, many big corporations aren’t paying a dime in taxes. Worse yet, they’re getting refunds.For example, GM is paying zilch and claiming a $104m refund on $11.8bn of profits. Amazon is paying no taxes and claiming a $129m refund on profits of $11.2bn. (This is after New York offered it $3bn to put its second headquarters there.)They aren’t breaking any tax laws or regulations. That’s because they made the tax laws and regulations. You gave them a free hand.You’re supposed to be working for us, not for giant corporations. But they’re doing better than ever, as are their top executives and biggest investors. Yet nothing has trickled down. We’re getting shafted.Which is why more than 75% of us (including 45% who call ourselves Republicans) support Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s proposed 70% tax on dollars earned in excess of $10m a year.And over 60% of us support Elizabeth Warren’s proposed 2% annual tax on households with a net worth of $50m or more.You’ve also shown you don’t have a clue about healthcare. You promised us something better than the Affordable Care Act but all you’ve done is whittle it back.A big reason we gave Democrats control of the House last November was your threat to eliminate protection for people with pre-existing conditions.Are you even aware that 70% of us now favor Medicare for all?Most of us don’t pay much attention to national policy but we pay a lot of attention to home economics. You’ve made our own home economics worse.We’ll give you official notice you’re fired on 3 November 2020, if not before. Until then, you can keep the house and perks, but you’re toast.Respectfully,America.', u'recommendation_count': u'2', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1551277005000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'we \u2019re getting smaller tax refunds', u'effect': u'we know that now'}, {u'cause': u'they made the tax laws and regulations', u'effect': u'that \u2019s'}], u'author_id': u'17776092', u'id': u'126350042', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'CaptainChien', u'text': u'This is true, but does highlight that it is patterns of consumption and the technologies utilised that are the problem rather than population per se.The cement problem is one that, like all global warming solutions, is a multi facteted one.

I am constantly amazed at how utterly wrong people can be, Clinton brought the budget back to surplus by removing Reagan's absurd ""trickle down"" tax cuts for the top 1%, under Reagan the top marginal rate was 28% and Clinton raised it back up to 39.6%.
BQEND
To me, what hurt the most from Reagan was when he broke the strike by the air traffic controllers. I'm pro union. What Clinton did was significantly more damaging to the working in terms of unions. Forcing the USA into the WTO made the American worker have to compete with lower wages being available to employers in primarily China and India. Most of the factory jobs are now in China and most of the call center jobs are in India. Clinton did that to Joe Sixpack. Ross Perot warned everybody what would happen. I watched hours of Senate Commerce Committee hearings where Ralph Nader was trying to explain to the Senators what he thought was going to happen. My first visit to DC in my life was to protest the entry into the WTO (NAFTA is bad but not nearly projected as being as devastating as the WTO would be).
BTW, the surplus under Clinton was primarily due to taxes being raised to pay for a proposed universal health package that HRC couldn't make fly. Today things are much clearly why universal healthcare didn't make it:  ""It's all about the Benjamins Baby""Nancy Pelosi ordered Omar to apologize, and she did “unequivocally,” having now been educated to these tropes to avoid. The lesson: if you are an elected politician in this country, never associate the votes of your colleagues with money—or at least, never link votes in support of the Israeli government with lobbyists’ dollars. 
This is not a defense to me. What AOC is doing is giving her a backhanded compliment. She is saying what Omar did was wrong, but praising her for being able to apologize. AOC threw Omar under the bus.
Nothing is ever going to get fixed until people start to acknowledge the power the lobbyists have. Campaign Finance Reform never happens because too many members of congress are getting rich because of the way things are.

An open Letter to President Macron from Hansen et al""July 1, 2017Dear President Macron,
We are writing as environmentalists, conservationists and climate scientists to congratulate you on your win in the presidential election, and to applaud your push for a carbon tax. Nobody has done more for advancing clean energy on the grid than France. In light of this knowledge, we are also writing to express our alarm at your decision to move France away from clean nuclear power.
Few nations have done more than France to demonstrate the humanitarian and environmental benefits of creating a high-energy, nuclear-powered, and electrified society. Not only was France host of United Nations climate talks, it also has some of the lowest per capita carbon emissions of any developed nation.
Any reduction in France’s nuclear generation will increase fossil fuel generation and pollution given the low capacity factors and intermittency of solar and wind. Germany is a case in point. Its emissions have been largely unchanged since 2009 and actually increased in both 2015 and 2016 due to nuclear plant closures. Despite having installed 4 percent more solar and 11 percent more wind capacity, Germany’s generation from the two sources decreased 3 percent and 2 percent respectively, since it wasn’t as sunny or windy in 2016 as in 2015.
And where France has some of the cheapest and cleanest electricity in Europe, Germany has some of the most expensive and dirtiest. Germany spent nearly 24 billion euros above market price in 2016 for its renewable energy production feed-in tariffs alone, but emissions have remained stagnant. Germany is set to miss its 2020 emission reduction goals by a wide margin. Despite its huge investment in renewables, only 46 percent of Germany’s electricity comes from clean energy sources as compared to 93 percent in France.
Solar and wind can play an important role in France. However, if France is to make investments in solar and wind similar to those of Germany, they should add to France’s share of clean energy, not inadvertently reduce it. Renewables can contribute to the further electrification of the transportation sector, which France has already done with its trains and should continue to do with personal vehicles.
Shifting from nuclear to fossil fuels and renewables would grievously harm the French economy in three ways: higher electricity prices for consumers and industry, an end to France’s lucrative electricity exports, and — perhaps most importantly — the destruction of France’s nuclear export sector. If the French nuclear fleet is forced to operate at lower capacity factors, it will cripple the French nuclear industry by adding costs and shrinking revenues. Eventually this will lead to poorer safety standards and less opportunities to fund research, development and efforts to export French nuclear technologies. Nations seeking to build new nuclear plants rightly want to know that the product France is selling is one that France itself values.
The French nuclear program has historically been the envy of the world. It demonstrated in the 1970s and 80s that the decarbonization of an industrialized country’s electricity sector is in fact possible. For France, the next necessary step to help combat climate change and improve air quality is to increase clean electricity from all non-fossil sources and massively reduce fossil fuels used in heating and the transportation sector. Nuclear power must play a central role in this.

It matters to me because as I comment on these boards, it isn't always about me. I really do look at the posterity side of things. I'm pushing medicare for all and I admit that is for selfish reasons, but I already signed up for medicare part A.
I'm pushing for space travel. That has nothing to do with me in my 60s. Over population is at the root of the CO2 problem, so no matter how efficient we are, the natural resources of the planet have a limit even if we aren't there yet. Legalized abortion isn't the most moral solution, but it is a solution, none the less. If mankind wasn't confined to this planet, over-population wouldn't be a concern.

Stanford experts reflect on the most destructive fire season in California history 
 

Decades of research show not only that the area burned in the West has been increasing, but also that global warming has been playing a role by increasing the dryness of vegetation on the landscape. The National Climate Assessment that was released by the U.S. government the day after Thanksgiving confirmed this evidence, highlighting that global warming has been responsible for around half of the historical increase in area burned.With regards to the conditions in California over the past few years, it is clear from multiple lines of evidence that California is now in a new climate, in which conditions are much more likely to be hot, leading to earlier melting of snowpack and exacerbating periods of low precipitation when they occur. The net effect is an extension of the fire season and greater potential for large, intense wildfires.""

If I asked you to define temperature, you probably couldn't. It's an extraordinary difficult thing to do, being that for an ideal gas it is actually an unmeasurable quantity (the mean kinetic energy of gas molecules, multiplied by two thirds of the Boltzmann constant).
The actual definition is the ratio of pressures of a fixed mass of gas, at constant volume (a quantity that can be measured) at Kelvin temperature T, to the pressure at the triple point of water multiplied by 273.16 (to give 100 divisions between freezing and boiling water), as measured by a constant volume gas thermometer.
The point is, temperature is the only physical property defined by the instrument that measures it. Hence a thermometer isn't a proxy for temperature, it actually is temperature. The property of the thermometer that changes is called a thermometric property.
A proxy may be thought of as a photograph of a thermometer. There's no way of knowing how it varies with temperature without generating a calibration curve, which would require a calibration curve.

Most recently, California senator Dianne Feinstein, 85, scolded a group of middle-schoolers with the group Youth v Apocalypse, who had joined the Sunrise Movement to call on Feinstein to back a resolution in the Senate supporting a Green New Deal. In a now infamous exchange, Feinstein barked that “I know what I’m doing” and that she has “been doing this for 30 years”, so they better just bugger off and let the adults work. (To be fair, the video was edited to comply with Twitter’s content guidelines. In the full clip she also offers them an internship.)
When Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey introduced their resolution for the Green New Deal, House speaker Nancy Pelosi, 78, off-handedly called it the “green dream or whatever”, before backtracking later in the day and voicing support for the enthusiasm of the idea – just not the resolution itself. Months earlier, Congressman Frank Pallone, 67, battled Ocasio-Cortez’s resolution to create a select committee on the Green New Deal based on unfounded, territorial fears that it would undermine the authority of his prized energy and commerce committee.
Former Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen, 72, recently told the Financial Times the Green New Deal was simply too expensive to work, joining a record number of economists in backing a modest carbon tax as the more “feasible” and “sensible” option. New York Times columnist Gail Collins, 72, mused that Green New Deal campaigners would be better off sticking to “one really important climate-control thought”, perhaps – she spitballed – wind power: “If the country really threw itself into wind power, we could, er, breeze toward our goals on that alone.”
None of these figures deny climate change in the conventional sense of spouting junk science from rightwing thinktanks. They have all agreed publicly and even forcefully that climate change is a pressing issue, and that human activity is its cause. Several have been vocal advocates for climate action of one sort or another. But none have proposed a workable alternative to the economy-wide mobilization the Green New Deal sets out to accomplish, to rapidly electrify the American economy and reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2030. Details still need to be worked out on that plan, of course. But it remains the only idea on the table even remotely approaching the “wartime footing” climate scientists are increasingly insistent is necessary to avert catastrophe.
The kids, in other words, are right. They will also be the ones forced to live with the consequences of the choices politicians make in the next several years. That’s not an unfamiliar dynamic in climate politics. Residents of climate vulnerable nations who are already dealing with rising tides and temperatures have long been the ones pushing for the most ambitious action at the international level, chanting “1.5 to survive” through the halls of UN climate talks. Communities in the US forced to live with the health impacts of extraction – from Houston to the Bay Area – have for years sought an end to the drilling that’s threatening to cook us. As they have in the last few weeks, adults in the room – whether US negotiators at the UN or big beltway conservation organizations – have in each case offered sage counsel: be realistic!
Yet realism on climate means something different than it did even a decade or two ago, when a modest carbon tax and a smattering of tax credits might have gotten the job done. As the IPCC noted in its latest report, avoiding climate breakdown at this point will mean a “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society”, including massive investments in renewable energy and new technology and going to war with the world’s most powerful industry, fossil fuels.
Thankfully, Sunrise, Ocasio-Cortez and other Green New Deal advocates are updating our shared definition of what being realistic in a climate-changed 21st century looks like. The adults in the room would do well to listen.

The 16-year-old welcomed the huge mobilisation planned in the UK, which follows demonstrations by tens of thousands of school and university students in Australia, Belgium, Germany, the United States, Japan and more than a dozen other countries.
“I think it’s great that England is joining the school strike in a major way this week. There has been a number of real heroes on school strike, for instance in Scotland and Ireland, for some time now. Such as Holly Gillibrand and the ones in Cork with the epic sign saying ‘the emperor is naked’,” she told the Guardian.
With an even bigger global mobilisation planned for 15 March, she feels the momentum is now building.
“I think enough people have realised just how absurd the situation is. We are in the middle of the biggest crisis in human history and basically nothing is being done to prevent it. I think what we are seeing is the beginning of great changes and that is very hopeful,” she wrote.
Thunberg has risen rapidly in prominence and influence. In December, she spoke at the United Nations climate conference, berating world leaders for behaving like irresponsible children.
Last month, she had similarly harsh words for the global business elite at Davos. She said: “Some people, some companies, some decision-makers in particular, have known exactly what priceless values they have been sacrificing to continue making unimaginable amounts of money. And I think many of you here today belong to that group of people.”
The movement she started has morphed and grown around the world , and, at times, linked up with older groups, including Extinction Rebellion, 350.org and Greenpeace.
Next week she will take the train – having decided not to fly due to the high carbon emissions of aviation – to speak at an event alongside Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, in Brussels, and then on to Paris to join the school strikes now expanding in France.
Veteran climate campaigners are astonished by what has been achieved in such a short time. “The movement that Greta launched is one of the most hopeful things in my 30 years of working on the climate question. It throws the generational challenge of global warming into its sharpest relief, and challenges adults to prove they are, actually, adults. So many thanks to all the young people who are stepping up,” said Bill McKibben, the founder of 350.org.
Around the world, so many student strikes are now taking place or planned that it is becoming hard to keep up. On Twitter, a supporter who posts under the name The Dormouse That Roared, has compiled a Google map that pins all the reported or announced locations, stretching from Abuja and Bugoloobi to Sacramento and Medellín. “This is not perfect by any means. It’s an emergency after all,” the online campaigner told the Guardian.
The most recent version shows thick clusters of activity, particularly in the UK and northern Europe. “#climatestrike. The house is on fire. Just wow!” wrote @dormouseroared, who is also collecting the different terms for “climate strike” in different languages.
In reply, people on Twitter have written, “I’ve been dreaming of this”, “Power to the children”, “beautiful” and simply “hope”.
Australia was one of the first countries to mobilise. Last November, organisers estimate 15,000 students went on strike. Last Friday, students lobbied outside the offices of the opposition party. On 1 March, they will target the federal treasurer’s office. Two weeks later, they will join the global strike.
They are demanding immediate political action to stop the Adani coalmine in Queensland, and a switch from fossil fuels to 100% renewable energy.
On Thursday, three student activists from Castlemaine in Australia – Callum Bridgefoot, 11; Harriet O’Shea Carre, 14 and Milou Albrechy,14 – spoke with the leader of the opposition in the federal parliament. “It’s a good sign that he is willing to meet,” they said. “The prime minister condemned the strike.”
The resources minister Matt Canavan was still more hostile, saying students would be better off learning about mining and science. “These are the type of things that excite young children and we should be great at it as a nation,” he told a local radio station. “The best thing you’ll learn about going to a protest is how to join the dole queue.”
In Belgium, there have been strikes by thousands of students for at least four consecutive weeks, with one now-famous placard – addressed to politicians and policymakers – reading: “I’ll do my homework when you do yours.”
More than 3,000 scientists have given their backing to the strikes. The Belgian government is clearly feeling the pressure. The environment minister was forced to resign after falsely claiming the country’s intelligence services held evidence that the striking children were being directed by unnamed powers. The allegation was quickly contradicted by intelligence chiefs.
Switzerland has seen some of the biggest actions. Local activists said 23,000 joined the strike on 18 January, followed by 65,000 on 2 February. They too are preparing for the global demonstration on 15 March. They want the government to immediately declare a climate state of emergency, implement policies to be zero-carbon by 2030 without geo-engineering, and if necessary move away from the current economic system.
Activists said they want to make clear that the problem is systematic rather than a matter of individual lifestyle choices. They have been criticised by right-wing politicians, but local governments have met student delegations to discuss short-term steps, such as a ban on any school trip that involves a flight. One regional authority has declared its support for the student movement. In an election year, state leaders have also expressed guarded support.
“For the moment, the government has reacted in a very paternalistic way. They say that it’s a good sign that the youth is demonstrating for its future but they don’t really do anything about it,” said Thomas Bruchez, a 20-year-old student at the University of Geneva. In two weeks, he said the organisers will prepare for the next nationwide strike, when they will consider how to involve workers and try to define more precise claims, such as free public transport financed by highly progressive taxes.
In Germany, activists told the Guardian there are mobilisations every week. Last Friday, there were 20,000 students striking in 50 cities. On 18 January, there were 30,000. And there will be another strike this Friday in at least 30 cities.
The global strike on 15 March is expected to be the biggest yet with mobilisations in 150 cities. “It is not acceptable that grown-ups are destroying the future right now,” said Jakob Blasel, a high-school student. “Our goal to stop coal power in Germany and fossil energy everywhere.” He said politicians have expressed admiration for their campaign, but this has not translated into action. “This is not acceptable. We won’t stop until they start acting.”
Until now 75% of the participants have been schoolchildren but increasing numbers of university students are joining. Luisa Neubauer, a 22-year-old, was among those invited to talk to senior cabinet officials. She told the German minister of economy that he was part of the problem because he was working for industry, rather than for people or the planet.
“What we need our politicians and our government to understand is that everything they do today comes at a price for future generations,” she said. “We are not doing this for fun, but because we don’t have a choice.”
But she too noted a new direction in the national discussion. “There is a debate now about climate and the environment, which is good. People for the first time in years are not talking about refugees but talking about the environment.” ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/15/the-beginning-of-great-change-greta-thunberg-hails-school-climate-strikes

The study says the combination of global warming, soil infertility, pollinator loss, chemical leaching and ocean acidification is creating a “new domain of risk”, which is hugely underestimated by policymakers even though it may pose the greatest threat in human history.
“A new, highly complex and destabilised ‘domain of risk’ is emerging – which includes the risk of the collapse of key social and economic systems, at local and potentially even global levels,” warns the paper from the Institute for Public Policy Research. “This new risk domain affects virtually all areas of policy and politics, and it is doubtful that societies around the world are adequately prepared to manage this risk.”
Until recently, most studies of environmental risk tended to examine threats in isolation: climate scientists examined disruption to weather systems, biologists focused on ecosystem loss and economists calculated potential damages from intensifying storms and droughts. But a growing body of research is assessing how the interplay of these factors can create a cascade of tipping points in human society as well as the natural world.
The new paper – This is a Crisis: Facing up to the Age of Environmental Breakdown – is a meta-study of dozens of academic papers, government documents and NGO reports compiled by IPPR, a leftwing thinktank that is considered an influence on Labour policy.
The authors examine how the deterioration of natural infrastructure, such as a stable climate and fertile land, have a knock-on effect on health, wealth, inequality and migration, which in turn heightens the possibility of political tension and conflict.
The paper stresses the human impacts go beyond climate change and are occurring at speeds unprecedented in recorded history.
Evidence on the deterioration of natural systems is presented with a series of grim global statistics: topsoil is now being lost 10 to 40 times faster than it is being replenished by natural processes; the 20 warmest years since records began in 1850 have been in the past 22 years; vertebrate populations have fallen by an average of 60% since the 1970s, and insect numbers – vital for pollination – have declined even faster in some countries.
These processes amplify and interact with existing social and economic problems, potentially threatening systemic collapse similar to the 2008-9 financial crisis. Back then, a subprime mortgage crisis in the US exposed excessive risk-taking and triggered a global panic and the deepest recession since the 1930s. The IPPR study envisages a similar breakdown could occur if the US suffers relentlessly worsening damage from hurricane floods and forest fires, which would prompt a rush of insurance claims and threaten the viability of financial institutions.
“In the extreme, environmental breakdown could trigger catastrophic breakdown of human systems, driving a rapid process of ‘runaway collapse’ in which economic, social and political shocks cascade through the globally linked system – in much the same way as occurred in the wake of the global financial crisis of 2007-08,” the paper warns.
There are other potential cascades. The paper warns of the vulnerability of food systems that rely on just five animal and 12 plant species to provide 75% of the world’s nutrition. The lack of diversity weakens resilience to the growing risks of climate disruption, soil deterioration, pollution and pollinator loss. Previous research – cited by the IPPR – estimates a one-in-20 chance per decade of a simultaneous failure of maize production in the US and China, which provide 60% of the global supply.
Migration is also likely to increase as a result of longer droughts and more extreme heat, particularly in the Middle East and central and northern Africa.
Laurie Laybourn-Langton, the lead author of the report, said the climate crisis was likely to create 10 times more refugees from that region than the 12 million who left during the Arab spring.
“There would be repercussions in Europe. Rightwing groups use the fear of migration, as we saw during the EU referendum in Britain,” he said. “What is that going to look like when far more people are forced from homes due to environmental shocks? What does that mean for political cohesion.”
Several other recent interdisciplinary studies have highlighted the dangers of mutually reinforcing impacts. In December, the authors of a paper published in Science warned the risks were far greater than assumed because 45% of tipping points were interrelated and could amplify one another. Last August, scientists warns these domino effects could push the Earth into an almost uninhabitable “hothouse state”.
Studies of financial and social tipping points are scarcer, but concern is growing. Last month, the top three global risks identified by the World Economic Forum were extreme weather, climate policy failure and natural disasters. Water shortages, accelerating biodiversity loss and large-scale involuntary migration also ranked in the top 10.
“Of all risks, it is in relation to the environment that the world is most clearly sleepwalking into catastrophe,” its annual risk report warns. “The results of climate inaction are becoming increasingly clear. The accelerating pace of biodiversity loss is a particular concern.”
The IPPR report, which launches a wider 18-month project on this topic, urges policymakers to grapple with these risks as a priority, to accelerate the restoration of natural systems, and to push harder on the “green new deal” transition towards renewable energy. In particular, it says, “the younger generations will need help in finding the energy and a sense of control that often eludes them as they begin to realise the enormity of inheriting a rapidly destabilising world”.
Wider discussion is the first step, according to Laybourn-Langton, who said he was shocked by the paucity of public debate relative to the scale of the problems.
“People are not frank enough about this. If it is discussed at all, it is the sort of thing mentioned at the end of a conversation, that makes everyone look at the floor, but we don’t have time for that now,” he said. “It’s appearing more in media, but we are not doing enough.”

Trade unionists and industry leaders will come together with academics, engineers and public institutions to build detailed regional plans setting out the challenges and opportunities ahead.
The proposal, due to be outlined on Wednesday by Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, will involve a national call for evidence and a series of regional events to build “a detailed action plan” to maximise the benefits of moving to a zero-carbon future.
“A decade of austerity and decades of neoliberalism have left many in our country asking: what is Britain for?” Long-Bailey told the Guardian. “This has been brought into focus by the government’s handling of Brexit, which is at its core deeply pessimistic, with nothing to say about the future.”
She said a future Labour government would oversee an economic revolution to tackle the climate crisis, using the full power of the state to decarbonise the economy and create hundreds of thousands of green jobs in struggling towns and cities across the UK.
“We believe that together, we can transform the UK through a green jobs revolution, tackling the environmental crisis in a way that brings hope and prosperity back to parts of the UK that have been held back for too long.”
Last year a UN report said there were only 12 years left to avoid the worst impacts of climate breakdown. And this week a report said insects were facing extinction, threatening a “catastrophic collapse of nature’s ecosystems”, and another said climate change posed a “systemic risk” to the economy and society.
Labour’s pitch echoes the Green New Deal that is gaining ground in the US, backed by leftwing Democrats such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders.
Long-Bailey said Labour was determined to move beyond rhetoric about a green revolution and work out exactly how that could be achieved, and how it could translate to new well-paid, unionised jobs across the UK.
“We’re launching an unprecedented call for evidence about what this means for your town, your city, your region,” she said. “We want to bring unions, industry, universities, the public sector and others together to build this vision out into a practical reality.”
Labour says a key plank of its plan will be to ensure a “just transition” to high quality green jobs for those currently working in carbon-emitting industries. To do that it will have to persuade its trade union backers, who represent people in high-carbon industries, that there is a viable economic alternative.
The party hopes that once the evidence has been collected it will form the basis of a green paper to be published in autumn 2019 at party conference, with plans for how each region might move to a decarbonised future.
Long-Bailey told the Guardian last year that the climate crisis was “incredibly dangerous” and said the UK’s entire society and economy needed to be refocused to meet the looming challenge.
She said Tuesday’s announcement was a key step to realising that ambition. “This is not a blithe promise,” she said. “This is about the jobs at the end of your road. From the Clyde to the Humber to the Mersey. This about our future.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/12/labour-plan-decarbonise-uk-green-jobs-climate-crisis

I’ve written a multimedia saxophone concerto challenging society’s ideas of femininity, I’ve written about anorexia, and I’ve tackled female boxing (which meant learning to box). My newest work is no different. I need to feel a sense of ownership and visceral experience of whatever it is that I’m writing about, so for a project focusing on climate change, it felt essential to find a way to get to the remotest and most untouched part of our planet – Antarctica.
For many of us living in urban environments, it’s difficult to understand the closeness that we can have to the environment. I wanted to travel to one of the most extreme parts of the world, a place almost as intangible and alien to the majority of the world’s population as climate change itself, and create a video and orchestral piece that gives people a sense of the absolute beauty and incredible nature of Antarctica, so that they will hopefully be more active in how they think about our planet.
My initial intention was to create a work that focused entirely on the Antarctic, but, as so often happens, my intentions were altered by the experience itself, and my composition became about the extraordinary voyage as much as the continent itself. In January 2018, I flew from London to Buenos Aires, then down to Ushuaia – fin del mundo – and from there I sailed across the Drake Passage down to the Antarctic peninsula. The crossing depends on the winds, but it’s roughly one week each way. We then spent two weeks sailing around the peninsula.
Sailing on the Bark Europa, a square-rigged tall ship, comes with the obligatory duties of being on watch. Essentially four hours on, eight hours off. (The main crew has a much more gruelling schedule of four hours on, four off.) Whatever the weather, this means getting up at midnight, 4am or 8am, clambering up the stairs to the deck and then being thrown into the elements. Climbing the rigging, hanging over the yards, steering on the helm, hauling ropes, watching out for icebergs was all part of the experience. All while wearing several layers of clothing that you have struggled into in the dark (not wanting to wake your fellow crew members), topped off with a safety layer in the form of a climbing harness, to ensure that the humungous waves crashing over the already severely heeling ship don’t throw you overboard.
Sailing across the Drake Passage was an exhilarating, exhausting and bitterly cold eight days. I’m an experienced sailor and was prepared for all of the above, but not for the sea sickness. I’ve never suffered from it before and was confident that I would be one of the lucky passengers who made it through without any tummy issues. I was wrong. I will never forget leaning over the side, while simultaneously trying to keep us on course at the helm in pitch-black darkness with sideways rain and the fear that the ship might capsize at any moment. This was one of the most exciting and awful moments of my life. How could it not become a part of the piece?
Gradually more and more icebergs started to appear and the ocean was getting calmer – signs that we were nearing the peninsula. The first time we stepped on land was at Deception Island. It was overwhelmingly beautiful.
But, before you step anywhere there, you have to place your boots in a bright pink antibacterial bath to ensure you don’t contaminate the habitat (and again when you come back on board the ship as well, so as not to contaminate subsequent sites). The shoreline was covered in thousands of penguins – mainly chipstrap penguins – accompanied by small groups of Weddell seals and a huddle of grunting young male elephant seals. I immediately started recording.
The initial excitement had temporarily clouded my other senses, but unfortunately my nose soon started working and I realised I was surrounded by the very potent, unpleasant smell of penguin poo. The stench followed us everywhere from that moment on until we returned to Tierra del Fuego.
Visiting Antarctica was an experience that will inform all of my future decisions about the way that I live my life
For me, there were three sound worlds. The first was the dry silence, particularly when we were drifting through the Lemaire Channel. The second was the the sound of the most active penguin colonies, the deafeningly loud constant barking alongside all their other sounds – exclamations, cries, squeaks and strange grunting. The third was the ice. I became obsessed with the variety of crackling, sizzling and fizzing qualities of the brash ice on the ocean’s surface.
All these elements became a significant part of the final work, through the audio recordings I made as well as through more expressionist interpretations. One challenge was the strange, eerie silence of Antarctica when we were anchored offshore surrounded by slow moving white giants of ice. I struggled for a long time with how to recreate this feeling through sound, finally landing on crystal singing bowls. Their pure, glass-like pitch with its seemingly never-ending resonance captured the sensation of the atmosphere during these moments of silence.
Unfortunately, there was also something else that intermittently decorated the landscape – human rubbish. Not left by tourists, but rubbish from around the world that had travelled on the ocean currents and washed up on these remote shores. Plastic microwave tubs, hairbrushes, straws, tin cans ... It was hugely distressing, but it also made me so angry to see the lack of care we have for the present and future of our planet.
Visiting Antarctica was an experience I will carry with me for ever, and one that will inform all my future decisions about the way that I live my life. But how could I process and communicate this in a piece of music? I didn’t want to shout at my audience and tell them what they should or should not do. Making a work that is in some way a political or social commentary is about probing and provoking questions, not necessarily about expressing demands or solutions.
I decided to give human form to things. In a variety of costumes I embody the fossil fuel frenzy, a futuristic weather woman, or, with a large Earth on my head and a gas mask, the barely surviving planet itself. The final third of the work uses satire, science and melting ice (projected on to a large screen from an on-stage blue box containing large melting ice cubes) in an attempt to communicate the severity of our environmental crisis. It’s as intense, guilty and declamatory as the earlier depiction of Antarctica is serene, spacious and innocent.

BQSTART
We use updated drainage inventory, ice thickness, and ice velocity data to calculate the grounding line ice discharge of 176 basins draining the Antarctic Ice Sheet from 1979 to 2017. 
We compare the results with a surface mass balance model to deduce the ice sheet mass balance. The total mass loss increased from 40 ± 9 Gt/y in 1979–1990 to 50 ± 14 Gt/y in 1989–2000, 166 ± 18 Gt/y in 1999–2009, and 252 ± 26 Gt/y in 2009–2017.
In 2009–2017, the mass loss was dominated by the Amundsen/Bellingshausen Sea sectors, in West Antarctica (159 ± 8 Gt/y), Wilkes Land, in East Antarctica (51 ± 13 Gt/y), and West and Northeast Peninsula (42 ± 5 Gt/y). 
The contribution to sea-level rise from Antarctica averaged 3.6 ± 0.5 mm per decade with a cumulative 14.0 ± 2.0 mm since 1979, including 6.9 ± 0.6 mm from West Antarctica, 4.4 ± 0.9 mm from East Antarctica, and 2.5 ± 0.4 mm from the Peninsula (i.e., East Antarctica is a major participant in the mass loss). 
During the entire period, the mass loss concentrated in areas closest to warm, salty, subsurface, circumpolar deep water (CDW), that is, consistent with enhanced polar westerlies pushing CDW toward Antarctica to melt its floating ice shelves, destabilize the glaciers, and raise sea level.

Here's a 5 minute clip that the film crew from that documentary captured (largest calving event ever filmed) of a piece of ice the size of lower Manhattan calving off of Jakobshavn Glacier in Greenland.

Watercolour World is the brainchild of former diplomat Fred Hohler, whose first large-scale digitisation endeavour, the Public Catalogue Foundation, laid the groundwork for Art UK. The idea came to Hohler when he embarked on a tour of Britain’s public collections and realised quite how much there was to do on watercolour alone: Norwich Castle Museum held about 4,500 paintings by a single artist; the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, meanwhile, had somewhere between 200,000-300,000 watercolours in its drawers. 
The value – and excitement – of the Watercolour World project, is that it views these historic paintings as documents, not aesthetic objects: visual records of the world at large, in colour, spanning a full 150 years before photography took over as our primary documentary medium. Between the invention of the spool camera around 1900 (which instantly superseded the pocket watercolour box as documentary tool of choice) and the advent of mass commercial colour photography in the 1950s, we lost, in a sense, half a century of colour.
The website, which has launched with about 80,000 works, focuses on pre-1900 documentary paintings: archival information gathering often duly kept in binders and boxes ever since. Some of the artists on the site were professional painters. Others were military draughtsmen, official expedition watercolourists, botanists, surveyors, as well as the untold numbers of amateurs – which Hohler suspects will turn out to have mostly been women, unpaid for their time and skill – who picked up a paintbrush to record the world around them.
The website has started with already digitised pieces from public collections: the Rijksmuseum, Bristol Museum and Art Gallery, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Musée des Beaux-Arts d’Orléans, to name some. Hohler is most excited, though, about what’s hiding in private archives, if only because most owners don’t even realise what they’ve got. “They all say the same thing,” he says: “‘Oh, we don’t have much.’” But often they do – hidden away in an attic or empty trunks in the living room.
This unintentional neglect is why many of the works are in sterling condition: light and handling threaten both pigment and paper; forgetting about artworks doesn’t. While official draughtsmen used the best archival paper, amateurs worked on whatever they could find. Which lends an added incentive to the digitisation Hohler’s team is undertaking: many of these paintings have a shelf life, yet what they depict is potentially of vital importance.
Hohler goes so far as to say that once the collection reaches the critical mass of 1m images, it will be an “absolutely indispensable tool to help us understand today”. From coastal erosion and ice-cap melt to loss of fauna and flora, not to mention direct human destruction (of Palmyra in Syria, say, by Islamic State, or the Seti tomb in Luxor, by tourists) these watercolours serve as an invaluable reference.
Hohler cites the recently reported projected loss of a third of the Himalayan ice-fields. Most of the visual records we have of what those glaciers looked like 150 years ago is in watercolours. Among the images on the website is the first known, yet accidental, picture of Mount Everest, from the 1840s: it’s not even labelled Everest. A lot of the value in these images is similarly accidental. Often it’s the context – replete with treelines, snowlines or waterlines – the artist painted around, for example, the flower they’d set out to record.
Anyone with a phone can send in picture of a historical watercolour they might have lying about, to see if it’s worth cataloguing
As Hohler puts it: “We have in this country all these images about, not this country, but the rest of the world – and they’re stuffed in drawers.” Beyond the UK, he has no idea quite how many images there are, worldwide, to be catalogued, but estimates it to be in the millions. The task is clearly not something his team will ever accomplish alone: the project is as much a call to arms as a public service. Anyone with a phone can send in a picture of a historical watercolour they might have lying about, to see if it’s worth cataloguing. And the more people do so, the more complete a picture of the bygone world this collection will provide.
These watercolours, for the most part, even come with built-in metadata. The website retains the original caption information (even when it’s mistaken) as supplied by the collections the images come from. The team then tags them with appropriate search terms to help people find interesting stuff.
And interesting stuff there is: from the French revolutionary knife grinder with his two canine assistants (search for “dogs”) to the students and their camel at a Marylebone boarding school (there are 366 images tagged with “camel”; search instead for “boarding school”). Teachers will have a field day. And, Hohler’s team suspects, so will any punter as curious about their own neck of the woods as they are about far-flung lands.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/feb/14/watercolours-documented-earth-website-digitise-historic-imagery-climate-change-world

They say know your history . . .
As we promote further extraction and burning of coal, consider that several previous mass extinctions have been linked to natural global warming events caused by an increase in atmospheric CO2, the worst, the end-Permian, likely from coal seams ignited by magma (the one that got the dinosaurs was apparently assisted by a large meteor strike). 
These ancient global warming events transpired over millennial time scales, nothing like the rapid burning by humans over the last two centuries.
If we wanted to create a mass extinction, paleoclimate evidence indicates that rapidly increasing CO2 in the atmosphere is hard to beat.
As the ocean warms there's evidence of a slow down in ocean circulation which provides oxygen to the deep ocean.
There's evidence of an increase in oxygen-deprived dead zones in the ocean where toxin-producing microbes thrive.
The worst of these are the hydrogen sulfide producing bacteria which are a suspected kill mechanism for several previous mass extinctions.
“We thus propose (1) chemocline upward excursion as a kill mechanism during the end-Permian, Late Devonian, and Cenomanian–Turonian extinctions, and (2) persistently high atmospheric H2S levels as a factor that impeded evolution of eukaryotic life on land during the Proterozoic.”

In a step that underscores the political divide over emissions policy, Vales Point power station in New South Wales was registered in August for a proposal to improve some of its turbines. It is the first stage in it being allowed to bid against land owners and other businesses for climate funding.
The Coalition has indicated it is considering tipping more into the fund, which started with $2.55bn but is now near empty, before this year’s election. The fund has so far failed to curb national emissions, which have increased each year since the government abolished a carbon pricing scheme in 2014.
The Australian Conservation Foundation said it was shocking that taxpayers’ money meant to combat climate change could go to coal power plants.
“No government should be propping up ailing coal generators with public funds, especially as any major capital works would help extend the life of a plant that should be retired,” said ACF chief executive Kelly O’Shanassy.
“Vales Point getting even this far in the process is a clear sign the emissions reduction fund needs structural reform before any new injection of cash is considered.”
Sunset Power International bought Vales Point from the NSW government for $1m in 2015. Two years later it was re-valued at $730m and last year it reported a net profit of $113m.
Its part-owner, coal power advocate and former National Party candidate Trevor St Baker, has flagged extending its operation beyond its expected closure date of 2029 to 2049. Managing director Greg Everett said prolonging the plant’s life was a $400m decision and had nothing to do with its pitch into the emissions reduction fund.
Everett said that project – replacing components on two units commissioned in 1978 – would cost $14.2m and cut emissions by 900,000 tonnes over the decade to 2029. Based on its current emissions of 6.9m tonnes a year, this is a 1.3% cut below what it would be expected to emit.
He said the company’s initial bid would be for about $600,000 to pay for an emissions reduction of 50,000 tonnes.
But the proposal has stalled due to a disagreement with the Clean Energy Regulator, which administers the fund, over whether the project needs to push the plant’s emissions intensity – how much it emits per unit of electricity generated – below the grid average. This shift is necessary for it to bid for funding.
Everett said that condition should not apply as the project would upgrade only a small part of the plant. He said the fund’s guidelines included coal power as being able to receive carbon credits. The methodology that covers the plant is being reviewed by an independent emissions reduction assurance committee.
Everett rejected suggestions Vales Point should not be eligible for climate funding. He said it played an important role in the grid alongside variable renewable energy.
“They try to make out like it’s either/or when in reality a lot of these technologies work together to ensure a secure system,” he said. “The benefit to the community is this is low-cost emissions reduction.”
The push for climate funding coincides with St Baker asking the government to underwrite a $6bn plan with a Chinese partner to build three new coal-fired plants in Victoria and NSW, including a new generator next to Vales Point.
The centrepiece of Tony Abbott’s “direct action” climate policy, the fund has been gradually whittled down and was not expected to be revived until the government abandoned its national energy guarantee policy and it became clear that voter concern about climate change was likely to play a significant role at this election.
The cash is distributed through reverse auctions, with the cheapest cuts proposed winning contracts and the right to generate carbon credits. The government buys credits back once the cuts are verified. To date, the fund has paid out $476m, committed another $1.8bn and has $226m left unspent.
Last year a Guardian Australia investigation found it was often difficult to determine if the fund was offering value for money.
Some projects were clearly not. The independent assurance committee found landfill sites that capture and burn leaking methane to generate electricity, for instance, would have existed without the fund’s support.
Asked whether the fund should be used for coal plants, a spokesman for environment minister Melissa Price said it was technology neutral and its methods required emissions cuts to be genuine. For Vales Point, upgrades to essential components must lower emissions intensity below the grid average to receive carbon credits.
Opposition climate spokesman Mark Butler said the fund was ineffective. “As Malcolm Turnbull famously said at the time, it is a fig-leaf to cover a determination to do nothing,” he said.

But you are not alone, if you don’t want to be. No matter who you are and where you are, there is a like-minded soul out there, a sympathetic voice, a support group, a project, a fellowship.
That’s what young people in England found when it turned out medical interventions for mental illness in their region were inadequate. They formed a support group and helped each other.
It’s also what struggling students from deprived communities have learned, thanks to an initiative that pairs them with successful professionals for a extra tuition.
In a sense, the “you are not alone” message was also delivered live on television to the LGBTQ community by an international sports star, a bold act of principle that did more for his sport than any athletic prowess could.

Thanks for reading and for getting in touch to share your stories. Here’s our most recent news story.
The climate change strikers have found an unusual source of support: Conservative MPs who have issued comments applauding those who took time off school or college to join the protests.
They include Claire Perry, the energy minister, who said: “I’m incredibly proud of young people who feel strongly that we need to take action.” She was joined by the former higher education minister Sam Gyimah, who tweeted approvingly: “Best to see this as an applied citizenship lesson on one day of the year.”
Meanwhile, Richard Benyon, the MP for Newbury, met a group of strikers at his office in the town. “Great to chat with young people so passionate about #climatechange. Glad to be able to talk of UK’s world-leading achievements in reducing [greenhouse gas] emissions and commitments to ocean protection and end[ing] coal power generation,” he later tweeted.
Among the homemade signs on display in Newbury was one reading: “I’ll focus on my A-levels when you focus on the sea levels.”
But the official position from the Department for Education was unchanged.
“I want young people to be engaged in key issues affecting them and involving themselves in causes they care about. But let me be clear – missing class won’t do a thing to help the environment. All they will do is create extra work for teachers,” said Damian Hinds, the education secretary.
“This is ultimately a matter for headteachers to consider, but I’ve repeatedly said I don’t want teachers being burdened with extra and unnecessary workload, and that’s exactly what these strikes would lead to.”
Only a small proportion of the UK’s 8 million school pupils are likely to have taken part in today’s action, although some schools allowed pupils to join in the protests if accompanied by parents or given written permission.
While the Liberal Democrat education spokeswoman, Layla Moran, a former teacher, joined a protest in Oxford, the shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, was more nuanced in her support: “I’m inspired by the many young people who want to support the #schoolstrike4climate movement, but I hope it can evolve so we can build on its success without the loss of time in the classroom.”
School students who spoke to the New Scientist during the protests in London said the media had to share some of the blame for the global failure to tackle climate change.
Eddy Barrow, 15, of Elmgreen school in Tulse Hill, south London, told the magazine: “Climate change is a big problem that is being ignored by mainstream media. The MPs in parliament are not doing much. There will be rising sea levels, no more Antarctica, the climate will be destroyed. Loads of terrible things.”
The youngest protester to whom the New Scientist spoke was an eight-year-old boy with his mother. 
He was carrying a banner stating: “Be cool, be green, not a dinosaur.” When he was asked what he thought the world would be like when he was older, he replied: “Burning.”
Also in Oxford, Windmill primary school has embraced today’s climate strikes by holding a “day of learning” about global warming.
A video of Greta Thunberg speaking at last year’s UN climate change conference has proved popular with pupils, who are understandably concerned about the impact of climate change on their lives.
Thunberg (16) began a solo climate protest by striking from school in Sweden in August 2018. She has since been joined by tens of thousands of school and university students in Australia, Belgium, Germany, the United States, Japan and more than a dozen other countries.
Speaking at the United Nations climate conference in December 2018, she berated world leaders for behaving like irresponsible children. And in January 2019 she rounded on the global business elite in Davos: “Some people, some companies, some decision-makers in particular, have known exactly what priceless values they have been sacrificing to continue making unimaginable amounts of money. And I think many of you here today belong to that group of people.”
Veteran climate campaigners are astonished by what has been achieved in such a short time. Thunberg has described the rapid spread of school strikes for climate around the world as amazing. “It proves you are never too small to make a difference,” she said. Her protests were inspired by US students who staged walk-outs to demand better gun controls in the wake of multiple school shootings.
Her mother, Malena Ernman, has given up her international career as an opera singer because of the climate effects of aviation. Her father is actor Svante Thunber. Greta has Asperger’s syndrome, which in the past has affected her health, he says. She sees her condition not as a disability but as a gift which has helped open her eyes to the climate crisis.

Pupils made banners with slogans including “Save the planet” and “There’s no planet B”, and are holding a picket line outside the school gates during the day, volubly encouraging parents – and passersby – to do more to tackle global warming.
Forty Windmill pupils also travelled into Oxford to take part in this morning’s protests. But rather than bunking off, these primary schoolchildren were supervised by their headteacher, Lynn Knapp, and a group of parents. 
At least 1,000 mainly young people held a protest in Oxford and heard from the local MP Layla Moran and the Guardian columnist George Monbiot.
Knapp said it was important to raise pupils’ awareness of climate change and valuable for children to learn they can achieve change by making a stand about issues that matter to them.

Oxford was among other cities that had large turnouts today. Thousands gathered in Bonn Square, the Oxford Mail reports.
Among them were students from Lord Williams’s school in Thame, who wrote an open letter to their MP, John Howell, stating: “Rather than leaving our generation in a better place, the UK government has demonstrated an utter lack of impetus, energy or enthusiasm in tackling the greatest threat to our planet’s future.
“This shortsightedness cannot continue. We urge you to consider and act upon this letter.”

What about the newly planted lawn in Parliament Square? Christopher Hope, the Telegraph’s chief political correspondent, has been voicing his concern.
Around 2,000 sixth formers who bunked off school have been protesting in Parliament Square have now wrecked the newly planted grass. And they are worried about climate change? What about the lawn?
Some schools were more explicit than others when it came to supporting today’s strikes. 
In Sheffield, however, the city’s mayor has been promising to help strikers who get into trouble for not being in class.
To all students in Sheffield! If any of your teachers threaten you with some sort of action or give you any hassle for going on strike. Let me know &amp; I'll have a word, even if I have to come into your school!You give us all hope! 👊🏾💚#ClimateStrike#SchoolStrike4Climate
Meanwhile, the Green party MP, Caroline Lucas, was hosted at a school in Brighton.

In Manchester, Poppy Noor reports that lots of students are saying they have been threatened with everything from unauthorised absences to suspensions today, but they think their futures are worth the risk.
Among others she spoke to, there has been criticism of the government.

The UN has yet to put out an official announcement about Anderson, but Solheim has already tweeted.

The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has picked the Danish economist and environmentalist Inger Andersen to be the new UN environment chief, turning the page on a scandal over expenses that rocked the UN agency.
That is according to a letter seen by Agence France-Presse. Andersen, who heads the International Union for Conservation of Nature, is to succeed Erik Solheim of Norway, who resigned in November following an outcry over his travel expenses.
A draft internal UN audit leaked to the Guardian in September found Solheim had spent almost $500,000 (£390,000) on air travel and hotels in 22 months, and was away 80% of the time. The audit said this was a “reputation risk” for an organisation dedicated to fighting climate change.
The UN deputy secretary general, Amina Mohammed, told a meeting of ambassadors on Thursday that Guterres had chosen Andersen as his nominee.
Her nomination as head of the Nairobi-based UN Environment Programme will be submitted to the general assembly for approval.
Andersen has also served as the World Bank vice-president for the Middle East and North Africa and worked at the UN for 15 years on water and environment issues.
If confirmed as expected, Andersen will take the helm of Unep following Solheim’s scandal-hit tenure.
University students have also been out today, including at Lancaster University.

In Belfast, a passionate crowd of schoolchildren have demonstrated in the centre of the city.
The small but vocal gathering of primary and secondary pupils made their voices heard as they held up homemade signs and chanted outside city hall. 
The environmental protest was one of a series of coordinated events around the UK as young people left their classrooms to make a point on global warming. 
Maia Willis-Reddick, a 17-year-old student at Belfast’s Methodist college, said time for action was running out. 
“We are protesting against the government for their ignorance of the problem of climate change,” she said. 
“We have 12 years before this becomes an international disaster, and before those 12 years, we need drastic action to take place in order to reduce carbon emissions for the entirety of the UK, the entirety of the world.” 
Megan Hoyt, from north Belfast, accompanied her four children – Finn, Penny, Aisling and Isabelle – to the protest. “We are here today because we think it’s time for political action,” she said. 
The first young people who have walked out of school to protest against climate change and the mess they are inheriting are now at Belfast city hall. May what @GretaThunberg has started continue to grow and build right across the planet. #ClimateStrike pic.twitter.com/1vdWqN2TuN
The former higher education minister Sam Gyimah has joined the surprising number of Conservative MPs who have offered tacit support for pupils joining the strike.
Best to see this as an applied citizenship lesson on one day of the year. Climate Change is one of the big issues facing mankind, and we all benefit from having informed, active and engaged citizens. https://t.co/tHS50qIBnv
When another Twitter user told Gyimah “None of those kids will grow up to vote Conservative,” he replied: “That’s not the point. I thought you do things because they are the right thing to do. And then you try to take people along with you. But what would I know.”
The shadow education secretary has a nuanced take – she supports the strike but hopes it can “evolve” to avoid disruption.
I’m inspired by the many young people who want to support the #schoolstrike4climate movement but I hope it can evolve so we can build on its success without the loss of time in the classroom. World leaders including our PM must listen &amp; act. 🙌
Another Labour frontbencher, Rebecca Long-Bailey, tweeted a video.

Hettie Ainsworth, 10, is here with her parents despite not being given an authorised absence from school. She’s here to protest because: “the government isn’t doing enough about it.” She adds: “It’s our future, and if we don’t start paying attention there may not be one.” pic.twitter.com/DhHdh7lywp
Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, welcomed the strike earlier today as “a cause for optimism in an often dark world”. She tweeted that the Scottish government was a world leader “but, given the urgency, it is right that we are all challenged to do more and that we hear the voice of the next generation”.
A wave of strikes are taking place today across Scotland, including in the Highland towns of Fort William and Ullapool, as well as Glasgow and Edinburgh.
The Scottish Green party education spokesman, Ross Greer, has written an open letter to education chiefs in Scotland urging them to confirm young people taking part in the strikes will not be punished for protesting.
In the Highlands, the local authority has said the hour’s strike will be recorded as an unauthorised absence, but will incur no punishment.
As well as protesting outside schools, young people have also gathered outside the Holyrood parliament in Edinburgh and outside the City Chambers in Glasgow.

It sounds like things are getting a bit more tense in London. My colleague Sandra Laville says mounted police have now moved right up to the young people sitting in the road and are shouting at them to move. Some of the young people are going – others are staying put for now.

Footage of the strikes around the UK ...
My colleague Sandra Laville says protesters are gathering at the bottom of Whitehall in central London, occupying the road and stopping traffic in all directions.
The police presence has grown and mounted officers have cleared part of upper Whitehall. But the children have regrouped and are now blocking the road outside Westminster. The police are hanging back – for the time being – with legal observers watching proceedings.
Although it is difficult to get a firm idea of numbers when an event is taking place across as many towns and cities as this, organisers are now confident that more than 10,000 young people are taking part in the climate strike.
That is pretty remarkable, according to Jake Woodier of the UK Youth Climate Coalition, which is helping to coordinate the action, who said it would have been happy with a few hundred a couple of weeks ago.
What we’ve witnessed today is thousands upon thousands of students and young people descend on their towns and cities to demonstrate the urgent need for radical climate action.
The size of the Youth Strike 4 Climate is testament to the passion and awareness among young people that we need to fight for a future that simply doesn’t exist because we’ve been betrayed by the inaction of those in positions of power.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2019/feb/15/schoolchildren-take-to-streets-in-uk-wide-climate-strike-live

A lot of the time, it’s not even raining. High tides intensified by sea-level rise are just pushing the water inland, overwhelming the drainage system.
Pip’s – named after owner Ryan Lamy’s daughter, whose real name is Madeline – floods inside frequently too.
“We wait for the tide to go out, and then we mop,” Lamy said. “That’s all we can do.”
Lamy has been running Pip’s for 10 years. His young daughter, pictured in photos on the walls of the restaurant, is now turning 15. And he says the flooding has only gotten worse, sometimes costing him thousands in lost sales each month.
A new study attempts to quantify those losses, as coastal communities around the country brace for more tidal flooding as warmer temperatures increase sea levels.
Published in the peer-reviewed journal Science Advances, the study estimates that eight shops in Annapolis saw about 3,000 fewer visitors and up to $172,000 less in revenue in 2017 when flooding closed the nearby parking lot.
“We typically think about climate change in terms of extreme events like hurricanes and wildfires, but it actually causes impacts in all sorts of other ways,” said coauthor Miyuki Hino of Stanford University. “This is one way where it’s really a part of people’s daily lives. It’s chronic.” 
Annapolis is seeing seas rise at about twice the global rate, and Hino said the flooding there foreshadows the problems other coastal communities can expect.
“What we’re seeing on the east coast now is a preview of what we’re going to be seeing on the west coast in the future as the rate of sea-level rise continues to climb,” she said.
One study showed seas rose up to five inches, an inch per year, in places between North Carolina and Florida from 2011 to 2015. Sea level rise threatens 300,000 US coastal homes. Higher elevation properties are becoming worth more in Miami, as people who can afford it move inland, according to research from Harvard.
Globally, seas were three inches higher than the 1993 average by 2017, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and they continue to rise one-eighth of an inch each year.
An analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists finds that flood-prone areas in Annapolis, where the US Naval Academy is located, could be almost constantly under water by 2070. The roughly 50 floods a year could reach 400 floods a year by 2050. The so-called “nuisance flood” days have increased 925% in 50 years, according to the NOAA.
The frequently flooded area in Annapolis is just a short walk from Maryland’s historic state capitol. A political cartoon that’s been tacked to the wall at Pip’s for years depicts city officials in a boat floating by the capitol. “I say it’s time to take action on possible city dock flooding!!” it reads.
The city is planning to install pumps costing millions of dollars over the next few years.
A few doors down, at the Annapolis Marine Art Gallery, visits have stalled when the parking lot has flooded, even though the water doesn’t come past the shop’s first step.
Manager Nancy McPherson said the gallery has taken all of its low-hanging art down and driven it away four times for impending storms. 
“I have tourists say all the time say ‘when will they raise the sea wall’? And I say it doesn’t come from there. It comes from a drain in the parking lot. When the tide’s high, where is it going to go? It comes out.”
McPherson knows the flooding will only get worse, but she said the gallery hasn’t thought about relocating.
“We’re just hoping the city can do something,” she said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/15/us-coastal-businesses-hit-by-everyday-impact-of-climate-change-study-shows

Up to one million native fish, including hundreds of thousands of small bony bream, Murray cod, up to 20 years old, and silver perch were killed in the three events. While there had been other fish kills during droughts, these were on an unprecedented scale, the report found.
“The conditions leading to this event are an interaction between a severe (but not unprecedented) drought and, more significantly, excess upstream diversion of water for irrigation,” the panel of scientists convened by the Academy of Science said. “Prior releases of water from Menindee Lakes contributed to lack of local reserves.”
Unless urgent steps are taken to restore flows in the Darling, Prof Craig Moritz, who chaired the panel, warned: “The Darling will die.”
“No one expects the river to run every year but they have cut the water so hard, the river is dying,” he said.
The report will again focus attention on the massive expansion of irrigated cotton farming in northern New South Wales, and the state’s commitment to the Murray-Darling basin plan.
The panel has called for an immediate effort over the next six months to restore flows, combined with a Menindee Lakes restoration plan focused on restoring its ecology, not saving water, as NSW hopes to do with its Menindee Lakes water saving plan.

It says there must be meaningful consultation with the Indigenous people who have native title along the river, as well as with local communities, to tap into local knowledge.
It is also calling on the federal government to immediately reverse last year’s decision to cut the environmental water recovery target for the northern basin by 70 gigalitres, a move the panel warns will further degrade the river.
But Moritz acknowledged there were limited options to prevent more fish deaths in the short term. Without “truckloads of rain” , there was almost no environmental water in storage upstream and letting small amounts of the bad-quality water go could make it worse.
The report, under the auspices of the Australian Academy of Science, was commissioned by the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, and released on Monday morning.
“I promised Australians I would get them answers on how this ecological disaster took place, and that’s what this report does, Shorten said.
“There is simply not enough environmental water held in the Darling River to meet critical environmental needs in times of drought,” he said.
“The Murray Darling Basin Plan was well designed by Labor, but its implementation has been mismanaged by the Liberals. That’s hurting the river, hurting farmers and hurting the environment,” he said.
Labor is now supporting the removal of a 1,500GL cap on water buybacks, which will clear the way for more purchases of water from farmers. But he did not say whether Labor would support a reversal of the 70GL cut to environmental water recovery in the Northern Basin – something it has supported to date.
The scientists made a point of saying they had consulted with the government’s rival panel, headed by Prof Robert Vertessy, and shared data and conclusions, which suggests it too will make similar findings when it is released in a few days.
The Murray Darling Basin Authority said it would study the report.
“The key academy finding, that flows in the northern rivers needs to be improved, is exactly what the Basin Plan sets out to achieve. As noted in the AAS report, this is especially challenging during drought,” it said.
It did not address the recommendation that the 70GL cut should be reversed.
The academy scientists agreed with the NSW Department of Primary Industries finding that the immediate cause of the fish deaths was stratification of the water column in the weir near Menindee, which led to blue green algae outbreaks in the warm surface water during a run of very hot days over 40C, and deoxygenated water below.
When the temperature dropped during a cool change, the algae died and the water column mixed, depleting the river of oxygen and causing the mass fish deaths. After the initial fish kill just before Christmas, the dead fish and algae on the bottom may have added to the problem.
But the academy report goes much further in analysing what has happened to long-term flows in the Darling. “Increasing diversions are related to pumping of environmental water, increased floodplain harvesting, policy changes in NSW in relation to the Barwon-Darling Water Sharing Plan and access to low flows and theft,” the report says.
“As a result of water resource development in the Barwon-Darling and its tributary catchments, maximum dry periods between low flow events have doubled and are sometimes 10 times longer, severely stressing ecosystems.”
The panel based its conclusions on the Murray-Darling Basin Authority’s own scientific work on flows from 2018.
It also cited a report to the Commonwealth Environmental Water Office which identified that low flows have reduced by 70% across most sections of the Barwon-Darling since 1990.
Decisions by the NSW government to drain the lakes meant there was no local reserves of water available.
The scientists said regular, low flows in the Darling were important in ensuring that native fish and invertebrate populations survived during dry periods, and upstream and downstream connectivity were maintained.
The panel was particularly critical of NSW and its 2012 water sharing plan. “The NSW Barwon-Darling Water Sharing Plan, and changes to it in 2012, contributed directly to the decline of low flows, independent of rainfall, and hence to the recent fish kills,” it said.
The scientists also warned that the implementation of the NSW floodplain harvesting policy would potentially legitimise growth in diversions. They said the take of groundwater was also likely to be contributing to the problem.
NSW said it was studying the report but immediately rejected two recommendations: that the cap on buybacks should be lifted as well as the assertion that the Northern Basin review should be repealed.
The Australian Conservation Foundation called for immediate action on the academy’s recommendation.
“The Australian Academy of Science has sounded a warning that the management and implementation of water recovery across the Murray-Darling Basin is deeply flawed, finding that excess diversion of water for irrigation was a root cause of this summer’s mass fish kills.
“More than a million dead fish floating in our rivers is a clear sign something must change.
Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick also called for action.
“The findings of the academy’s expert panel are absolutely clear, and absolutely consistent with the findings of the Murray-Darling Basin Royal Commission - too much water is being taken for irrigation and not enough is being allowed to flow down the Darling River.”
The scientists were also asked to comment on whether climate change was contributing to the problems of the river system.
“The Murray-Darling Basin has increased in temperature by ~1 °C since 1910 and there is high confidence that the Northern Basin will continue to warm, towards a further 1–2 °C increase over the coming one to three decades. These large changes cannot be explained without anthropogenic emissions.”
But so far there was no detectable long-term change in observed annual precipitation.
“While climate change linked to increasing emissions has contributed to hotter conditions, it is unlikely that the observed reductions in flows is attributable to climate change alone,” they said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/18/the-darling-will-die-scientists-say-mass-fish-kill-due-to-over-extraction-and-drought

Nobody has heard about Wally - but everyone has seen the graphics of the ""ocean overturning circulation"". Or the ""global conveyor belt"". 
Wally is yet another scientific Daddy that nobody knows about - because everyone alive got to know science by twitter. 
He did not just ponder why chronology was difficult. He went ahead and helped define the problems of chronology. While also pondering deep ocean ventilation and how stable isotopes can help.

Because, just like religion and voices of gods in human heads did not turn out to give an ""entirely correct testament to how old creation is, how big it is, what the centre is, how life evolved and how continents met and reshaped and stuff "", nor does political ideology have any bearing on how efficient CO2 is at blocking electromagnetic waves in the IR spectrum. 
Fact is that the solution of how AGW works was figured out under Napoleon. And he was bat-shit crazy. By the time the leaders of USA figured out to solve if having slaves was a universally good or bad thing, science had already measured the effect that CO2 has. While the leaders of Europe in their infinite wisdom figured out that it was best to engage in a first world for very strange issue, subsequently ending up with millions dead of all sorts of things - from gas to foot infection - science was already exploring that relativity is general and that the effing Universe may be expanding. While by extension doing stuff that let bat-shit crazy politicians blow up atoms over Japan as a final salute to that latest bat-shit political crazyness that started it. 
Now, in 2019, big nations of this planet (Russia, USA, Australia, Brazil - to mention a few) are run by politicians that try to outsmart CO2. Because what CO2 does - we must understand - is something that can be politically argued against. 
Remember, science does not invent stuff. It discover stuff. When it comes to gravity for example, it was not invented by Newton. Even our Sun discovered gravity 4.5 billion years earlier, I am sure to its own surprise, as it drew enough hydrogen to suddenly start fusion. 
Politicians can make laws prohibiting us waving knives around in public. Because that is anti-social and dangerous. But they can not prohibit gravity to pull us down by acceleration of c. 9.8 meter per second per second until we reach terminal velocity just to blame the atmosphere for not being thick enough to make the number lower. 
As I indicated above - we can not vote on this stuff. Except within religion and politics, of course. It is perfectly possible to make laws that cause royal family members to marry each other for a while. And make laws that forbid anyone to mention that it can not possibly lead to any good. 
The laws of the Universe does not care. But it does provide Charles the second of Spain. That made even the Catholic Church reconsider how well they were interpreting the weak messages from their god (yet again - while they were working on the whole which thing as supreme leaders of Europe and getting women burnt on fire all the way up to Arctic Norway). 
Leaders are completely nuts. 
And research is now explaining to us that to ""run for office"" requires individuals with a good doze of psycopatic character-traits (who else want some billionaire media-mogul to focus their global effort to demonstrate that one is a bad parent by smoking a spliff 2 decades ago?). 
Of course leaders are bonkers. They run for election. Nobody who run for position is normal. 
Now to the ""laws of economics"" and their relation to reality. I agree - physics do struggle with two rather complex issues - how to get ""relativity"" work with ""quantum"". The standard theory does hold up well, in that respect. To the extent that it may seem that the mathematics we know is lacking so much that it leads us to solutions that require way to many dimensions. 
The laws of economics is not part of any solution to physics. They do change reality for us as humans though (but they do not change reality for bugs - grass - bacteria - they only change reality for stuff that can vote). 
The ""scientific laws"" of economics is lower on the scale of known reality than human shared evolution to a banana (our shared gene-pool) - and the fact that a banana is so scientifically interesting that it can be used as a measure of radioactivity. 
I would vote for any regime - given that they have a clue about banana-science. It is important - because it is real. Economics - that is bat-shit crazy like the leaders who got us occupied about wars over slaves, colonies, ""race"", a bit too much sociology about ""living-space"" and bat-shit crazy humans does. 
Remember - a perfect hit in the face of an unknown friend while waiting for a taxi can outsmart a brain-surgeon. 
It is easy to push science outside its knowledge limits. That science can not rescue a catastrophic hit in the face is not equal to think that science have no clue when it advice ""do not knock people down"". Biology and all these laws of the universe may cause you to kill a person without wanting it - because shit is rather complex. 
Do not punch people in the face - even when tempted. Because the laws of the universe may express themselves. Respect the laws of the universe.

Personally I think we’ve made a big improvement since then. Treating people like some pawns in a consumerist game is child’s play compared to some of the shit we used to get up to. And of course in many parts of the world today people are still pulling some of that shit. 
There’s 80m refugees in the world and I don’t see many people queueing up to offer them sanctuary.

I do it. I say why can’t we do this or that to fight climate change or end word hunge. It all sounds fantastic. Except they’re just musings. They’re as about as fake as some Instagram models photos.

We just need to take a few steps back with Trump and Brexit and then we’ll arrive at the sunny uplands. Just you wait to see.

Going into a discussion thinking “I think x is the best way to address a particular agreed goal but I am open to other suggestions AND I trust that everyone else involved has a similar willingness to find a solution to this goal” is consensus.

Labor are no longer remotely Australian Labour. You are brave to draw attention to this, as Labor voters mistakenly believe Labor want to dismantle neoliberalism. 
Labor cling to neoliberalism like a grief-stricken Gorilla clings to their dead baby. Having delivered the children of the Labour movement into the jaws of a planet-wrecking doctrine, they are stuck between Rupert Murdoch and the Greens(also neoliberal). The neoliberal ratchet has only one direction, and because it places no value on the basis of it's own prosperity, represents the operating code for cultural suicide.
Neoliberalism is a human-created culture of planetary suicide. And Labor are making absolutely no noises whatsoever to challenge it's primacy, despite the now very visible wounds draining away the lifeblood of our planet and it's children.
The solutions will, necessarily, be a little different from the way things are done now.
Necessarily. At first they may jar the sensibilities. For example, most people don't know the difference between the Wealth system(depending on Land) and the Money system(depending on Wealth). Capitalism says Land, Wealth and Money are interchangeable forms of capital. Clearly this cannot be true, and is the reason why capitalism destroys nature. It's forgotten nature is the basis for all wealth. That should jar our sensibilities in a big way.
The time of the Politician-Leader is past, as you say. We have to demand  Labor redesign economics from the ground(i.e. land) up. To do that we need to not get angry, but to get informed as to how and why this has been done to us and our only home, and rational responses to it which don't require bloody revolution.
No doctrine dominates completely, thank goodness, but unless we make ourselves aware of our options we will never be able to choose among them, or create a workable synthesis. If hereditary privilege of the 0.01% is slightly diminished in the process, it is a small price to pay.

Glyphosate does not ""kill everything"" . It's a herbicide that kills unwanted plants aka weeds. Regulators around the world do not consider glyphosate a cancer risk and neither does the WHO.

Health Canada recently reassessed Glyphosate in the light of the ""Monsanto Papers"", court cases and various other allegations.

But the scariest aspect didn’t receive sufficient attention.
The scientists don’t attribute the extinctions primarily to climate change. They blame multiple causes, particularly habitat loss, pollution and pesticides.
In other words, the climate emergency on which most of us have been focused must be understood as one aspect of a broader disaster pertaining to humanity’s relationship to nature.
How will politicians respond?
After last week’s parliamentary clown show, many commentators justly bemoaned the low standard of leadership in Australia, with some urging a return to the centrist stability of the Hawke, Keating and Howard governments.
Yet that comparison actually reveals the deeper issues underpinning today’s political dysfunction.
Bob Hawke won office in 1983 after heading the ACTU, a body that then represented more than half the workforce. He promised unionists an increased standard of living through a “social wage”; he convinced employers he’d restrain labour militancy. His Accord gave Labor a real base and thus the stability to implement a neoliberal program that, at the time, no conservative politician would have dared advocate.
John Howard, by contrast, intensified neoliberal reform via a full-frontal assault on a labour movement weakened by the Accord and increasingly resented by capital. He thus united neoliberals and social conservatives behind big business and against the unions.
The situation today could not be more different.
Since Howard’s defeat, tension between Liberal wets and dries has become endemic, with Scott Morrison merely the latest leader tilting from one faction to the other according to the shifting political winds. The chaos reflects not the failure of individual politicians but an inability to present a coherent political project behind which the right’s traditional support base might be mobilised.
Similarly, Hawke won power with an astonishing 78% approval rating, while the latest polls put Shorten at an equally remarkable negative 15. Again, that’s not a personal flaw but indicative of a deeper uncertainty about who and what Labor represents, given its declining links to its traditional constituency.
In 1983, Hawke convinced organised labour to back an Accord meant to transform the economy on workers’ behalf.
In 2019, with the union movement greatly diminished, Shorten offers at best tepid support to the ACTU’s Change the Rules campaign.
The ALP’s likely victory in the next election thus reflects public disdain for the Liberals rather than enthusiasm for a Labor project.
We’re set for a familiar pattern: an unpopular leader with no real agenda or mandate, fending off internal challenges, and reliant on culture war and media stunts to beat back the opposition.
The absence of a stable social base leaves governments without the authority to tackle difficult issues.
The parliamentary convulsions accompanying the medevac bill provide an obvious example, with asylum seeker policy still based on piecemeal, ad hoc expedients slung together in response to an immediate crisis and then retained indefinitely in lieu of anything better.
Yes, the politics of borders are complicated. But they don’t present nearly as much of a challenge as the environmental situation.
We know that the biggest threat to insect populations comes from industrial farming. The advanced economies increasingly rely on unsustainable agricultural techniques, intensive use of pesticide and fertiliser, and the systematic clearance of forests, so much so that experts attribute about two-thirds of the loss of wildlife to food manufacture.
Furthermore, according to the World Resources Food Institute, production must rise by half in the next 30 years just sustain the growing world’s population.
In other words, any meaningful response to “insectageddon” requires fundamental changes in agriculture and thus the world economy – even as we address the separate but related problem of climate change.
Can you imagine a single contemporary politician putting forward a program for that?
Think of the agonised process that eventually resulted in marriage reform. Equality required merely a simple (and overwhelmingly popular) legislative change. And yet successive parliaments tied themselves in knots failing to deliver it – until a public campaign delivered the extra-parliamentary yes vote that broke the deadlock.
Indeed, the popular mobilisation for marriage reform hints at the only way out of the mess that we’re in.
Even if parliamentarians wanted to address the environmental emergency (and clearly many of them don’t), they no longer possess the kind of support base to deliver radical change.
That’s why, as the school students leading climate strikes have realised, we need to build our own constituency for action, creating the kind of mass movement that makes change impossible – even for politicians – to resist.

Wallace Smith Broecker, a Columbia University professor and researcher died on Monday at a hospital in New York City, according to a spokesman for the university’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. He had reportedly been ill in recent months.
Broecker brought “global warming” into common use with a 1975 article that correctly predicted rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere would lead to pronounced warming.
He was also an advocate for political action to deal with the problem. In 1984, he told a House of Representatives subcommittee that urgent action was required to halt the accumulation of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere because the climate system could “jump abruptly from one state to another” with devastating effects. His theories have subsequently become proven by events and are almost universally accepted by climate scientists.
He was also a pioneer in radiocarbon and isotope dating and became the first person to recognise what he called the ocean conveyor belt, a global network of currents affecting everything from air temperature to rain patterns.
“Wally was unique, brilliant and combative,” said the Princeton University professor Michael Oppenheimer. “He wasn’t fooled by the cooling of the 1970s. He saw clearly the unprecedented warming now playing out and made his views clear, even when few were willing to listen.”
In the ocean conveyor belt, cold, salty water in the North Atlantic sinks, working like a plunger to drive an ocean current from near North America to Europe. Warm surface waters borne by this current help keep Europe’s climate mild.
Otherwise, he said, Europe would be a deep freeze, with average winter temperatures dropping by 20F or more and London feeling more like Spitsbergen in Norway, which is 600 miles (965km) north of the Arctic Circle.
Broecker said his studies suggested that the conveyor belt was the “Achilles heel of the climate system” and a fragile phenomenon that could change rapidly for reasons not fully understood. It would take only a slight rise in temperature to keep water from sinking in the North Atlantic, he said, and that would bring the conveyor to a halt. Broecker said it was possible that warming caused by the buildup of greenhouse gases could be enough to affect the ocean currents dramatically.
“Broecker single-handedly popularised the notion that this could lead to a dramatic climate change ‘tipping point’ and, more generally, Broecker helped communicate to the public and policymakers the potential for abrupt climate changes and unwelcome ‘surprises’ as a result of climate change,” said the Penn State professor Michael Mann.
In in his 1984 address, Broecker said the buildup of greenhouse gases warranted a “bold, new national effort aimed at understanding the operation of the realms of the atmosphere, oceans, ice and terrestrial biosphere”.
Broecker said that by dumping into the atmosphere huge amounts of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels, “we are conducting an experiment that could have devastating effects”.
“We’re playing with an angry beast – a climate system that has been shown to be very sensitive,” he said.
Broecker received the National Medal of Science in 1996 and was a member of the National Academy of Sciences. Among his many awards were the Vetlesen Prize in 1987 and the Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement in 2002. He also served a stint as the research coordinator for Biosphere 2, an experimental living environment turned research lab, during which time he briefly worked under Steven Bannon, who went on to become a strategist for Donald Trump. 
Broecker was born in Chicago in 1931 and grew up in suburban Oak Park. He joined Columbia’s faculty in 1959, spending most of his time at the university’s laboratory in Palisades, New York. He was known in science circles as the “grandfather of climate science” and the “dean of climate scientists”.
In the 1970s, he worked as a consultant for Exxon and wrote several papers on the effects of carbon dioxide for the oil company.
His 1975 paper “Climatic Change: Are We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming?”, which predicted rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would lead to pronounced heating of the planet. This built on earlier studies and helped to push the subject to a wider audience.
More recently, he advocated the mass deployment of carbon capture and storage technology because he felt it was already too late to rely only on a switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy, but too early to take dangerous gambles on geoengineering.
“His discoveries were fundamental to interpreting Earth’s climate history,” said Oppenheimer. “No scientist was more stimulating to engage with: he was an instigator in a good way, willing to press unpopular ideas, like lofting particles to offset climate change. But it was always a two-way conversation, never dull, always educational. I’ll miss him.”

I'm making no comment on climate change. I'll call it politics and say I'm not interested. My comment is on the evangelical brain set and to ask can such people solve problems whatever those problems are. Convert petrol cars to electric? Have you no idea of the concept of engineering? What? The bonnet is a hole you fill? Take out petrol engine, drop in electric? You think that'll work? Loaves and fishes, and how about walking on water while you're at it
BQEND
Let's assume you don't have a commercial interest in production electric cars from the large manufacturers.
When it comes to engineering, I agree, it's difficult to covert a modern petrol car into an electric car, with all mod cons, BUT, it's relatively simple to take an older car and converted it to electrical power. In fact, a quick glance at Google will show that people are doing this all over the world. Indeed, if you don't want to do the work yourself then there are businesses that will sell you an already converted car. 
Modern cars are marvels of technological complexity , but I suspect that many people would be happy to have their existing car converted to electric for a few thousand pounds. This is ""back street garage"" territory, rather than ""rocket science"". In fact, a simple conversion can be done very quickly if a garage is geared up for it, providing a viable business opportunity for those who see the potential.

The Japanese-owned firm stated that every 15 minutes of customs delay would cost it up to £850,000 a year, and that it would take 18 months to set up new procedures and warehouses if Britain left the customs union.

BQEND
I'm sorry that I have to explain this to you, because it seems to me that a schoolchild would have grasped this, but fossil fuels are no longer a prerequisite to generate electricity.
Let's go back to basics : Nuclear power is the use of nuclear reactions that release nuclear energy to generate heat, which most frequently is then used in steam turbines to produce electricity in a nuclear power plant.
Wind energy (or wind power) describes the process by which wind is used to generate electricity. Wind turbines convert the kinetic energy in the wind into mechanical power. A generator can convert mechanical power into electricity.
Solar power is the conversion of energy from sunlight into electricity
And now for part 2 (as an example) :Apple announced that it's facilities are now 100 percent powered by renewable sources. That's up from the 96 percent in 2016, according to its latest energy report. Apple claims the new milestone covers power usage in its stores, offices, data centers and co-located sites across 43 countries. As for manufacturing, it's received commitments from 23 partners (including Pegatron and Quanta Computer) to build Apple products using renewable energy.

They may say these things are difficult and take time - but your statements are direct lies.
From the linked articles : 
""Electric-powered aircraft are enjoying a boom at the moment; last year, the consulting firm Roland Berger found there were more than 100 electric-powered aircraft projects underway around the world.""
""Britain’s biggest budget airline, easyJet, is working with a Los Angeles-based company, Wright Electric, to develop a wholly new commercial all-electric jet by 2027. “For the first time we can envisage a future without jet fuel and we are excited to be part of it. It is now more a matter of when, not if, a short haul electric plane will fly.”
The new aircraft will carry around 150 passengers, and will initially be “ultra short haul”, with a range of 540km. But easyJet says that could be sufficient for one-fifth of its current route network, including Belfast-London-Amsterdam, Bristol-Edinburgh and Paris-Geneva.""
...and yes, hybrid planes will be part of the answer to decarbonisation. I said this will take time and be difficult.....

And how about three large manufacturers ?
Three European industry heavyweights have teamed up against a US startup and Britain’s biggest budget airline to develop the first commercial electric aircraft.
Within a decade, according to the Californian firm Wright Electric, passengers could be flying on battery-powered flights between London and Amsterdam, with far less environmental impact than conventional aircraft.
European developers are more cautious, forecasting hybrid commuter jets will start flying routes of up to 1,000km between 2030 and 2035. 
But the deal signed today by Rolls-Royce with the planemaker Airbus and the eAircraft division of Siemens shows that the mainstream industry is now taking electric propulsion for commercial planes seriously.
Oh - here's another person with credibility :
According to the former CEO of Air France, Alexandre de Juniac, commercial electric planes could become a reality in the not-too-distant future.The CEO explained that the main advantage of electric planes would be the potential distance they could cover.
I bet these experts are regretting not having asked you about the physics that will prevent all their plans from happening.

Amazon's got a patent for recharging via drones while driving (I admit that sounds rather impractical), and some other company is working on special roads that allow to recharge while driving.
Plus as soon as you get to the point where you only need to charge at night and once during the day when you're stopping for lunch, there problem disappears for most drivers. And recharging times have decreased quite a bit.

If we all switched to electric we'd need more power stations to cope with demand. Not all of those will be renewable.

True, but the proportion of renewable is going up in many countries.

For one the car industry is overblown and needs to shrink.There simply is not enough space in metropolitan areas for vehicles, electric or conventional ones. Urban transport in cars is not viable. The reduction in car ownership among urban and particularly young inhabitants is indicative of this. Cities here with good urban transport have ownership rates of just under fifty percent of all households, more and more people subscribing to car-sharing schemes to cover occasional needs.
Then electric cars are far simpler than those on combustion. Conventional engines, transmission, gear boxes, exhaust systems are going to be largely superfluous. Braking systems will be electric. 
There is going to be far less servicing needed for electric vehicles.
Hence the motor car industry is in crisis worldwide, and Donald Trump's shooting himself in the foot by banning German cars, most of which are made in the USA, is only one manifestation of the issue.
A truly modernising country would focus far more on new systems of urban transit, on new heating technology, upgrading homes, new food growing and distribution schemes and a lot else. And very different housing. The sprawl of houses with parking space in front and a narrow strip of back garden will hardly be the ideal of city planning in the age of climate change. Low population density in the vast London expanse hardly makes for efficient transport. 
And I am just a little familiar with that single roundabout in Dover over which most of the spring fruit and vegetables enter Britain. I have driven over it numerous times, cycled over it, walked over it. Look at the map and the cadence of the transport volume and discover to what extent Britain is dependent on imports from drought-stricken southern Spain or Italy, with illegal migrant workers doing backreakaing work for a pittance under merciless gangmasters. I takes more than a Women's Land Army poster put on my bookshelf by my Anglophile daughter to redress this.
But there will hardly be a respectful public debate on these issues while Brexit is monopolising the public space.

For every car in the UK to be electric in the UK would require 20 additional power stations.

That's simply wrong. You could electrify all the cars in the UK without any more generation if you spread charging optimally. In practice you'd probably need a bit extra because charge-timing won't quite be optimal, but we still have a decade to do that in.

https://energy-surprises.blogspot.com/2017/02/what-difference-will-electric-cars-make.html
Overall we will use a huge amount less primary energy. 
EV charging will make very little difference to the grid (some re-inforcing needed in some places). The thing that really matters is heating.
That's currently 5 times our electricity supply and nearly all gas.

Suddenly, there was a flip/flop in policy 3 or 4 years ago when governments everywhere said “diesel bad”. It takes considerable time to change tack in mass production vehicle power trains and that’s where we are now.
It will be another 5 years before electric powered cars become generally affordable and become useful utility vehicles for average users and before the charging infrastructure will be available. When the balance shifts and electric cars become more than a third of cars on the road - probably another 10 years yet- the government will have to find a new source of tax revenues to replace that lost through falling petrol and diesel fuel sales (which are a very useful cash cow now).

It’s down to government failure to champion electric cars | Rosie Rogers,article,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/20/honda-closure-government-failure-champion-electric-cars-global-shift,0,"Honda’s announcement that it is closing its Swindon car plant has brought with it a very human tragedy, with thousands of job losses expected, and many more throughout the supply chain. As the rancorous debate about the role that Brexit played lingers, what might be drowned out is that, in an era of climate emergency, these are the workers whose skills and know-how we so desperately need.
Transport emissions remains the UK’s biggest source of greenhouse gases. Unlike other polluting sectors, like energy, which have seen significant drops in emissions, our transport emissions have only dropped 2% since 1990. If we’re to tackle climate change we desperately need to deal with this. And a big part of solution is electric cars.
The shift from polluting vehicles to electric ones is already happening and happening faster than anyone expected. Honda cited “unprecedented changes” in the market for cars as a result of electric vehicles as their main reason for leaving the UK. Workers in UK plants like in Swindon should be at the forefront of the worldwide shift to electric vehicles, building the cleaner cars that we’ll all need to be driving in the future.
The problem is our government is failing to adequately prepare for the shift to electric vehicles. Honda will have had its specific circumstances but unless the government wakes up to the pace of this change, it will risk seeing more plant closures and more job losses. Because if the change is coming – and many in the car industry see it as inevitable – those jobs dependent on the use of fossil fuels are going to go. The only question is whether the UK can capture the new jobs that will be created in manufacturing clean vehicles.
The government can help us build a thriving car industry fit for the realities of climate change, but certainty is key. If we are to cut carbon emissions and reap the economic benefits, the UK needs to be one of the best places in the world to make electric vehicles. The phase-out date for conventionally fuelled cars and vans set last year by UK government – 2040 – already looks hopelessly tardy.
In this, the UK is far behind a whole host of nations, ranging from India, to our near neighbours Ireland and Norway. Like them, we should be bringing this date forward to 2030. China is clear that it wants to dominate the market in electric vehicles this century and if the EU and UK don’t move quickly, it will. The new earlier date would create a tight timescale for government departments, energy companies, infrastructure providers, supply chain companies, as well as car manufacturers themselves. This needs to be backed up with preferential tax treatment to help encourage companies to make electric vehicle purchases for their corporate fleets.
Experts from the National Grid to committees of MPs have said going faster than government plan is both possible and desirable. Too often the government makes the right noises on this issue but fail to take the prompt action needed, and all too often, it’s British workers who pay the price. But the prize, if they grasp it, is a thriving, greener car industry providing good jobs for many years to come.

The Washington Post is now supporting CNN’s report that the attorney general, William Barr, could announce the completion of Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation as early as next week. 
Regulations call for Mueller to submit to the attorney general a confidential explanation as to why he decided to charge certain individuals, as well as who else he investigated and why he decided not to charge those people. The regulations then call for the attorney general to report to Congress about the investigation.
An adviser to President Trump said there is palpable concern among the president’s inner circle that the report might contain information about Trump and his team that is politically damaging, but not criminal conduct.
After postponing due to threats against his family, Michael Cohen, President Trump’s former lawyer, has set a date to appear before Congress.

Christopher Hasson intended “to murder innocent civilians on a scale rarely seen in this country,” according to a filing to federal court in Maryland. Law enforcement officers seized 15 guns and 1,000 rounds of ammunition from his home.
Prosecutors said Hasson was a “domestic terrorist” and should be detained. He was arrested last week on drugs and weapons charges.
The filing said Hasson, a fan of the Norwegian mass killer Anders Behring Breivik, compiled a spreadsheet of apparent targets, including Representatives Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar, and anchors from CNN and MSNBC.

Hassan Shibly, the lawyer for the family of Hoda Muthana, shared a document on Twitter that appears to show the young woman was born in New Jersey in 1994. 
Shibly has told reporters that the administration’s position is based on a “complicated” interpretation of the law involving her father, who was a diplomat. 
“They’re claiming her dad was a diplomat when she was born, which, in fact, he wasn’t,” Shibly told The Associated Press. 
Muthana was born in the United States to parents from Yemen who became naturalized American citizens, according to the Counter Extremism Project at George Washington University.

Guardian political correspondent Lauren Gambino with more on Bernie Sanders’ big day. 
Bernie’s having a big week. Yuuuge, you might say. 
After raising more than $6m in just over 24 hours, the Vermont senator on Wednesday jumped to the top of the fourth presidential straw poll by progressive website, Daily Kos. 
About 56,000 people responded to the latest poll, which happen every two weeks. This is significant because the women of the Senate, some of Sanders’ fiercest competition for the nomination, were ahead in the first three straw polls, which in one survey found Sanders behind vice president Joe Biden, the closest the field may have to an establishment backed moderate. 
In the 24-hour poll, which coincided with Sanders’ launch, his standing rose from 13% in two weeks ago to 44%, while Senators Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren round out the top three with 15% and 10% respectively, according to the survey results.In as much as any poll can reveal at this point, it’s another sign that Sanders has maintained significant grassroots support. The question is whether his loyal base is strong enough to withstand the competition for many of his supporters. 
House Democrats plan to file a resolution as soon as Friday that’s aimed at blocking President Donald Trump’s declaration of an emergency at the Southwest border, according to the Associated Press.
That could set up a vote by the full House by mid-March. The clash is over a declaration that Trump is using to try spending billions of dollars beyond what Congress has authorized to start building border barriers. 
Passage by the Democratic-run House seems likely. The measure would then move to the Republican-controlled Senate, where there may be enough GOP defections for approval. 
Trump has promised a veto, which would be difficult for Congress to override. The plan was described by officials at three progressive groups who heard of them from congressional aides but were not authorized to discuss the plans publicly.
Donald Trump said on Twitter that he ordered the State department to block Hoda Muthana, an American-born woman who left the US to join Islamic State in 2014, from returning to the US.
Muthana told the Guardian this week that she regretted leaving the US to join the terrorist group and wants to return to the US with her 18-month-old son. 
Earlier today, US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said Muthana was “not a citizen,” but the State department has not responded to inquiries from the Guardian about how that could be the case for the 24-year-old, who was born in New Jersey. 
I have instructed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and he fully agrees, not to allow Hoda Muthana back into the Country!
Trump’s tweet raises questions about the State department’s declaration that Muthana is “not a citizen” and whether that designation is in accordance with US and international law. 
The Trump adminstration’s statements about Muthana also contrast their calls on other countries to bring back and prosecute their own jihadist nationals.
A new report from the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) says that hate groups in the US have continued to surge in the Trump era, and that the president himself has helped to mainstream hate by “fueling fears of a white minority country”. 
Jason Wilson, writing for the Guardian, said the SPLC counted 1,020 hate groups in the United States in 2018, up 7% from the previous year:
In a press conference, Heidi Beirich, the director of the SPLC’s Intelligence Project blamed in part the “words and imagery coming out of the Trump administration” which have been “heightening the fears” of demographic replacement.
The report points to a range of murders and violent attacks – like a mail-bombing spree that targeted Democrats and media organisations and a mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue – as evidence that the conspiracy-fueled far right is increasingly willing to commit extreme acts.
Another similar recent report from the Anti-Defamation League suggested that extremist murders in the United States in 2018 were carried out almost exclusively by the far right.
But the SPLC also points to the increasingly strident expression of far right ideas in conservative media, and from Republican politicians, as evidence that hate is being mainstreamed.
Lawyers for the family of Hoda Muthana – the American-born woman who told the Guardian this week that she regretted leaving the US to join the terrorist group Islamic State in Syria – have responded to secretary of state Mike Pompeo’s claim that the 24-year-old is not a US citizen. 
An attorney for the woman’s family, Hassan Shibly, told the Associated Press that the administration’s position is based on a “complicated” interpretation of the law involving her father. 
“They’re claiming her dad was a diplomat when she was born, which, in fact, he wasn’t,” Shibly said. 
Muthana was born in 1994 in Hackensack, New Jersey, the lawyer said. 
Most people born in the United States are accorded so-called birthright citizenship but there are exceptions. 
Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, a person born in the U.S. to a foreign diplomatic officer is not subject to US law and is not automatically considered a US citizen at birth. 
The State department has not responded to the Guardian’s inquiries about Muthana’s immigration status. 
A former Trump campaign staffer has filed a class action lawsuit seeking to invalidate all nondisclosure and non-disparagement agreements signed by staffers to the campaign, according to Buzzfeed’s Zoe Tilllman: 
The claims brought by former campaign staffer Jessica Denson represent the broadest attack to date on the Trump campaign’s practice of having staffers, volunteers, and contractors sign agreements barring them from ever publicly criticizing Trump, his company, or his family, and from disclosing private or confidential information.
The Trump campaign has gone after several former staffers who publicly aired their grievances against Trump, his administration, or his campaign, including Omarosa Manigault Newman and Cliff Sims, who recently wrote a book about his time in the White House called Team Of Vipers. Denson was ordered to pay nearly $50,000 to the campaign after filing a workplace discrimination and harassment lawsuit in 2017.

The company has moved to cap its output of thermal and coking coal at current production levels of 145m tonnes a year after pressure from investors who want companies to take stronger action and factor in the financial risks of climate change.
Glencore says the decision to cap coal production and focus investment on commodities including nickel, copper and cobalt used in the renewables industry does not mean it intends to drop greenfield coal projects in Australia, such as its Wandoan coal project in Queensland’s Surat Basin.
The project has been on hold for several years for economic reasons because it would require investment for both the mine and associated new infrastructure.
In New South Wales, the company’s proposal for the expanded United Wambo Project in the Hunter Valley is being assessed by the NSW Independent Planning Commission and the forecast tonnes of that project are already contained within the 145MT cap.
“Glencore has been very clear that we closely consider market conditions before bringing on new coal projects as they need to be economically sustainable over a long period,” a company spokesman said following the announcement.
“As older mines in our portfolio come to the end of their economic life, all coal projects will be considered. This includes our Wandoan Coal Project.”
Lock the Gate, which has been campaigning for communities that would be affected by the Wandoan or United Wambo projects, said the company’s statement on Wednesday sent “a powerful signal that thermal coal is in decline globally”.
But Carmel Flint, the group’s campaign coordinator, said it may not go far enough, because deep cuts were needed to meet Paris climate targets, “and maintaining current levels of production is not sufficient to deliver on that”.“The true test of the statement will be in whether Glencore acts immediately to withdraw from new coalmining projects it has on its books – especially the proposed Wandoan coal project on the Western Downs of Queensland and the United Wambo project in the Hunter Valley in NSW,” she said.
The Australian Conservation Foundation said the company had been “dragged” by investors to implement a cap and it should be a warning to promoters of coal in public debate, including the Morrison government.
“As a result of this decision Glencore should make an unequivocal announcement that controversial greenfield coalmine proposals in Australia that local communities have been opposing for years, such as Wandoan on prime farming country in Darling Downs, will not proceed,” ACF’s climate and energy program manager Gavan McFadzean said.
Rod Campbell, research director at the Australia Institute, said “it’s not like Glencore has suddenly gone green”.
“But I think they’re getting good publicity out of some very sensible thinking that coal production doesn’t need to increase,” he said.
“It’s only in the bizarre energy politics of Australia that this is really big news.”
Glencore’s announcement is one of a number by major companies in recent months – including BP, Shell and Maersk – about their responsibilities around climate change.
It follows work by the Climate Action 100+, an investor initiative pushing the world’s biggest emitters to reduce emissions and improve financial disclosures related to climate change.
Emma Herd, the chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change and a member of the Climate Action 100+ steering committee, said more companies would be making similar statements in the future.
“I can definitely say there will be more announcements in the months ahead from very big companies related to climate change,” she said.
“People tend to think of this as climate activism or investor activism but actually what it is is these are very big, very mainstream investors who want very big and mainstream companies to have a plan on climate change.
“This is some of Australia’s and the world’s biggest institutional investors and pension funds saying you have to have a plan on climate change. They’re asking because they’re trying to manage risk in their own portfolios.”
Energy research and consulting firm Wood Mackenzie said Glencore’s announcement suggested it was chasing “value over volume” because of its dominant position in the premium thermal coal market.
“In a 2C scenario, premium thermal coal demand is expected to be resilient compared to other coal types,” research director Prakash Sharma said.
“That means companies holding on to high-energy thermal coal assets stand to gain and will realise higher prices.

The Extinction Rebellion group will support the demonstration outside the Department for Education, which organisers describe as a “peaceful nonviolent protest that may involve civil disobedience”.
It is intended as a show of solidarity for pupils who skipped classes last Friday to express their frustration at the failure of older generations to adequately address climate change. Organisers said more than 10,000 young people in at least 60 towns and cities in the UK joined the strike.
More would be likely to follow, they said, if the government did not live up to a Paris climate agreement promise to enhance climate change education. Instead, they say, there is currently no requirement for children to be taught about the climate crisis so it is treated, at best, as a peripheral subtopic of subjects like geography and science.
They are also unhappy that part of the curriculum appears to cast doubt on the evidence for man-made climate change, even though governments, the UN and the overwhelming majority of scientists accept that it is happening. Government guidelines for key stage 4 chemistry say pupils should be taught “evidence, and uncertainties in evidence, for additional anthropogenic causes of climate change”.
Tim Jones, a secondary school teacher from Lewisham, said students in the state system could easily go through 11 years of compulsory education and hear climate change mentioned in fewer than 10 lessons out of approximately 10,000. Given the scale of the crisis, he believes this is “negligent”.
“Climate and ecological breakdown will define the life of every child and student alive today. They and we are facing an unimaginable catastrophe. But when I tell my students, it’s hard for them to take me seriously when it plays almost no part in the content of their education,” he said.
Earlier this month, the group Teachers for Climate Truth wrote to the DfE to request an overhaul of the current curriculum to prepare children for a future that will be shaped by ecological and climate crisis
“When we have had the evidence for decades, why does it amount to little more than a footnote in our national curriculum – a vague and marginal concern?” asks the letter. “If we keep this information out of the public domain – out of schools, for example – perhaps we might avoid some awkward conversations in the years to come … after all, who wants to tell a child that, unless we make unprecedented changes to how we live, we are heading for societal collapse, famine, war and the increasing likelihood of human extinction?”
The picture is not black and white. There is considerable scope for schools and teachers to go beyond guidelines.
The government said the current curriculum already included many related issues including classes on seasonal changes, the water cycle, the carbon cycle, eco-systems, the composition of the atmosphere and the impact of carbon dioxide on the climate. “Children are very engaged, otherwise they would not be joining protests. That shows they are obviously being taught quite well,” said a government official.
The education secretary, Damian Hinds, has criticised the young strikers. “Missing class won’t do a thing to help the environment; all they will do is create extra work for teachers,” he said.
Friday’s demonstration is expected to draw between 100 and 200 teachers and academics, most of whom are on half-term holiday. Organisers are also in talks with unions to discuss how to increase support during the next global youth climate strike on 15 March, with possibilities ranging from a walkout by teachers to the setting of homework on climate topics. Extinction Rebellion will also offer workshops for students.
Elsewhere, the stakes are growing. In Australia – which has seen waves of school walkouts in recent months – the New South Wales education minister, Rob Stokes, warned students and teachers that they will be punished if they skip classes to join a global climate rally on 15 March.
The initiator of the school strike movement, Greta Thunberg, responded with a defiant tweet. “OK. We hear you. And we don’t care. Your statement belongs in a museum.”
Last week, 200 academics expressed support for the youth activists in an open letter on the Guardian. Among the signatories was Alison Green, a doctor of psychology who resigned from her position as pro-vice chancellor of Arden University so that she could concentrate on climate activism. She will join the protest on Friday.
“It’s incredibly brave for schoolchildren to confront what must be a terrifying prospect; that the future they hope for isn’t available to them,” she said. “We’ve been humbled that children have gone on strike despite threats of detentions and other punishments. We should at least match their courage.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/21/teachers-to-join-climate-protests-to-demand-curriculum-reform

Whole populations were affected by food crises in countries ravaged by by drought and hurricanes such as Ethiopia and Haiti, yet neither crisis generated more than 1,000 global news stories each.
In Madagascar, more than a million people went hungry as corn, cassava and rice fields withered under drought and severe El Niño conditions. Almost half the country’s children have been stunted, but their suffering sparked few headlines.
Sven Harmeling, the climate change lead for Care International, which commissioned the report, said: “Not only are the people who live in the world’s poorest countries most vulnerable to climate change, but they are also the least equipped to address its increasing impacts. Media must not turn a blind eye to such crises and the role of climate change.”
Asad Rehman, the executive director of War on Want, blamed a “climate change reporting that prefers pictures of polar bears to those we are killing with our inaction”.
He said: “Climate change has long had its fingerprints over untold killer floods, droughts and famines. Unfortunately the people being sacrificed every day to the climate crisis are those least responsible for it. They have been deliberately made invisible because the lives of those with black and brown skins simply don’t matter.”
Around the world, extreme weather events claimed about 5,000 lives in 2018, and left almost 29 million people in need of humanitarian aid and emergency assistance.
The Care report links climate change to civil disasters in Sudan, Chad, the Philippines, Madagascar and Ethiopia, and says it played an exacerbating role in Haiti.
Nine of the 10 most neglected tragedies occurred in countries in the Africa Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group of states.
Dr Viwanou Gnassounou, the ACP’s assistant secretary general, said: “We try always to show that these disasters are linked to climate change but we have to fight to get our points heard. We have not been very successful until now. The [media] coverage is poor and [reported] in terms of ‘disaster’ – not linked to climate change or its consequences.”
Gnassounou, who is also the ACP’s sustainable development spokesman, said that donor countries sometimes implicitly linked crisis aid to silence about climate change.
“They will never say it formally but it is part of the conversation,” he said. “They prefer that you condemn yourself by saying that you did not have a proper policy to prevent disaster and now you need their support.”
Scientists have tended to be wary of attributing individual weather events to global warming but many are increasingly reluctant to underplay trends in line with climate models.
Last year, the European Academies Science Advisory Council said climate change this decade had been “fundamentally responsible” for driving a 50% increase in flood frequencies and a similar surge in storms, droughts and heatwaves.
In July, the World Meteorological Organisation described extreme heatwave conditions as “consistent with what we expect as a result of climate change”.
Later that month, one of the world’s leading climate scientists, Prof Michael Mann, described accelerating extreme weather events as “the face of climate change”.
However, Dr Friederike Otto, the deputy director of Oxford University’s environmental change institute, added a note of caution. She said: “Not every humanitarian disaster has climate change as a major player. Some are actually being made less likely by climate change. And in some, climate change only plays a minor – if any – role.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/feb/21/climate-change-cause-of-most-under-reported-humanitarian-crises-report-finds

Flanked by students from the Belgian and German school strike movements, the Swedish teenager said it was not enough to hope that young people were going to save the world.
“There is simply not enough time to wait for us to grow up and become the ones in charge,” she said, citing the fall in greenhouse gas emissions that was needed by 2020.
The EU wants to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels.
“Some people say that is good, that is ambitious; but this new target is still not enough to keep global warming below 1.5C,” Thunberg said, referring to what scientists regard as the preferable upper limit if the planet is to avoid extreme droughts, floods and the bleaching of corals.
 “This target is not sufficient to protect the future for children growing up today. If the EU is to make its fair contribution to stay within the carbon budget for the 2C limit then it needs a minimum of 80% reduction by 2030, and that includes aviation and shipping.”
Thunberg, whose lone school strike last September became the catalyst for a global movement, was applauded by the audience of political, business and civil society leaders, despite her uncompromising message that the older generation was failing those of the future.
She also responded to criticism from political leaders, who included Theresa May, over skipping lessons. “If you still say that we are wasting valuable lesson time, then let me remind you that our political leaders have wasted decades through denial and inaction.”
Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, followed her address with a sprawling speech across a variety of green topics including EU climate policy, his love of Europe’s varied landscapes and opposition to the harmonisation of toilet flushes. Juncker said he had rejected his civil servants’ proposal for an energy-saving measure on toilets because the EU needed to focus on economic problems and external threats.
Speaking to journalists after the event, Thunberg said it was sad Juncker had not said much about the climate crisis, while revealing her own frustration about the reaction to the school strike movement.
Thunberg (16) began a solo climate protest by striking from school in Sweden in August 2018. She has since been joined by tens of thousands of school and university students in Australia, Belgium, Germany, the United States, Japan and more than a dozen other countries.
Speaking at the United Nations climate conference in December 2018, she berated world leaders for behaving like irresponsible children. And in January 2019 she rounded on the global business elite in Davos: “Some people, some companies, some decision-makers in particular, have known exactly what priceless values they have been sacrificing to continue making unimaginable amounts of money. And I think many of you here today belong to that group of people.”
Veteran climate campaigners are astonished by what has been achieved in such a short time. Thunberg has described the rapid spread of school strikes for climate around the world as amazing. “It proves you are never too small to make a difference,” she said. Her protests were inspired by US students who staged walk-outs to demand better gun controls in the wake of multiple school shootings.
Her mother, Malena Ernman, has given up her international career as an opera singer because of the climate effects of aviation. Her father is actor Svante Thunber. Greta has Asperger’s syndrome, which in the past has affected her health, he says. She sees her condition not as a disability but as a gift which has helped open her eyes to the climate crisis.

“When people talk about the climate strikes … they talk about almost anything except for the climate crisis: they talk about whether we are promoting truancy, or whether we are puppets, or it’s great that the young people are taking action. They don’t want to talk about the climate crisis … they just want to change the subject.”
She said she planned to continue her strike every Friday until Sweden meets its Paris climate targets.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/21/greta-thunberg-tells-eu-your-greenhouse-gas-targets-are-too-low

“So, what might this gas be?”
“CO2”
“Good, but what does CO2 stand for?”
“Oh, carbon dioxide,” reels off the whole class as one.
Secondary students know CO2. The chemical formula rolls off the tongues of even those who disdain science. Carbon dioxide is frequently mentioned in lessons; as products in reactions, during tests for gases, in the carbon cycle, respiration, photosynthesis and even to explain the greenhouse effect. This common gas, essential for many processes occurring on our planet, is intertwined throughout the secondary school curriculum. But real insight into the impact those two atoms of oxygen and one of carbon will have on my students’ future varies drastically between individuals.
I have been following the growing student strikes around the world with fascination. Seeing young people abandon their studies for a day and claim to be taking their future into their own hands should make any teacher uneasy, and it has led me to question my role as a secondary school science teacher.
I am sure most would agree with me that the purpose of a student’s school years is to safeguard their future; preparing them and educating them with information relevant to their future overall life happiness. The Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change and other global institutions have issued irrefutable warnings on global warming – now the education sector must ask itself how it can prepare young people for the battle against climate change.
In response to the recent protests, a government official told the Guardian that “children are very engaged, otherwise they would not be joining protests” and that this “shows they are obviously being taught quite well”. Well, those students taking part in the protests were engaged, but very few of my pupils knew it was even happening or understood why the protesters were so upset. Are schools failing to fulfil a potential duty to inform their students about the situation?
The newly updated KS4 science curriculum shows promise. In physics, students learn about renewable and non-renewable energy sources; in chemistry they study the carbon cycle and greenhouse effect; in biology they learn about biodiversity loss and methods of conservation. Exam questions ask about the consequences of global warming and directly link it to carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases being released excessively into the atmosphere. What is missing, however, is a way of bringing it all together; to show how the situation is likely to affect young people’s lives within a few years.
Projections of societal collapse, famine and war are not fearmongering: they must be taken seriously. It is never enjoyable to startle and worry children, but we have a duty to inform them of the issues.
We need more detail in the GCSE science curriculum, especially in terms of how renewable energy sources work, and I would like to see more information and debate about the consequences of not lowering carbon dioxide emissions or not rapidly acting to protect biodiversity.
The PSHE (personal, social, health and economic) education syllabus taught at schools has the potential to be expanded. A good PSHE programme should promote children’s personal and economic wellbeing and help them develop as individuals. Part of this should be to prepare them for the high-carbon legacy from previous generations.
Schools encourage charity fundraising and working within local communities. There now needs to be legislation to ensure they show the same diligence in protecting the planet’s future and preparing young people to be informed actors in their own futures.
The big revolutions of the young against the old in the past century, like the swinging 60s, were characterised by the introduction of new social values. But this burgeoning 21st-century revolt doesn’t have to be a revolution at all. Young or old, no one wants to lose key species of plants and animals. No one wants to be short of food or see their children displaced or harmed due to conflict from limited resources.
Some informed students of this country are simply prompting all adults, especially policy makers, to act on an issue which they ought already to be acting upon. We should stand in solidarity with them.

Those on the left applauded them for their brave moral stand. Jonathan Freedland – not without basis – pointed to the strike as evidence that children were acting more like adults than the adults. But on the right the focus seemed to be on chiding them and telling them to get back to school – from the prime minister’s spokesperson to Toby Young, who saw the children’s behaviour as an argument for raising the voting age to 21.
So far, so predictable. And then came the waves of abusive comments and tweets in response. Teachers who “support this strike should have their assets confiscated and [be] sent to work down the salt mines”. “Oh do shut up you total fucking arse” the actor James Purefoy tweeted at Young to his 107,000 followers.
With all this discord you wouldn’t blame any child, unsure of what they think about the strike, for wishing that the adults would all stop fighting and just play nicely. 
Who can blame young people for having little faith in adults when they see the chasm that separates what adults tell them and what they actually do themselves. It must seem to them that we are playing one huge game of Simon Says, where the object is to do the exact opposite of what we tell children to do. On a societal level we seem to be saying: do as I say, not as I do. So ask yourself: if you were a young person, would you really have much faith in adults to deal with the greatest challenge facing humanity when those selfsame adults – even teachers, such as me – are such blatant hypocrites? 
We tell children to treat each other how they wish to be treated themselves, yet the House of Commons regularly resembles a playground fight, with the different sides jeering and sneering at each other. In the streets, we blare our horns and shout obscenities at other drivers. We hurl abuse at the opposition during the football and scream angrily at powerless call-centre workers when we are unhappy about something. All the while, our children watch.
Just the other day, I took the children in my class to task for laughing too forcefully at the misfortune of one of their classmates. We talked about how they didn’t have the right to make another person feel worse about themselves, and I asked them to imagine how they would feel if they were in that child’s shoes. Fast-forward only a few hours, and I sat laughing as Jeremy Corbyn mocked the transport minister for yet another mistake. MPs, and indeed all of us, relish this sort of thing. Many a standup’s career is made from perfecting the pithy putdown.
Our hypocrisy doesn’t stop there. As parents, families and teachers we tell children that mistakes are a good thing and that they are proof you are trying, a chance to learn. And yet we are far less forgiving when we are asked to put this in to practice as adults. Errors – true or perceived – by politicians, business leaders, sports people and co-workers are pounced on as evidence of their incompetence, unsuitability and negligence.
Is it any wonder that so few of us are good at accepting responsibility for our mistakes when the response to doing so is damning? Just think how rarely we hear someone say: “Sorry. I was wrong.” Even when those words are uttered, more often than not they’re qualified by a conditional “if you misunderstood me” or “if anyone took offence”. It makes it hard to muster the audacity to stand in front of a class of young children and tell them to grow up and start taking responsibility for their actions.
In my classroom in Spain, as in most others, “partner talk” is an essential part of most lessons. Children are encouraged to share their thinking with their partner and we even take time out to practise listening effectively. “Listen to understand rather than just to respond,” I tell them all. Because that’s how adults behave, isn’t it?
I’ve stopped listening to BBC Radio 4’s The Moral Maze and Question Time as I just can’t cope with how little anyone actually listens (Melanie Phillips could learn a thing or two from my year 6 class). The contributors seem to have their idea of what the other person thinks – and is going to say – and will respond to this rather than what is actually said. But it’s not just in politics: I regularly argue with my wife about something she has said only to find out 10 minutes later that we were saying the same thing all along.
The more you think about the depth of our hypocrisy, the worse it gets. We shouldn’t physically hurt others, we say, and yet violence is glorified in films, sport and music. Being different is good, we tell children, yet we live in monolithic echo chambers, cross the road to avoid people acting “weird” and pull funny looks if someone does something out of the ordinary in a public place. Knowledge is power, we say, yet experts are derided and belittled at every turn. Clever people are nerds, often figures of fun.
And that brings me to the biggest hypocrisy of all, the mantra that you need to work hard to get ahead. Should our children really believe this when there is so much evidence to the contrary? Yes, we have inspiring examples, famous and non-famous, whom we can point to. But with social mobility decreasing, unthinkable amounts of wealth being held by just a tiny percentage of the population, and with an upswell in racism and bigotry across the western world, it stretches credulity to breaking point to suggest hard work is all that is needed for success.
Maybe, just maybe, if we as adults actually started practising what we preached then our children wouldn’t need to go on strike and could instead focus on their own futures. But for the time being, with the adult world so filled with hypocrisy and inaction, I’m glad we have an ever increasing group of young people who aren’t listening to their elders, and instead are being seen and heard.

Beyond a certain point, it becomes irrational. To get or follow instructions from an OCD cleaner is very problematic – just look at the extent of her daily routines (and the amount of water she uses for washing).
With OCD, a vivid imagination will supply all the motivation needed to spend every waking moment fighting against “dirt” seen or unseen. To those who have it, it is no joke; even worse is how the psychology can leach into the imaginary metaphysical world, with whole races, classes and genders becoming stigmatised as “unclean”.
Instead of condoning this new disinfectant onslaught, promoted by advertising and media articles like this one, but with very little epidemiological basis, we should be discussing the possible effects of excessive hygiene and its weakening effect on the human immune system. The simple tools designed for bacteria cannot fight viruses. Luckily, apart from the professional cleaners there were a few “normal” experts who were more relaxed about cleaning issues. Balances have to be struck. Humans are tough old animals and a bit of dirt may be no bad thing.Virginia SmithAuthor of Clean: A History of Personal Hygiene and Purity, London

• Rarely has an article in the Guardian so enraged me. In these days of heightened climate change awareness you have experts who encourage washing tea towels daily and washing bath towels daily. Who are these people? Apart from the blindingly obvious fact that bath towels dry theoretically clean people is the expert completely oblivious to issues such as water scarcity, carbon-producing energy to power her machines, microfibres being released into our ever more polluted waterways and eventually the sea? Heaven forbid that after washing her towels daily she then tumble dries them – such a delicate person I am sure would never use anything so practical as an outdoor washing line (think of all those nasty birds flying around who might drop something on the drying). The article gave out such a bad message. We should be washing less, not more.Nicky FordGuildford, Surrey

The demonstrators – who carried Teach the Truth, Rebel for Life and Climate: More Important Than Brexit banners – urged the government to make the climate and ecological crisis an educational priority.
The protest organised by the Extinction Rebellion group, which has been taking place during the half-term holiday, was also a show of solidarity for 10,000 pupils who missed classes last Friday to express their frustration at the world’s failure to reduce emissions, inspired by 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, who staged the first school strike.
The organiser, Tim Jones, a secondary school teacher from Lewisham in south-east London, told the gathering that the education system was failing to address the complex reality of climate change and biodiversity loss. He said: “The current system teaches children to conform, not to question things. This conformity breeds the denial that is exacerbating the problems. What we need now is action. That’s what we have seen from children and students and that is now what we need from adults.”
The protesters met at Old Palace Yard in Westminster and marched to the DfE offices on Great Smith Street. They blocked the road and heard speeches from Prof David Humphreys of the Open University, Dr Anne Andrews of the University of Cambridge and Dr Alison Green, a former pro vice-chancellor of Arden University who recently organised a letter signed by more than 200 academics in support of the Youth 4 Climate Strike.
The teachers and students performed a pantomime lesson, with mock chairs and desk, and heaps of chalk, to highlight the curriculum’s light coverage of a topic that will shape the lives of young people.
The protesters claimed the UK government had failed to live up to the Paris agreement in which it pledged to enhance education on climate change. They said climate change was treated, at best, as a peripheral subject and that the weak emphasis on the topic meant some state students could go through all 11 years of compulsory education with just 10 classes on climate change out of a total of more than 10,000.
“Sometimes I wonder, what’s the point of teaching when no one is teaching the truth about the future?” said Andrew Thompson, a 33-year-old teacher.
Green said she was speaking on behalf of fellow academics in expressing solidarity with the student strikers. “Like them, I fear for the future of the planet,” she said. “Young people are striving at school to gain qualifications to fulfil personal goals and aspirations. They trust the government but the government is letting them down and squandering their future.”
The DfE said climate change was included in the curriculum. The education secretary, Damian Hinds, has criticised the young strikers. He said: “Missing class won’t do a thing to help the environment; all they will do is create extra work for teachers.”
Many were inspired by students. Edmund Stubbs, a secondary school science teacher based in east London, wrote in the Guardian: “Seeing young people abandon their studies for a day and claim to be taking their future into their own hands should make any teacher uneasy and it has led me to question my role as a secondary school science teacher.”
The demonstration is the latest in a wave of climate protests that are disrupting an increasingly wide range of locations and institutions.
On Monday, dozens of Extinction Rebellion activists held up traffic outside a London fashion event. In December, the BBC’s central London headquarters was put on lockdown after campaigners rallied outside to demand the national broadcaster declare a “climate and ecological emergency”.
More than 100 Extinction Rebellion activists were arrested in November when protesters blocked five London bridges and glued themselves to the doors of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. There have also been demonstrations outside the Scottish parliament and in the centre of Manchester.
Extinction Rebellion, which started in the UK less than a year ago, now has groups in dozens of countries and plans to stage a week of disruption from 15 April.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/22/teachers-and-students-stage-mock-climate-classes-national-curriculum

The former vice-president met people in Hayneville, near Montgomery, and heard them describe dire sanitary conditions as open pools of sewage pockmarked their lawns after a night of heavy rain.
Later Gore told a town hall gathering that he found the conditions “shocking and tragic”. It’s all connected to the climate crisis, he told the 100-plus crowd crowd, referencing “rain bombs” from the ever-growing number of annual hurricanes hitting the south-east.
Gore visited with civil rights campaigner the Rev William Barber, and Catherine Flowers, the director and founder of Alabama Center for Rural Enterprise. Gore drew connections between poverty, ecological devastation and systemic social inequality.
Lowndes county’s open-piping sewage – and its long-term effect residents’ health – has been documented by reports from the United Nations and studies on tropical diseases which show that some illnesses such as hookworm are making a comeback in areas where it was once thought eradicated.
“This looks like the civil rights movement never took,” Barber said, staring down at the patchwork of sewage at his feet and walking around the brown liquid taking up much of the street. The area feet away from this neighborhood, Barber said, made up the route of the march Martin Luther King took from Selma to Montgomery in the 1960s.
There is very little sewage infrastructure in Lowndes county, Flowers told the Guardian, echoing similar sentiments from 2017 when she estimated 80% of the county remained uncovered by a municipal sewerage system, leaving some residents to find their own solutions.
“The problems that are visible [in Hayneville] and the solutions that would work here are integrally connected to the problems that are being seen in the world right now, and the solutions that would work right now,” Gore said, explaining why he chose to visit.
Jerome Means, a 63-year-old African American resident showed Gore the sewage running into his yard and home. Behind his one-storey brick home is a sewage lagoon, a pond full of raw, brown liquid. Gore asked him how many times it had to be pumped.
“Three times a week!” Gore shouted in disbelief when he heard the answer, his voice rising. On top of that, Means, a retired city employee who has lived in Hayneville for 20 years, pays a “sewage fee” to avoid such overflows.
“The problem is that, in these communities, they’ve applied these cheap fixes that don’t work,” Flowers said. “And with climate change it has only gotten worse.”
A sewage truck comes by every three days to pump out the mess, Meanes explained. “If not, it would fill out the yard.” As if on cue, a few minutes later, a sewage truck came by and its driver greeted Means by name.
Across the street, 70-year-old Charlie May Holcombe keeps her great-grandchildren away from their outdoor swing set as sewage covers its base. She can’t remember the last time the children were able to play outside the home. And they’re not even safe from sewage inside the house.
“I’ve replaced the carpet more times than I can count,” Holcombe, a great-grandmother, said as she sat the top of her driveway, just feet away from the sewage line. Her great-grandchildren ran toward the chain-link fence, trying to play in the brown liquid, but Holcombe shooed them away.
“Nobody cares about us,” she told Barber and Gore. Both men each took a hand and listened as she cried. “We’re going to try to get help,” Gore said.
“Almost every person is dying from cancer, asthma, heart trouble. I tell you something is wrong. All of us are suffering from the same thing,” Holcombe said. “Why is nobody researching it?” she kept asking. Holcombe has congenital heart disease.
Gore said the area needed a systemic solution – not emergency stop-gaps like sewage trucks.
“The cost of sending that truck out there three days a week instead of treating the asthma, cancer and other diseases that doctors suspect are so strongly related to these conditions … you add up all those costs, just on sheer economic ground alone, it would make sense to fix this and extend the sewage treatment infrastructure out there,” he said.
Before Means goes back into his house, he told the Guardian he was leaving his home in Hayneville but was unsure where he will go. He said he was tired of the constant struggle with sewage, the stench, the frustration.
Though Means had not told Gore he was leaving, Gore alluded to Means’ plight later in the day. “Maybe we need to treat them as environmental refugees,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/22/al-gore-alabama-environmental-justice-climate-worse

Faecal bacteria in the pungent, murky waters have risen in recent years to up to six times the recommended levels.
Once a raging torrent, the lower Jordan has been starved of water to become a stagnant stream, filled with sewage and dirty run-off from farms. Around 95% of its historical flow has been diverted by agriculture during the past half-century. And the river’s primary source, the Sea of Galilee – where Christians believe the son of God walked on water – has for years been dammed to prevent its demise.
Biblical bodies of water in the Holy Land, eternalised in Christian, Jewish and Muslim ancient texts as godly, are now facing very human threats: climate change, mismanagement and conflict.
Following five consecutive years of drought, the Sea of Galilee has sunk to a 100-year low. A number of small islands have emerged at the water’s surface, and several holiday homes that were built on the shoreline now stand at least 100 metres from the boggy edge.
Overuse has also taken its toll. Last summer, the level of the lake dropped close to a black line, a level at which it could lose its status as a freshwater body. “The black line is our best guess of that point,” says Gidon Bromberg, the Israeli director of EcoPeace, an organisation of Israeli, Palestinian and Jordanian environmentalists. “It was tens of centimetres above the black line,” he says, adding that such a shallow depth has not been seen in records taken over the past century.
As the lake’s level falls, it cannot wash away salt fast enough, and its salinity rises. If the Sea of Galilee’s waters were left to hover around the black line, its flora and fauna would start to perish. A glimpse of the lake’s grim future might be seen 350km downriver at the lowest place on the planet: the Dead Sea, a body almost devoid of fish and plant life. “Once the lake becomes saline, that could be irreversible,” says Bromberg, speaking at the muddy edge of the water, reeds poking up behind him.
As Israel’s largest lake, the Sea of Galilee – which locals call the Kinneret, its Hebrew name – has long been the country’s main source of fresh water. But it cannot be relied on any more, says Yoav Barkay-Arbel, an engineer for Mekorot, the national water company. Standing at the Eshkol water pumping station on the peak of a hill, Barkay-Arbel looks across a series of reservoirs and intricate piping systems. Zionists in the early 1920s had intended to use the lake in the green, lush north to supply water to the arid south and “make the desert bloom”. A network of pipes from the Sea of Galilee, which is 214 metres below sea level, link to surrounding hills and then down towards the coast.
At its peak, the installation pumped hundreds of millions of cubic metres of water from Galilee to the rest of Israel. As fears grew that such volumes would deplete the lake, the plant has reduced to moving just 20m cubic metres per year. “That is zero. That is nothing. It’ll remain practically zero for the next couple of years,” says Barkay-Arbel, adding that Galilee supplies will now only be used in emergencies.
In a rush to save the lake, Israel is now looking at reversing the flow. Over the next few years it will spend millions of shekels moving seawater, desalinated at plants on the coast, 75km up to the Sea of Galilee.
Israel is a world leader in desalination, with five plants built along the Mediterranean coast. However, the Eshkol station was never meant to move water east instead of west. Open canals, built by engineers in the 1950s at a slight angle to improve water flow, still cut through the land. But they are at the wrong angle, and so a new pipe is being constructed along their side. “They never thought they would have to fill the lake with artificial water,” says Barkay-Arbel. “That is crazy. You cannot count on nature.” Nevertheless, the current plan is to be moving water in the next couple of years.
Saving the Sea of Galilee could, in turn, save the river Jordan, says Bromberg. He has campaigned to reopen the dam that blocks the lake from flowing into the Jordan. Without it, the river’s fragile ecosystem will deteriorate drastically and it could turn into a dry river bed. Five years ago, Israel agreed to release 9m cubic metres from the Sea of Galilee, a tiny amount of water, the first time its waters had run uninterrupted into the river since the 1960s. But hundreds of cubic metres will be needed to fully rehabilitate the river.
The source of the river is now a small creek, with two pipes each less than half a metre wide that pump out water. A third pipe releases yellowish liquid. This is treated sewage – not ideal, Bromberg says, but better than nothing.
As long as the Sea of Galilee is under threat, the river Jordan will be too. And their eventual deaths could have explosive ramifications as water in this region has been a key source of conflict. The river Jordan is shared by Israel, the occupied Palestinian territories, Jordan and Syria, all of which use its depleting reserves.
“Israel takes half, Syria and Jordan take the other half,” says Bromberg. “Because it’s a war zone, they take everything … The mindset of conflict leads to the complete demise of the river Jordan.”
In 2000, Syria’s then president, Hafez al-Assad, father of the current president, Bashar, turned down a deal to end three decades of on-off war on the basis that Israel refused to give him back access to the north-eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee. The prime minister at the time, Ehud Barak, ran on the campaign slogan: “No Syrian soldiers will splash their feet in the Kinneret.” Israeli forces had taken over the entire area in 1967.
Israel has retained hold of all the water resources in the Palestinian territories, where residents suffer regular shortages and often have to pay large amounts for private water lorry deliveries. In Gaza, which is under a tight Israeli-Egyptian blockade, most water is unsafe to drink.
“While Israel has become a trailblazer in the field of water technology, the failure to reach a fair water allocation and management agreement between Israelis and Palestinians is putting the Palestinian water sector under huge stress and continues to breed animosity that will only accelerate under climate change,” says a recent report by EcoPeace.
Israel also relied on the Sea of Galilee’s waters to forge a 1994 peace treaty with Jordan, agreeing to pump 55m cubic metres a year to its former enemy. That continues today, a deal that cannot be broken without diplomatic fallout, making the desalination project ever more critical.
EcoPeace hopes that good water management will spur on peace to the region. Bromberg is now advocating for a deal in which Israel, which is on the Mediterranean, supplies desalinated water to Jordan. In exchange, Jordan, which is low on water but full of open desert with 320 sunny days a year, will supply solar power.
In the meantime, the river Jordan remains polluted. Most Christian pilgrims who want to be baptised in the holy waters do not venture to the original site where John the Baptist is believed to have led Jesus into the water. That location is in the occupied Palestinian territories next to Jordan, and the Israeli army mined it decades ago. Pilgrims were only allowed to return some years ago.
Authorities have instead promoted another attraction about 110km north in Israel. The Yardenit baptismal site was built in the early 1980s and welcomes half a million visitors each year. Here the water is clean as it is pumped from the Sea of Galilee into a holding area. Bromberg calls it a “man-made swimming pool”. Dozens of people in white gowns wait in line, walking through metal fences into the water, before being plunged below. A colossal gift shop sells bibles and religious trinkets, and customers can buy small bottles filled with water and stones from the plunge pool – three for 57 shekels, or around £12. Visitors can buy or rent white gowns for baptisms. A cafe outside sells ice-cream.
One day, the masses may return to the original site. And as the end of the winter approaches, authorities say an unusually rainy season has given the Sea of Galilee some relief and broken a five-year drought. As the snow melts in the north, they hope the water level will continue to rise.
But a rainy winter goes against the trend, and in a few short months the hot summer will evaporate the lake again, possibly taking it back down or below the black line. “It would be an ecological disaster,” says Bromberg.

The former UN secretary general said he was deeply concerned that the UK’s export credit agency had provided billions of pounds in recent years to support businesses involved in oil and gas schemes around the world.
“These figures and policies are hard to reconcile with the UK’s commitments under the Paris agreement,” said Ban, referring to the  international climate deal he forged in 2015 as UN chief.
“The time has come for the UK to change course, in the interests of the whole world,” he wrote in a comment piece for the Guardian.
He said the funding was at odds with warning given by Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, who has said climate change will lead to financial crises.
Ban rarely comments on specific climate change policies of individual countries, and made clear he believed that the UK could continue to be a leader on the issue.
But he said: “The UK now faces a crucial opportunity to live up to the prime minister’s words [on climate action] and prove it is serious about phasing out the use of fossil fuels worldwide, and not only on its own territory.”
The former South Korean diplomat’s comments on UK Export Finance (UKEF), which provides lines of credit and insurance to help companies win business overseas, are the first time he has singled out a country’s credit export agency. “There is now a growing consensus that fossil fuels should not be funded in any way by export finance organisations,” he said.
Ban, who is part of a group of former world leaders known as the Elders, cited the World Bank’s policy on oil and gas financing and the Swedish equivalent of UKEF’s decision to stop funding fossil fuel companies.
Mary Creagh, chair of a committee of MPs investigating the scale and impact of UKEF funding for oil and gas schemes, said: “Mr Ban is right that UKEF’s support for fossil fuel projects overseas is incompatible with the UK’s leading role in the fight against climate change.”
The Environmental Audit Committee said UKEF was estimated to have given £551m of support to fossil fuel production between 2014 and 2016. Between 2010 and 2014, more than 99% of its funding for energy went to fossil fuels, despite a coalition government pledge to stop funding such “dirty” projects.
Labour has said it would redirect UKEF towards low carbon energy projects if it came to power, following the agency’s “overwhelming” support for fossil fuel projects.
More than a tenth of the export credit agency’s budget, £1.5bn, was allocated for the oil and gas sector in 2017. UKEF has increased its exposure to the oil sector, according to its latest annual report, due to opportunities in Asia and South America.
And the agency said it was ready to support more fossil fuel projects overseas. “There is a pipeline of new business in both the oil and gas and petrochemical sectors given the strong credentials of UK exporters in these areas,” it said.
Recent projects supported by the UK include oil and gas fields off the coast of Ghana, a major gas pipeline in Oman and software for an oil firm in Argentina.
A UKEF spokesperson said: “The UK government’s priority, at home and abroad, is to encourage international opportunities for UK businesses – ensuring they can build fruitful relationships with overseas partners and contribute to economic growth around the world.
“We are committed to high standards of environmental, social and human rights risk management.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/24/ban-ki-moon-britain-stop-invest-fossil-fuels-overseas

Yet another exercise in throwing money at a problem without meaning to solve the problem, just another in the long list of wastrel ""policy"" approaches of the Koalition.

Seem the ""friends of the Koalition"" are able to receive, quite often without contract scrutiny, large sums with little accountability over use of said funds, a marked difference in attitude to those on Centrelink, and a marked difference in the amounts available to individuals.
Of course the major culprits in this exercise with PM Muckeysums are the carbon-based industries, while Glencore shareholders have seemingly taken the great leap froward by closing all new coal mines, the Koalition still has its head in the sand promoting each and every aspect of the carbon-based industries. Calls for greater fracking, off shore gas extraction, oil and more coal sales remain at the forefront of the Koalitions Klimate change policies(think of the money they bring to the economy, not how much we will need to pay to fix up the problems they create here and globally). 
Meet the new PM Muckeysums, same as the last two PM's Abbutt and Trumble, environmental ignoramuses policy wise who have left us as a country behind the rest of the world in tackling this specific problem. Rather than follow the scientific evidence they have deliberately frustrated every attempt to resolve the issues around Climate Change, and only now, we the Australian public must believe, that the scales have fallen from their Koalition, political eyes, now with an election a few months away, and the wrath of the public over years of deliberate climate change inactivity firmly in the grip of their election pencil.', u'recommendation_count': u'3', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1551057046000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'15495355', u'id': u'126241059', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Joey Rocca', u'text': u'Even Sky News calls bullshit.......

'The President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, said Thursday that a quarter of the European Union’s (EU) budget would be spent on tackling climate change. 
“In the next financial period, 2021 to 2027, every fourth euro spent within the EU budget will go towards climate mitigation actions,” Juncker said. “That is our goal, to ensure that a fourth of the budget goes towards climate change mitigation, and this is going to be a paradigm shift,” he added. The EU budget is usually one percent of its economic output, or 1 trillion euros ($1.13 trillion) across seven years, according to Reuters. 
'Juncker’s comments came after Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old climate activist from Sweden, spoke at the same plenary session of the European Economic and Social Committee in Brussels. “We know that most politicians don’t want to talk to us,” she said. “Good. We don’t want to talk to them either,” she added. “We want them to talk to the scientists instead.""'

Attempting to draw a line over years of destructive in-fighting within the Coalition that has cruelled various emissions reduction policies, the prime minister will use a speech in Melbourne on Monday to launch a new package of measures on climate change, saying his government acknowledges and accepts the challenge “but we do so with cool heads, not just impassioned hearts”.
The emissions reduction fund is a vestige of Abbott’s heavily criticised Direct Action policy. Funded by taxpayers initially at $2.5bn, the ERF pays farmers and businesses to cut carbon dioxide pollution to below what it would otherwise be. But an investigation by Guardian Australia last year found it was often difficult to determine if the fund was offering value for money.
Malcolm Turnbull, who once branded the approach “a recipe for fiscal recklessness on a grand scale”, let the ERF dwindle to almost nothing as he pursued policy alternatives, including the national energy guarantee resisted by conservatives and dumped by Morrison shortly after he took the Liberal leadership last year.
Morrison will confirm on Monday the ERF will be rebadged a “climate solutions fund” and given a 10-year funding profile. The rebooted fund will partner with farmers, local governments and businesses to deliver “practical climate solutions” across the economy that reduce carbon emissions.
The prime minister will also continue to assert that Australia will meet its Paris target despite the trend of rising emissions in the economy that has been evident in the government’s own figures since the abolition of the carbon price in 2013.
But a chart released in advance of Monday’s speech makes it clear the looming abatement exercise will rely significantly on accounting measures as well as on practical emissions reduction.
According to projections done last December, the government will count a 367 megatonne abatement from carry-over credits (an accounting system that allows countries to count carbon credits from exceeding their targets under the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol periods against their Paris commitment for 2030) to help meet the 2030 target.
It is also factoring in emissions reduction from Turnbull’s pet project, the Snowy 2.0 expansion (which the Morrison government has not yet formally signed off on); energy efficiency measures; an electric vehicle strategy (that it has not yet unveiled); the rebadged climate solutions fund; additional hydro projects and just under 100Mt of abatement from “technology solutions” (which aren’t specified) and “other sources of abatement” such as projects under development but not yet contracted.
The government says examples of projects to be assisted under its rebadged ERF will include funding for remote indigenous communities to reduce severe bushfires in rural and remote areas; support for small business to replace lighting, air conditioning and refrigeration systems to help reduce energy costs; drought proofing on farms; and support for local communities to reduce waste and increasing recycling rates.
Liberal MPs have been lobbying the leadership to pull together a package of climate measures, with many reporting a significant voter backlash about the Coalition’s destructive record on climate policy.
Strategists for both major parties report that after a summer characterised by extreme weather and prolonged heatwaves, voters are more concerned about climate change now than they have been at any time since 2007.
Liberals are also under fire in their electoral heartland from small “l” liberal independents campaigning on the Coalition’s poor record on climate change, highlighting past behaviour like cutting the renewable energy target and attempting to abolish agencies like the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and Arena.
Morrison will on Monday attempt a course correction, saying the government is committed to “meaningful, practical action on climate change, without damaging our economy or the family budget”.
“We will continue to play our part in meeting the global challenge of climate change in the 21st century,” the prime minister will say. “We will do so without taking a sledgehammer to our economy. Without putting our electricity market at risk. Without putting pressure on electricity prices. Without destroying jobs in our traditional industries and in regional Australia.
“This is the responsible and balanced course. And we must stay the course”.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/25/scott-morrison-to-reboot-tony-abbotts-emissions-reduction-fund-with-2bn

And this one, I almost choked on my vanilla slice. ""The coalition didn't used to believe in Medicare, they wanted to sell it off, ""
They still do not believe in Medicare, and they still want to sell it off, they are still looking to find a way to do it without losing any votes and to be able to put more public funds into the pockets of their donors. The LNP since Fraser has been trying to get rid of Medicare and to some degree they have succeeded by chocking it of funds, while giving billions of public funds to private corporations. Given one eighth of a chance they would sell it in a nanosecond, if they could just find that magic door that allowed them to do it without the public knowing about it.
This far right government would get rid of all government services to the private sector, they have said that is their aim, if they could find a way of doing it without losing the majority of even their rusted on base.

The brief to Labor MPs from the Stop Adani campaign says the group is looking for a commitment that “if elected, we will review the federal environmental approval and if the evidence supports it, we will not hesitate to revoke it”.

Scott Morrison is talking constructively about climate change because he is intelligent enough to understand that failing to do that renders the Coalition unelectable in parts of the country, and with parts of its own base.
Compared with where we’ve been, a Liberal prime minister standing up at a podium, accepting the science of climate change and making the case for action, is progress.
We need to acknowledge it.
But this isn’t, ultimately, a test of talking points.
It has to be a test of substance, and a test of whether or not you are prepared to be a grown-up government facing up to a significant policy problem – and the truth is the Coalition has been here before.
Right on this spot.
John Howard had a very similar epiphany in 2007, delivering a speech in Melbourne within sight of an election in much the same way Morrison did on Monday. Like Morrison, Howard knew the Coalition needed to switch course on climate policy because Australians then, like now, were fretting about extreme weather and the droughts that never seemed to end.
Howard signed the Liberal party up to emissions trading during his 2007 pivot. But after he lost the election to Kevin Rudd, madness descended inside the Coalition, and raged in full public view for a decade, with that madness killing most of the optimal policy solutions for dealing with emissions reduction.
Morrison needed to put forward a serious policy program that is an implicit apology for past misdeeds. He didn't
While Morrison would like us to think that was all a bit of a bad dream, and the Coalition has actually been tremendous on climate policy despite all the compelling evidence to the contrary, the truth is the madness still defines the parameters of the policy.
Monday’s climate policy pivot reflects Morrison’s limited options. He’s unveiled a reboot of Tony Abbott’s Direct Action policy, kicking in more cash to the emissions reduction fund (although the cash only pans out at $200m a year), and giving it a new business card.
This mechanism will deliver some abatement, a significant chunk according to the government’s own projections, but the persistent question over the ERF as a mechanism (apart from why taxpayers have to pay, as opposed to big polluters) has always been whether it delivers any abatement beyond what would have happened anyway.
To put it simply: you can call the ERF a Climate Solutions Fund if you like, but giving it a reassuring sounding new name does not transform it into a mechanism designed to do the heavy lifting on emissions reduction that really needs to happen.
I could call myself Beyoncé too if I wanted to. It wouldn’t make me Beyoncé, sadly.
Other elements of the putative reboot include (probably) helping to build an interconnector between Tasmania and the mainland to maximise the potential of hydro (which is a useful development), and (presumably) pressing ahead with the Snowy 2.0 project that has been ready to go since last December. Despite not yet signing up to the expansion, the government has already built Snowy into its projections for meeting the Paris target. Nifty, huh?
There’s also something coming on electric vehicles, but there is no sign yet of an emissions standard for vehicles that would have any prospect of reducing pollution meaningfully from the transport sector. Flag that sort of thing and Nationals start rhapsodising about man’s inviolable right to his SUV.
The government is also failing to bite the bullet in other ways. We are building a big chunk of carry-over credits into our projections for meeting the Paris target, which you might be more sanguine about if there was evidence of a real emissions reduction plan, with real teeth, lined up against a bit of creative accounting to ameliorate some of the short to medium-term dislocation associated with transitioning a carbon intensive economy such as Australia’s to a low-emissions economy.
Just one more problem. You also have to line up Monday’s “climate solutions” pivot with the climate problem the government will create for itself if it proceeds to lock in more coal-fired power to Australia’s energy grid, underwritten by taxpayers, which is what the energy minister, Angus Taylor, keeps hinting he wants to do.
In order to hit reset on climate policy in a way that has some prospect of cutting through with the cohort of voters inclined to desert the government over this issue, and this issue alone, Morrison needed to do two things on Monday.
He needed to say sorry for all of that insanity. He needed to say I don’t know what came over us, but we aren’t going to do that again.
Prime ministers can do that in two ways. The first is to just say it, but that’s very hard for risk-averse politicians who equate public acts of humility with public acts of weakness.
The second is do it by implication: put forward a serious policy program that is an implicit apology for past misdeeds, and in so doing, project that you are prepared to stare down any internal brinkmanship that ensues.
That didn’t happen on Monday, and it didn’t happen on Monday because we all know what happens when the Coalition hits these particular tipping points.
Just ask Malcolm Turnbull.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/commentisfree/2019/feb/25/if-the-coalition-has-had-a-climate-epiphany-im-beyonce

To that we can now add warnings against green, pink, orange and black snow, as new evidence of our trashing of the planet is now being etched out on the most pristine of environments – our dwindling snow caps.
A spate of incidents in Russia has grabbed internet attention. Residents of Siberian towns watched with dismay as the snow around them turned green and black, with toxic emissions forcing some to wear masks. These seem to be connected to local factories, with a chrome plant in particular behind the green snow, and, as protests gather pace, the Putin government has come under pressure.
Snow pollution is not new. Campaigners have been warning for years of the dangers of dark snow, – black, brown and grey streaks across the ice that can be clearly seen from the air above Arctic regions – because of its effects on climate change. Dark snow is stained by black carbon, AKA soot – unburnt particles released by the combustion of fossil fuels in coal-fired power plants, factories and other sources, and carried to the ice caps on the wind. When soot falls on white snow, it is not only an aesthetic disaster: reflective snow and ice enhance the earth’s albedo ((the ability of a surface to reflect sunlight), bouncing light and heat back into space, but dark snow absorbs heat instead, accelerating global warming. Eliminating soot could slow climate change, helping to reduce temperatures by up to 0.5C.
Snow is sometimes stained by natural phenomena. Chlamydomonas nivalis algae can make it appear pink or red, an effect documented by scientists since the 19th century. Orange snow spreading across eastern Europe last year may have been from particles of dust and sand from the Sahara, though pollution was a more likely cause of orange snowfalls in Siberia a decade earlier.
As far as eating snow goes, don’t try the white stuff. Researchers in Canada found in 2017 that melting urban snow releases a cocktail of toxic chemicals, largely from car exhausts, trapped in the snow from polluted air. Snow in its beauty has always exercised a hold over our imaginations, symbolising purity and transcendence, harking back to a mythical state of innocence. As the snow around us stains black, grey, brown, green and the rest, there could hardly be a more potent emblem of our runaway global problem with pollution.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/shortcuts/2019/feb/25/what-russias-green-snow-reveals-about-the-rise-of-pollution

The protesters – who planned for the arrests – were led with their hands behind their backs to a police bus as supporters chanted: “Which side are you on now? Which side are you on?” They filled the Republican leader’s office and the hallway outside, with constituents from his home state of Kentucky telling stories about poverty and their fears of the human cost of climate change.
The group, the Sunrise Movement, which included high schoolers, demanded to talk to McConnell about the Green New Deal (GND), a proposal introduced by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey. The GND would radically reduce greenhouse gases and try to lessen social inequity. Republicans have condemned it, and some Democrats have said it is not feasible in the 10-year timeframe proposed.
McConnell has said the Senate will vote on the proposal, in a move that could put centrist Democrats in a difficult position. The Sunrise Movement called McConnell’s plans for a vote a “shameful ploy”. They say he has fought any action to stall global warming.
A staffer greeted the group and took down contact information. Protesters from Kentucky said they have repeatedly sought meetings with McConnell.
Robert Steurer, a spokesman for McConnell, said: “As with all Kentuckians visiting DC, we welcomed them to the office today. It’s worth noting that two weeks before, Senator McConnell had already announced that he will be bringing the Green New Deal up for a vote in the US Senate. Also last week, Senator McConnell’s state director met with a group of students from the organization in the Louisville office to discuss the issue.”
One protester from Kentucky, Jenny Bencomo-Suarez, yelled inside McConnell’s office: “He has not answered a damn voicemail.”
She said: “He has consistently denied access to us – access to resources, access to jobs, living wages, healthcare and the right to sustain ourselves in a livable, breathable future.”
Destine Rigsby, a 17-year-old from Louisville, said of McConnell, who did not appear: “You line your pockets while we die in floods and choke on the air we breathe, yet you don’t even have the decency to look us in the eyes.”
Last week, California Democratic senator Dianne Feinstein faced criticism over her response to a group of children and teenagers from Sunrise who were also asking her to support the GND.
A video of the incident went viral on Twitter after Feinstein appeared to lecture the youngsters. The group later accused her of reacting “with smugness + disrespect”.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/25/mitch-mcconnell-protest-young-climate-activists-green-new-deal

Kelly took issue with the characterisation of climate change in the textbook Pearson History New South Wales.
Kelly has written to the NSW education minister, Rob Stokes, saying the book’s description of Tony Abbott as a climate change denier was “an offensive slur equating it with Holocaust deniers”, the Daily Telegraph reported.
The book says: “Climate change is noticeable in Australia, with more extreme frequent weather events such as the 2002-06 drought or the 2010-11 Queensland floods.”
“That is simply an inaccurate statement that is in a school history book,” Kelly told parliament’s federation chamber last week.
“What chance do we have of forming the best policies in this nation to deal with fire, floods and drought if we have children being misled by incorrect information in our history books?”
He quoted Dorothea Mackellar’s poem My Country to argue contemporary natural disasters are nothing out of the ordinary: “I love a sunburnt country, a land of sweeping plains, of ragged mountain ranges, of droughts and flooding rains,” the poem says.
“We need to understand that we live in that same country that Dorothea Mackellar wrote about over a hundred years ago,” Kelly said.
“That is why we need to prepare and help people recover from their resources instead of wasting money pretending that we can change the weather.”
The Australian Bureau of Meterology says “one of the greatest impacts of climate variability and climate change occurs through changes in the frequency and severity of extreme events.”
It describes the 2011 Brisbane floods as the second-highest flood level of the last 100 years, after January 1974.
The bureau and CSIRO’s latest State of the Climate report said Australia was experiencing more extreme heat, longer fire seasons, rising oceans and more marine heatwaves, consistent with a changing climate.
A spokeswoman for the publisher Pearson backed the book.
“Pearson builds textbooks to support the Australian curriculum and we stand by this text book and its author,” she said.
Nonetheless, Stokes said he was writing to Pearson about Kelly’s concerns.
“It is very important that texts present information in a balanced way so that students can make up their own minds on important issues,” he said in a statement.
Stokes has previously criticised Abbott’s climate change stance, warning against “populist anti-intellectualism” from public figures.
The NSW school history curriculum does not specifically mention climate change and there is no mandatory textbook set.
While the state government sets the syllabus, it does not write or set the textbooks.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/26/publisher-rejects-craig-kelly-complaint-school-textbook-inaccurate-on-climate-change

That is flatly untrue. I've explained how isotopes of Oxygen are the key indicator and why they differ. When you expressed disbelief that this could be a metric I explained how the ratio could be predicted. At no point have you explained what your issue is; you've just said people are wrong.

That is, ultimately, why AGW is a matter of belief, not evidence.
BQEND
Ignore your first lie for a moment. Assume it's true that all I'd said was that lots of eminent people say so, rather than explaining the actual process.

This is not religion. 
As it happens, I'm interested in climate science, and can provide a reasonable explanation of many of the more superficial points. But there's lots of science where I can't do this.
I don't know how cells malfunction to cause cancer, I don't understand the process of evolution in any detail, I don't how understand nuclear fission is controlled, I don't know how keyhole surgery is possible. 
Disputing the experts on all these things because I can't follow the reasoning is not intellectual atheism. It's rank stupidity.

This is absolutely untrue. If you want to question it there is reams of information you can look into. The scientific journals are full of disputes around climate science.

We asked you to share the signs where you are, and received thoughtful contributions and photographs from around the UK. After a warm weekend for much of Britain, Anna Markwell, in East Sussex, said: “It’s lovely, but worryingly mild.” Her sentiment was echoed in many of your stories; the flutter of butterflies and buzzing of bees is something to be savoured – but could their early appearance lead to environmental disaster? And could the need for an early antihistamine dose be the least of our problems in the coming years?
Below are some of your stories and photographs.
Patrick Green was one of many readers to share concern in his contribution (which included the image at the top of this piece, taken in north London’s Clissold Park).
“The scenes are very beautiful, and I’m very pleased with the pictures I took on 22 February, but I know I’m seeing them too early: climate change terrifies me,” he wrote. “Politicians are in a permanent state of denial and seem oblivious to what is staring them in the face. The weather on our shared planet is changing in dangerous and unpredictable ways and the future of humanity is at stake.”
Petr Skapa is also worried: “This wild plum tree grows alongside a public footpath where dog walkers, joggers, families with children and young couples are casually passing without even noticing it.
“I am perplexed by the apparent public indifference toward weather swings in the last 20 years. If the scientists are correct with their climate modelling, the swings are not only here to stay but are set to increase, causing havoc in living nature; forests, agriculture, everything will change, and not for the better. How this flowery demonstration of a trend toward a future laden with risks to water and food security doesn’t alarm everyone passing by is beyond me.”
Several readers contacted us to say they had been surprised to see butterflies around already. It is unusual to see a red admiral so early, according to Butterfly Conservation, but Anne Davison saw this specimen on 22 February, resting on an Edgeworthia chrysantha bush in her garden near Stamford, Lincolnshire.
Bees were also early visitors to gardens and parks near many of you. “They are around pollinating crocuses and there are a lot more flowers around in general,” says Julie Prescott, echoing many fellow readers’ surprise and concern for the creatures. “It’s a big contrast to 21 February last year, which was very snowy here in Blyton, Lincolnshire.”
Gareth Todd Jones, who keeps honey bees in the Rhondda valley, south Wales, remembers nursing them through a cold early 2018 and is struck by the difference this year: “Watching the way they are reacting to February temperatures that are really too high is fascinating. Honey bees are the ultimate evolvers, but I can’t help but be concerned!”
Andy Bell, in Burton upon Trent, sent this picture of frogspawn in his pond. Pools in Mark Palmer’s allotment in Ulverston, Cumbria, have also filled with spawn over the last week. “It is earlier by around two weeks than normal, perhaps because we have not yet had any really heavy frosts – being on the northern side of Morecambe Bay probably helps with sheltered weather.”
Veronica Love, in Dumfries and Galloway, shared a similar story. “Soft croaks on Sunday morning led me to the side of our garden pond where I watched two frogs mating – and a third trying and failing to muscle in. I expect frogspawn to appear soon, but it doesn’t stay long as the goldfish feast on it.”
Reports that the air is unusually perfumed this spring due to warm weather in 2018 are perhaps confirmed by Helen Garland, in Bristol. “These iris were inherited from my mother and my grandmother, and normally flower in April. They are a really old variety that have a scent, so it’s strange to see them already.”
Helen Evans, a reader in Ruthin, north Wales, notes down the first time she sees certain flowers each year. “I made a point of looking for violets on my walk on 23 February and did see a few growing next to a country lane. In 2016 the first violet was 12 March, 11 March in 2017 and 24 March last year.”
“It’s been incredibly warm,” says Courtney Hopf, in east London, another reader to note record snowfalls this time in 2018. “I know [parakeets] are essentially invasive pests, but seeing that flash of tropical green in London always gives me a little thrill. This parakeet and three others were busily nibbling this tree’s blossoms for hours last Friday.”
Foragers among you have been enjoying early crops. John Kelly said he’d collected “boatloads of mature wild garlic” in Leeds over the last few days. Elizabeth, in Cardiff, said she’d been harvesting garlic for around three weeks, much earlier than usual.

Amin Nasser, the chief executive of Saudi Aramco, said financiers at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month had told him the sector had only a few years left because of trends such as the rise of electric cars.
Policymakers, regulators, investors and NGOs increasingly believed that oil and gas firms have little or no future, he said.
“My encounters in Davos showed me that fewer and fewer of our stakeholders accept logic and facts, least of all from us. We are therefore facing what I would call a crisis of perception,” he told an industry audience in London.
He said: “Because it [the crisis] threatens our industry’s very relevance, it puts our ability to supply ample, reliable and affordable energy to billions around the world at risk, which in turn risks their energy security.”
Nasser claimed the idea that oil demand would soon peak, which most authorities think will happen in the next two decades, was an exaggerated theory.
Saudi Arabia is one of the world’s biggest oil producers, with only Russia and the US on a par, and it plans to increase its output in the coming decade.
Nasser’s speech did not explicitly mention climate change but he said one of the remedies to the sector’s image problem was to understand society wanted clean energy and a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. Asked what the Paris climate agreement meant for Saudi Aramco, he boasted that the company would become a “global leader” in another fossil fuel – gas.
He also said Saudi Aramco would invest more in petrochemicals but that it would not yet be entering the renewables market because the Gulf kingdom was already investing in solar power.
Nasser said that if the firm stopped investing now, the world would face a shortfall in oil supply in five years’ time that would lead to higher oil prices – reinforcing a perception the industry was profiteering. Saudi Aramco is reportedly the world’s most profitable company.
Bob Dudley, the chief executive of BP, said he agreed with the Saudi oil boss. “The world is driven by myths and not facts,” he said.
Dudley said: “I think we have a particular challenge with [the perception of] energy. But I think business in general has a huge communications issue. I think we are seeing the effects of the financial crisis rolling through now, particularly in the western world, and everybody is looking for people to blame. Unfortunately I think the political system is starting to blame companies and business more.”
On Tuesday, oil prices crept up to $65 (£49) a barrel. On Monday, they had fallen when Donald Trump tweeted that they were getting too high and told oil cartel Opec – of which Saudi Arabia is the de facto leader – the world could not take a price hike.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/26/saudi-aramco-oil-industry-faces-crisis-of-perception

You already know the weather has gone weird, the ice caps are melting, the insects are disappearing from the Earth. You already know that your children, and your children’s children, if they are reckless or brave enough to reproduce, face a vista of rising seas, vanishing coastal cities, storms, wildfires, biblical floods. As someone who reads the news and is sensitive to the general mood of the times, you have a general sense of what we’re looking at. But do you truly understand the scale of the tribulations we face? David Wallace-Wells, author of the distressingly titled The Uninhabitable Earth, is here to tell you that you do not. “It is,” as he puts it in the book’s first line, “worse, much worse, than you think.”
The book expands on a viral article, also titled The Uninhabitable Earth, which Wallace-Wells published in New York in the summer of 2017, and which frightened the life out of everyone who read it. Writing at length, he is even more remorseless in his delineation of what the not nearly distant enough future probably holds for us. The book’s longest section, entitled Elements of Chaos, is composed of 12 short and brutal chapters, each of which foretells a specific dimension of our forecast doom, and whose titles alone – Heat Death; Dying Oceans; Unbreathable Air; Plagues of Warming – are enough to induce an honest-to-God panic attack.
Wallace-Wells identifies a tendency, even among those of us who think we are already sufficiently terrified of the future, to be strangely complacent about the figures. Yes, we know that climate change will cause sea level rises of between four to eight feet before the end of this century, but then again what’s a few feet if you happen to live a couple of miles inland? “That so many feel already acclimated to the prospect of a near-future world with dramatically higher oceans,” he writes, “should be as dispiriting and disconcerting as if we’d already come to accept the inevitability of extended nuclear war – because that is the scale of devastation the rising oceans will bring.”
The book is extremely effective in shaking the reader out of that complacency. Some things I did not want to learn, but learned anyway: every return flight from London to New York costs the Arctic three square metres of ice; for every half degree of warming, societies see between a 10 and 20% increase in the likelihood of armed conflict; global plastic production is expected to triple by 2050, by which point there will be more plastic than fish in the planet’s oceans. The margins of my review copy of the book are scrawled with expressions of terror and despair, declining in articulacy as the pages proceed, until it’s all just cartoon sad faces and swear words.
There is a widespread inclination to think of climate change as a form of compound payback for two centuries of industrial capitalism. But among Wallace-Wells’s most bracing revelations is how recent the bulk of the destruction has been, how sickeningly fast its results. Most of the real damage, in fact, has taken place in the time since the reality of climate change became known. And we are not slowing down. One of the sentences I found most upsetting in this book composed almost exclusively of upsetting sentences: “We are now burning 80% more coal than we were just in the year 2000.”
There’s also a temptation, when thinking about climate change, to focus on denialism as the villain of the piece. The bigger problem, Wallace-Wells points out, is the much vaster number of people (and governments) who acknowledge the true scale of the problem, and still act as if it’s not happening. Outright climate denialism as a political force, he argues, is essentially a US phenomenon – which is to say, essentially, a phenomenon of the Republican party – and the US is responsible for only 15% of the world’s emissions. “To believe the fault for global warming lies exclusively with the Republican party or its fossil-fuel backers is a form of American narcissism.” (I’m not sure I’ve ever heard anyone make quite so simplistic a case, but the point about denialism as largely a red herring is an important one.)
It’s easy to overlook how bad things have got, to accept the floods, wildfires and hurricanes as the nature of things
This all makes for relentlessly grim reading, particularly in that first section. As is generally the case in any sustained exposure to the subject of climate change – a subject that can seem increasingly like the only subject – a kind of apocalyptic glaze descends over even the most conscientious eyes, a peculiarly contemporary compound of boredom and horror. (“Human kind,” as the bird in TS Eliot’s Four Quartets sagely points out, “cannot bear very much reality.”) It’s a problem of which Wallace-Wells is clearly aware. “If you have made it this far, you are a brave reader,” as he puts it, somewhere past the halfway point, acknowledging the likelihood of the material he’s sifting through causing despondency in anyone considering it. “But you are not merely considering it,” he clarifies, “you are about to embark on living it. In many cases, in many places, we already are.”
That last point turns out to be one of the most crucial of the book’s warnings. Because as dire as the projections are, if you are surveying the topic from a privileged western vantage, it’s easy to overlook how bad things have already got, to accept the hurricanes and the heatstroke deaths as simply the unfortunate nature of things. In this way, Wallace-Wells raises the disquieting spectre of future normalisation – the prospect that we might raise, incrementally but inexorably, our baseline of acceptable human suffering. (This phenomenon is not without precedent. See, for example, the whole of human history.)
For a relatively short book, The Uninhabitable Earth covers a great deal of cursed ground – drought, floods, wildfires, economic crises, political instability, the collapse of the myth of progress – and reading it can feel like taking a hop-on hop-off tour of the future’s sprawling hellscape. It’s not without its hopeful notes: in a sense, none of this would even be worth talking about if there were nothing we could do about it. As Wallace-Wells points out, we already have all the tools we need to avoid the worst of what is to come: “a carbon tax and the political apparatus to aggressively phase out dirty energy; a new approach to agricultural practices and a shift away from beef and dairy in the global diet; and public investment in green energy and carbon capture”. The fact that the route out of this hell is straightforward does not mean, of course, that it won’t be incredibly arduous, or that we should be confident of making it.
The book, however, is less focused on solutions than on clarifying the scale of the problem, the horror of its effects. You could call it alarmist, and you would not be wrong. (In the closing pages, Wallace-Wells himself accepts the charge as “fair enough, because I am alarmed”.) But to read The Uninhabitable Earth – or to consider in any serious way the scale of the crisis we face – is to understand the collapse of the distinction between alarmism and plain realism. To fail to be alarmed is to fail to think about the problem, and to fail to think about the problem is to relinquish all hope of its solution.

The new congresswoman’s blueprint, co-introduced by Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey, aims to develop a carbon-neutral economy in 10 years, which would require huge strides in reducing the US’s reliance on oil, gas and coal. It does not set a date for ending the use of fossil fuels.
Specifically, the resolution says it is the duty of the federal government to craft a Green New Deal “to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions”. That includes getting all power from “clean, renewable and zero-emission energy sources”.
The document also endorses universal healthcare, a jobs guarantee and free higher education – a huge shift in messaging from nearly a decade ago, when Democrats were advocating for a cap-and-trade system to limit greenhouse gases by allotting industry permits for pollution.
Sixty members of the House and nine senators are co-sponsoring the resolution, including several presidential candidates, according to a fact sheet from congressional aides that did not include a list of supporters. However, any legislation would be dead-on-arrival with Republicans in control of the Senate and the White House, and would be difficult for Democrats to implement even if they controlled government. In supporting documents staffer acknowledge the investment required would be “massive”.
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said a select committee on climate change, which she has announced the members of, will not be tasked with writing a specific bill and called the Green New Deal a “suggestion”.
“It will be one of several or maybe many suggestions that we receive,” Pelosi said in an interview with Politico. “The green dream or whatever they call it, nobody knows what it is, but they’re for it right?”
Discussions on what shape the plan would take also involved major environment, justice and labor organizations, as well as the youth-run Sunrise Movement. Backers hope the six-page resolution will push Democrats vying for the White House in 2020 not just to sign on to the general idea, but to lay out specific legislative goals.
Some environmental groups, including Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace, said they were encouraged by the movement on climate change but that the resolution does not do enough to confront fossil fuels. The Sierra Club, however, welcomed the document.
Ocasio-Cortez, a democratic socialist from New York who has been in Congress for just over a month, centered her campaign on climate change and a Green New Deal.
But the resolution itself focuses on the tenets of a progressive policy platform as much as it does on climate change.
It is both a framework for a cleaner-energy future and a plan for a large-scale mobilization that would rival in scale and scope the progressive New Deal policies ushered in under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in response to the Great Depression.
One of its goals is “to promote justice and equity by stopping current, preventing future, and repairing historic oppression of indigenous peoples, communities of color, migrant communities, deindustrialized communities, depopulated rural communities, the poor, low-income workers, women, the elderly, the unhoused, people with disabilities, and youth”.
The resolution says significant portions of the American population are suffering from declining life expectancy, exposure to pollution, and lacking access to healthy food, healthcare, housing, transportation and education. It spotlights wage stagnation, lacking socio-economic mobility, income inequality, a racial wealth divide, a gender pay gap and weakened bargaining power for workers.
The resolution text comes as Donald Trump frequently questions the science that shows humans burning fossil fuels are causing temperatures to rise and exacerbate extreme weather. He did not mention climate change in his annual address to Congress this week, despite increasing warnings from scientists.
Democrats, who hold a majority in the House, are trying to raise awareness of climate change as an impending crisis, with two committees holding hearings this week and a third to follow next week. But Republican lawmakers remain resistant to any legislation to limit greenhouse gas emissions.
Republicans in dual climate change hearings called by House Democrats yesterday attacked the as-yet unwritten Green New Deal, charging that it would be far too expensive and would worsen poverty. Ocasio-Cortez and her supporters say the strategy is designed to do the opposite – to create jobs in a green economy.
Meanwhile, Trump’s agencies continue to roll back climate regulations enacted by the Obama administration. US carbon emissions increased last year, according to analysis by the economic firm Rhodium Group.
Ocasio-Cortez elevated the Green New Deal when she joined activists at a protest outside the then minority leader Nancy Pelosi’s office last year. The activists are planning to protest at Democratic debates in an effort to ensure the proposal, which was until now largely a liberal rallying cry for action on climate change, is a prominent issue for the 2020 election.
Before the text was released, several presidential candidates had already embraced the notion of a Green New Deal, including senators Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, and Kirsten Gillibrand. The former San Antonio mayor Julián Castro committed to the plan during his campaign announcement.
The Democratic congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, who is the co-chair of the House progressive caucus and a sponsor of the legislation, said the resolution defined the scale and scope of what must be done to combat global warming.
“We really need an urgent and comprehensive approach,” said Jayapal.
Such legislation has little chance of becoming law as long as Republicans control the Senate and Trump is president. But Jayapal said Democrats would continue to lay the groundwork for a Green New Deal while pushing more incremental legislation.
“This is a moment for us to push a comprehensive view of the challenge before us,” she said, “and therefore to offer the solution that we need to address that challenge.”
The world has already warmed about 1C since the industrialization in the 19th century and is barreling toward exceeding a 1.5C increase, which climate scientists say will significantly worsen the risks of extreme heat, drought, floods and poverty.
Already, the process for drafting the brief documents has outlined the fights ahead, even among progressives who want climate action.
A background summary prepared by staffers said the plan “sets a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, at the end of this 10-year plan because we aren’t sure that we will be able to fully get rid of, for example, emissions from cows or air travel before then”.
But climate justice advocates who represent the communities seeing the worst of environmental damages and pollution already want to quickly phase out all fossil fuels. Many also oppose nuclear power that uses mined uranium but represents a huge portion of the US’s zero-carbon energy.
Angela Adrar, the executive director of the Climate Justice Alliance, a coalition of communities dealing with environmental problems, said her group supported the vision of the Green New Deal, even though members were concerned about what they saw as loopholes to allow some fossil fuels use.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/07/green-new-deal-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-plan

The spell of baking summer weather was made 30 times more likely by global warming and left spuds substantially smaller than usual. Yields of carrots and onions were also sharply down.
Recent years have seen winter deluges cause flooding, severe late frosts and dry summers, all of which make the precarious job of growing fruit and vegetables even harder. Climate change is already making extreme weather more likely and, with projections indicating severe water stress in key parts of England, some growers fear for their future.
The report, Recipe for Disaster, was produced by The Climate Coalition, which brings together 130 organisations including WWF, the National Trust, the Women’s Institute and Christian Aid, and represents more than 15 million UK members. The report calls for urgent reductions of carbon emissions and food waste by, for example, eating more wonky veg.
The summer of 2018 was the joint hottest on record, with some places not seeing any rain for 58 days. The lack of water resulted in the fourth lowest potato harvest in the last 60 years.
“Yields were down 20-25%,” said Richard Thompson, a potato grower in Staffordshire. “We also had quality issues with a lot of misshapen and small potatoes. I’ll be reducing my acreage next year because I can’t afford to take the risk.”
Cedric Porter, editor of World Potato Markets, said consumers were seeing smaller chips as a result of last year’s drought and extreme heat: “They were 3cm shorter on average in the UK. Smaller potatoes means smaller chips.”
More than 80% of the potatoes eaten in the UK are homegrown, but climate change could make three-quarters of land used unsuitable by 2050, the report found. “It should be unthinkable to us that the humble spud could become a delicacy,” said Gareth Redmond-King, at WWF. “But the unthinkable becomes reality if climate change isn’t tackled.”
Leeds University scientists Kate Sambrook and Prof Piers Forster contributed climate analysis to the report. They found that high temperature extremes in summer and intense winter downpours have become more common in recent decades, with 2013-2014 the wettest winter on record for the UK. Extreme weather will worsen further in future as the world gets hotter, they said.
Warmer winters encourage early flowering of fruit such as apples and wine grapes, but they can then be wiped out by late frosts. Mild winters also mean pests such as the cabbage moth can thrive and could allow the pea beetle to cross the channel from France.
Lee Abbey, head of horticulture at the National Farmers Union, said: “A lot of growers will have come out of [2018] with sore heads and not much income. Farmers and growers are used to dealing with fluctuations in the weather but if we have two or three extreme years in a row it has the potential to put growers out of business.” Carrots yields were down 25% and onions down 40%.
Michael Gove, the environment secretary, said: “This nutritious food, and the livelihoods of the hard-working farmers who grow it, are increasingly threatened by more extreme weather and increased pests and diseases as a result of climate change.” He said the new agriculture bill would reward farmers who reduce their emissions.
“We have to do all we can to limit climate change,” said cook and broadcaster Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall. “As luck would have it, that is an built-in consequence of sustainable, ethical eating anyway. If you shop locally and eat seasonally you are already doing your bit. If you prioritise organic produce and limit your consumption of animal foods, you’re doing even more.”
Agriculture is a large emitter of greenhouse gases, particularly from cattle. In January, the National Farmers Union set out its aspiration for UK farming to become net zero in its greenhouse gas emissions by 2040.
Other threats to fruit and vegetable supplies in the UK are a lack of pickers after Brexit – currently 99% are from other EU nations – and extreme weather in other places. There were shortages of courgettes, spinach lettuce in early 2017 after bad weather in Spain and Italy.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/05/uk-chips-an-inch-shorter-after-summer-heatwave-report

Clive used millions from his Townsville Nickel refinery to finance the 2013 election campaign which saw a number of Palmer United senators elected including ex-rugby league player Glenn Lazarus. 
I organised ALP booth worker for my local primary school. Clive's workers were dropped off one to a booth from a large bus. Ours was a young good looking high school student who was being paid for his efforts. He soon got into a heated discussion about climate change with a young girl handing out for the Greens. I joined in the discussion contributing what I knew about the science. The young bloke gave up handing out as he was getting paid anyway. Last year Clive's Nickel refinery went into receivership leaving many of his employees out of work and owed their outstanding leave and superannuation. His nephew took off to Europe.
Glenn resigned from Clive's party and stood unsuccessfully for re-election in 2016.

It means everything when it comes to repudiating your claim that Bowen “stated unequivocally that Adani will not be banned under a Labor Government”.
To do that he would have had to mention Adani. 
Which he didn’t. 
Which you’d know if you read the speech. 
Which you didn’t. 
Instead you relied on Menzies House for your talking points.

I don't ""see left and right in terms of social and environmental progressiveness and basically ignore what really matters - economics, as in the equitable allocation of resources. In recent years my daughter, whose political views I largely share, as Education Minister greatly increased the allocation of resources to state schools and significantly increased the retention rate for indigenous students. A Quandamooka woman who was a student at one of the state's poorest high schools when I taught there before democracy arrived, is now one of her cabinet colleagues.
With four children and periods of unemployment interspersed with jobs which were not high paying, we struggled with the cost of housing, power, food and the general costs of living. As a union representative I organised to ensure full time secure employment with good conditions for my sections workers and as a Labor Party member I support the efforts of the Australian Council of Trade Unions in opposing the workplace depredations of six years of Liberal National Party federal rule.
In Queensland there are two right wing factions in the Labor Party. One is the general right wing faction found across Australia, the other, which I'm in, called historically the old guard, is restricted to queensland. This faction is more centrist and played a large role under the guidance of Tom Burns, Peter Beatty and others in surviving and resisting the undemocratic years of the Bjelke-Petersen government. We are currently the smallest faction.
With the prosperity that followed the return of democracy in the 90s, Queensland has grown and its economy diversified particularly in the South East. This has resulted in more urban electorates which return left faction Labor members undermining by attrition the previous dominance of the Australia wide right wing faction.

In an interview with Guardian Australia’s political podcast, Zali Steggall said the current policy outlined by Bill Shorten was on the right track, but she challenged the opposition to go further. “I don’t think it’s ambitious enough.”
Steggall said Labor, given the potential for a change of government later in the year, needed to include a commitment to block the controversial Queensland coal project. “Our financial institutions aren’t prepared to lend or invest in coal projects, why should the Australia people’s money be invested?”
She said Labor, if it wins this year’s federal contest, needed to use whatever regulatory powers it had available to it to stop the project. “We need an orderly retirement of coal, I don’t think we should be entering new projects,” Steggall said.
“The attention should be with renewables, technology, clean transport, clean energy – not projects like Adani.”
Steggall, a barrister, and former Olympic ski champion, is one of a group of small l liberal independents taking on government frontbenchers in the federal election contest expected in May, and has put Abbott and the Coalition’s record on climate change front and centre of her campaign in the Sydney seat.
The environment movement, and activist groups like GetUp, also want Labor to strengthen its position on the Adani project, an idea Shorten countenanced seriously last year, before stepping back.
Private polling conducted for the environment movement and for the major parties suggests community concern about climate change is currently sitting at levels not seen since the federal election cycle in 2007.
In political terms, Labor strategists think strengthening the current position on Adani would be beneficial to the election effort in the southern states and in south-east Queensland, but could write off the party’s chances in central Queensland.
Steggall said voters were desperate for action on climate change. The issue she said, had become “a political football” and that had led to “up and down results”.
“I’ll be advised by experts, I’m not an expert on climate change, I’m a concerned resident … to me, this is something that needs to be bipartisan, [the policy] needs to be supported by facts and experts and across industries so we can come up with a strategy that has longevity – a long-term plan.
“The last four years has seen increased emissions because everyone goes on their agenda.”
Steggall entered the contest in Warringah in late January. Well known in Manly, she is regarded as a real chance against Abbott if her insurgency can depress his primary vote in the contest.
Her candidacy has already prompted Abbott into engaging more forcefully on local issues, and he is attempting to characterise her as “the carbon tax candidate”.
“It’s all very well saying we’ve got to do more but there is a cost to doing more, a very heavy cost as we’ve seen,” Abbott told 2GB last week.
Steggall said her fundraising goals and volunteer sign-ups were running ahead of expectations. Steggall is aiming to secure a primary vote of 50%. “Everyone would have said that being a ski champion from Manly was impossible, and that was possible, so nothing is ever impossible,” she said.
“It’s a huge mountain to hope to climb, but you’ve got to set the goal high, and if the current level of dissatisfaction is high enough, that’s how people can really make their voice heard.”
Steggall’s campaign is implicitly negative, centred on a time’s up push against Abbott, but she said she wanted to keep her messages positive. She wanted to win, she said, “with the positivity of the message”.
She said it was obvious that in Australia negative campaigning cut through with the public, but she said “that’s something we have to address”. The ceaseless negativity of intraday politics was fuelling disengagement with institutions, including representative democracy, and the conversation “infiltrates the mood of the nation”.
“You have to be offering up some hope, as corny as that sounds,” she said.
She was also the recipient of help locally from Liberals concerned that if Abbott held the seat but the Coalition ultimately lost the election, he would want to take back the party leadership.
“I’ve got a huge support base from moderate Liberals who feel incredibly disenfranchised. Something has to change,” Steggall said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/06/zali-steggall-says-labor-needs-to-commit-to-stopping-adani-coalmine

The Bureau of Meteorology released its climate summary for January on Friday and said the widespread heatwave conditions and daily extremes were “unprecedented”.
“There’s been so many records it’s really hard to count,” said Andrew Watkins, a senior climatologist at the Bom.
January was Australia’s warmest month for mean, maximum and minimum temperatures.
Large parts of Australia received only 20% of their normal rainfall, particularly throughout the south-east in Victoria and parts of New South Wales and South Australia.
Tasmania, which has been battling bushfires throughout the past month, had its driest ever January.
Watkins said Borrona Downs in north-west NSW broke the record for hottest minimum temperature, registering one night at 36.6C.
According to the Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO, Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910, and temperatures will increase in the future.
So how will climate change affect future heatwaves in Australia?
The CSIRO and BoM have compiled different models for predicting the outcome of climate change in Australia to produce a guide to how different regions will likely be affected.
They found that every part of Australia will continue to experience increases in average temperature, and will have a higher frequency of hot days.
The duration of hot spells will increase in every region. In many areas in the northern half of Australia, the average number of days above 35C could increase by two to three times.
Late in the century, towns such as Darwin, Alice Springs and Broome  may experience days with temperatures above 35C for about a third of the year.
These higher temperatures will also result in higher evaporation, which will continue to make drought conditions worse.
Port Augusta recorded the country’s highest temperature in January, reaching 49.5C.
“We’ve also seen records in many states set including places like Victoria where Swan Hill and Kerang got up over 47.5C,” Watkins said.
Menindee in far-west NSW, the site of December and January’s mass fish kills, had four days in a row of temperatures above 47C.
In parts of western Queensland and western NSW, there have been long strings of more than 40 days of temperatures above 40C.
Cloncurry had 43 days in a row that exceeded 40C.
Birdsville in the state’s west had 16 days in January of temperatures higher than 45C and 10 of those days were in a row.
Bom said a persistent high-pressure system in the Tasman Sea that blocked cold fronts and cooler air from reaching the country’s south, and a delayed monsoon in the north, contributed to the heatwave.
“The warming trend which has seen Australian temperatures increase by more than 1C in the last 100 years also contributed to the unusually warm conditions,” Watkins said.
New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria and the Northern Territory all had their warmest January on record.

For the first time since records began, the country’s mean temperature in January exceeded 30C (86F), according to the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM), which said daily extremes – in some places just short of 50C – were unprecedented.
“There’s been so many records it’s really hard to count,” said Andrew Watkins, a senior climatologist at BoM, after January registered Australia’s warmest month for mean, maximum and minimum temperatures.
This followed the country’s warmest December on record, with heatwaves in every Australian state and territory. With colour-coded heat maps of the country resembling blazing red furnaces for much of the month, the authorities have recently issued a special report on the extraordinary heat.
A persistent high-pressure system in the Tasman Sea that blocked cold fronts and cooler air from reaching the country’s south, and a delayed monsoon in the north, contributed to the heatwave.
Climate change is the long-term driver. “The warming trend which has seen Australian temperatures increase by more than 1C in the last 100 years also contributed to the unusually warm conditions,” Watkins said.
The bureau’s monthly report said the heatwaves were unprecedented in their scale and duration. The highest temperatures of the month were recorded in Port Augusta in South Australia, where thermometers registered 49.5C , but the most relentless heat was in Birdsville, Queensland, which endured 10 consecutive days above 45C.
Tasmania, where emergency services have been battling bushfires throughout the past month, had its driest ever January. Watkins said Borrona Downs in north-west New South Wales broke the record for hottest minimum temperature, registering one night at 36.6C. This has a major impact on ecosystems that have not been able to cool down during the night as is normally the case.
This was compounded by drought. Large parts of Australia received only 20% of their normal rainfall, particularly throughout the south-east in Victoria and parts of NSW and South Australia.
Menindee in far-west NSW had four days in a row of temperatures above 47C. This was the site of December and January’s mass fish kills on the Darling River. Hundreds of thousands of native fish, including Murray cod, golden perch and bony bream, died around the Menindee weir. The authorities blamed “thermal stratification” as sudden shifts in temperature – first hot, then cold – caused algae blooms and choked the water of oxygen.
After the most recent fish die-off on 27 January, the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, said the Murray-Darling was “facing the makings of an ecological disaster”. He said: “This is not standard, this is not normal. This is a disaster.”
In parts of western Queensland and western NSW, there have been long strings of more than 40 days of temperatures above 40C.
Cloncurry had 43 days in a row that exceeded 40C. Birdsville had 16 days in January of temperatures higher than 45C including 10 days in a row.
NSW, the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria and the Northern Territory all had their warmest January on record.
The meteorological agency has warned that temperatures are set to rise further in the years ahead as a result of climate change. In its report last month, it said warming was contributing to a long-term increase in the frequency of extreme heat, fire weather and drought.
“Australia is already experiencing climate change now and there are impacts being experienced or felt across many communities and across many sectors,” said Helen Cleugh, the director of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, which collaborated on the report.
The study, which is updated every two years, found that Australia’s fire seasons have lengthened – in places by months – and become more severe. From April to October, there has been a broad shift to more arid conditions in south-eastern and south-western Australia. Sea levels have already risen by 20cm and ocean temperatures are up by 1C, which is causing acidification – 10 times faster than at any time in 300m years – which has damaged the corals of the Great Barrier Reef.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/01/australia-extreme-heat-sign-of-things-to-come-scientists-warn-climate

Record high temperatures, the hottest January on record; storms; floods in some places, droughts in others; mass fish kills in ailing rivers.
Climate change is back as a vote-changing issue – top of mind for many Australian voters. Private polling conducted for the environment movement and for the major parties suggests community concern about climate change is currently sitting at levels not seen since the federal election cycle in 2007.
If you can remember the events of 2007, you’ll recall that John Howard was forced into a significant about-face on the issue. Within sight of the election that swept Kevin Rudd into power, Howard signed the Liberal party up to emissions trading, a “world’s best-practice” cap and trade scheme, and declared Australia must prepare for a “low-carbon future”.
The research doing the rounds as the major parties bed down their war rooms for the May contest puts climate change in the top-two issues of concern nationally. Women, particularly, are alarmed by the ongoing policy inaction, and that’s bad for the Liberals because the party’s standing among women is already depressed courtesy of the unhinged shenanigans of the past 12 months.
But there’s some nuance in the research. In marginal seats in outer suburban areas – the seats that often determine the outcome of federal elections – cost of living pressures still rank higher than climate change. But people insist that climate is registering in the top-three concerns in several outer suburban seats, where the issue is normally dormant.
The political consequence of all this is pretty obvious. The strength of community concern about climate change leaves the Morrison government vulnerable. The Coalition’s policy record on climate change is appalling. There is no other word for it. Absolutely, indefensibly, appalling.
The Liberals have opened the election year trying to put themselves back in contention. The government is desperately hoping that a full frontal, never mind the nuances, assault on Labor’s controversial tax measures is the pathway to a political fightback executed over the opening months of 2019.
During the summer the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has led a morale-boosting offensive on Labor’s negative gearing and dividend imputation policies on social media, with enthusiastic amplification from cooperative conservative media outlets hungry to sharpen their own “campaign journalism” spears, given the apparent likelihood of a Labor victory.
Frydenberg has endeared himself to colleagues for picking the tax fight. Nobody knows if all the thrashing about and train-crash gifs will resonate in the real world but two tangible things have been achieved.
Labor has been forced to defend its tax policies after a long period of dormancy in the debate, and the joust has delivered a shot of adrenalin to the moribund Liberal base. (As an aside, perhaps we can note that Frydenberg, with the frenzy of activity, might also be positioning himself for whatever fate awaits the Liberals post-election. Bit cheeky but doubtless true).
Coalition and Labor MPs report that the community backlash against dividend imputation is now a thing – a real and palpable thing rather than a febrile media confection – but Liberal and Labor MPs agree the anger is felt most keenly among Coalition supporters rather than people inclined to vote Labor.
Smart people on both sides of politics don’t yet know whether the government can leverage the current softening in the housing market to make negative gearing a point of serious political vulnerability for Labor or not. As they say in the classics, only time will tell.
While the tax fight has been good for internal morale, and may yet catch fire, smart people inside the government doubt it will be enough to turn negative sentiment, and believe it certainly won’t be enough if the government doesn’t try and fix its self-created disaster on climate change.
Internal discussions are under way about what to do. Moderates are sounding out what conservatives can live with.
An obvious course correction would be a cash injection for the emissions reduction fund, a vestige of the heavily criticised Direct Action scheme, and the environment minister has already flagged the ERF’s remit (which is currently paying for abatement) could be broadened to include the protection of threatened species.
Liberals who favour more climate action, and pronto, also point to the potential to increase funding for the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and Arena (the agencies the Coalition once campaigned to abolish), as well as providing handouts to households – a new package supporting the uptake of renewable energy.
But even if the Coalition manages to land some kind of repositioning without blowing the show sky-high (Hi Tony, happy new year), it’s unclear whether voters will buy it, given the gross stupidity of the past couple of terms, and given the Liberal party last year killed a prime minister in plain sight at least in part because he pursued a policy to reduce emissions in the electricity sector.
Also unclear is how any climate revamp would sit with the government’s aspiration to have taxpayers underwrite new coal-fired power plants, and potentially indemnify them against future carbon risk. Even if voters are forgiving enough to look past the policy car crash and the dumb and dumber intrigues that led to the third leadership change in two terms – that’s a split personality that’s hard to explain.
Climate change is not only a hot-button issue on its own terms. Some of the research suggests it has also become a proxy for political dysfunction, which is a lethal combination when voters are, as MPs report, viscerally angry at an incumbent government (although some Liberals will tell you Morrison isn’t loathed, according to their focus groups, and there’s some sentiment he should be given a chance).
At the moment, most of the political class is talking about Victoria. This is unusual. Normally before a federal election, a collective obsession descends about Queensland. “Whither Queensland?”. Why Queensland? Because the state has a swag of marginals.
Queensland remains front of mind, but Victoria is also turning up more often in dispatches. “Whither Victoria?” is on the agenda because of recent field evidence: the Liberals endured a rout in the state last year. Courtesy of that result, some in Labor think it’s possible Bill Shorten could take government with a southern states strategy, rather than embarking on the more typical mass genuflection to Queensland.
Not everyone buys that theory. Some think the anti-Liberal swing in the state contest won’t translate federally, for a couple of reasons.
The backlash in the Liberal heartland seen in last year’s state election was a cost-free protest vote. Liberals lost nothing by backing in Daniel Andrews, who had a concrete record to campaign on, and was a known quantity.
If Liberals vote for Bill Shorten, there will be a hip-pocket cost – the loss of negative gearing and capital gains concessions, cash rebates from dividend imputation – in other words, Labor’s policy offering federally puts a brake on the scale of the protest vote that might be lodged in May.
Liberals deeply depressed about the state of play in Victoria, and to a lesser degree in New South Wales, think Labor’s appetite to wind back tax concessions will be an automatic stabiliser on their heartland backlash to some degree – but they are conscious that a potent threat is coming from “small-l” liberal independents, which will require the diversion of scarce resources to supposedly safe seats.
Independents such as Zali Steggall and Oliver Yates are thumping the government on climate change, both as a thing in itself and as a proxy for dysfunction within the Liberal party which is imposing costs on the citizenry.
One live litmus test of whether Labor ultimately goes for broke with a southern states strategy – whether they think they can craft a pathway to victory without considering the parochial and materialist sensibilities of central Queenslanders – will be if Bill Shorten toughens Labor’s line on Adani. He went close to doing that last year but baulked at the last minute.
Environment groups and GetUp want Labor to stop the project, and they offer the party valuable campaign resources, strengthening an already formidable on-ground machine, in the event there can be a meeting of the minds.
Thus far Shorten hasn’t shifted and is remaining focused on hearts and minds in central Queensland, kicking off the election year campaigning in the state.
This suggests the Labor leader and the brains trust around him aren’t convinced – at least not currently – that writing off central Queensland is a political risk worth taking.

Schoolchildren demanding action on climate change have played truant and taken to the streets in Australia, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland and, in their greatest numbers, in Belgium, where 35,000 made their voices heard in Brussels a week ago and a further 12,500 marched on Thursday.
But in the Netherlands, where half the country is below sea level and awareness of global warming is high, there have been no such demonstrations. And for the first march, planned for Thursday in The Hague, organisers say they hope for a rather modest turnout of about 3,000.
“The commitment of Belgian youth seems to be greater than that of Dutch young people,” said the Dutch newspaper Trouw on Friday. “Why?”
Certainly the attitude of the Dutch government has not been particularly welcoming of the truancy movement. The country’s education minister, Arie Slob, while welcoming the enthusiasm for saving the world, suggested those who wished to make their point should do so on the weekend.
“Education is education and we are not going to give way to truancy,” he told the current affairs show Nieuwsuur this week.
 Fearing the prospect of mass truancy, some schools have also taken a hard line. Heleen Klootwijk at Herbert Vissers College in Nieuw-Vennep spoke for many by warning that students who went to The Hague demonstration next Thursday would be listed as truanting “with accompanying consequences”.
But while encouraging students to make their voices heard, the Dutch MEP Sophia in ‘t Veld suggested there may be a cultural reason for Dutch teenagers’ apparent reticence. In report after report, the Netherlands tops OECD countries for high life satisfaction among its young people, partly because they already have the ear of their elders.
“It’s a different tradition, I suppose,” In ‘t Veld said. “It doesn’t always work but there is a relationship between the government and the social partners. The government could reform the pensions today from above but they won’t. They will talk with the stakeholders. The children live with that different experience. In Belgium and France it is more top down – and people turn to the streets.”
The difference in approach has certainly been notable in the attitudes of some senior politicians in Flanders, where the Youth for Climate movement first emerged in Belgium.
Dad, where’s my cell phone? Gone! When are we going to ski? Never again
Bart De Wever, the chairman of the Flemish nationalist party the New Flemish Alliance, which was until recently in government as part of a coalition, urged the young protesters “not to believe in the apocalypse” but to go back to their books and have “confidence in the future and in the power of innovation”. “We will not solve anything with green taxes and making people feel guilty,” he said.
His colleague, the former secretary of state for migration Theo Francken, tweeted: “Dad, where’s my cell phone? Gone! When are we going to ski? Never again. Where will we go this summer? Home. Is the power on? … Put on sweater. Are you taking me to football? Pack your bike. Dad, why are you doing this? Sorry kid, you convinced me that it should be different.”
But this week the Belgian students launched an online platform to collect ideas for tackling global warming, and they say they will keep on skipping school until their message is heard.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/03/belgian-kids-march-against-climate-change-why-dont-ours-ask-dutch

Meteorologists said there was a 10% chance of a year in which the average temperature rise exceeds 1.5C, which is the lowest of the two Paris agreement targets set for the end of the century.
Until now, the hottest year on record was 2016, when the planet warmed 1.11C above pre-industrial levels, but the long-term trend is upward.
Man-made greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are adding 0.2C of warming each decade but the incline of temperature charts is jagged due to natural variation: hotter El Niño years zig above the average, while cooler La Ninã years zag below.
In the five-year forecast released on Wednesday, the Met Office highlights the first possibility of a natural El Niño combining with global warming to exceed the 1.5C mark.
Dr Doug Smith, Met Office research fellow, said: “A run of temperatures of 1C or above would increase the risk of a temporary excursion above the threshold of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Predictions now suggest around a 10% chance of at least one year between 2019 and 2023 temporarily exceeding 1.5C.”
Climatologists stressed this did not mean the world had broken the Paris agreement 80 years ahead of schedule because international temperature targets are based on 30-year averages.
“Exceeding 1.5C in one given year does not mean that the 1.5C goal has been breached and can be redirected towards the bin,” said Joeri Rogelj, a lecturer at the Grantham Institute. “The noise in the annual temperatures should not distract from the long-term trend.”
Although it would be an outlier, scientists said the first appearance in their long-term forecasts of such a “temporary excursion” was worrying, particularly for regions that are usually hard hit by extreme weather related to El Niño. This includes western Australia, South America, south and west Africa, and the Indian monsoon belt.
They also noted that the probability of 1.5C years would steadily increase unless emissions were rapidly scaled back.
“It’s a warning that we’re getting close to that level,” Prof Adam Scaife, the head of long-range prediction at the Met Office, told the Guardian. “We’re not saying there is a current risk of breaching the Paris agreement. What we are saying is that for the first time, we are seeing a chance of a temporary rise of 1.5C due to a combination of global warming and natural climate variation.”
The Met Office said previous results had demonstrated the accuracy of such “decadal reports”, which cover the ground between short-term weather forecasts and long-range climate models.
Since 2014, the world has experienced the four hottest years since records began in 1850, but these highs are likely to be exceeded soon. From now until 2023, the Met has 90% confidence that mean annual temperatures will range between 1.03C and 1.57C above pre-industrial levels.
The recent United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report on warming of 1.5C, highlighted the calamitous difference even a fraction of a degree above could make to coral reefs, Arctic ecosystems and hundreds of millions of lives. Starting now, the report said emissions would have to be cut by 45% by 2030 to have any chance of holding to that level.
“Breaching 1.5C of global warming does indeed mean that we failed to limit warming to that ‘safe’ level, but not that our understanding of a safe level of climate change has suddenly changed and climate change should go unchecked,” said Rogelj, who was was a coordinating lead author on the UN report. “Every tenth of a degree matters. So if 1.5C of global warming would be exceeded for whatever reason, this would be a call for steeper emissions reductions.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/06/met-office-global-warming-could-exceed-1-point-5-c-in-five-years

I was about a third of the way into my new novel, The Wall, when I discovered that I was completely obsessed by intergenerational inequality. In particular, by the question of intergenerational inequality linked to climate change. Who knew? Certainly not me.
Now, there’s nothing wrong with intergenerational inequality. At least, there’s nothing wrong with the version of it that existed in the developed world for much of the 20th century. That kind of inequality was based on the idea that life should be gradually better, from one generation to another – more secure, more prosperous, healthier, longer. That means that children got a better deal than their parents, but that was fine; indeed, in this version of the social contract, that was the whole point.
This model for a relationship between the generations has broken down. There are numerous reasons for this, and some are side-effects of positive social trends. When the UK state pension was introduced in 1908, it kicked in at the age of 70; but only one in four people lived past that age. In other words, most people died before they were able to collect any state pension at all. Today, life expectancy at birth is 82.9 years for women, 79.2 for men. This is, it goes without saying, a hugely positive development, but it plays havoc with the actuarial mathematics. Our state pension system resembles a benign Ponzi scheme, in which people in work are paying for liabilities accrued by the generation older than them who have now retired. When the retired generation is bigger than the working generation, there are obvious problems with making the sums work. You end up with different versions of the welfare state being experienced by different generations. A huge body of social science has been done on this subject, and you can sum it up in seven words: the baby boomers ate all the pies.
This fundamental shift in demographics, and the consequences it has had for intergenerational inequality, has been severely compounded by other trends in our society and politics. Austerity has made the welfare state less generous. Perhaps even more importantly, through the deliberate use of bureaucratic cruelty in the form of practices such as sanctions, it has introduced a darkness to the welfare state. In a landscape of food banks and fit-for-work tests, the experience of state assistance has a fundamentally different tone from the one summed up in the idea of cradle-to-grave care. That’s not all. Brexit is the most intergenerationally divisive issue this country has ever faced, and that dividedness stares at you when you look at a breakdown of how people voted, with over-65s twice as likely to have voted leave as under-25s. For the first time, age is a better predictor of a person’s politics than income – which shows how intergenerationally divided our country now is.
It gets worse. The central premise of capitalism, the idea that work was the means to a escape from poverty and towards a decent standard of living, has been broken by the stagnation of pay growth and the use of in-work benefits to subsidise corporate profits. And finally, the grotesque inflation in property prices has caused the collapse in levels of home-ownership among the young, and the directly linked phenomenon of housing poverty, in which a huge proportion of people’s earnings are consumed by housing costs. According to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, 47% of the poorest fifth pay more than a third of their income on rent. The Institute for Fiscal Studies points out that among young middle earners, home ownership has fallen from 65% to 27% in the last two decades. When it comes to housing there is no question that the young have a dramatically worse deal than their parents.
It’s at this point that somebody needs to speak up for the boomers. It’s not like all of this was a plan. The shift in demographics was foreseeable, but austerity, Brexit and our housing madness were all, essentially, historical accidents. In addition, although the postwar welfare state looks pretty good in retrospect, it’s easy to forget that life didn’t seem all that great at the time. The paradise of state provision was only relative, and life was at least as fractured and anxious as it is today. When I turned 20, more than three million people were unemployed, three times as high a percentage as now; inflation had recently been in the high teens, and interest rates still were.
If you were able to put down a deposit on a house, you would be sweating about that double-digit compound interest mortgage payment every month. And then, for lots of us in the late 80s, no sooner did we buy a place but the housing market imploded. In the south-east, real, post-inflation house prices fell by 46% in the early 90s. That left millions of people in negative equity, a horrible experience forgotten by everyone except the people who lived through it.
The emotional and political landscape was difficult, too. We lived and dreamed the threat of nuclear war, which, with President Reagan in charge of the developed world, seemed more likely than it ever has since. Oh, and with the arrival of Aids, and before the invention of retrovirals, sex could kill you. Growing up as a boomer, life in the first world was harder for women, for ethnic minorities, for the LGBTQ community. In most respects, life for young people is better today than it was then. We didn’t know the cold war was going to end, that the cruise missiles were going to go home, that the Berlin Wall would fall, that interest rates, inflation rates and unemployment would all drop. We didn’t know that our homes (for those of us who had homes) were going to shoot up in value. We didn’t know things were going to improve. Yes, the state of the UK housing market is flagrantly unfair to young people, but an intergenerational score card is a complicated thing.
A horrible plot twist is coming, however. If you look at the reports from the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and the projections of what a warmer world is going to look like, and how quickly it could arrive, you realise we are facing the prospect of the most radical form of intergenerational inequality the world has ever seen. That would be a world in which different generations don’t just have different versions of the social and economic contract, but instead grow up with fundamentally different maps of the world. A world four degrees warmer – the world for which we are heading, in some of the worst-case scenarios – is a world of floods, droughts, drowned cities and coastlines, crop failures, unprecedented levels of mass migration, and all of it arriving in the gap between three or even two generations. Of course, it’s possible we will get lucky, in the way that my generation got lucky, and that warming comes in at the lower estimates. The world would be hotter, but not uninhabitably, unimaginably so. But I don’t think we can just cross our fingers and hope for that. The need for intergenerational justice on the issue of the climate could not be stronger. The prospect of leaving a broken world for our descendants is the clearest call to action on climate change we will ever get.

In an interview published in the Swiss newspaper Tages Anzeiger earlier this week, Gian Franco Kasper said “dictators can organize [big] events ... without asking the people’s permission”. He added that “from the business side, I say: I just want to go to dictatorships, I do not want to argue with environmentalists.”
The 75-year-old, who has been president of the federation since 1998, and was a member of the IOC until last year, said his comments had been as a result of a “misunderstanding” explaining they “were not meant to be taken literally but this was not clear in the final story.”
He also referred to “so-called” climate change in the interview. When asked to elaborate on his beliefs, he referred to cold temperatures at last year’s Winter Olympics. “We have snow, sometimes even a lot of it. I was in Pyeongchang for the Olympiad. We had -35C. Everybody who came up to me shivering I greeted with, ‘Welcome to global warming’.” He added that immigrants were to blame for the decline of winter sports in Switzerland. “The second generation of immigrants has nothing to do with skiing,” he said. “There are no ski camps anymore.”
Kasper has made controversial statements in the past. In 2005, he said he was opposed to women competing in the ski jump. “Don’t forget, it’s like jumping down from, let’s say, about two meters on the ground about a thousand times a year, which seems not to be appropriate for ladies from a medical point of view.”
Kasper’s latest comments came as the skiing world championships take place in Sweden.

Thousands of pupils are expected to walk out of lessons at schools and colleges across the country amid growing concern about the escalating climate crisis.
The movement started in August when the 16-year-old schoolgirl Greta Thunberg held a solo protest outside Sweden’s parliament. Now, up to 70,000 schoolchildren each week are taking part in 270 towns and cities worldwide.
Individual protests have been held in the UK, but next week a coordinated day of action is expected to result in walkouts in more than 30 towns and cities – from Lancaster to Truro, and Ullapool to Leeds.
Jake Woodier, of the UK Youth Climate Coalition, which is helping to coordinate the strikes, said Greta’s message about the need for radical, urgent change had struck a chord with hundreds of thousand of young people in the UK.
“The images of what Greta did and then the huge strikes by schoolchildren in other countries have been widely shared by young people on social media and have really inspired people.”
He said young people were becoming increasingly radicalised by the environmental crisis and understood the need for urgent political action.
“Young people see what is happening – especially since the IPCC report last year, which spelled out that we only have 12 years left to avoid catastrophic climate change … they realise that politicians are nowhere near where they need to be on this and want to do something to change that.”
There has been some pushback against the strikes by climate deniers and politicians. Last week, Belgian’s environment minister was forced to resign after falsely claiming the country’s intelligence services held evidence that the tens of thousands of children skipping school were being directed by unnamed powers.
So far those planning to protest in the UK say they have had broad support.
Zoe Bonnett, 14, is organising a strike in Bristol next week.
“People seem to think this is an issue that can be solved another time, but there is no other time,” she said. “I know this is a drastic action, this is quite a big step that I am taking, but I do feel strongly that we have to solve it now … I have to do something. ”
Bonnett, who heard about the movement after seeing a video of Greta online, said young people had a special stake in the unfolding crisis.
“At the moment I am having to make my choices for GCSEs, and I realised that if there is going to be a bad future ahead those sort of choices are not really that important unless we do something urgent now.”
Bonnett’s mother, Joanna, said she supported her daughter’s decision to walk out of school.
“I was a bit reticent at first because I am more of a rule-keeper than a rule-breaker but as she became more enthusiastic and learned more about it and decided to set up her own strike we became very supportive.”
Bonnett said she was planning to write to the headteacher of her school to outline her plan and offer to discuss the strike.
The UK walkouts are being billed as a chance to build towards a global day of school strikes on 15 March.
Greta has already confronted world leaders with the movement’s demand for radical climate action, first at a climate meeting in Poland in December where she accused them of acting like irresponsible children; then in Davos for the World Economic Forum when she told the gathered global elite that the climate crisis was real, adding: “I want you to panic.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/08/global-school-strikes-over-climate-change-head-to-the-uk

Behind the scenes, the team behind this big change were Richard Furness, managing director of reader revenue and publishing, Mylene Sylvestre, director of publishing, Roger Clapham, head of supply chain, and Dave Kirwan, the production director for publishing. Here they explain how they did it.
Richard We are in a constant, inquiring conversation with our readers about what they’d like to see from us, and the genesis of this project really came from conversations with them in which they asked how we might adapt our product to be more environmentally friendly. We introduced polybagging about 20 years ago, when our weekend edition started to get bigger and bulkier with extra supplements. It was the only way we could get them out on time and guarantee they would survive the British weather! Over time we tried to improve the plastic we were using, making it thinner, more recyclable, etcetera, but it was still plastic, and still not good enough. It took a bit of time to get the project off the ground – we are always very conscious of balancing commerciality with our values. It’s clear 2019 is a hugely important year in terms of cutting plastics use across the board. It felt urgent, so we didn’t want to wait for regulation or wait and hope someone else solves the problem.
Dave Last year we used approximately 25 tonnes of plastic for wrapping, which is about half a tonne a week. We knew we had to find an alternative. The newsprint we use for newspapers, however, is more than 70% recycled, and sourced in a way that retains biodiversity, which is really important to us. The new compostable wrapping film we now use is made from waste potatoes left out of the food chain in Eastern and Northern Europe, it is processed to release the starch and manufactured into granules.Mylene The decision to do away with our plastic wrappers came at a time when the Guardian was trying to cut costs, and when we had just completed a transition to the new tabloid format, so it had to be as inexpensive as possible. In the end, the overall wrapping cost has gone up a little, but we see it very much as an investment and decided to invest in compostable wrapping despite increasing our operations costs.
Mylene It’s been about 10 months in the making, all told. We needed something that could be produced quickly for each edition, so as not to delay distribution of the paper. We originally tried to move to a paper substitute for the wrapper, but found that it wouldn’t stand up against the elements too well, so wouldn’t be suitable for home deliveries. It was actually our environment journalists who suggested we try potato starch – a material they had seen being used by the RSPB, the National Trust and others.
Richard It’s been really fascinating to learn about the process. Our early prototypes underwent intensive tests to see how quickly they could move through the printing presses, how the text looked, how robust it was. We discovered we were only allowed to have ink covering a maximum of 5% of the surface of the wrapper in order to keep it compostable, so that was a challenge too.
Dave The material itself is called Bioplast 300 and is made using compounded potato starch, mixed with the other ingredients (biodegradable polyesters and additives). Bioplast 300 does not contain volatile or GM ingredients and is 100% biodegradable. The bio granules are extruded and blown into film, in the same way conventional plastics are made.
Richard We decided to launch it in London and the home counties first, as a live test to see how it was received. But after the overwhelmingly positive response we have had from readers, we plan to roll it out nationally from April this year. Guardian Weekly subscribers across UK and Europe will also start seeing the new wrapper on their editions very soon.
Mylene It needs to go in the compost bin or garden waste after it’s been used. Some councils still don’t offer proper facilities for this, so people need to lobby their local councils to implement these services as soon as possible!
Mylene Happily, the response has been overwhelmingly positive. We didn’t have a huge PR drive around the new wrapper as it hasn’t quite yet been rolled out to all our readers, and so many people got in touch to say it had been a lovely surprise when they got to the newsagent. It made me laugh when one reader commented on Twitter that she thought this was “the most Guardian thing ever!”.Richard There has been a global reaction, as word has spread about the project online, with people sending us messages – often copying in their local publication and lobbying them to follow suit. Several publishers have been in touch to ask about our suppliers. We are actively sharing our methodology and details of our partners: the environment is an issue that’s extremely close to our hearts and it would be great if more publications followed suit. I think many simply didn’t know the technology exists – and, similarly, this project has highlighted the lack of general knowledge around composting. So there’s a lot of work to be done by readers too, in getting the word out there!
Richard We are always looking for ways to innovate and improve the supply chain. We have recently moved one of the magazine production sites from mainland Europe to the UK, and we share our distribution routes with other papers, so we no longer have our own vehicles. Our distribution manager Roger Clapham is instrumental in making this process work so efficiently.
Richard Readers have a deep attachment to the paper, and understandably so – it’s news at a different pace to so much of modern life, and as such, it can provide a bit of respite from it. The chance to carve out some time at the weekend for the papers is one of life’s pleasures, and we know from research that our print readers really value the tangible nature of print.

Thousands of schoolchildren are expected to absent themselves from school on Friday to take part in a series of coordinated protests drawing attention to climate change.
At a time when politicians fret that young people are failing to engage with the political process, a headteacher’s decision to take a hard line against the strikers could be counter-productive. But equally granting permission for a day off could set a dangerous precedent and lead to safeguarding issues, it is feared. Parents could be fined for taking a child out of school.
One would-be striker, Anna Taylor, 17, from north London, said her school had given her “mixed messages”.
“I chucked up a notice – ‘school strike in a few weeks’ – on the noticeboard in the common room and they wiped it off, said ‘you can’t actively publicise it in schools’ and ‘we’ll give you an unauthorised absence and detention if you strike’, but then they said ‘you can spread it by word of mouth and we do support your cause’.”
A Department for Education spokeswoman said the decision was a matter for individual schools. “However, we are clear that pupils can only take term-time leave in exceptional circumstances, and where this leave has been authorised by the headteacher.”
Supporters of the UK Student Climate Network, which so far has pupils in about 30 towns and cities signed up to the day of action, argue that the “exceptional circumstances” excuse is applicable when it comes to Friday’s day of action.
A template letter drawn up by Youth Strike 4 Climate, one of the groups supporting the network, for parents of striking children to give headteachers, states: “I’m aware of UK law that permits parents to only give permission for their child to miss school on medical grounds or in a few other cases, one of which is under ‘exceptional circumstances’. My view is that having only 12 years left to cut CO2 emissions by 50%, as per the latest UN IPCC report, is pretty dire and exceptional circumstances to find ourselves in. And it in this light that I’m giving my child permission.”
It continues: “I support her to attend the youth strike as part of active civic engagement, which is a core part of the curriculum. People under 18 years can’t vote, but with more of their life in the future, rather than the past, it’s they who are most affected by climate breakdown.”
The letter is part of a cache of documents being shared with potential protesters ahead of Friday’s strike as the pupil-led grassroots movement gains momentum.
Similar protests have been held in individual UK cities and other countries, including Australia, Belgium and the Netherlands, where tens of thousands of children refused to attend school so that they could take part in rallies to raise awareness about threats to the environment from global warming. But Friday will be the first nationwide day of action.
Organisers were inspired by Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish activist who last August refused to attend school so that she could protest outside the Swedish parliament building, an action that shot her to global prominence.
However, not everyone has been enthusiastic about the burgeoning movement. “The best thing you learn about going to a protest is how to join the dole queue,” Australia’s resources minister, Matt Canavan, told a radio station last November.
Belgium’s environment minister, Joke Schauvliege, was recently forced to resign her position after suggesting that the strikes were being coordinated by unknown groups and were “more than spontaneous actions of solidarity”.
In the UK, Greenpeace is providing help with the construction of banners, while the UK Youth Climate Coalition, a 10-year-old campaign group, is helping coordinate media coverage and offering advice behind the scenes.
But both organisations were keen to stress the movement was organic and led by young people. Formed in the UK only three months ago, it has grown rapidly as its message has been shared on social media. Its website was created by two 15-year-old supporters in under a week.
“The wave of student strikes demanding action on climate change has been an inspiration for us all,” said Greenpeace UK’s executive director, John Sauven. “Theresa May promised our children that they’ll inherit a healthier environment than the one we found. Those children are now taking to the streets to remind her that unless we get serious about tackling the climate emergency, her promise will be broken. At the moment she is clearly failing.”
How many children will take to the streets on Friday is open to debate. More than 10,000 students skipped school to protest in Belgium. A similar number went on strike in the Netherlands.
Supporters suggested they expected a turnout in the low thousands for this Friday’s protest in the UK but believed a second day of strike action – on 15 March and in coordination with similar protests in other countries – would be considerably larger as the movement took hold.
“I have faith it will continue to grow throughout the year,” Taylor said. “Hopefully the government will eventually listen to us because we have the greatest stake in our future and we’re doing this because we feel let down by them and we want to make a difference before it’s too late.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/feb/10/pupil-strike-climate-change-puts-schools-on-spot

The perfect storm is also the metaphor most often used to describe the conditions facing Scott Morrison and his government at the coming federal election.
Dr Jill Sheppard is an investigator for the Australian National University’s Australian Electoral Study (AES), a major post-election review that has been tracking voter sentiment since 1987. She is also author of the ANU poll and focuses on why people participate in politics and the opinions they hold.
“What we have in 2019 is a perfect storm,” she says. “Where we are seeing independents get prominence, they fill a gap that major parties aren’t filling.
A hung parliament is not out of the equation at all
“The major parties are in state of disalignment. As much as left and right in Liberals, there is a coalition of factions not only for different policies but different leaders.”
After the 2016 election, the AES found key measures, including satisfaction with democracy, trust in government and loyalty to major parties, at record lows.
Like the Andrea Gail, the good ship Coalition is facing two approaching fronts: the rise of the high-profile independent and mounting concern about climate change policy as Australia tackles a drought and associated water shortages.
The Australian electorate has come a long way in its views since rural and regional independents Tony Windsor, Rob Oakeshott and Andrew Wilkie carved out their agreements to support Julia Gillard’s government in the 43rd parliament.
The anger Windsor and Oakeshott faced in parts of their conservative electorates at the time has subsided, as voters have seen the fruits of those agreements. At the heart of that agenda was action on climate change, connectivity via the national broadband network and infrastructure investment, all of which remain at the centre of national debate.
In 2019, voters are prepared to look again at independents after a decade of climate policy failure. This has interlinked like-minded independents with outside players, including tech billionaires, the next generation of corporate giants, political disrupters such as GetUp and assorted community groups determined to drag governments by the scruff of the neck.
The difference too is that Turnbull’s national energy guarantee (Neg) brought business, farmers and the community together but was opposed by a vocal minority in the Liberal party room. This highlighted the contrast between the public and parliament, and now the Coalition is in danger of being left behind as cashed-up forces are ready to help independents to enter and force change, including Turnbull’s son Alex and the Atlassian co-founder, Mike Cannon-Brookes.
While conservative seats have had six years of the Coalition finding reasons not to act on climate change, independents are offering a starkly different policy position – testing which side of the Liberal party is most in line with their constituents.
I guess you would have to have a heart of stone not to want Abbott tossed out of Warringah
Field evidence, including surveys by the Lowy Institute, the Australia Institute and private companies, find that most Australians want decisive action on climate. The 2018 Lowy Institute poll, for example, finds that 59% of Australians say “global warming is a serious and pressing problem” about which “we should begin taking steps now even if this involves significant costs”. Lowy describes it as a “dramatic reversal” on 2013 when Tony Abbott prosecuted the carbon tax scare campaign.
One environmental philanthropist, who asked not to be named, says all his donations this year will go to funding “quality candidates who are committed to climate action”.
He says it will be a six-figure sum and he knows of other like-minded philanthropists who are doing the same.
There are currently seven independent or minor party MPs in a federal house of representatives of 150.
Cathy McGowan (Indi), Andrew Wilkie (Denison), Rebekha Sharkie (Centre Alliance), Kerryn Phelps (Wentworth), Bob Katter (Katter’s Australia party) and the Greens’ Adam Bandt have all won elections. Julia Banks (Chisholm) was a Liberal who defected after Malcolm Turnbull was toppled.
In May, McGowan is retiring, hoping to hand the baton on to health researcher and midwife Helen Haines. Banks will challenge health minister and the Peter Dutton leadership co-conspirator Greg Hunt in Flinders. Former Olympian Zali Steggall is the most high-profile challenger of several independents pushing Abbott in Warringah. Former Clean Energy Finance Corporation chief executive and former Liberal member Oliver Yates will challenge treasurer Josh Frydenberg in Kooyong. Oakeshott is having his second go at Cowper, albeit with a much longer run than his previous surprise announcement at the start of the 2016 campaign.
The Nationals are facing challenges from two local councillors – Jason Modica and Ray Kingston – in Mallee, where Andrew Broad is retiring after the “sugar baby” scandal. There are nascent community groups springing up in rural seats, such as the Voices for Farrer movement in Liberal frontbencher Sussan Ley’s seat on the New South Wales southern border.
Former Liberal leader John Hewson believes the anti-Liberal sentiment is driving the rise of independents.
“The background to this is the drift against big parties and as it drifts away, we are getting better quality independents standing,” Hewson says.
“There is a range of sentiments but the centre is always going to win politics in Australia. What Abbott and his cronies don’t understand is that you will never win as a hard right or hard left candidate.
“There is the likelihood of a balance of power among the independents because some will get up and that will make a difference to the complexion of government.”
While the publicity surrounding them is intensifying, there remains a deep caution about the independents’ capacity to win a ground campaign against major parties. Independent analysis commissioned to test the capacity of challenges in safe seats, obtained by Guardian Australia, looked at 30 election results since 2007 where the final preference count was between the Coalition and an independent (excluding optional preferential voting systems).
It found the lowest recorded primary vote for a winning Coalition candidate was 42.7% for Rowan Ramsay in the South Australian seat of Grey in 2016 against Nick Xenophon Team (now Centre Alliance) candidate Andrea Broadfoot (she is running again this year). Apart from that contest, it’s safe to say that if a sitting MP gets a primary vote above 45%, the MP wins but if an independent can push the MP below 45%, the independent wins – albeit by sometimes tiny margins.
Previously successful independents have combined a well-organised campaign, good local community support and an unpopular sitting MP and/or a federal government on the nose.
These elements are not uniform among the big-name races in 2019. Oliver Yates, for example, has a strong track record on climate change and has spoken to forums in the seat but has no formal community organisation. Yet when former Liberal state member John Pesutto lost his seat in the Victorian election, the former attorney general blamed the federal government’s stance on climate change.
Banks owns a family home in the seat of Flinders but has been working as the member for Chisholm.
While Banks and Yates have presented themselves to their electorates, in Warringah the community rallied to find a candidate. Voices of Warringah, Vote Tony Out and other groups have come together into a well cashed-up and organised machine to stand behind a quality candidate, with help from progressive campaigning tools from GetUp.
But Dr Peter Brent, an adjunct fellow at Swinburne University, thinks the belief that Steggall will romp home is wishful thinking.
“I guess you would have to have a heart of stone not to want Abbott tossed out of Warringah and I must admit, when Zali Steggall announced, like many I thought she does tick all boxes,” he says.
“But that doesn’t mean she will necessary win. Most people in Warringah are voting on front-of-mind issues and most don’t want Labor. They will probably hold their nose and vote for Abbott.”
Brent does believe, however, that Oakeshott can capitalise on the retirement of Nationals MP Luke Hartsuyker in Cowper, possibly replicating Wilkie and Bandt, who won when there was no existing sitting member contesting.
 Sheppard also hoses down the conclusions we should draw. Commentators have assumed the conditions mean a landslide for Bill Shorten even as polls tighten. However, she believes the rash of independent candidates and the climate focus simply make the competition more unpredictable.
“A hung parliament is not out of the equation at all,” she says.
“There is a frustration with major parties and a contempt for their leaders. It seems after every election, we chart historically unpopular leaders and yet there seems to be no one on the horizon who can fix it.
“Yet there are not many voters who view themselves as ideologically independent, it is more that they view themselves as not fitting into either major parties.”
Sometimes called Liberal-Lite, the independents challenging in conservative seats have impressive CVs. Yates is an ex-Macquarie banker, Steggall is a barrister and elite athlete, Haines was a director of the Rural Health Academic Network and has a PhD in medical science. Kerryn Phelps is a medical doctor and former president of the Australian Medical Association.
Hewson says the major parties’ preselection processes are failing because the current candidates should be attracted and chosen as the next ministers.
“Instead we are seeing higher qualified substantial people standing than you see getting preselected because the skills to get preselected and rise to become a minister in a major party are not the same as outside it,” he says.
The Liberal MP for Mackellar, Jason Falinski, rejects Hewson’s argument, referencing the preselection of the energy minister, Angus Taylor, in Hume, who was a former partner at global consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Co.
“I think there is a perception out there that to get preselected you need to join when 16 years and 1 day, toil on polling booths and then when you are in your 30s you are rewarded with a seat as payback without the capability to represent the community,” says Falinski.
“I out and out reject that. So many times people have done that but then the local MP retires but if say, a Rhodes scholar and a partner in a major management consulting firm who has worked around the world for the good and great turns up, the party usually says we will give him a go.”
But Falinski does concede the party has failed to implement a basic corporate human resources functions to actively identify, recruit and provide professional development for good candidates, and if they are no good, to find a way of replacing them.
“It is a hard conversation to say to a member of 20 years that your capacity will run out in three to six years’ time and we need a succession plan,” he says.
He believes the only way to fight independent challengers is for the party to continue to improve and also explain issues.
Sheppard says the appeal for voters has been the rise of independents who have proven they can get things happening from the crossbench. They have pushed issues forward such as the banking royal commission and a national integrity commission, and forced major parties to consider removing children from Nauru.
“They are popular, smart, articulate and if there is a sizeable contingent they can get stuff done without the factional intrigue, without having to bow to tight party discipline and the electorate have felt starved of this,” she says.
Whether they are a trend or a blip, they are acting in contrast to business as usual in the major parties. For example, McGowan’s decision to retire after two terms shows a capacity to not treat the job as a lifetime sinecure.
Independents are no longer just saying yes or no to major party legislation. They are drafting their own legislation, mustering their numbers and brokering peace deals on unresolved issues between the main parties.
Yet Sheppard does not see the current rise of independents as a long-term trend; rather they are filling a void that the parties cannot currently fill. The big parties will have to decide which direction to take.
“In Australia, due to the political system, the centrifugal pull is towards major parties and the independents will lose their usefulness when their positions are replicated by the major parties,” she says.
“Apart from Katter … I don’t think he will ever be replicated by a major party.”
And she warns that a Labor government that fails to produce results could also result in Labor-style independents breaking away, if a future Labor government is on the nose.
Falinski remains sanguine about competition from independents, saying more choice in all seats is a good thing.
“I’m a Liberal so I believe choice is a good thing; so I can’t have it both ways,” he says.
“The advantage of Liberal democracies is freedom and fairness and political campaigns allow us to distill the hopes and concerns of voters.
“So if [discontent] builds up and organisations like banks or political parties are failing, democracy provides a safety outlet and gives parties the chance to say we can’t ignore it anymore, we need to respond.
“That might be a chance to change positions on some issues that aren’t working or change our communication or explanations that isn’t working. That is, not spinning better but looking at it in a different way.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/11/independents-and-climate-form-perfect-storm-for-the-good-ship-coalition

By 2040, scientists predict that only a fringe of ice will remain in Northeast Canada and Northern Greenland when all other large areas of summer ice are gone. This ""Last Ice Area"" is likely to become important for polar bears and other life that depends on ice.
A projection of sea ice in the archipelago, supported by WWF, shows that much of the region is facing significant ice loss in the coming decades - with potentially serious consequences for polar bears.Global polar bear numbers are projected to decline by 30% by 2050.

Polar bears lumbering along the corridors of apartment blocks and offices. Polar bears descending on a sleepy Russian town in their dozens.
To state the obvious: polar bears should not be wandering into human habitation, and certainly not in these numbers. That they are doing so in Belushya Guba shows how they are being driven off their normal migration routes and hunting trails by a changing climate. This has long been predicted – with the Arctic heating twice as fast as the rest of the planet, winter temperatures are rising and the sea ice – which is the primary habitat of polar bears – is shrinking.
In this small town in the Novaya Zemlya archipelago, authorities have declared a state of emergency (a reasonable precaution after spotting an unprecedented 52 polar bears). Fences have been erected around school playgrounds and locals have tried to drive them away with warning shots and explosions. All to no avail. Many residents are afraid to leave their homes. Workers are reportedly being bused to their offices in military vehicles.
No other animal symbolises global warming like the polar bear. Over the past three decades, we have grown used to images of malnourished or solitary animals cast adrift on broken ice. But this time it’s different. There is a pack instead of a solitary beast, humanity is near rather than distant and the mood is not just of pity but fear – entirely fitting for a period in which the climate crisis suddenly feels as if it is upon us rather than a future threat.
It also highlights other problems of the Anthropocene – the name that scientists have given to our geological era, which is being shaped less and less by natural forces and more and more by human behaviour.
Belushya Guba is remote but far from pristine. The nearby seas have recently seen the first commercial offshore oil development in the Arctic. Poor waste management in this region – once the site of Soviet nuclear bomb tests and still with a heavy military presence – has attracted hungry animals to dumpsites.
The bears are obviously not environment vigilantes out for revenge. Humans are everywhere. They have nowhere else to go. But many headlines talk of an “invasion” and articles debate the need for “deportation” or execution. The echo of the refugee crisis is no accident. More and more species, along with people, are being driven from their homes by climate disruption, raising the risk of conflict.
How to respond to this emergency is also shaped by the usual political divide: the right focus on the immediate threat to human individuals, while the left tries to understand the long-term global causes. But a debate about whether the bear migration should inspire fear or sympathy misses the point. The animals are losing the winter they depend on. Ultimately, so are we. We should feel sorry and afraid both for them and for us.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/shortcuts/2019/feb/11/polar-bears-russian-apartment-block-climate-crisis

All I saw and heard of it was inspiring and humbling, and fully justified Jonathan Freedland’s questioning who are the adults now (We failed the young on climate change – now we must listen, 16 February).
These young people were articulate, passionate and clear about why they were there and what they wanted to achieve. Their straight answers to those telling them that they should be at their lessons, or demonstrating only at the weekend, made the criticisms seem lame and out of touch. It was not just what they said but how they said it. They responded neither defensively nor offensively, but clearly stated what they knew and what they believed in. How sadly different this is from the level of communication we see between our elected MPs in parliament.
The thoughtfulness, courage and maturity of these protesters, linked across national boundaries, has added new dimensions to the momentum for greater and faster action on the causes and effects of climate change – and much-needed hope for the future, however challenging that may be.Kit WelchmanBury St Edmunds, Suffolk
• Having marched for the Youth Strike 4 Climate, alongside my friends and hundreds of others, I am now enraged at the foolishness of our government.
Thousands of children and young people turned out nationally to protest against government inaction on climate change. The response of young people worldwide is awe-inspiring and makes me proud of our generation. Yet, the government’s response has been to condemn us, to tell us we are wasting crucial lesson time. How can they expect us to stay in school, learning about things that are supposed to prepare us for our future, when they do nothing to ensure our future safety?
The dismissal of our action is shortsighted and foolish. I do not think I will look back in future and regret missing one chemistry lesson in order to fight for our planet. Theresa May and her government are too cowardly to admit that we children are right.
In 12 years’ time, I will be 29. I would like to be able to look forward to the future, without the fear and uncertainty that climate change brings.
At 17, I should be worried about whether I will get into university, and what kind of job I want to do. Instead, I am worried and scared about the very future of mankind and of our home. Is this what you were worried about at 17, Theresa May?Isabel AitkenCambridge
• Bit ironic, that. Theresa May, whose sole act of rebellion in an otherwise blameless life was running through a wheat field, criticising the demonstrations of schoolchildren horrified and angry that in 50 years there may be no wheat field to run through. Or indeed any people to do the running. Alex DunnStrathpeffer, Highlands

Ban all forms of purchasing from China. And the planet will breathe again

Historically, China tried to ban imports of opium, brought to them by the East India Company, but we Brits didn't like that...https://www.nam.ac.uk/explore/opium-war-1839-1842
If you think the Chinese have forgotten and forgiven, think again. In any case, much of what they produce, from computers to hand and machine tools, is produced at the request of US corporations. Taking hand tools as an example, I was in Homebase last year, and saw a box of spanners labelled ""Crescent"", a long established US manufacturer, in a cardboard sleeve reminiscent of the packaging style of toys. My first adjustable spanner was a Crescent tool, from Jamestown, New York state. These Crescent tools were Chinese made, at the behest of the US ""Apex Tools Group"", and a little investigation showed that many of the traditionally American tool manufacturers absorbed into the Apex group have been closed down and their production offshored to China, to increase margins.The knock-on effect is that while, when I was a youth, British and US tools were superior in so many ways to Asian imports (mainly Japanese and Indian), people like Apex have provided the Chinese with the product name, production methods, the metallurgy and designs, to make high quality goods, plus a market into which American brand names can be sold... This is not going to change any time soon. The only likely change is that we'll see more, and better high quality Chinese clones of US tools, which will sell, once the first few buyers, without the traditional prejudice towards known makes, try them and find them to be good value.We're screwed, by a combination of our unwillingness to pay domestic industry's prices, and the domestic industry's proprietors' pursuit of profit.', u'recommendation_count': u'3', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1549966679000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'4100535', u'in_reply_to': u'125761912', u'id': u'125771527', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'rockyrex', u'text': u'It's been increasingly obvious on at least an anecdotal basis for a long time, and other research studies have been pointing this way for some time.

In the end, politics among the survivors of plague, war and famine was reduced to a bitter fratricidal struggle over a defensible potato patch. Like most of the so-called “cosy catastrophe” novels, this could be criticised for optimism. Grim though a future of famine and the war of all against all might seem, the consequences were largely confined to humans.
The threatened extinction of insect populations around the world raises the prospect of a much more general catastrophe, which would implicate plants, birds, fish, small mammals, and everything else that depends on insects. That’s just the start. Other species, and we ourselves, depend on the animals and plants that need insects. When they go, we go. This is not just a greater catastrophe. It’s a much more plausible one. The most recent study concluded that insect biomass is decreasing around the world at a rate of 2.5% a year. At that rate, half the insects in the world will be gone in 50 years’ time, and all of them in a century – although no one will be keeping track of centuries then.
The chief driver of this catastrophe is unchecked human greed. For all our individual and even collective cleverness, we behave as a species with as little foresight as a colony of nematode worms that will consume everything it can reach until all is gone and it dies off naturally. The challenge of behaving more intelligently than creatures that have no brain at all will not be easy. But unlike the nematodes, we know what to do. The UN convention on biodiversity was signed in 1992, alongside the convention on climate change. Giving it the strength to curb our appetites is now urgent. Biodiversity is not an optional extra. It is the web that holds all life, including human life.
The two main expressions of greed that hasten this apocalypse are global warming and industrial agriculture. It appears that most of the damage is being done in the developed world by farming practices. The use of giant fields, devoid of shelter for insects of any sort at all, whether they are harmful to human interests or not, and where the plants are drenched in long-lasting pesticides, has been fatal for uncounted billions of insects. The effects of this kind of farming reach beyond the fields immediately affected, too. There has been a huge loss of aquatic insect species from the rivers into which the products of industrial agriculture are flushed by rain. Even in German nature reserves, which are by definition protected from the use of pesticides, there have been steep falls in insect populations because so many of the most widely used ones are persistent and prevent breeding. In the tropics, the steady rise of global temperatures is already devastating whole ecosystems, starting at the bottom with the insects. Last year we learned of the disappearance of almost all the ground-dwelling insects from a rainforest in Puerto Rico, and three-quarters of the species of the canopy. 
Some governments have done some necessary things. The EU has banned neonicotinoid pesticides. But the necessary change also relies on individual action. As individuals we must consume less in every way, which helps with climate change. We must also change our food habits. To eat less meat and more organic is not just piety. A little self-restraint in this generation will make all the difference to our grandchildren.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/11/the-guardian-view-on-the-mass-death-of-insects-this-threatens-us-all

The actor best known for fighting off Imperial stormtroopers as Han Solo and writhing in snake pits as Indiana Jones has now taken on the combined might of climate change deniers, with Trump a top target. Though Ford did not mention the US president by name, the subject of his speech at the final day of the World Government Summit in Dubai was beyond doubt.
“Around the world,” he said, “elements of leadership including in my own country to preserve their state and the status quo, deny or denigrate science. They are on the wrong side of history.”
Ford, at 76 four years Trump’s senior, has long been a campaigner for global environmental protection. He prefaced his speech at the summit with a short film, narrated in his trademark lion’s growl, featuring the character of Nature speaking about the future.
“If I’m not kept healthy, humans won’t survive, simple as that,” Nature says. “I could give a damn with or without humans, I’m the ocean. I covered this entire planet once, and I can always cover it again.”
Climate change denial and skepticism about established scientific truth have long been embraced by Trump. He has been propagating conspiracy theories about global warming since at least 2012, when he claimed it was a ruse by China to gain an unfair manufacturing advantage over the US.
In June 2017 Trump withdrew the US from the Paris agreement to limit global pollution levels and control temperature rise. Last November he responded to a dire US climate assessment by 13 government agencies and top scientists with the blunt words: “I don’t believe it.”
Only on Sunday, Trump issued yet another denigrating tweet in which he sought to mock the Democratic senator from Minnesota Amy Klobuchar, who had just launched a 2020 presidential bid, but ended up mocking climate science. He noted that Klobuchar had addressed global warming in her speech as snow fell around her.
“Bad timing,” Trump said.
In an interview with CNN before his Dubai appearance, Ford criticized directly the Trump administration for being “bent on dismantling all of the gains we’ve made in the protection of the environment”.
He lamented the “isolationism, nationalism that’s creeping into governments all across the developed world. The problems require attention on nature’s scale not on the scale of the next election.”
In his address to the summit, Ford called climate change “the greatest moral crisis of our time. We need nature now more than ever because nature doesn’t need people, people need nature.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/12/harrison-ford-world-government-summit-climate-change-trump

Compared to the 1,728 MW Dinorwig pump storage hydro power which can go from zero electricity output to 100% output in 16 seconds and gas turbines which can reach 100% capacity from zero in minutes, the best nuclear generators can do is a 30% increase in total capacity from 50% in 10 minutes. As you have to have them already running at 50% whether you need that electricity or not, they are not as flexible as hydroelectricity or gas turbines. They are as inflexible as the old coal fired power stations.
This is not a belief but instead is knowledge based on evidence.
No one except you is talking about running a grid on 100% gas or 100% nuclear or 100% wind or 100% solar. So I don't see the point in that.
""what is your line connection cost today?""
When we for three years we had a government that scrapped renewable energy projects we suddenly had a large increase in line connection fees which followed on a 40% increase in the per kWhr retail price of electricity. The AC interconnection with our neighboring state of New South Wales had been built with federal government funding in the early 90s. We once again sent electricity south in the recent heat waves. Our only storage is pumped hydro also built in the 90s. There is virtually no windpower in South East Queensland. It's not a windy place. There is however the equivalent of two large coal fired power stations capacity of rooftop solar panels. There are two solar panel farms in South-East Queensland with a total capacity of 200 MW. So the high cost of network capacity upgrade and maintenance has nothing to do with renewable energy. 
The numerous rooftop solar panels reduce the need to upgrade grade the capacity of the network. Without them the network cost I pay per kWhr and in my line connection cost, would be larger still.

Nuclear power plants in France and Germany often operate in load following mode"" But that load-following mode is much slower than hydro power and slower than gas turbine power.
BQENDperhaps, but it is undeniably fast enough for them to use it that way.
Don't forget that with nuclear France the UK (and Germany) have hydro and pumped storage.
As does Australia.
And pumped storage is very fast.But not as fast as batteries (a la the 100MW Tesla EFR in SA) for ultra fast frequency response.We can also use DSM (Demand Side Management) to *virtually* do the same thing.
This isn't a game Top Trumps® where wind beats solar on reliability but solar beats wind on aircon demand parity and gas wins on dispatchability and loses on emissions to nuclear.
The solution is a MIX of technologies, each played to their strengths.
So obviously in Australia ...Loads of solar.Loads of wind.
Then it's a choice between massive amounts spend on grid firming such as EFR/FFR/Storage/Interlinks/DNO batteries which add to stability but are literally non productive 'add on' costs.Which is technically feasible and very possibly the optimum for where Australia is.
Or the same mix of renewables but with the baseload (literally the year round minimum demand) fed by nuclear with *some* load following capacity.

Their solar output has parity with their aircon demand and their wide open plains offer extremely cheap land on which to plant solar and wind farms with far lower seasonal variability than with a country like the UK.
So where is it?The ANU report, so eagerly seized upon by those claiming that no significant effort is required, wrongly confused the issue but there is no doubt that Australia genuinely has the ability to make serious cuts in emissions, the economics of which could (and should be) driven by a carbon tax IMLTHO. The problem is that Australia's grid requires massive expansion and strengthening to make a renewables based system work - unfortunately the public refuse to pay for it whilst at the same time asking their politicians where the renewable generation is.
That's where the danger of the ANU report lies - unless you take the time to read the fine print, is that it fools people into thinking that the grid does not require the massive investment that AEMO et al say that it does.It is a constant refrain on these pages by people claiming such things are unnecessary 'gold plating' on the grid.
So if Australia decides (as it seems to have done) that spending hundreds of billions updating their grid to accommodate renewables is too much, then they could use renewables to limit demand and have their baseload (literally: the minimum demand requirement) met with some nuclear.
It's unpalatable I'm sure, but possibly cheaper than the massive grid expansion, the preponderance of which is a solution to a self imposed problem.
This is what UEA decided to do, from scratch - whereas Australia already has industrial/commercial nuclear, it just doesn't use it for power.
Sun and wind is free - but utilising it is not.The change from coal will not be free, but then there's no rule that says that addressing AGW is free.
At the end of the day, we know that failing to address AGW will cost far far more.Right now Australia is bottom of all OECD nations in addressing AGW - and so no matter what they decide to do (quickly please!) they need to stop complaining about change, pull their collective finger and make their minds up.https://www.climate-change-performance-index.org/country/australia-2019', u'recommendation_count': u'2', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1550141685000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'14842422', u'id': u'125859607', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Raismail', u'text': u'It's been said that ""sarcasm is the lowest form of wit"" but when it comes to a debate about high emission electricity production in our time of climatic peril sometimes the temptation to be sarcastic is too much.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1550244214000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'11922278', u'in_reply_to': u'125881785', u'id': u'125912108', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'ComfortablyPlumb', u'text': u'Correction, not ""immaterial"" - it is a 'locking away' of money that could have been spent on something that worked.

That's right Walsunda, that's why the slew rate in MW/min is what's important.If it's slower in MW/min, you need more plants to achieve the slew.That's why grid operators need to know the slew rate of the plant, in MW/min.

For a reactor operating at 50% this would produce, at the best or 5% per minute rate, a 30% of plant capacity increase in 10 minutes. 
However, seehttps://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Dispatchable_source_of_electricitywhich describes the 1,728 MW Dinorwig pump storage hydro power plant which can reach full power outlet from zero in 16 seconds and gas turbines which can reach 100% capacity from zero in minutes.
""Nuclear power plants in France and Germany often operate in load following mode.""
But that load-following mode is much slower than hydro power and slower than gas turbine power. There is very quick load following power supplies, quick load following electricity generation and slower load following power generation. They all work together to meet demand and stabilize the grid. As nuclear and coal fired generators can only slowly follow the load they take a while to catch up with it, during which time in France their 7,686 MW of hydro power capacity no doubt play a role. 
""You've been lied to about nuclear being unable to load-follow, but you refuse to accept the evidence in front of you.""
What I referred to above as slow load following (sometimes referred to as baseline power) is not considered by many independent experts to be load-following, though to a certain extent both coal fired generators and nuclear powered generators follow and eventually catch up with the load.
 I haven't refused to accept the evidence in front of me. You have not provided that evidence.

Because when a grid operator needs a 100MW reduction in the next 10 minutes, they need 100MW, as measured in watts. Either a plant can slew that 100MW, or it can't.

Yes but a 2,000 MW capacity generator will have a much larger slew rate than a similar 100 MW capacity generator. So what's the point of expressing power slew rates in terms of MW per minute to compare generators of such different capacity?
You need to take into account the maximum capacity of the generator and the rate it slews from zero kW per minute. At what rate do the the nuclear reactor generators slew from zero kW output? 
A 200 MW capacity gas turbine would have a much lower power slew rate expressed in MW per minute than a 2,000 MW capacity nuclear reactor generator but ten 10 such 200 MW capacity gas turbines with a combined capacity of 2,000 MW could have a higher power slew rate expressed in MW per minute than the nuclear powered generator with a 2,000 MW capacity.

See my post above re dispatchable power.
Use cases for dispatchable generators are:
Load matching - slow changes in power demand between, for example, day and night, require changes in supply too. Peak matching - short periods of time during which demand exceeds the power of load matching plants; generation capable of matching these peaks in demand is implemented through quick deployment of power by flexible sources.
Lead in times - periods during which an alternative source is employed to supplement the lead in time required by large coal or natural gas plants to reach full output; these alternative sources can be deployed in a matter of seconds or minutes to adapt to rapid shocks in demand or supply that cannot be satisfied by peak matching generators.
Frequency regulation or intermittent power sources - changes in the electricity output sent into the prison may change quality and stability of the transmission system itself because of a change in the frequency of the electricity transmitted; renewable sources such as wind and solar are intermittent and need flexible power sources to smooth out changes in energy production.
Back-up for base-load generators - nuclear power plants, for example, are equipped with nuclear reactor safety systems tat can stop the generation of electricity in less than a second in case of an emergency.
The demanding requirements are not mine, they arise out of the grid, the changing pattern of demand, the different rates at which generators can ramp up to meet that demand, and the changing patterns of supply from solar and wind. 
The different requirements for dispatchable power at different rates of dispatch require different power sources - from slow changes to match long term load, to peak matching and lead in time covering sources as well as combinations of these different rates of delivery.

""Coal-fired power stations can take days to fire up from cold to full capacity and when demand slumps during off peak periods, shutting down isn't an option.""
""So when these power plants were built in Australia, a market solution was created, says Professor Anthony Vassallo, Chair of Sustainable Energy Development at the University of Sydney.""

""But today as more and more renewables such as wind are feeding the grid, coal-fired power stations are often forced to pay to keep their turbines running when demand drops.""
""'At night when wind in some areas is generating a lot (of power), it's the coal-fired power stations that don't get dispatched and the price can drop negative - below zero dollars - and so the (big) coal generators end up having to pay for people to take their electricity,' Professor Vassallo says.""
""If not base load, then what?""
""Researchers argue that this 'base load' of supply from coal-fired power stations has been falsely translated as a baseline of consumer demand.""
""'The idea of there being an average or 'base' electricity load, doesn't make sense. Let alone having this sort of big, slow-changing power station to meet that load' says CSIRO Energy Director Dr. Glenn Platt.""
""Things are much more dynamic and the difference between the minimum and the peak amount of electricity we use is huge these days.""
""Throughout the day, electricity demand peaks in the morning as people get ready for work, and again in the evening.""
""But electricity use also changes across the year, with huge differences between hot summer days, when air-conditioners are at full blast, and mild sporing nights - with particular lows at unusual times like Christmas night.""

In the UK we have the situation where just five or so years ago, off-shore wind was more expensive than nuclear, and deployments were slow, but now we are issuing contracts close to half the price of our nuclear white elephant (HPC), and they'll come on line sooner too.
BQENDWell Hornsea 1 is just coming online this week at a cost of £155.53/MWh

That's a lot more expensive than nuclear, even the very expensive First Of a Kind reactor, Hinkley point-C.
The current bid price for non FOAK new nuclear is £75/MWh, pretty much identical to the 2022 price for offshore wind at Triton Knoll.I think that was Thames Array at £220/MWh or the Swansea Tidal Lagoon at £123/MWh index linked for 90 years!
If you're going to use Hinkley point-C (a baseload plant) as your nuclear benchmark then you'll have to use FOAK offshore wind as its level... and not forget[!] to add the cost of intermittency, which UKERC say is up to an additional £45/MWh for just a 50% penetration of your preferred intermittent supply.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1550192962000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'14842422', u'in_reply_to': u'125792931', u'id': u'125889107', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Erik Frederiksen', u'text': u'And a few hundred million refugees.

Baseload is a strange concept.
BQENDTo my thinking it is surely the easiest concept - it is the minimum load on the grid.
The level below which demand does not go at any particular time.
So if you have a grid that supplies between 15 and 25GW on a 24hr cycle, your 'base load' is 15GW - no flexibility is required (in principle) - in reality it is a mix and match of what is available and at what price.

""The point is, like gas, it is a dispatchable supply as are older reactors in France and Germany.""
As I pointed out previously, there is dispatchable power and there is dispatchable power, because some means of electricity generation and supply can be dispatched more quickly than others. Coal fired power stations, and the older reactors in France and Germany, are slow dispatchers.
""You can throttle down a CCGT gas plant but it becomes less efficient and emissions / kWhr get even higher.""
This doesn't occur with throttling up in response to a sudden peak in demand but does it occur with throttling down during a continuation of the peak? Because the gas turbine part of the CCGT (combined cycle gas turbine plant) is a quick power dispatcher, it is used in response to a sudden peak or sharp increase in demand. If the peak once climbed proves to have a flat top, slower forms of dispatchable power such as nuclear reactors, gas thermal plants, wind farms and solar panels can be deployed allowing throttling down of the gas turbine part of the CCGT plant at a time of high demand with the excess heat still being used in the steam turbine part of the plant making no difference to the emissions per kWhr.
""Hence why we (and most developed nations) plan to use nuclear for baseload plus renewables.""

BQSTART
We use updated drainage inventory, ice thickness, and ice velocity data to calculate the grounding line ice discharge of 176 basins draining the Antarctic Ice Sheet from 1979 to 2017. 
We compare the results with a surface mass balance model to deduce the ice sheet mass balance. The total mass loss increased from 40 ± 9 Gt/y in 1979–1990 to 50 ± 14 Gt/y in 1989–2000, 166 ± 18 Gt/y in 1999–2009, and 252 ± 26 Gt/y in 2009–2017.
During the entire period, the mass loss concentrated in areas closest to warm, salty, subsurface, circumpolar deep water (CDW), that is, consistent with enhanced polar westerlies pushing CDW toward Antarctica to melt its floating ice shelves, destabilize the glaciers, and raise sea level.

That is close to the 10 year doubling time which James Hansen noted in a 2016 paper would bring multimeter sea level rise in around 50 years.
Historically however, sea level rise has not followed a smooth, exponential curve, but has been marked by periods of rapid rise when sections of ice sheets collapsed, known as meltwater pulses.

Germany has already admitted that its plan to phase out nuclear has forced it not only to keep coal, but to open new coal plants and strip mines (one of which currently threatening an ancient forest) and so their emissions have not fallen - it would hurt their coal sector.
It could be argued that their phasing out of nuclear was an unprecedented subsidy to the coal sector. 
So despite these calls from President Macron, the German coalition government refuses to hold polluters accountable. “We say no to a price on CO2” said the CDU with a masterly piece of swapping nuclear for coal+renewable greenwashing that a surprising number of self styled environmentalists seem entirely at peace with.

I mentioned above the speed of hydro-electric power pumped storage or ordinary storage. I also mentioned the role of the 7,686 MW of pumped storage in France and am familiar with the similar geography.
I agree that the solution is mix of technologies each playing to their own strengths. Different places with different climates and geographies have their own individual different mix of different technologies.
At each stage of the response to a sudden increase in demand a different technology comes on line. Batteries such as the 100 MW one in South Australia are the first and fastest. Pumped hydro is not far behind by a matter of seconds. Queensland's 590 MW of pumped hydro in Wivenhoe Damis the first response to a sudden jump in demand. South Australia gets most of its water from the Murray River not very far above sea level. Much of the state is desert, so hydro stored or otherwise is not an option. Battery storage is their only option followed by gas turbines. Queensland has 3,477 MW of gas turbine capacity.
Australia is the size of Europe or mainland USA. The amounts of wind and sun varies from place to place. Most of the mainland is well provided for with sun. In the south winter winds off the southern ocean lows that bring cloud cover and rain coincide with times of high wind chill. Cold. clear frosty nights are rare but occur increasingly as global warming moves the lows further south in spring. This affected last years wheat crop.
Tasmania has large amounts of hydro and exports power across Bass Strait. During the severe El Nino of 2015-16 Tasmania's hydro dams ran dry at a time when their link to the mainland was damaged. On their north-west coast in particular they are very well suited to wind power. Stored hydro could be used in conjunction with this resource. Since 2016 the construction of a number of wind farms has started in Tasmania.
Baseload is a strange concept. Minimum demand occurs on pleasant days, cool pleasant nights, when there is plenty of solar and wind power to meet that demand. There are however cold still frosty nights with high demand and hot days as seen in the recent southern heatwaves with even greater demand. On such hot still summer days solar panels come into their own but other sources are needed to meet that Everest of demand peaks.', u'recommendation_count': u'12', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1550150269000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'12483673', u'in_reply_to': u'125859874', u'id': u'125866764', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'onthefence', u'text': u'BQSTART
Walsunda - But that load-following mode is much slower than hydro power and slower than gas turbine power.
BQEND
I see you still can't let the load-following thing go.I can't understand its central importance to you, but let's press on.
Current French Gen III nuclear slews at 65MW/min, (5%/min), the newer EPR slews at 80MW/min.For comparison, the AEMO planning assumption for new gas is 10MW/min for CCGT, 20MW/min for OCGT (although most are faster than that).That is, OCGT, whose main benefit is rapid response, needs to have a 20MW/min slew rate.
The new BoA lignite plants in Germany slew at 30MW/min. Their main selling point in Germany has been that their ultra-fast slew rate can track variations in wind output, making them a good match for wind and solar.
Here's a gushing RWE press release, explaining how Environment Minister Peter Altmaier and 400 assembled guests marvelled at the BoA lignite plant's enormous slew rate:
BQSTART
Efficient and highly flexible: BoA 2&3 makes important contribution to transforming German energy industry and climate protection RWE Press Release, 15 Aug 2012 
... Federal Minister for the Environment, Peter Altmaier and RWE CEO, Peter Terium gave an impressive demonstration of the plant’s flexibility to the over 400 guests. Instead of the usual start signal, they gave the order for a rapid reduction in electricity production. Within five minutes, the output of one unit was reduced by over 150 megawatts – and then equally rapidly restored, demonstrating the power station’s ability to offset the intermittency of wind and solar power.
BQEND
Decades-old nuclear can slew at twice that rate.
Dinorwig pumped storage hydro slews at 6800MW/min. It's an exceptional special-purpose capability. It's there to provide grid services that nothing else can. No one claims that nuclear (or anything else) will replace Dinorwig's function.

Unfortunately, after a careful review, we find their analysis doesn’t stack up.
The ANU briefing note has surprised, if not shocked, many in the expert and analytical community with detailed knowledge of Australia’s climate and energy policy.
Numerous international and national efforts to examine Australia’s climate and energy policy have all concluded that the government will not reach, on present policy settings, the 26-28% reduction from 2005 levels by 2030 it has put forward under the Paris agreement.
To achieve a 26% reduction below 2005 levels in national emissions – the lower end of Australia’s Paris agreement target – would require about a 75% penetration of renewables in the power sector by 2024, whereas the ANU scenario projects 50%, which is not enough to reach the Paris target.
The ANU briefing, possibly inadvertently, creates the impression that all that would be required is a continuation of the recent rate of renewable energy deployment. That is simply not the case, not without major policy interventions, which are unlikely – at least under the current government.
The government’s claim that the ANU briefing note shows it will achieve the Paris agreement targets “at a canter” is manifestly false. The rapid and continued rollout of renewable energy into the power sector assumed in the ANU briefing paper is something that the Australian government actually opposes.
The government’s policies are aimed at slowing the renewable energy rollout, and in particular maintaining coal in the power sector at any scale, which essentially contradicts the premises of the ANU paper.
The present large and increasing rollout in the utility sector is driven by the renewable energy target. Given that this expires in 2020, that specific economic incentive will disappear.
While the penetration of 50% renewables by 2025 may be plausible in the absence of further policy developments, it is not considered plausible that close to 90% penetration could be achieved by 2030 without substantial policy action.
Such reductions would also require phasing out coal almost completely from the power sector by 2030, which is clearly not supported by a federal government that is currently trying to promote more coal power, not less.
While the low cost of new renewable supply is also a clear driver, market barriers are already in evidence, along with grid connection issues that require active intervention.
As the ANU briefing note argues – and as is shown in peer reviewed studies (including by the authors of the briefing note) – achieving renewable energy penetration rates in the power sector at this scale by 2030 is technically and economically feasible.
However, there is a consensus in the expert community that these levels of penetration will not be achieved without further policy and grid development. An effective exit of coal from the power sector in Australia by 2030 would be one of the necessary steps in achieving this.
There is a very important role for renewable energy in the non-power generation sectors, such as industry, mining and agriculture. While the recent growth rate of renewables in Australia’s power sector has been high by world standards, it is also the case that the penetration of renewable energy into Australia’s total primary energy supply has not progressed rapidly and is relatively stagnant. This would need to change for Australia to meet the Paris agreement goals, and as a further major opportunity for the renewable industry.
The government’s own projections, updated most recently in December 2018 with present policies, show that by 2030, emissions will be at only 7% below 2005 levels.
The other explanation for the ANU’s anomalous finding is what appears to be a substantial underestimation of the ~70% of national emissions outside of the power sector – the emissions from direct combustion, transport, fugitives, agriculture, industrial processes, waste, and land use and forestry (LULUCF).
This is important, as the power sector only accounts for about 34% of national emissions (and declining), and overall emissions from these other sectors are growing.
The ANU assumes an average increase from these sectors of 2 MtCO2e per year. However, government projections indicate this increase is likely to average around 5.4 MtCO2e a year, on average, to 2024 or 2025, and then about 4.0 MtCO2e per year to 2030 (all from post 2018).
Given the underlying lack of policy, the historical growth rates and the trends in efficiency improvements of emissions in these sectors, the government projections look reasonable. The reduction rates the ANU paper assumes are far below any reasonable estimate.
Finally, it is also worth noting that the Paris agreement targets put forward by the Australian government are insufficient to meet the agreement’s 1.5°C long-term temperature goal. The Paris agreement would require reductions of 45- 60% by 2030 for the whole economy.

Nelson Mandela once said: “Our children are our greatest treasure. They are our future. Those who abuse them tear at the fabric of our society and weaken our nation.” Human planetary abuse is, in a very real sense, child neglect.
As many of us and other fellow academics have indicated previously in this newspaper (Letters, 27 October 2018), the scientific evidence of climate change is clear. For example, the summer of 2018 has been confirmed by the Met Office as the hottest on record for England. The heatwave adversely affected crops across Europe, with wheat and potato harvests reduced by one quarter, which in turn impacted upon food prices. Australia is similarly experiencing “hottest on record” weather events. As citizens across the globe will know and testify, many comparably disturbing examples could be given. We cannot nurture our children without Nature.
We are rapidly losing sea ice in the Arctic. The warming of the ocean, the melting of land ice and the ensuing rising sea levels will threaten coasts. In 2018, the European Drought Observatory noted a high deficit in soil moisture across Scotland, Ireland and much of northern Europe. This increases the risk of wildfires, such as those we saw across England in 2018. As well as posing a direct threat to life, fires produce toxic smoke, which is a significant health risk to young and old alike. Sir David Attenborough has warned: “If we don’t take action, the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon.” Many other organisations, like Extinction Rebellion, are now working to bring the truth about the ecological crisis to the public’s attention.
It is with these tragic and desperate events in mind that we offer our full support to the students – some of whom may well aspire to be the academics of the future – who bravely plan to strike on 15 February to demand that the UK government takes climate action. They have every right to be angry about the future that we shall bequeath to them, if proportionate and urgent action is not taken. We are inspired that our children, spurred on by the noble actions of Greta Thunberg and many other striking students all around the world, are making their voices heard.Alison Green, PhD (Psychology), National Director (UK) ScientistsWarning.orgSir Tim Smit Co-Founder, Eden Project &amp; Exec Chair Eden Project InternationalProfessor Kevin Anderson, Joint chair of Energy and Climate Change at Manchester and Uppsala UniversitiesProfessor Tony Watts OBEMolly Scott Cato MEP, Professor of Green Economics, University of RoehamptonChris Rapley CBE, Professor of Climate Science, UCLProfessor T.

Thousands of the more than 8 million school pupils in the UK are expected to walk out of lessons to show their concern about the threat of escalating climate change.
Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat education spokeswoman and a former science teacher, said she will be joining a rally in Oxford and urged school leaders to accommodate pupils who join the protests.
“As a former teacher I absolutely understand the frustrations that teachers and schools may have with these strikes. However, I would describe this as a teachable moment,” said Moran, the MP for Oxford West and Abingdon.
“I hope schools, colleges and universities see this in the positive light it is meant and equally hope those students act sensibly with making sure adults know where they are and making up the missed work.”
But the National Association of Head Teachers, which last week offered some support for those joining the strike, gave a more hard-headed assessment to its members as the day of the action approached.
“Pupils should only be out of school in exceptional circumstances. Whilst NAHT supports the right of young people to express themselves, first and foremost, pupils should be in school during term time,” the union said.
“While a school leader’s role is to ensure children attend school, are kept safe and receive a good quality of education, it is right that individual school leaders can decide how best to respond to any proposed protest by students in their school on Friday.”
Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT teaching union, said young people were right to be concerned about climate change but warned that teachers had genuine safeguarding issues to consider.
“It’s not appropriate for pupils to just walk out of school. The young people organising this are potentially putting themselves and others at risk by simply walking out of school,” Keates said.
“Teachers take their responsibility for pupils welfare during the school day seriously and while they may have sympathy for the cause will not be able to condone pupils just walking out.
“A well-planned, accessible demonstration of young people at a weekend or during a holiday would enable thousands to participate and be a powerful protest.”
The Department for Education’s guidance says unauthorised absences must be recorded as part of safeguarding, but gives room for headteachers to approve absences in “exceptional circumstances”.
The organisers have written form letters for the parents of those wanting to take part, which argue that protesting qualifies as civic engagement and climate change is an exceptional circumstance.
With the strike taking place on the final day before half-term holidays in many parts of England, some schools may adopt a relaxed attitude. But others have already informed their students any absence will be noted as unauthorised.
Geoff Barton, a former secondary school headteacher who now leads the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “While we understand the strength of feeling over the very important issue of climate change, we would urge pupils against walking out of school on Friday.
“It is extremely disruptive for a school to have to deal with unauthorised absences and pupils will be missing out on important learning time.”
The day of action follows the example of Greta Thunberg, a 15-year-old Swedish schoolgirl who began protesting outside her country’s parliament in August. Her solo effort has since grown and spread to countries around the world including Germany and Australia.
In a letter to the Guardian, more than 200 UK academics said they offered “full support” to the school strikers. “They have every right to be angry about the future that we shall bequeath to them, if proportionate and urgent action is not taken,” it said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/14/uk-pupils-climate-change-strike-headteachers-unions-schools

Condos are still being built. Can't humans see the writing on the wall?,article,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/15/florida-climate-change-coastal-real-estate-rising-seas,0,"I stood behind a worn shopping center outside of Crystal River, Florida, looking for the refuge where a hundred manatees were gathered for winter. I found them clustered in the emerald-colored spring, trying to enjoy a wedge of sunlight and avoid the hordes of people like me, boxing them in on kayaks and tour boats, leering over wooden decks. The nearby canals were lined with expensive homes and docks with jetskis. One manatee breached the water for a breath, and I could see the propeller scar on its back.
2018 was the second deadliest year on record for manatees. Like many of our coastal species, they’re vulnerable to habitat loss and warming seas, which are more hospitable to algal blooms and red tide. Science has given us the foresight we need to make decisions that will reduce the future suffering of other species and ourselves, but we don’t heed it. Why?
Studies show that humans don’t respond well to abstract projections. We overvalue short-term benefits, such as driving SUVs, burning coal and building waterfront real estate. We choose these extravagances even though they impede beneficial long-term outcomes, such as saving threatened species, or reducing the intensity of climate change.
Humans tend to respond to immediate threats and financial consequences – and coastal real estate, especially in Florida, may be on the cusp of delivering that harsh wake-up call. The peninsula has outsized exposure: nearly 2 million people live in coastal cities. On the list of the 20 urban areas in America that will suffer the most from rising seas, Florida has five: St Petersburg, Tampa, Miami, Miami Beach and Panama City. In 2016, Zillow predicted that one out of eight homes in Florida would be underwater by 2100, a loss of $413bn in property.
I flew into Miami in early December and the risk was visibly apparent from the airplane window. Aerial views of Miami and South Beach show high density construction on flat, sandy slivers of land. A recent National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicts Miami streets will flood every year by 2070.
South Beach was vibrant and populated, with mega-yachts docked in front of luxury homes, sorbet-colored art deco-era hotels rising a block from the water, cafes misting customers on the sidewalks, neon signs flashing bright in the night sky. But I wondered: given the forecasts, why are people still building new condominiums?
In Florida, you will see a bewildering mix of optimism, opportunism and denial in the real estate market: luxury condominiums going up in flood-prone South Beach, and property values rising in the vulnerable Keys, post-Hurricane Irma. And though the House of Representatives passed a bill to require real estate agents to disclose flood risks, the Senate has not reviewed it, and a culture of “systemic, fraudulent nondisclosure” persists in high flood risk areas.
You will see the massive benefits of privilege, and the way it allows a homeowner, particularly a second home owner, to afford the risk. You will see emerging issues like Miami’s climate gentrification, where previously low-income neighborhoods like Little Haiti are rising in value and under pressure from developers because of their higher ground, resulting in the displacement of people and place-based culture. Haitian playwright and bookstore owner Jan Mapou recently told a reporter: “Gentrification is coming forcefully: developers buying the major corners, raising the rents, forcing renters onto month-to-month leases … We’re not against development or modernization … but respect the people living there, their culture, their history.”
I spoke with a developer who wanted to remain anonymous, given business interests. He told me that he’s surprised that people are still buying, building and investing in coastal Florida. He estimated that a decade ago, only one in 10 buyers asked about the property elevation, or expressed concerns about rising seas. Today, nearly six of 10 ask and many decide not to buy in these same critical areas. “I’m worried we’re one bad storm away from a rush for the exits,” he told me.
I sought input from the environmental community as well. “Real estate is a huge economic driver here,” Laura Geselbracht, a senior marine scientist with the Nature Conservancy, said. “And it’s at risk from sea level rise. People don’t want to believe it. That’s a normal human condition – suspension of belief.
“If you’re not a millionaire and you own a property in a vulnerable area, it may be a wise decision to think about moving before the masses think about moving,” Geselbracht said. She also owns waterfront property on a canal in Fort Lauderdale, and is deeply invested in her community, but has cautioned her child not to expect the same lifestyle in the future.
She wonders why she doesn’t see more people of means in south Florida buying electric cars, getting solar panels and living more sustainably. “The quicker we take action, the better. We’ve got to be leaders so that we have a longer horizon of survival here,” she said. When she’s approached community leaders in the past, asking them to take steps toward sustainability, she often hears the same response: “Technology will solve it.”
It’s a high-stakes gamble. Consider innovative mitigation in action: raising roads, shoring up sea walls, adding pumps and drainage upgrades, beginning dredging projects, offering complex insurance structures. Proximity to these short-term solutions are not always pluses in a home buyer’s column, but acute reminders of vulnerability.
While Geselbracht is optimistic about developments like Orlando’s zero emissions goal, and Miami’s forward-looking Forever bond, she’s not ready to pin all her hopes on innovation. She also wonders about the fallacy of “safe” investments elsewhere. “There are air quality issues and forest fires out west, and extreme heat inland.”
I spoke with young farmers who recently decided to purchase a farm away from the coast. “As we looked for farmland to buy, we certainly thought hard about what the climate would be like in 10, 20, 30 years,” one of the owners of Ten Mothers Farm told me. “We knew we didn’t want to be near the coast, and we wondered whether even being in the south-east was a bad idea. Ultimately we decided that the most important thing was to be in a community that’s supportive and that we believe will be resilient.”
While baby boomers may be slow to adjust spending behavior to climate change, the Florida developer told me, millennials will not, and that shift will likely impact the market in the decade to come.
I grew up in two eastern North Carolina towns, Rocky Mount and Atlantic Beach, that have been bludgeoned by hurricanes. There, friends have real estate that falls into an increasingly common, and expensive, pattern: flood, repair, rebuild. Many are locked into this expensive, emotionally draining pattern because they can’t sell their homes, which have been flooded multiple times.
Browsing real estate in nearby New Bern, which was dramatically flooded by Hurricane Florence last year, reveals the terminology indicative of this practice. Homes are presented as a “blank canvas” and “waiting to be brought back to life”. There are optimistic takes, too, like “circumstances have created great potential”, and “great fishing”.
According to a 2018 report from the Union of Concerned Scientists, it’s not just houses that will flood, but also “roads, bridges, power plants, airports, ports, public buildings, military bases and other critical infrastructure along the coast”. Furthermore, the report indicates that financial markets have not accounted for this future downturn. The economic impact will be “staggering” and the window for towns to maintain creditworthiness and build resilience is “narrowing”.
The Union of Concerned Scientists point out that “nearly 175 communities nationwide can expect significant chronic flooding by 2045” and of those “nearly 40% – or 67 communities – currently have poverty levels above the national average”. States with areas of particular concern are North Carolina, Maryland and Louisiana, where a significant percentage of at-risk properties are owned by people of color.
The climate change-induced real estate crisis is imminent in the south, and it’s going to have a brutal impact on those who can’t afford new insurance, relocation, lowered property values, or bandages such as private sea walls. It will have an outsized impact on homeowners who live in flood zones or near over-heated superfund sites and toxic factories, and those who can’t afford to pay taxes on submerged land where they can no longer make a home.
I look at real estate listings and wonder, what if the places you love most are no longer a good investment? What if we’re so focused on denial, data and property that we fail to grasp the human side of the situation?
The moral imperative to act is not about salvaging expensive second homes on the waterfront. It is about taking responsibility for human action, helping frontline communities solve a complicated economic and cultural challenge, and doing what we can to help species whose survival is imperiled by our lack of foresight.

However, the school has an exchange programme by which students from other continents spend a term being tortured in the Hong Kong education system, presumably working on the principle that suffering builds character. My wife insisted that our daughter take part in the scheme, because 'it's something that middle class families do'. Full stop. I was eventually forced to submit despite having severe misgivings about the value of the programme. And how right I was. We were forced to host two Australian Chinese girls for eight weeks in our tiny flat. These teenage antipodeans were rather bored, for three main reasons. Firstly, they were already from an Anglo Chinese background, so culturally there was little or nothing for them to learn in Hong Kong. Secondly they had already been to the city several times and one of them even had close family here. Thirdly, this was their fourth or fifth long-haul overseas trip of the year, and frankly by the age of fourteen they had got rather blasé about jetting around. I was hard pressed not to point out to the school that they were putting a lot of effort and resources into ensuring that spoilt kids with massive carbon footprints got a bit more spoilt and pumped out yet another few unnecessary tons of CO2. And this was supposed to be education.
The thing about this venture that drove me up the wall more than anything else was the question of why anybody thought this was a good idea. The organisers are highly educated and presumably the kind of intelligent people who keep abreast of international affairs. They know that guests like those in our household will almost certainly know Hong Kong well, and so it is a waste of time them coming, but much more crucially that it is a waste of energy which sets an appalling example for all the affluent young people in their care. The school managers, given that they are presumably not brain dead, absolutely have to know about the perils of global warming and the burning necessity for informed people in the twenty first century to start trying to do something to combat it. And yet they vigorously encourage their students to waste their time taking these frivolous flights around the world, in the full knowledge that every air ticket has a double carbon impact because it is an exchange programme, and for every local student flying to Australia there is an Australian counterpart flying the other way in the same week. In a very real sense, the school is acting like a coal-fired power station, churning out ton upon ton of carbon dioxide and encouraging impressionable young people to adopt this moronic behaviour as a lifelong habit. (Of course it should be said that this is not an entirely fair comparison. At least the dirty generating plant does actually produce something useful and worthwhile, such as the electric power for subway trains and hospitals.)’', u'recommendation_count': u'6', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1550255040000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u""it 's something that middle class families do"", u'effect': u'my wife insisted that our daughter take part in the scheme'}, {u'cause': u'it is an exchange programme', u'effect': u'that every air ticket has a double carbon impact'}], u'author_id': u'2516115', u'id': u'125917144', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'DisunitedKingdom', u'text': u'I'm not, I assure you.

So I salute the children striking back | George Monbiot,article,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/15/planet-children-protest-climate-change-speech,0,"The Youth Strike 4 Climate gives me more hope than I have felt in 30 years of campaigning. Before this week, I believed it was all over. I thought, given the indifference and hostility of those who govern us, and the passivity of most of my generation, that climate breakdown and ecological collapse were inevitable. Now, for the first time in years, I think we can turn them around.
My generation and the generations that went before have failed you. We failed to grasp the basic premise of intergenerational justice: that you cannot apply discount rates to human life. In other words, the life of someone who has not been born will be of no less value than the life of someone who already exists. We have lived as if your lives had no importance, as if any resource we encountered was ours and ours alone to use as we wished, regardless of the impact on future generations. In doing so, we created a cannibal economy: we ate your future to satisfy our greed.
It is true that the people of my generation are not equally to blame. Broadly speaking, ours is a society of altruists governed by psychopaths. We have allowed a tiny number of phenomenally rich people, and the destructive politicians they fund, to trash our life-support systems. While some carry more blame than others, our failure to challenge the oligarchs who are sacking the Earth and to overthrow their illegitimate power, is a collective failure. Together, we have bequeathed you a world that – without drastic and decisive action – may soon become uninhabitable.
Every day at home, we tell you that if you make a mess you should clear it up. We tell you that you should take responsibility for your own lives. But we have failed to apply these principles to ourselves. We walk away from the mess we have made, in the hope that you might clear it up.
Some of us did try. We sought to inspire our own generations to do what you are doing. But on the whole we were met with frowns and shrugs. For years, many people of my age denied there was a problem. They denied that climate breakdown was happening. They denied that extinction was happening. They denied that the world’s living systems were collapsing.
They denied all this because accepting it meant questioning everything they believed to be good. If the science was right, their car could not be right. If the science was right, their foreign holiday could not be right. Economic growth, rising consumption, the entire system they had been brought up to believe was right, had to be wrong. It was easier to pretend that the science was wrong and their lives were right than to accept that the science was right and their lives were wrong.
A few years ago, something shifted. Instead of denying the science, I heard the same people say, “OK, it’s real. But now it’s too late to do anything about it.” Between their denial and their despair, there was not one moment at which they said, “It is real, so we must act.” Their despair was another form of denial; another way of persuading themselves that they could carry on as before. If there was no point in acting, they had no need to challenge their deepest beliefs. Because of the denial, the selfishness, the short-termism of my generation, this is now the last chance we have.
The disasters I feared my grandchildren would see in their old age are happening already: insect populations collapsing, mass extinction, wildfires, droughts, heatwaves, floods. This is the world we have bequeathed to you. Yours is among the first of the unborn generations we failed to consider as our consumption rocketed.
But those of us who have long been engaged in this struggle will not abandon you. You have issued a challenge to which we must rise, and we will stand in solidarity with you. Though we are old and you are young, we will be led by you. We owe you that, at least.
By combining your determination and our experience, we can build a movement big enough to overthrow the life-denying system that has brought us to the brink of disaster – and beyond. Together we must demand a different way, a life-giving system that defends the natural world on which we all depend. A system that honours you, our children, and values equally the lives of those who are not born. Together, we will build a movement that must – and will – become irresistible.

The youngest clutched a parent’s hand as people gathered in the sunshine in Parliament Square in London, a few metres from the politicians they say are letting down a generation.
They carried homemade placards, with slogans full of humour, passion and hope that the voices of thousands of children and young people would be heard.
“March now – or swim later”, “I’ve seen smarter cabinets in Ikea” and “denial is not a policy” read the banners, as chants for action on climate change grew and strengthened with the passing hours into a deafening roar. “What do we want? Climate action! When do we want it? Now!”
Across the UK it was a day for thousands who are not normally heard, as children took time out of their lessons to attend the strike.
“As students we don’t have the vote, and it is really unfair because this is going to impact on us the most. It is our future,” said Evie Baldwin, 15, from north London.
In Manchester, the students came with handwritten notes from their parents giving authorisation for their photos to be taken, and bullet points to explain why they felt compelled to strike.
There was a party atmosphere outside the central library, as students played Where is the Love? by the Black Eyed Peas and I Want It That Way by the Backstreet Boys.
They cheered as a band played Joni Mitchell’s Big Yellow Taxi, with its ecological refrain: “Don’t it always seem to go, that you don’t know what you’ve got till it’s gone/They paved paradise, put up a parking lot.”
Lillia Adetoro, nine, told Manchester demonstrators: “Scientists across Europe say we have 12 years to get this right. The technology is there. The solutions are there. Brilliant minds across the world have been working on this for decades. And what they have said has been ignored.”
Children who had been told not to miss school defiantly attended the rallies anyway. Ten-year-old Hettie Ainsworth, in Brighton, had not been given permission by her primary school to join the protest, but such was her passion that her parents let her attend anyway.
To her, the issue was personal. She said: “The government isn’t doing enough about it. It’s important because it’s our future and if we don’t start paying attention to climate change, there may not be one.”
There was a range of age groups present, from people in their 60s, to children as young as four and five, running around in superhero costumes. Swedish 15-year-old Greta Thunberg was frequently cited as an inspiration by adults and children.
One group called Fridays for Future Manchester, which has been meeting outside the library every week for more than two months, stood with a banner painted with Thunberg’s face on it. Protesters from Extinction Rebellion and Campaign against Climate Change were also present.
Similar crowds were seen across the north of England, with organisers assembling in Leeds, Newcastle and Sheffield.
Magid Magid, Sheffield’s lord mayor, who banned Donald Trump from visiting the city last year, said there was no better time to march than now. He said: “It’s as simple as action or extinction … [These students] come across as the fearless advocates in the face of those who have stopped caring about [the climate crisis]. They are literally saving our bloody planet.”
At the clock tower in the centre of Brighton, hundreds of primary, secondary and university students gathered. 
As they marched towards the Level park, the crowd swelled. According to organiser Mary-Jane Farrell, more than 1,000 people were in attendance. While adults and supportive parents followed, teenagers in school uniform marched at the front of the crowd, shouting, among other things: “Greens in, blues out” and “Fuck the Tories”.
The procession blocked traffic on Brighton’s main roads, and onlookers clapped and took photos as people passed through.
Joe Paugler, 16, left his school during break time to join the march. He said he felt the need to raise awareness. “They don’t discuss climate change as much as they should in politics, probably because there’s no money in it,” he said.
Critics of the strike had suggested some students would use the strike as an opportunity to skip school, but most children seemed more excited by the prospect of attending their first protest.
At Level park, crowds cheered for several of the day’s speakers, but the loudest applause was undeniably for the local Green party MP, Caroline Lucas.
Surrounded by children vying to get a selfie with her, she said today marked a real turning point. “It’s children’s futures at stake, and frankly our generation has let them down and certainly the politicians at Westminster have let them down,” she said.
Hundreds of young people gathered across Glasgow, cheered on by MSP Ross Greer, who tweeted: “Just look at these incredible young women, who can’t be older than 13/14, taking action to save the world and their future.”
In London, there were more than 1,000 in attendance by lunchtime. Among them was former Labour leader Ed Miliband with his nine-year-old son, Daniel. “I am here because it is our future, and we need to protect it,” said Daniel.
The size of the demonstration took the police by surprise. “I don’t know how many are here, but it’s a lot – much more than we expected,” said one officer.
Several hours in, what had begun as a rally outside the House of Commons turned into a spontaneous running march on Downing Street, as hundreds of teenagers, sprinted along Whitehall to chant their message outside No 10.
As they surged down the road, buses, trucks and taxis, were forced to stop. “Honk your horn,” the teenagers shouted, to blasts from scores of drivers.
Other groups broke away from the main crowd to sit down in the road, forcing Westminster traffic into gridlock for more than two hours. Holding hands, they refused to be moved, as the police deployed mounted officers in an attempt to move them back into Parliament Square.
One officer successfully lifted 15-year-old Alex Cooper off the road – only for her to continue her seated protest moments later. “This is a great turnout,” she said. “We need the government to listen.”
Across the street, among those watching from the sidelines, one woman said: “My 13-year-old daughter is in there somewhere. I am so proud of her.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/15/children-climate-inaction-protests-uk

Groups made up of scores of demonstrators wearing black to mourn those whose lives have been devastated by environmental destruction caused traffic standstills for seven-minute intervals, unfurling banners saying “Rebel for life” and holding placards inscribed “Climate change = mass murder”.
Models and protesters mingled outside the main venue at 180 Strand in central London throughout Sunday, with lighthearted impromptu catwalks staged while leaflets were passed to motorists and bystanders warning of the catastrophic consequences of unsustainable growth and inaction over climate change.

Attendees outside the events said that ethical considerations had become fashionable, even mainstream, though campaigners contended they had always been trendy. “Minds in fashion are changing right now,” said Jonas Aucher, a French fashion student. “Fast-fashion brands like Zara have a huge impact, and the protesters are right that the industry has to change.” However, he added: “Recycled products are too expensive.”
Roxanne Murray, a stylist on her way in to an event, emphasised that most people were sympathetic to the need to be more environmentally conscious and that fast fashion needed to slow down. “We don’t have to buy new, cheaply made clothes,” she said. Shop at secondhand stores and wear vintage. Fashion isn’t just about you, it’s about all of us. If we all change together, it will have a great impact.”
Some fashionistas dismissed the protesters’ concerns, while others questioned whether climate change was indeed a man-made phenomenon. “We are in a diabolical situation and it’s too late to convince climate deniers,” said Caroline Vincent, a scientist. “We do need to engage, but we really don’t have the time: we must convince the people who already recognise there is a problem to do something about it.”

The afternoon of civil disobedience by about 150 people passed peacefully with no arrests, as organisers stayed in constant contact with police on the ground and allowed emergency vehicles to pass when required.
Following one of the constructive conversations between protesters and drivers halted by the traffic, a liaison officer said the action had been a pleasure to police, adding: “You are getting the point across.”
Shortly after, one motorist who refused to turn off his engine during the stoppage shouted, “Fuck off back to Richmond. Can’t you move these soapy bastards?”
However, most people waited patiently and read the leaflets, and the sound of horns swiftly subsided as chants of “What do we want? Climate justice. When do we want it? Now!” echoed down the street.
Extinction Rebellion met the BFC on Tuesday to discuss the action it planned to take. The group also discussed how the industry body could use its influence to transform fashion into a force for cultural change that would stop the trend for excessive consumption and respond to the “urgent and existential threat of climate change”.

Clare Farrell, a fashion designer and co-founder of Extinction Rebellion, said: “We need to hold thought leaders and creators of culture to account. The fashion industry’s influence permeates deep within culture and radiates globally.
“While the fashion industry is not responsible for the unsustainable system it exists within, it is a key driver of global trends and a significant source of ecological devastation.”
She said global clothing consumption had doubled in the past 15 years, while utilisation – how often clothes are worn – had decreased by 36%, with total greenhouse gas emissions from textiles production, at 1.2bn tonnes annually, exceeding those of all international flights and maritime shipping combined.
“There are no signs that this is slowing, and events such as London fashion week contribute to and encourage this continued unsustainable growth,” Farrell added, saying that the fashion industry was the most influential on earth.
The BFC said it showcased British businesses engaging in sustainable practices and that it believed shifts within London-based brands could spearhead changes within the wider industry.
“We are committed to supporting businesses to do more to develop through green growth and our hope is that London fashion week becomes synonymous with responsible business in the years to come,” a spokesperson said. “We believe that more than any other capital, London has an opportunity to be a part of a cultural change around sustainable business practices that put creative product at their core.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/feb/17/climate-protesters-take-action-to-disrupt-london-fashion-week

A single tree planted in the open becomes extra vulnerable to storms or droughts. Fatal weakening of its roots is often hastened by farmers treatig the surrounding land with chemicals then ploughing close up.

But the beech is not universally popular with woodland enthusiasts. Some fear it outcompetes oak, taking over mixed woodland. This is because it produces more seed and its saplings thrive in shade, while young oaks need stronger sunlight.
Some say beech trees should be culled in British woodland because they are a non-native species; however it has since become clear that they have been here since shortly after the last ice age.
As climate change bites and droughts become more frequent, research suggests it is the beech rather than oaks we should fear for in the future.
Scientists studying the tree rings of both species have compared the growth rates for each year with the droughts during the 20th century. They discovered the periods when oak trees grew faster than beech have been increasing, particularly since 1970, and were linked to the changes in temperature and rainfall.
Beech trees suffer more during droughts because they have shallower roots, while oaks reach moisture deeper in the soil and continue to grow. ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/feb/18/weatherwatch-drought-threatens-britain-beech-trees

“None of us fit easily in any box, but we all hold each other in high regard,” he wrote.
“If we can’t talk to each other about the future course of our country, who can?
“Maybe,” he added, “we could see if old friends can at least have a conversation about these issues without demonizing each other.”
Steiger was proposing a political rendezvous amongst friends – some Republicans, some Democrats, some in the wild, open range in between – who have largely avoided the subject for their more than 30-year history together.
In other circles, Steiger’s request may have seemed commonplace. At the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering, a weeklong festival of western poetry and song cherished by thousands for its cultivation of community, it was a perilous suggestion. More than a few performers, they say, have shot themselves in the foot proselytizing in Elko. Of the five poets Steiger initially invited to participate in his offsite roundtable, two respectfully declined.
The rodeo poet Paul Zarzyski, a diehard liberal from Great Falls, Montana, was one of them.
“These people are so locked in. I was going to run head-on in that room,” he later told me. “I didn’t need that here. Elko might be the one place I can come to and disconnect. When I go back, I’m going to be looking on Huffington Post in the morning. I’m going to be watching MSNBC. I’m going to be thrown right back in again and this is a little sanctuary for five or six days.”
The rest of them quietly gathered in the old Hotel West, the Basque steakhouse next door boisterous with tourists and townies, the blinking lights of Elko’s tiny brothel district visible from the back door. They sat around a large dining room table, discussing climate change and immigration, passing the “talking stick” back and forth and striving unsuccessfully – like newcomers to a board game – to follow the rigid guidelines of a Socratic dialogue: more questions, fewer opinions.
The son of a rancher and five-term Arizona congressman, Gail Steiger grew up with “a different brand of politics”. He used to accompany his father Sam to the weekly meetings of the Arizona delegation, and though all but one of them were Republican, he says, the lone Democrat commanded equal respect at the table.
“They’d laugh about that, but they were friends! They would sit down and say, ‘What is best for Arizona?’ They really tried hard to do that.”
But he’d never harbored any particular fantasy of a career in politics, not after watching the way it skewed so many simple encounters into perverse transactions, everyone “blowing smoke” to gain access to his father. After he dropped out of college to help run his father’s Senate campaign in 1976, he shut the door on politics for good, suddenly all too aware of just how manipulative and hollow the enterprise could be. The final straw was an encounter with the then-governor, Ronald Reagan, who agreed to endorse his father.
“He stands right on his mark and he looks at that camera and in one take – you would have sworn that he and my father had known each other their whole lives and they were just like this,” he says, crossing his fingers. “This guy had sincerity like you wouldn’t believe.”
“We’re packing up, and I can hear [Reagan’s assistant] leading him out there in the room and he goes, ‘Okay, Governor. This guy is the beer distributor. This guy started these little stores called Circle K … That light came on and it was like, holy shit! This guy’s an actor. He’s been practicing lines and making you believe him his whole life. This is show business.”
Finally disillusioned by politics, Steiger earned a business degree in Colorado, took a summer job working cattle back in Arizona and gradually fell in love with the work; he’s been running cattle ever since. He credits the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering with shifting his perspective on environmental stewardship. The forum in Elko, which mixes ranchers and environmentalists, conservatives and liberals, helped him see what both groups have in common – an intimate connection to the land.
“If climate science suggesting we should take steps to reduce our use of fossil fuels …is in error,and we take the suggested action anyway, the downside will be that we’ve left more fossil fuel in the ground for our descendants,” he wrote to those involved in the roundtable discussion. “If the preponderance of climate science is correct, and we do nothing to alter our carbon footprint, the downside will be that we’ve rendered our planet uninhabitable for humans and many other species, all for the short term gains of those who currently benefit most from the status quo.”
Steiger’s views on immigration stem primarily from his own experience working with undocumented immigrants in Arizona, the “overwhelming majority” of whom he found “to be honest, hardworking people who did their jobs, supported their families and paid their taxes”. He’d rather see the US focus its time and money on the “economic conditions, lawlessness, violence and desperation that causes people in Mexico and Central America to seek asylum here”.
Born and raised on a ranch near Jiggs, Nevada, a ghost town 36 miles south of Elko, Waddie Mitchell quit school at 16 years old. Like the cattlemen and “true cowboys” he idolized as kid, he soon found himself starting colts for a nearby ranch and living alone in a tiny bunkhouse with little but his own imagination to occupy him.
That first winter alone, he was desperate for thicker gloves and new boots; his parents sent him a box of old books instead. “I thought it was the worst present ever,” he says. But the isolation got the best of him. He finally dived in. “To this day, I think it was the best present I ever got.”
It planted the first seed of what would later become a full-time career in the arts, writing and performing cowboy poetry for audiences across the country, from Elko to The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. In between, he’d buckaroo all over the west, serve a tour in Vietnam, break horses for the US Cavalry in Fort Carson, Colorado, get married, raise five kids, and help found the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering in 1985.
In recent years, Mitchell has been an outspoken supporter of the Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, whose refusal to pay federal grazing fees led to an armed standoff in 2014 with government agents. Mitchell has written a host of op-eds for the local newspaper arguing against government overreach and the Bureau of Land Management’s treatment of ranchers whose roots in the area predate the enforcement of grazing limits on federal lands.
“We should not allow these unconstitutional, martial-law minded BLM globs to abuse power THEY GAVE THEMSELVES, against citizens who, unlike the tax suckers, actually produce something,” he wrote in the Elko Daily Free Press in January 2016.
Like the poet John Dofflemyer at the other end of the table, Mitchell stops short of declaring global warming a manmade issue, but he calls the increase in extreme weather events in his lifetime “substantial” and says he stands with “the scientists, not the petroleum pamphlets, on this one"".
“No matter our feelings on climate change, we need to clean up our act, steward all of our eco-systems as they are all interrelated. Try to help earth live in her natural state,” he wrote the group. “Our children and grandchildren will have to live with the air, water and policies we leave for them. If humankind is not responsible for the earth’s climate change, we are [still] responsible for how we live and the messes we make.”
As for immigration: “When they [immigrants] break the law coming to this country, we take it too lightly. I don’t feel we should feel obliged to house, feed, give medical attention or financial assistance to those here illegally. I believe we should do better helping the Native peoples, to care for our own sick, those who go home to die because they can’t afford medical costs,” he wrote. “I prescribe to family, tribe and America first, then our somewhat flawed policies and prescribed path to citizenship.”
Vess Quinlan was 10 years old when he contracted polio. One day he was helping his uncle break horses on a ranch near Eagle, Colorado. The next he was “crippled”, he says, confined to the hospital for a year, subject to the doctors’ whims and his mother’s whimsy, neither of which allowed for even the slightest suggestion of a return to the ranch. He killed the time reading Will James and the poems his grandmother had clipped from the livestock papers and collected in a shoebox, tranquillized by a stiff cocktail of existential despair.
His mother eventually moved the family to Pueblo, Colorado, where his teachers tried their best to steer him towards more intellectual pursuits. But the cowboy never left him, and his heart remained at the ranch.
“It created this huge conflict with everybody around me. With my folks, with my teachers. And that’s my little problem with authority.”
At 15, he ran away from home and spent the rest of his teenage years hiring himself out at various ranches, earning $20 a month and attending roughly nine high schools before finally cobbling together enough credits to graduate. He kept working as a ranch hand until he met his wife, who purchased a farm and ranch in the San Luis Valley. They’ve lived there ever since.
Quinlan doesn’t question whether the climate is changing – it always has, he says – but he’s hardly convinced it’s a manmade issue, nor does he place any faith in warnings from “publish-or-perish scientists and professors” whom he believes are often bought and paid for by corporate interests. “The same agencies and scientists that are now predicting manmade global disaster,” he says, were predicting the same when he first moved to the valley in 1970.
“But it didn’t really matter: the experts were predicting a coming famine because other farmers were even dumber than me and allowing erosion to wash all their topsoil into the Gulf of Mexico and would soon be trying to plant their soybeans on bedrock,” he wrote. “And besides, we were running out of fossil fuel and would soon be reading by candlelight and canning our meat. What meat we had left was from ranchers even dumber than farmers who were destroying their pastures by overgrazing.”
Like Steiger, he’s worked with many undocumented immigrants over the years, almost all of whom were “decent people and good hands”. If he were living in the same conditions they fled from, he says – the cartel violence and economic despair – he’d do the same.
“I would be here asking John for a job picking fruit in his orchards, or asking Gail for day work on the Spider Ranch. If caught and sent back, I would start walking north as soon as I got off the bus.”
And though he believes America has a responsibility to “develop a fair, affordable, and accessible immigration system”, he also considers tight border security a moral imperative: “I think it is immoral when we steal the best and brightest from poor countries by not controlling our border. Most of the illegals I worked with over the years were a credit to this country and would have … been a credit to their own if given a chance at a decent life.”
Zarzyski grew up in awe of his father, an iron ore miner in Hurley, Wisconsin, and the brute force with which he approached every facet of his life, whether a mile deep in the hematite mine or “making firewood”.
From an early age, he learned to throw his everything into everything. It’s an ethic he carried to graduate school at the University of Montana, where he studied poetry under the celebrated American poet Richard Hugo and began competing as a bareback bronc rider. He kept at both until his mid-30s, subsisting on occasional winnings from the rodeo circuit, meager paychecks from a part-time teaching gig at the university, and the scraps he earned from his published work. Serendipitously, just as his body began to give out, he found a wider community for his work through the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering.
Few who are familiar with his work would be shocked to learn Zarzyski – one of the few here to write in mostly free verse – is liberal. Still, he makes it a point to step aside from politics each year when he enters Elko county, and he has dedicated more than a few poems to close friends across the aisle.
“If you’re asking, ‘Do I bring it out in the open verbally?’ the answer is no. It would be an extreme violation of all the goodness this gathering has stood for,” he says. “I have witnessed year after year people making pilgrimages here because they’re in need of something missing from their lives that they can’t quite articulate, but they had a pretty strong instinct that if they came here, they would be graced with that mecca-something or other, and they almost always inevitably are.”
Outside the confines of the gathering, however, he rarely holds back. Consider the final stanza of his unpublished poem, Knock-Knock-Knocking On Doomsday’s Door, which lampoons both humanity’s stupidity in the face of climate change, and the seemingly futile nature of his own work in the face of global crisis.
…This poem,
then, exists only to sift its own ashen
bone-fragment remains
through its own chaliced fingers
raised in a pathetic gesture
of reckoning, raised to the billowing God-
cloud of what was once
each and every miracle, each
and every mystery, each and every
molecule of merciful matter
this poem held dear – of what was
once living, breathing
twice-blest you … me … them … us … it.
Cognizant of his own half-Italian, half-Polish ancestry and their passage through Ellis Island, Zarzyski strongly identifies with those immigrants fleeing dire circumstances in their home countries.
“They came here to give, as well as to receive … and I’m not convinced that the larger majority of immigrants seeking security and safety for their families today do not harbor similar sensibilities as did our European immigrants,” he writes.
“I understand, as well, that the ‘green new deal’ coupled with the long-overdue rebuilding of infrastructure in this country is not the panacea to all that ails us, but I can’t help but wonder just how integral – how ‘symbiotic,’ if you will – are the solutions to immigration and climate change? Bottom line, it’s’ all going to come down to fresh perspectives and an entirely new way of applying hard work, white- and blue-collar work alike, to save us from ourselves, from destroying this glorious orb that gives everyone of us our, and everything its, existence.”
A fifth-generation cattleman in Tulare county, California, John Dofflemyer “weaned” himself on the poetry of Gary Snyder, which he first encountered as a teenager while packing mules in the Sierra Nevada. “I ran across his work and just came undone,” he says. “His poetry really spoke to me in that minimalistic form. Gary doesn’t use a lot of multisyllabic words, and I realized, shit, I was capable of writing.”
After graduation, he enrolled at the University of Southern California, distractedly studying business, certain “my graduation present would be an AR-15 and some camo gear”. But he failed the draft physical with a bum knee from a rugby injury and instead returned home to work the family ranch full-time. After first performing at the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering in 1989, he launched the quarterly Dry Crik Review, encouraging verse grounded less in the past than the cowboy present, the challenges and opportunities facing ranchers today. Though he no longer prints the physical chapbooks, he continues to publish his own work on the Dry Crik Journal website. Work like The Climate of Change, in which he finally asks:
How long can we be entertained
by delusion, the dissolution
of civility, of compassion
as the planet prepares
for the business of war –
already overstocked with banks
of houses stacked upon
the fading fruited plains?
Dofflemyer often resists crediting human activity for global warming, but either way, he wrote: “It’s only prudent to make provisions for a warmer and drier climate where we can.”
As for immigration: “Congress needs to address our immigration policy in a practical and humane way. Separating children from their parents and holding immigrants in concentration camps is no better strategy than completing the construction of a wall that has been tunneled under for decades. Instead of a political bargaining chip, the Daca program needs to be resolved compassionately.”
An anti-war demonstrator during his college years, he admits he’s lately grown fatalistic, that he views his own political involvement as “a futile exercise.” And perhaps more importantly, he says, “relationships with neighboring ranchers are too vital and important for us to jeopardize, so it’s out of respect for them and getting along that we don’t discuss politics.”
Later that week, as visitors flooded downtown Elko and the group scattered to fulfill their various performance schedules, each of them told me separately they had never held any hopes of changing anyone’s mind and were certain no one had. Still, they were curious to see how the night would play out.
A few of them felt the exercise was important, a test of their friendship, an affront to the larger partisan forces currently alienating friends and relatives. Though none of them tested the waters again – certainly not on stage – they regretted little more than their own mismanagement of the dialogue. They had opined too much, or their questions had been too narrow, or they had lost track of the order. They had never gotten around to income inequality.
“I don’t have any illusions of saving the world, but you do what you can,” Steiger says. “And I will tell you that I feel a lot better after trying than I did just ranting and raving about those stupid son-of-a-guns who don’t agree with me.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/19/cowboys-politics-climate-immigration-poetry-nevada

But amid growing concern among Americans about the overheating planet, one potential 2020 presidential candidate is aiming to hoist climate to the top of the agenda.
Jay Inslee, the gravel-voiced governor of Washington, is poised to enter the throng of Democrats vying to dislodge Donald Trump as president in the 2020 election. He’s made some exploratory moves, visiting Nevada and New Hampshire, and said a definitive decision on running will be taken in “weeks”.
“He’s embarrassing. Even Republicans are embarrassed about him,” Inlsee said of Trump in an interview with the Guardian. “To fail to mention the greatest existential threat in the world is pathetic. He’s a blip in history we need to get over, and quickly.”
Climate change will be the cudgel that Inslee will use in the ballot box fight, an issue he considers perniciously overlooked by America’s leading political figures even as the US is tormented by more powerful hurricanes, scorching wildfires and submerged coastlines.
“We need a fundamental shift in our national priorities. There’s too much to risk to belittle climate change,” Inslee said. “You cannot overstate the scope of what needs to be done. We literally have to decarbonize our economy in the next few decades. That’s a huge transition. It’s the largest economic change in history.
“I think there’s only one potential candidate who views this as the paramount issue, one candidate who wrote a book on it, only one candidate who has experience as an executive doing these things. That’s me. I sense timidity from others because it hasn’t been done before, but we need to go pedal to the metal.”
Twelve years ago, as a US congressman, Inslee co-authored a book that compared the effort of eliminating planet-warming emissions to the Apollo space project launched by John F Kennedy.
He’s since attempted to distill these ambitions into policy in Washington – he has been governor since 2013 – by pushing forward plans to expand renewable energy, cut emissions from buildings and promote electric cars. In a state stuffed with progressives who savor their lush forest surrounds, this agenda has by and large received nods of approval. Inslee was comfortably re-elected in 2016.
The governor is now looking to an outsider’s run in 2020, centering his campaign on tackling the unfolding disasters of climate change while the worst can still be averted. He hopes that growing public concern over climate change will encourage people to view it as an existential emergency that requires a vast national mobilization.
A record proportion of Americans – 59% in a recent Yale poll – say they are alarmed or concerned by climate change, having recently seen colossal hurricanes hurtle into Texas, Puerto Rico, Florida and the Carolinas, record wildfires raze vast tracts of California and a string of warm years spawn unbearable heatwaves across the country. Clear majorities, when asked, also support levying a carbon tax on fossil fuel companies and agree that protecting the environment is more important than economic growth.
Despite this, many Republicans continue to ridicule climate science and paint any sweeping remedies as fanciful. Many Democrats, meanwhile, have been galvanized by the idea of a Green New Deal, headed by the new congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, although the leading presidential contenders have yet to make climate change a central issue.
“We need to blow the bugle on this,” Inslee said. “The Green New Deal is exciting. It raises ambitions and alerts people to the scale of the problem, the scope of it. This wouldn’t be a one-note candidacy; it touches on everything from national security to asthma.”
Inslee is attempting to drape the monumental challenge posed by climate change in comforting, familiar garb, pointing to his love of hiking, gulping in clean air gazing at snow-capped mountains and enjoying salmon fishing. These homespun enjoyments are under threat.
“The forest fires were so grotesque last year that we had the worst air in the world in Washington,” Inslee said. “We were choking. It’s a very personal thing for me.”
Inslee, 68, hopes Americans will be similarly inspired by the moon landings when contemplating a scenario in which, scientists say, the world must completely revolutionize the way we farm, transport ourselves and generate electricity within a few decades to avoid catastrophe.
“This is about the American character as much as it is about chemistry and physics,” Inslee said. “It’s about igniting core convictions of Americans, that we can be innovators rather than anchoring ourselves to old industries.”
It’s still unclear, however, whether Americans will want to vote for policies to enable this vision. In November’s midterm elections, voters in Washington state rejected a fresh attempt to implement the country’s first carbon tax. The Inslee-backed initiative lost following a hefty campaign against the measure funded by the oil industry.
A separate cap on carbon is in place but may be removed by the state supreme court in March. Another setback in this green, economically robust state would raise further questions over the national viability of bold climate policies.
Inslee is a “kind of a square peg in a round hole because he wants to be a carbon warrior”, said the Washington state senator Doug Ericksen, a Republican. “Washington state already has an extremely low carbon footprint.”
Perhaps a more realistic goal for Inslee than capturing the Democratic nomination would be to help shift focus on to climate change following years of political and media inertia on the issue.
“There will be a lot of lip service to climate change but a lot of the candidates won’t be able to tell a toaster from a solar panel,” said Nick Abraham, who campaigned for the carbon tax and now works at the Washington Environmental Council. “Jay Inslee has been nothing but consistent that this has been his No 1 priority. He’s walked the walk.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/19/jay-inslee-2020-climate-change-interview

""Atmospheric CO2 is currently just below 400 parts per million (ppm) on average. It last reached similar levels during the Pliocene (5.3-2.6 million years ago). At that time, temperatures rose to levels 2-3°C warmer than today, and sea level rose by up to 20m in places. Sea level takes a few hundred years to reach equilibrium in response to changes in atmospheric CO2 and temperature, which may explain why sea level has not yet risen to the same levels seen in the Pliocene.

""Recent estimates suggest CO2 levels reached as much as 415 parts per million (ppm) during the Pliocene. With that came global average temperatures that eventually reached 3 or 4 degrees C (5.4-7.2 degrees F) higher than today’s and as much as 10 degrees C (18 degrees F) warmer at the poles.

You stop adding CO2 today and you'll still have a MINIMUM of a 5m mean sea level rise before 2200. It could well be before 2100.
The changes are small in the near term but still incredibly costly and irreversible.

I also bought and enjoyed ‘Out of the Wreckage’ and heard you talk at the first ER protest. Perhaps you will allow me time to make four points, I appreciate your indulgence in advance. First, patently, climate chaos has not been ‘caused’ by a couple of institutions, no matter how powerful and complicit they are. Not even the fossils fuels companies caused us to do what Willam Catton set out clearly decades ago. It was a logical response to extract fossil fuels which brought about a dynamic age of ‘exuberance’ as Catton coined it. This was not a set of evil beings triggering chaos out of greed and sociopathology, was it? So if this movement develops a short story that does serious injustice to history, physics or the tragic but completely understandable evolutionary imperatives it will have to fail because it will be peddling a partial and ultimately false narrative. Let’s always remember Darwin and in his footsteps, William Reese who repeatedly wrote and said in lectures, that what we do is ecology 101. Any species will use everything at its disposal to grow until it dominates the ecosystems it inhabits including reproducing and consuming, if it does run run into other species that put a check on it, to the point that healthy natural limits are overshot. And overshoot is where we are, no? This is something the ‘kids’ need to internalise not just recognise cognitively. We are not in the midst of a crises of problems we are smack in the middle of a set of dilemmas which means that hard ethical choices will have to be made. Triage and salvage and yes, restoration all must play a part. Not just restoration will have to be made clear and discussed in public. Also what we have to give up and why and how and in what time frame and with what chances of it making any significant difference, yes even that sad last calculation has to be transparent and honest. No hopium, we cannot afford it. 
Second, transnational corporate capitalism is very very strong and not stupid. It has happened in the past that potentially capitalist-threatening movements have been successfully coopeted by such as they. Corporations have control of the public relations and marketing of well, everything under the sun. Not everyone who has doubts about the astonishing media success of ER is a conspiracy theorist. The shock doc showed how equity firms, hedge funds, banks, insurers and other financial “services” know how to use unmitigated horrors as fantastic opportunities for profit. And don’t forget what an exciting and potentially lucrative demographic Gen Z is. Also, that fourth industrial revolution is not going to happen without pots and pots of funding now is it? Signs of the financialization of nature as a part of the green economy can even now be found although much effort goes into not being transparent. 
Third, the complete interweaving of the military complex and the ‘growth’ economy is a block to taking effective action on climate change. A feedback loop has been created as the global economy has to continue to expand in order to keep the military power of states going but that continuing expansion of resource depletion and overshoot will stop any kind of significant reduction in CO2 emissions. Kevin Lister (The Vortex of Violence) wrote about this extensively. Without a very vocal stance on demilitarisation, the hard truths of economic destabilisation and their connection to degrowth this movement could well end up as the others you have named. 
Finally, you wrote that soon you will present your research on the drawdown of CO2. As many others I have looked into this albeit not deeply enough. Still, it is hard to see how any form of geoengineering can be scaled up to the levels required in the window or opportunity left. Some would argue that a number of tipping points have passed already. That means even if we were to reach zero carbon tomorrow with literally hundreds of thousands of CO2 sucking machines going full blast day and night for a few decades at least (without themselves emitting any GHGs) we are still in for it.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1550682507000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'companies', u'effect': u'us to do what willam catton set out clearly decades ago'}, {u'cause': u'it will be peddling a partial and ultimately false narrative', u'effect': u'it will have to fail'}], u'author_id': u'15436413', u'id': u'126119749', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'baselinebob', u'text': u'You can if you want and it will do about as much as these protests', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1550682305000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'16787174', u'in_reply_to': u'126090327', u'id': u'126119596', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'lawrencd', u'text': u'BQSTART

We must all help | George Monbiot,article,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/20/manifesto-youth-climate-strikers-win-fight,0,"This one has to succeed. It is not just that the youth climate strike, now building worldwide with tremendous speed, is our best (and possibly our last) hope of avoiding catastrophe. It is also that the impacts on the young people themselves, if their mobilisation and hopes collapse so early in their lives, could be devastating.
To help this movement win, we should ask why others lost. We should ask, for instance, why Occupy, despite the energy and sacrifices of so many, came to an end, while the institutions it confronted remain intact. We should wonder why the global justice movement of the late 1990s and early 2000s, despite the numbers involved, their courage and determination, has not changed the world. We should consider why Podemos, the Spanish party that rose so high on the optimism of the indignados movement, now seems to be spiralling into recriminatory collapse.
Much of what I propose here is controversial, and I can't promise I've got it right
Those of us who witnessed these disappointments have, I feel, a painful duty to be as honest about them as possible, to help ensure their failures are not repeated. Much of what I propose here is controversial, and I can’t promise I’ve got it right. So my first advice is this: don’t listen only to me.
A central task for any campaign is to develop a narrative: a short, simple story explaining where we are, how we got here and where we need to go. Using the narrative structure common to almost all successful political and religious transformations, the restoration story, it might go something like this. “The world has been thrown into climate chaos, caused by fossil fuel companies, the billionaires who profit from them and the politicians they have bought. But we, the young heroes, will confront these oligarchs, using our moral authority to create a movement so big and politically dangerous that our governments are forced to shut down the fossil economy and restore the benign conditions in which humans and other species can thrive.”
This restoration narrative, I think, could be greatly strengthened by recent findings suggesting that ecological recovery – restoring forests, salt marshes, peat bogs, the seabed and other crucial ecosystems – could, by drawing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, make a massive contribution towards preventing climate breakdown. (I’ll write about that when I finish my research on the subject, in a few weeks). A successful movement should also define a clear and tangible objective, perhaps a date by which nations achieve a zero-carbon economy. It could recommend a pathway, such as a ramped-up version of the green new deal proposed by the most progressive Democrats. If so, it will need to set a series of waymarks, by which it can judge whether or not governments are on track. This ensures that the activists, rather than the government, keep setting the agenda.
This objective should be supported by a set of irreducible principles that can be explained and spread with pride and conviction. Here are a couple of possible examples. “Human life is not negotiable, it cannot be exchanged for money.” “Those generations that are yet to be born have the same rights as those already alive.”
Clear principles appear to be essential to the long-running success of a campaign. A fascinating report in the online magazine Truthout explains how indigenous people living around Lake Texcoco in Mexico confronted a $13bn international airport – one of the biggest infrastructure projects in Latin America – and, across 17 years, and despite all predictions, won. The campaign was built on the principle that their land and community were not for sale, however much money might be offered. This ensured that the Mexican government’s only remaining strategy was force. But the people had created such strong community organisations and attracted so much support from other Mexicans that force ceased to be an option.
This suggests another crucial element: a protest community strong enough to resist all attempts at division and co-option. Such communities do not arise by accident but are consciously and carefully constructed, often with the help of training, music and fun. They must be strong enough to support people threatened by despair, burnout or breakdown, especially when the response gets nasty. Already, conspiracy theories are being spread by politicians and the media, suggesting that the young people have been organised by unknown sinister forces: after all, how could children possibly organise themselves?
Greta Thunberg, whose school strike sparked this movement, has written a response far more dignified and mature than the articles attacking her. But the nastiness has only just begun. As some of us can testify, the viciousness of the lobby groups funded by the fossil fuel industry, and the publications that amplify their message, knows no limits. As we have already seen, they treat even children as fair game.
I would suggest that the climate strikers develop clear rules of engagement, in order to give their opponents no ammunition. In my view, the global justice movement was gravely damaged by its failure to exclude or contain the black bloc: people dressed in black, some of whom came to protests tooled up for a fight and often smashed up random local businesses, denting support for the mobilisation with every blow. Some people in the movement believed that everyone had a right to join it on whatever terms they wished. I see this as an unaffordable indulgence.
A good exercise is to ask yourself what the police and authorities would most like to happen, then do the opposite. They would love a violent faction to emerge that would erode the young strikers’ credibility and provide an excuse to send in the riot police and break up the protests. Never give them this excuse.
Successful movements also need an organisational model that allows them to keep growing. One promising approach is Big Organizing, through which campaigners create proliferating networks, each branch of which trains the branches that grow from it. It helped Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez take her seat in the United States Congress. They need clever, funny and innovative tactics, which take opponents by surprise and create a sense of forward momentum. Designing such tactics, narratives and principles is, I believe, best done by a small number of people, then put to the wider group for approval. I saw how Occupy became bogged down in the impossible process of developing complex policies through consensus.
All this is a lot to dump on young people. But there are plenty of veterans, many of whom have far more experience than I do, who are ready to offer advice and help. Any support must come on the young strikers’ terms: they lead, we follow. But they carry a terrible burden: this is a struggle they cannot afford to lose. We will help them lift it if they wish.

The New South Wales education minister, Rob Stokes, appeared on Sky News earlier this week, warning students and teachers against attending rallies planned across Australia for Friday 15 March, as part of the school climate strike movement.
“These are on school days, school children on school days should be at school,” Stokes said during an interview with the Sky News host Chris Kenny.
“You simply can’t strike if you don’t have a job … the law is very clear, this is a notified school day, kids should be at school.”
The Liberal MP also said if teachers did not turn up at school on the day, “then the same sanctions would apply to anyone who misses a day of work without reasonable excuse”.
The Swedish student activist Greta Thunberg, 16, responded to a tweet from Sky News paraphrasing the minister’s warning to students, saying students heard his message but “we don’t care” and that his statement “belongs in a museum”.
Ok. We hear you.And we don’t care. Your statement belongs in a museum.#FridaysForFuture #ClimateStrike #schoolstrike4climate https://t.co/6iJFkgyX9D
The deputy prime minister and Nationals leader, Michael McCormack, delivered a similar message to students about attending school instead of the protest during question time on Wednesday, when asked by the Greens MP Adam Bandt about the strike.
“The children should be in school. They should be learning about Australian history, Australian geography,” said McCormack.
“Who’s going to look out for those kids when they’re out protesting?”
Thousands of Australian students attended rallies on a day of protest around the country on 30 November 2018, demanding action on climate change.
Organisers hope a larger number of students and adults will attend the next protest in March, which will take place a week before the NSW state election and just prior to the likely start of a federal election campaign.
The November protests attracted opprobrium from some federal leaders, with the prime minister, Scott Morrison, saying he wanted to see “less activism” in schools, and the resources minister, Matt Canavan, saying the “best thing you’ll learn about going to a protest is how to join the dole queue”.
Stokes, a former NSW environment minister and vocal supporter of renewable energy, was at the time actually an isolated Coalition voice expressing sympathy for the sentiment behind the students’ climate change protest, while maintaining he did not support the strike itself.
“A passionate generation of young scholars consistently hear a wilful ignorance of scientific evidence and expert advice from many elected officials,” he told the Sydney Morning Herald in December.
It was not the first time he has taken a thinly veiled dig at some of his federal counterparts’ views on climate change. In 2017, Stokes appeared to criticise the former prime minister Tony Abbott’s stance on climate change, warning that “anti-intellectualism” on the issue risked undermining faith in Australia’s education system.
Stokes’ appearance on Sky News followed a front-page story on the News Corp-owned Daily Telegraph in Sydney on Monday, headlined ‘Pupils used as climate pawns’, that contended school students were being coached and given detailed instructions on “how to play truant, make posters and organise ‘marshals’” by “taxpayer-funded eco-worriers” from the Australian Youth Climate Coalition.

The AYCC said in a statement after the publication of the story it was “proud to support the School Strike 4 Climate movement with logistics to keep them safe at their march, leadership training and fielding calls from journalists during school hours.” It is also an administrator of the Facebook group School Strike for Climate Action.
Since Thunberg’s lone protest outside the Swedish parliament, student-led climate marches have been held around the world, while the teenager herself has addressed the United Nations climate conference and the World Economic Forum in Davos.
She has used her Twitter account, where she has more than 194,000 followers, to deliver blunt retorts to politicians before.
Five days ago she responded to similar criticism from Theresa May about British students missing class to attend a 15 February climate strike in the UK by saying: “British PM says that the children on school strike are ‘wasting lesson time’. That may well be the case. But then again, political leaders have wasted 30 yrs of inaction. And that is slightly worse.”

Similar rigour should be applied to whether, and how, this issue is included in the curriculum. The claim that climate change is a “peripheral subtopic” in geography is simply not supported by the evidence (Teachers demand emphasis on climate change in curriculum, 22 February).
For example, the statutory geography national curriculum requires that pupils study how our climate has changed from the ice age to the present. In addition, pupils should also understand how human and physical processes interact to influence and change landscapes, environments and the climate; and how human activity relies on effective functioning of natural systems.
Comparable requirements are also included in geography GCSE and A-level courses, which are studied by 250,000 and 35,000 pupils respectively each year.
By combining study of the physical and human worlds, geography provides a unique context to study how our climate is changing and how we might adapt to and mitigate against the changes; an education that all pupils deserve and that geography can provide.Steve BraceHead of education and outdoor learning, Royal Geographical Society (with IBG)

The prime minister confirmed on Monday the government would spend $56m in an effort to progress a new 1,200MW interconnector as part of Tasmania’s “battery of the nation” project and he also sent a strong hint he will back Malcolm Turnbull’s pet project, adding 2,000MW of new generation capacity at Snowy Hydro.
The Tasmanian project is a plan to double the state’s renewable energy capacity by developing pumped hydro energy storage, building windfarms and upgrading existing generation assets. Fourteen pumped hydro sites have been earmarked across the state with a combined potential generation capacity of up to 4,800 megawatts.
Under the plan, renewable energy would be exported to the mainland if a planned second interconnector goes ahead.
The additional generation projects and transmission infrastructure, as well as potential action to assist the rollout of electric vehicles, were flagged during a speech in Melbourne in which Morrison promised to rebadge and top up funding for the existing emissions reduction fund to the tune of $2bn over 10 years as part of a climate policy pivot.
The prime minister, who has faced internal pressure from MPs to give them something constructive to sell to voters on climate change, said the government was committed to addressing the challenge, and insisted a package of measures will ensure Australia meets its commitments under the Paris climate agreement.
One of the measures the government has factored in to help meet the 2030 target is a 367 megatonne abatement from carry-over credits (an accounting system that allows countries to count carbon credits from exceeding their targets under the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol periods against their Paris commitment for 2030).
The government’s policy shift was panned by Labor, the Greens, a range of climate experts and environmental groups. The shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, said Labor would scrap the fund if it won the next federal election.
“This has been their policy for the last five years, with exactly the same annual amount put into it as Scott Morrison has promised for the future, and yet we’ve seen carbon pollution go up year upon year, projected to continue to go up all the way to 2030,” Butler said on Monday. “This is a failed policy”.
Bill Hare, a climate scientist and the director of Climate Analytics, said the emissions reduction fund was “a failed policy”, with all independent analysis showing it had not reduced emissions to the extent the government claimed.
“They certainly have not shown up in the national emissions, which continue to increase,” he said.
Hare said the amount of annual funding proposed by Morrison halved what the original policy provided under Abbott. He said the government had also taken no steps to rectify problems with the scheme, including that emitters were currently able to use the safeguard mechanism to increase their emissions.
“The bigger issue is there’s no way the Australian taxpayer can pay for the emissions reductions needed, and nor should they,” Hare said.
“The polluter-pays principle needs to be applied and that means a carbon pricing system would enable companies to make an investment in their production that would benefit taxpayers and the bottom line.”
The Australian Conservation Foundation said the emissions reduction fund had done nothing to cut carbon pollution since its introduction and it was difficult to see how continuing with the same policy would lead to a different result.
“There are serious questions about the governance, effectiveness and value for money of the emissions reduction fund that a new name won’t fix,” Gavan McFadzean, the ACF’s climate change and clean energy program director, said.
“A responsible climate policy must include a whole-of-government and whole-economy approach to reducing pollution, but today’s announcement contains nothing about the energy sector or transport or agriculture or major industry – nothing about cutting pollution from the most polluting parts of our economy.”
Neneh Darwin, a campaigner at Greenpeace Australia Pacific, said topping up the fund was a choice by the government to do “as close to nothing” on climate policy as possible.
“First step in fixing the climate crisis is powering past coal – but the government is doing every single thing it can think of to delay that, including trying to actively prop up the industry by throwing as much taxpayer money at it as they can”, Darwin said.
The Investor Group on Climate Change, which has been focused on the financial risks associated with climate change, said by continuing with the same policy the government was not addressing the serious economic risks climate change exposed Australia to.
“There is a significant gap between the government’s current target and the objectives of the Paris agreement. This is of great concern for investors, as global warming above 1.5-2C would have large and detrimental impacts on global economies, society and investment portfolios,” the group’s chief executive Emma Herd said.
Herd said the government needed to close the gap between its long-term Paris commitments and the current policies urgently. She said investors were increasingly worried about climate change and would keep pushing governments to adopt policies that enabled a smooth transition to a net zero emissions economy.
“The government’s support for investigation into stronger network connection with Tasmania and large scale energy storage is important,” she said.
“This work should be undertaken in the context of the energy market operator’s Integrated System Plan and embedded within a strategy to achieve net zero emissions in the electricity sector.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/25/scott-morrison-pledges-56m-for-tasmanian-interconnector-in-climate-policy-reboot

Like governments in general, it is not possible to produce a detailed plan about everything that is going to happen - you have to set targets, regulations, general directions of travel, metrics, and lots of bodies produce projections and research in their areas of expertise.
Plenty of bodies have produced reasonably wide-ranging projection covering a whole relevant area.

You are correct that the strength of concrete and steel has gone up, and the material safety factors have also improved. Most concrete suppliers routinely use GBFS as a cement replacement.
You fail to mention that we have also had a technology revolution since the 70's thanks to greater analytical power, and FE is now routine rather than esoteric. As a result we now have composite steel frames, flat slabs, and post tensioning is now common place. All of this leads to huge savings in materials.
The nett result of these technological improvements is that we use a lot less cement and less concrete for comparable structures. Floors have longer spans with less depth. Non-engineers can see this every day in offices and shopping centres. Clients demand it, contractors demand it. 
The pressure to reduce material costs and volume is greater than ever. I have won contracts on this basis, enabling developers to squeeze in 11 floors instead of 10, or contractors to save time by using thinner post tensioned slabs as two examples.

A key strategy that seems to be emerging is cut-off dates.
All the main UK political parties signed an agreement that coal cannot be used to produce electricity in the UK after a cut-off date - 2030.
This means no change of policy if there is a change of government, and the generators have clarity.
In reality, it looks like it will be done by 2025.
A number of countries are setting cut-off dates for registering new petrol or diesel vehicles.
As a result, I suspect that by around 2030 no car maker will be putting old engine technologies in new models.
Cut-off dates worked for removing lead from petrol, and for dealing with CFCs that strip the ozone layer.
For fossil fuels we need different cut-off dates, dealing with the easier fuels and uses first.
The UK CCC says that by 2025 new builds should not be connected to the gas grid.
Boilers have a lifetime well within the time we need to switch to non-fossil space heating - within a couple of decades all older properties can be retrofitted with heat pump systems.
These are expensive now, but with millions required we get economy of scale.
It's clear that the target is a zero-carbon global economy by some point in the 2040s.
This is challenging, and yet progress to start reducing emissions is needed by around 2030.
Can it be done? I'm unlikely to be around long enough to find out.

The author introduces the concept that the production of 1 tonne of concrete  releases 1 tonne of CO2. But then switches to details of the CO2 potentially released through the production of cement for planned large projects. Perhaps a simple statement that concrete is made through the mixing of cement & x / y / z and in which proportions would tie things together more.
The statement that ""If it were a country, the cement industry would be the third largest in the world"" doesn't make sense. The relative size of countries in economic terms is generally based on GDP. So what is the ""GDP"" of the cement industry ? If ranking cement vs countries, has the ""GDP"" associated with cement production been excluded from the country comparison figures ? No figures are provided which reduces my confidence in any comparison provided
""The UN says its annual emissions need to fall about 16% in the next 10 years"" - this is very badly written. Is this the UN's emissions, or the cement industry's ? On what basis is the assertion that the cement industry could single-handedly cause a breach of the Paris Accord made ?
""Annual cement production has quadrupled from nearly one billion to over 4 billion tonnes a year in 30 years. In the next decade it is expected to increase a further 500m tonnes a year"". So 500m tonnes per year over 10 years = an extra 5 billion tonnes p.a. in 10 years time. So the industry will more than double in 10 years ? This does not seem credible. Or logical.

What is the relative expense of the alternatives vs concrete ? How much would the tax raise ? At what level would it be set ? These obvious questions are not addressed
""A high global cement tax, the theory goes, would concentrate industry’s minds and massively reduce demand for carbon-intensive cement, but any tax that raise energy prices would be very unpopular.""

It is enough, it has been calculated, to pave over the entire city of Manchester.
A more modest 3 million tonnes of concrete will be needed to construct the Hinckley B nuclear power station in Somerset, and the proposed new runway at Heathrow will require one million tonnes.
Cement, the key component of concrete and one of the most widely used manmade materials, is now the cornerstone of global construction. It has shaped the modern environment, but its production has a massive footprint that neither the industry nor governments have been willing to address.
This week Guardian Cities investigates the shocking impact of concrete on the planet, to learn what we can do to bring about a less grey world.
Our species is addicted to concrete. We use more of it than anything else except water. Like that other manmade wonder material, plastic, concrete transformed construction and advanced human health. But, as with plastic, we are only now waking up to its dangers.
Concrete causes up to 8% of global CO2 emissions; if it were a country it would be the world's worst culprit after the US and China. It fills our rubbish dumps, overheats our cities, causes floods that kills thousands of people – and fundamentally changes our relationship to the planet.
Can we kick our addiction, when it's so hard to imagine modern life without it? In this series of articles, Concrete Week will explore the impact of the material on our environment and us, and look at alternative options for the future.
Chris Michael, Cities editor
Because of the heat needed to decompose rock and the natural chemical processes involved in making cement, every tonne made releases one tonne of C02, the main greenhouse warming gas.
Including the new Crossrail line through London, the building of Britain’s four largest current construction projects will, if completed, together emit more than 10m tonnes of CO2 – roughly the same amount as a city the size of Birmingham, or what 19 million Malawians emit in a year.
Nearly 6% of all UK greenhouse gas emissions, and up to 8% of the world’s, are now sourced from cement production. If it were a country, the cement industry would be the third largest in the world, its emissions behind only China and the US.
So great is its carbon footprint that unless it is transformed and made to adopt cleaner practices, the industry could, on its own, jeopardise the whole 2015 Paris agreement which aims to hold worldwide temperatures to a 2C increase. To bring it into line, the UN says its annual emissions need to fall about 16% in the next 10 years, and by far more in the future.
While some of the biggest cement companies have reduced the carbon intensity of their products by investing in more fuel-efficient kilns, most improvements gained have been overshadowed by the massive increase in global cement and concrete production. Population increases, the urban explosion in Asia and Africa, the need to build dams, roads and houses, as well as increases in personal wealth have stoked demand.
Industry leaders are now embarrassed, aware that they are in danger of being financially penalised and tarred as climate laggards
Annual cement production has quadrupled from nearly one billion to over 4 billion tonnes a year in 30 years. In the next decade it is expected to increase a further 500m tonnes a year. Unless there is a dramatic change, cement emissions are expected to continue to rise beyond 2050.
Industry leaders are now embarrassed, aware that they are in danger of being financially penalised and tarred as climate laggards who refuse to change in the face of the climate emergency. They well know that not only is it quite possible to build most structures safely without cement, but their own research has shown that green, cement-like products using recycled byproducts which are just as strong can be made from other industries, such as steel slag, fly ash from coal-fired facilities or some types of clay. Instead they trust that nascent technologies like carbon capture and storage which could allow emissions to be buried will come on stream, and that more efficient plant will reduce cement emissions by as much as 20-25%.
This is wishful-thinking. The great bulk of the industry is inherently conservative, ignorant of the alternatives to cement and reluctant to adopt change. Conventional, or Portland, cement is trusted to be safe and strong and developers continue to specify it because it is cheap and the alternatives are not well-known. Without major demonstration projects showing what is possible, and the education of architects and planners, progress will be incremental and possibly too late.
But technological change will not alone drive cement emissions down fast enough. What is needed to speed up cuts is a global cement, or concrete tax. Only if the whole industry is forced to pay far more for the emissions of its product will companies shift to cleaner practices.
A specific cement tax would fit well into the growing clamour for a simple revenue-neutral global carbon tax. These have been proposed and adopted on a limited basis for over 20 years, but the cement industry has strongly lobbied against them in Europe, the US, Canada and elsewhere.
The cement industry has transformed the world. But it now threatens to tip the environment into uncontrolled warming
Indeed, such is the industry’s influence that governments have not only been shy to adopt anything more than token restrictions, but have been encouraged to promote giant concrete-intensive projects like HS2 and massive road building programmes. In Europe, where an emissions trading scheme has repeatedly stuttered, carbon regulation on cement makers has perversely resulted in windfall profits for the industry and no emission cuts.
There are now at least 70 national and regional carbon tax schemes covering possibly 20% of all global emissions. Some, like those imposed in Norway, Sweden and Finland, are straight taxes; others, including California, the EU, China and South Korea, are emission-trading schemes which issue permits for industries to pollute.
The consensus is that the carbon in all these schemes is still priced way too low to drive change and to encourage fuel-intensive industries like cement to change practices. At best, the carbon schemes have encouraged cement makers and other big emitters to relocate to avoid charges.
Studies suggest that direct taxes not only cut emissions better than “cap and trade” schemes, but also raise more money. A high global cement tax, the theory goes, would concentrate industry’s minds and massively reduce demand for carbon-intensive cement, but any tax that raise energy prices would be very unpopular.
The solution, say some economists, is to make a cement or carbon tax “revenue neutral”, with money raised from industry returned to people in the form of tax rebates to offset any rise in energy bills, or used to specifically reduce other emissions. Where similar approaches have been used, as in Switzerland which has a tax on heating fuel, or New Zealand, high carbon taxes have proved both popular and effective.
The cement industry has transformed the world and enriched both itself and mankind. But it now threatens to tip the environment into uncontrolled warming. It’s now payback time and the industry must respond urgently to the problem it has helped to create.

Environment minister, Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, said that if the plan is achieved, his grandchildren in 2035 will have the same carbon footprint as his grandparents did in the 1940s – and by 2050 his grandchildren will have none at all.
“Not only are we going to reduce that footprint but we are going to bring many benefits with it,” Rodríguez said.
But Jairo Quirós, an electrical energy researcher at the University of Costa Rica, warned the plan would be challenging, and “should be viewed with some caution”.
Under the roadmap launched Sunday, Costa Rica by 2050 would achieve “zero net emissions”, meaning it would produce no more emissions than it can offset through things such as maintaining and expanding its extensive forests.
Such emission cuts are key to holding increases in global temperature to well under 2C (3.6F), the goal of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change.
The Costa Rica plan aims to allow the country to continue growing economically while cutting greenhouse gases. The country’s economy grew at 3% last year, according to World Bank data.
Christiana Figueres, the Costa Rican former UN climate chief, called the goal “unprecedented” in international politics.
Only the government of the tiny Marshall Islands also has laid out a detailed plan to achieve that goal, but “they still do not have the whole plan articulated sector by sector”, Figueres told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
President Carlos Alvarado noted that while Costa Rica represents only a tiny share of the world’s climate-changing emissions, the plan could be a model for other nations.
“We can be that example – we have to inspire people,” he said at the plan’s launch,.
But Quirós, of the University of Costa Rica, warned the plan will take hard work to achieve.
Some goals, he said, such as ensuring all buses and taxis run on electricity by 2050, may be difficult, not least because the changes will be expensive.
Transport today creates about 40% of Costa Rica’s climate-changing emissions, making it the largest single source of them, according to the National Meteorological Institute.
The new plan aims to modernize public transport, including through the creation of an electric train line﻿ that would connect 15 of the 31 neighborhoods in the San José metropolitan area, according to the Costa Rican Institute of Railways.
Construction on the lines is expected to start in 2022.
Under Costa Rica’s decarbonization plan, the number of cars circulating in urban areas would be cut by half by 2040, the environment minister said.
By 2035, 70% of the country’s buses would be electric and 25% of its cars, Rodríguez added.
Costa Rica does not have a fossil fuel extraction industry, but dependence on oil revenue could still cause problems. Fuel taxes, vehicle import taxes and driving taxes currently account for about 12% of government revenue, the minister said.
To phase out fossil fuels without slashing government income, the government will need to push for “green tax reform” to find new revenue sources, he said – which would need legislative approval.
Under the plan, the country’s state-owned petroleum distributor would change course and begin research on alternative fuels, such as hydrogen and biofuels, and look at helping fossil fuel workers move to clean energy jobs.
The plan also calls for further expanding forests – though at the moment most of the money to pay for that comes from taxes on fossil fuels, Rodríguez admitted.
“In the 1960s and 70s, Costa Rica had the highest per capita deforestation rate in the world. We have managed not only to stop deforestation but to double forest coverage” as the economy grew, Rodríguez said.
Last year, 98% of the country’s electricity came from renewable sources, according to the Costa Rican Electricity Institute, the state-owned company in charge of electricity generation and distribution.
Quirós, the University of Costa Rica researcher, said the country’s plan, while “a little utopian” was clearly “a step in the right direction”.
“It’s good to be ambitious,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/25/costa-rica-plan-decarbonize-2050-climate-change-fight

As for there being none, Try the Scandinavian countries, they seem to be proud of the fact that they are democratic socialist countries.
Capitalism needs strict regulation and well-defined limits to be harnessed for the social good, left to its own devices it succumbs to mindless environmentally and socially disastrous greed, as is painfully evident throughout the globe.
Capitalism can work to the benefit of all, but needs limits.
No monopolies, for one, or cartels. Last I checked economic theory said that you need 12-13 competitors in a market to prevent monopolies and cartels from distorting the marketplace.
Putting an upper limit on wealth accumulation is another. Realized wealth is always finite, and anything finite, when divvied up, means that for some to have more, others must have less, again a self-evident global reality.
Ending the hidden subsidies for businesses is another. Every single job should pay a living wage, period. When living wages are paid, the tax base is broader and returns more to the common treasury, the need for welfare shrinks massively, and social stresses are vastly reduced. Sub-living wage jobs are a drag on the economy.
Capitalism is a useful model, provided it is harnessed for the common good rather than unlimited individual gain.

It is not stupidity as far as I can tell. We all seem to self-impose limitations on our own powers of perception; both inadvertently and deliberately. I think it is worse when one is raised with an authoritarian worldview; when to question everything is judged to be a flaw of character. I have met clever people who swallow Trump hook, line and sinker. Even some who promote scientific viewpoints do so on an authoritarian rather than an evidence-based perspective; scinetism rather than science. I think we may all be vulnerable to varying degrees to cultish thinking in which it is supposed that only one's cult speaks the truth and all outsiders are the enemy. It is a bit like collaborative paranoid schizophrenia, and demagogues are masters at stoking it and keeping it going; divide and conquer. Seeing our human common interests and/or the manipulator(s) behind the curtain cab break it's grip.

I am not saying that voters are antagonistic to mainstream media. I am saying they are physically not listening, reading, or watching mainstream media. How do we know this? Because according to this Yale survey 82% of registered voters never heard of the Green New Deal of AOC. This despite blanket intensive coverage of the proposal.
Obviously weather must have something to do with climate. The problem with climate millennialists is that they note all the hot weather events, and ignore all the cold weather ones. I’m not saying climate change isn’t real. However, the charges are incremental of 1 or 2 degrees. Yes, I know there are all kinds of activists predicting imminent disaster. There always are. The human penchant for emotional crusades has existed throughout the ages.

Fossil fuel corporations like ExxonMobil and Koch Industries have waged a decades-long campaign to mislead the public about the environmental costs of their business activities and co-opt the rightwing governing party. This week, senior White House officials told the Washington Post that the administration is forming a climate panel headed by William Happer, a physicist who once compared critical assessments of CO2 emissions to the “demonization of the poor Jews under Hitler”.
A blathering majority of Republican apparatchiks and Fox &amp; Friends talking heads –including the president – continue to insist global warming is a hoax. And for years, cable news networks have provided a platform for these tinfoil hat people, giving airtime to oil-friendly propagandists who reduced the climate debate to a simple binary of belief and denial.
Until recently, Democratic leaders failed to lead, viewing climate as a low priority for voters and positioning themselves as true believers rather than an enlightened party with a real plan to take on a planetary calamity that will be measured in geological time.
There was once a day before the Tea Party, Twitter and Trump, when Republicans like President George HW Bush promised to fight the greenhouse effect with the “White House effect” and, not so long ago, the late senator John McCain advocated for free market approaches to climate action, like cap and trade. But those days are gone.
In the last Congress, Carlos Curbelo, a moderate Republican representative from Miami and co-founder of the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, introduced a carbon tax proposal. But his colleagues in the House of Representatives, beholden to Koch Industries and Americans for Tax Reform, pre-empted the marker bill with a resolution repudiating a carbon tax as “detrimental to the United States economy”. In November, Curbelo lost his seat to the blue wave, along with 22 Republican representatives in his climate caucus.
Today, a surprising number of beltway economists, lobbyists and even a former Fed Reserve chair still hold fast to the dream of bipartisan climate legislation. But there are few right-leaning partisans still wandering the halls of Congress who are willing to do their cross-aisle bidding. Meanwhile, the Republican party draws its strongest base of support from the south – ironically, the region most heavily affected by a changing climate. Denial is ascendant and bipartisanship is dead, but the conservative party has painted itself into a corner that, in the long term, will be economically, ecologically and politically untenable. Democrats have an unprecedented opportunity to own the issue and lead.
Enter the Green New Deal, the first Democratic policy built for the post-Recession age of climate crisis, polarization and wonky leftism.
This month, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts introduced a resolution outlining the vision, goals and projects of a Green New Deal. The resolution was sponsored by 68 representatives and 11 senators, including all seven Democratic presidential contenders in Congress: Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Jeff Merkley, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.
Many, including the editorial boards of the New York Times and Washington Post, criticized the resolution for including flashy non-emissions policies like Medicare for All and a federal jobs guarantee. Writing in the Atlantic, Robinson Meyer caricatured the 14-page document as “a binder of climate policies duct-taped to an Easter basket of socialist goodies”. But the reasoning behind including a broad slate of programs in the proposal is sound: leverage the federal government to spur public and private investments and meet climate targets, create millions of green jobs while modernizing infrastructure and leveling the playing field so that everyone – particularly communities of color, women and working families – can participate in a new economy.
From this view, the resolution – which, judging by the many co-sponsors, has become canon for the rising progressive wing of the Democratic party – is a bold but strategic opening statement and bargaining position in a renewed climate debate. (Full disclosure: in my role at 350.org, I consulted with Ocasio-Cortez’s staff on the resolution.)
The polling shows the public is increasingly concerned about climate change and supportive of a Green New Deal. A recent survey conducted by the Yale program on climate change communication showed that 73% of Americans believe climate change is happening – up 10 points since March 2015 – while almost as many (69%) are worried about it. Remarkably, Yale researchers also found that 81% of registered voters support a Green New Deal to create jobs and accelerate the transition from fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy. The same poll also found, however, that 82% of respondents hadn’t heard a thing about the Green New Deal. As the issue has entered the mainstream and politicized, understanding remains spotty and support may be wavering. A more recent Politico questionnaire showed a plurality of voters support the proposal, but with a large fraction – nearly a third – still in the dark. This must change.
Commentators have rightly pointed out that, to pass the Green New Deal, Democrats will need to win a governing trifecta in 2020 and reach a 60-vote Senate supermajority (improbable) or a 50-vote majority with a repeal of the filibuster (feasible). But the constituencies that really need to be educated, mobilized and organized are not politicians – they’re everyday people beyond the Beltway who could benefit from a Green New Deal.
And this is where the real political fight – on the nightly news, in the press, at the debate podiums, on social media and, most of all, out in local communities – must be waged.
This spring, youth leaders from the Sunrise Movement are launching a Green New Deal tour, making stops in battleground states like Florida, Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Michigan. Sunrise, perhaps more than any other group, has been a guiding voice of moral clarity and leadership in this emergent climate moment. Ahead of a Senate vote called by the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, the group is coordinating direct actions in the offices of noncommittal Democrats and Republican senators.
On Friday, an exchange between Senator Dianne Feinstein of California and school children affiliated with Sunrise, went viral, when the senator refused to support the resolution because she believed it to be too expensive and politically unachievable. “I’ve been doing this for 30 years,” the senator scolded the kids. “I know what I’m doing. Maybe people should listen a little bit.”
“It doesn’t matter, we are the ones who are going to be impacted,” one of the activists, a young girl, responded.
And on Monday, hundreds of Sunrise activists occupied the majority leader’s Capitol Hill office, chanting “which side are you on?” and bearing a banner that read “Mitch, look us in the eyes.” Forty-two were arrested during the protest.
The spirit, tenor and terms of the climate debate have changed.
And where momentum and zeitgeist shift are not enough, proponents of more Rooseveltian approaches to climate action must engage groups historically on the margins of environmental policy, like Indigenous nations, communities of color, immigrants, faith groups and labor unions. The data shows, for example, that Latinx communities are more concerned about global warming than other voters by a 22-point margin and are more likely to believe it should be a high priority for lawmakers.
As the impacts of climate change become increasingly apparent, there may yet be unforeseen opportunities for Green New Dealers to make inroads beyond urban and coastal Democratic enclaves – perhaps even in Republican strongholds like the south and battlegrounds like the midwest andsun belt. There, the Green New Deal’s populist appeals to economic and social policy may help build a broader base of support.
It is too early to predict how this will play out. But, after years of bipartisan stagnation, free market dogma and denialist stalemate, the Green New Deal has breathed much needed oxygen back into the climate debate.

Specialist police officers spent about two hours unsticking the protesters from windows next to the entrance of the InterContinental Park Lane hotel in Mayfair, which was hosting an oil and gas industry conference.
Police put up screens to conceal the protesters from view as the officers detached them. Security staff had previously attempted to remove the protesters.
As one protester was led to a police van, she said: “I’ve been a very law-abiding citizen all my life but I realise now that is not really working. I am a mother of two girls and I am really terrified about their future. We can’t just carry on like this.”
Another said: “The petroleum industry has been complicit in the destruction of our environment and they have been making money out of selling products that are harmful and we need them to stop.”

The arrestees, including Jackson Harries, a film-maker, were taken to local police stations.
A Metropolitan police spokesperson said: “Police were called to reports of a protest at a hotel on Hamilton Place, W1. Officers attended and discovered a number of people had glued themselves to windows. Nine people have been arrested on suspicion of offences including aggravated trespass and criminal damage.”
The protest came halfway through International Petroleum Week, an event organised by the Energy Institute to bring together global energy experts and to manage “tension between sustainability demands and operational, business return”.
Extinction Rebellion said oil and gas operators and investors should respond seriously to the climate crisis rather than meet to form new partnerships and discuss expansion.
Sam Knights, an activist with the group, said: “These companies are destroying our planet. We have to start talking about that. We have to start pointing out, again and again, that their business model is based on the mass murder of hundreds and millions of people. They know this.
“In fact, they have known this for a very long time. But they refuse to change. They continue to put private profit over human life. The fact that they are still talking about acquiring new fossil fuel reserves at this point in the climate crisis is not only deeply immoral, it is evidently criminal. We all have a moral duty to stop them.”
The conference heard a speech from the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, who entered the venue through a side entrance.
The Guardian asked the Department for International Trade for a copy of the speech and initially received extracts in which Fox declared that the UK government “will not use Brexit to lower environmental standards”, before being given the full document.
He highlighted the importance of the oil and gas sector to the UK and restated the country’s commitment under the Climate Change Act to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80% between 1990 and 2050.
Discussion topics at the conference on Wednesday included “unlocking opportunities on [Africa’s] next hotspots”, adapting to “climate change impacts that are now unavoidable” and exploration of a number of new oil prospects.
Outside the hotel, attendees said they sympathised with the protesters. “We all do, as human beings,” one said. “However, we do different things to reach the same goal, a better world.”
Extinction Rebellion, which last November blockaded five bridges in central London, said it would continue to embark on a “campaign of rebellion” to highlight what it said was the criminal inaction of the UK government on climate change.
It said a series of events were planned in the run-up to an “international climate rebellion” planned for 15 April, in which it says thousands of activists will gather in London. Similar events are planned by Extinction Rebellion groups in 30 other countries.
“While politicians rearrange the Brexit deckchairs, the British people are heading for extinction due to the ecological emergency,” the group said in a statement. “The rich and powerful who run this country continue to refuse to do their duty to protect us from disaster … that is why we have to rebel.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/27/extinction-rebellion-activists-arrested-outside-london-oil-conference

But in America, incredibly, 92 % of republicans in a recent poll, stated that higher education was harmful to American values, and republicans managed to cut 43% of the public education budget before the new congress took over.

BQSTART
Simple calculations show that if deep-water H2S concentrations increased beyond a critical threshold during oceanic anoxic intervals of Earth history, the chemocline separating sulfidic deep waters from oxygenated surface waters could have risen abruptly to the ocean surface (a chemocline upward excursion). 
Atmospheric photochemical modeling indicates that resulting fluxes of H2S to the atmosphere (>2000 times the small modern flux from volcanoes) would likely have led to toxic levels of H2S in the atmosphere. 
Moreover, the ozone shield would have been destroyed, and methane levels would have risen to >100 ppm. 
We thus propose (1) chemocline upward excursion as a kill mechanism during the end-Permian, Late Devonian, and Cenomanian–Turonian extinctions, and (2) persistently high atmospheric H2S levels as a factor that impeded evolution of eukaryotic life on land during the Proterozoic.

CCS is a pipe dream
BQEND
We don't know and it shouldn't be ruled out. I'm sceptical that, for example, new coal plants with CCS would be an economic proposition. However one of the interesting (and concerning) things about the global fleet of coal plants is that many of them are relatively new with potentially long service lives ahead of them. If CCS could be retrofitted to some that might be an interesting proposition.
Another interesting proposition is that many of China's coal plants are 600 MWe units. It just so happens that a demonstration pair of high temperature gas cooled reactors are under construction in China with just the right power and outlet temperature to potentially substitute for the coal furnace in these 600 MWe plants leaving the balance of plant the same. An interesting proposition that may or may not come to pass.

When you burn coal at a sufficient rate you increase the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere resulting in global climate and ocean warming. This causes the Southern Ocean lows which bring rain to Tasmania to migrate south where the rain falls into the ocean instead of onto the land. This causes a lack of rain in Tasmania. A warmer climate and warmer oceans in Northern Australia result in more extreme precipitation events as the atmodsphere can contain more water vapour. One such extreme precipitation event has resulted in the floods in North Queensland.
""Build more dams fixes everything, hard to fight bushfires without water from dams.""
Tasmania does not lack dams. Nor did it, this summer, lack water in its dams. It was able to use water from its dams to supply hydro-power to Victoria during the recent heatwave. As seen by the recent crash of a sky-crane helicopter, even its small dams were full of water. With fires of the number and size recently seen in Tasmania aerial deployment and ground based firefighting at best can only provide some protection no matter how many dams full of water you have.
""Eliminating coal use in Australia, not sure how that will fix the weather.""
As explained above burning coal is increased atmospheric CO2 and causing global warming which is responsible for the increase in periods of hot, dry weather during the Tasmanian summer as well as the increase in extreme precipitation events in North Queensland. Change the climate and you change the suite of weather events that you experience. 
Reducing the use of coal worldwide or even eliminating its use, as you suggest, will slow the increase in atmospheric CO2 and begin to fix the climate and its associated weather patterns.
""Australia is one of the biggest exporters of Coal and Natural Gas how will stopping this export fix floods in Queensland and the lack of water in Tas?""
If the overseas countries stop or reduce their burning of coal and natural gas, thereby giving us nowhere to export our coal and natural gas to, as described above global warming will be lessened and in time even reversed causing the rain bearing Southern Ocean lows to provide more rain to Tasmania and decreasing the frequency of extreme rainfall events and their associated floods in North Queensland.

The climate disaster future has arrived while those in power laugh at us | Richard Flanagan,article,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/05/tasmania-is-burning-the-climate-disaster-future-has-arrived-while-those-in-power-laugh-at-us,0,"As I write this, fire is 500 metres from the largest King Billy pine forest in the world on Mt Bobs, an ancient forest that dates back to the last Ice Age and has trees over 1,000 years old. Fire has broached the boundaries of Mt Field national park with its glorious alpine vegetation, unlike anything on the planet. Fire laps at the edges of Federation Peak, Australia’s grandest mountain, and around the base of Mt Anne with its exquisite rainforest and alpine gardens. Fire laps at the border of the Walls of Jerusalem national park with its labyrinthine landscapes of tarns and iconic stands of ancient pencil pine and its beautiful alpine landscape, ecosystems described by their most eminent scholar, the ecologist Prof Jamie Kirkpatrick, as “like the vision of a Japanese garden made more complex, and developed in paradise, in amongst this gothic scenery”.
“You have plants that look like rocks – green rocks – and these plants have different colours in complicated mosaics: red-green, blue-green, yellow-green, all together. It’s an overwhelming sensual experience really.”
Five years ago I was contacted by a stranger, Prof Peter Davies, an eminent water scientist. He wanted to meet because he had news he thought would interest me. The night we met Davies told me that the south-west of Tasmania – the island’s vast, uninhabited and globally unique wildland, the heart of its world heritage area – was dying. The iconic habitats of rainforest, button grass plains, and heathlands had begun to vanish because of climate change.
I was shocked. I had understood that climate change’s effects on Tasmania would be significant but not disastrous; the changes mitigated by Tasmania being surrounded by seas that were not heating as quickly as others: the island’s west would get wetter, the east a little warmer and drier, but compared to much of the world it didn’t seem catastrophic.
But it wasn’t so. Tasmania’s sea waters were warming at two to three times the global rate. Davies’ work, with that of other scientists, was revealing the warming and drying of Tasmania’s west and highlands, and the growing impact this was having. The highland lakes of Tasmania would, for example, in the next 70 to 100 years see between a 10% and 20% drop in rainfall, coupled to a 20% to 30% increase in evaporation. By the end of this century a significant proportion of these lakes and wetlands will cease to exist or be largely dried out much of the year.
Then there was the startlingly new phenomenon of widespread dry lightning storms. Almost unknown in Tasmania until this century they had increased exponentially since 2000, leading to a greatly increased rate of fire in a rapidly drying south-west. Compounding all this, winds were also growing in duration, further drying the environment and fuelling the fires’ spread and ferocity.
Such a future would see these fires destroy Tasmania’s globally unique rainforests and mesmerising alpine heathlands. Unlike mainland eucalyptus forest these ecosystems do not regenerate after fire: they would vanish forever. Tasmania’s world heritage area was our Great Barrier Reef, and, like the Great Barrier Reef, it seemed doomed by climate change.
Later Davies took me on a research trip into a remote part of the south-west to show me the deeply upsetting sight of an area that was once peatland and forest and was now, after repeated burning, wet gravel. The news was hard to comprehend – the enemies of Tasmania’s wild lands had always had local addresses: the Hydro Electricity Commission, Gunns, various tourism ventures. They could be named and they could be fought, and, in some cases, beaten.
But the new danger was not here. It was in the sky, it was carbon, and every year there was more of it. The name of the crime was climate change.
Six weeks ago, the future that Davies and others had been predicting arrived in Tasmania. Lightning strikes ignited what would become known as the Gell River fire in the island’s south-west. In later weeks more lightning strikes led to more fires, every major one of which is still burning.
Tasmania subsequently recorded its driest January on record, with maximum temperatures an astonishing 3.22C above the long-term average for the month. Fuel loads were, according to the Tasmanian Fire Service, 20% to 30% drier than average. In such an unprecedented environment the fires were unstoppable.
Today Tasmania is burning. Its fires are so large that a firefighting team was reportedly called out in New Zealand to investigate a heavy smoke haze that turned out to have drifted across 2,500km of ocean from the Tasmanian fires. Firefighters are confronted with 1,629km of fire front, with fires having consumed 190,000 hectares, or 3% of Tasmania’s land, with authorities warning there is no sign of the fires abating for several weeks, and the potential for catastrophic consequences still a distinct possibility.
To date, Tasmania has had the extraordinary luck this summer to not have had the gale-force winds that characterised the tragic 1967 fires, in which 62 people perished within a few hours. But luck is only that, and one day soon, this summer or next, or the one after, that fatal day will dawn, and the catastrophe that will result will dwarf all previous Tasmanian fires in its fatal tragedy because everything else has changed, and all for the worse.
The Tasmanian fires have attracted little national media attention because there has been as yet, thankfully, no loss of life and only a handful of homes burnt. And yet these fires signal a terrifying new reality, as disturbing and ultimately almost certainly as tragic as the coral reef bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef.
What has become clear is that another global treasure in the form of Tasmania’s ancient Gondwanaland remnant forest and its woodland alpine heathlands are at profound and immediate risk because of climate change. Heroic efforts have been made by remote area firefighters to preserve some of these rare ecosystems. But when communities in the Huon came under threat most of these resources were diverted to that front. Such resources don’t come cheap: a single drop by a Hercules C-130 water bomber is understood to cost $75,000.
And so, without a far greater investment of money in the coming years, scientists believe these global treasures are doomed to destruction. This week or next year or the next, the certainty is that without extraordinary effort, they will burn and be gone forever.
At the same time Tasmanians find themselves living in a frightening new world where summer is no longer a time of joy, but a period of smog-drenched dread that goes on week after week, and it seems inevitable, month after month. Whole communities have been evacuated and are living in evacuation centres or bunking down with friends and families. Those that remain live in a fug of sleeplessness and fear, never knowing when the next ember attack will occur or a nearby fire will break containment lines, a gut-clutching terror of wind, smoke and heat. Volunteer firefighters find themselves no longer fighting fires for a week but for a season. Government is confronted with the extraordinary cost of fighting fires of this size and scale for months.
This would seem to be the new normal. According to Prof David Bowman, professor of pyrogeography at the University of Tasmania, henceforth Tasmanians “must think about fire as part of daily life”.
Two years ago the then treasurer Scott Morrison picked up a large lump of coal. Perhaps he thought it was a great joke for Australia at the expense of a few weird outliers like the Greens and the global scientific community. Or perhaps Morrison wasn’t really thinking anything. Perhaps the greatest error of journalists is thinking people at the centre are more than they seem. The problem with people like Morrison, the true terror, is that they may be so much less.
“This is coal,” Morrison began babbling. “Don’t be afraid don’t be scared won’t hurt you won’t hurt you.”
Almost stuttering in his excitement, missing pronouns, he was gibbering without punctuation. If the style was grammatically Joycean, the effect, like his previous masterpiece, “Where the bloody hell are you?”, was memorable.
He waved the piece of coal around like it was the sacred Host itself, he swung it high and he brought it so low that for a moment it was as if a wildly guffawing Barnaby Joyce seated next to him might lick it. How they laughed! The ranks of the Liberal party assembled around and behind, how they all laughed and laughed that day.
Those faces contorted in weird mirth are the grotesque masks of a great and historic crime, deriding not just their political opponents but mocking the future with that pure contempt of power, daring us to remember beyond the next news cycle, to care beyond the next confected outrage, to see past the next lie. It is the image of our age: power laughing at us.
Scott Morrison’s proudest boast is that when the barbarians were at the gate, he stopped them. But now the truth is clear: the barbarians were never at the gate. They were always here, in the palace, in power, and they were blinding us with their lie that the enemies who would destroy our world were the wretched and powerless who sought asylum here. And all along our real enemy was them: those who held up lumps of coal in front of their throne, and laughed and laughed and gloated won’t hurt you won’t hurt you.
But it is.
What has become clear over these last four weeks across this vast, beautiful land of Australia is that a way of life is on the edge of vanishing. Australian summers, once a time of innocent pleasure, now are to be feared, to be anticipated not with joy but with dread, a time of discomfort, distress and, for some, fear that lasts not a day or a night but weeks and months. Power grids collapse, dying rivers vomit huge fish kills, while in the north, in Townsville, there are unprecedented floods, and in the south heat so extreme it pushes at the very edge of liveability has become everyday.
And the future in which the people of Tasmania now find themselves, in the evacuation centres, camped in friends’ and family homes, fighting fires day after week after month, isn’t just frightening. It’s terrifying. While Morrison, now the prime minister, rushes around the country trying to scare the people about franking credits, he seems blithely unaware that the people are already scared – about climate change.
Climate change isn’t just happening. It’s happening far quicker than has been predicted. Each careful scientific prediction is rapidly overtaken by the horror of profound natural changes that seem to be accelerating, with old predictions routinely outdone by the worsening reality – hotter, colder, wetter, drier, windier, wilder, and ever more destructive.
When Scott Morrison visited Tasmania yesterday he wasn’t photographed holding a lump of coal up in Geeveston. In the evacuation centre at Huonville. In the sacred King Billy pine groves of Mt Bobs or the exquisite cushion plant gardens of the Walls of Jerusalem. I doubt he had the folly to tell people don’t be scared. I am sure that he looked concerned and perhaps occasionally he smiled, the smile of the weak man, the smile of all the empty men.
And tomorrow there will be another welcome photo opportunity at another unprecedented “natural” disaster, another fire, another flood. And when he retires back into his prime ministerial limo I wonder if he laughs. He should. Laugh at us all, Scott Morrison, you and the others who sit with you, grinning fools at the entrance to hell. Laugh and laugh as the ash falls soft as silent despair.

Funny thing about that canard:
When looks at the chart for revenues as a percentage of GDP from the early 60's until 2017, it basically hoovers around 35%: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IUj_AGJS5WywibuptGr4lZVP9M0QCTvkZQ0Q_Pp9CHw/edit#gid=5
(Link compliments of a this article: https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/apr/25/tax-receipts-1963 )
BUT, and this is big fucking but, GDP growth, when tax rates were higher, was on average also higher: https://tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/gdp-growth-annual
Cutting rates and then collecting 35% on lower GDP growth is nowhere even close to the same (let alone better) as collecting 35% of GDP on higher growth.
Now you know why:
a) Even though overall revenues as a percentage of GDP has stayed close to the same while the percentage GDP of government spending has gone down since the late 70s (I wonder what happened around that time), with the exception the period right after the Great Recession when the government was forced to borrow more as a percentage of GDP to maintain civilization because of the collapse in revenues compliments of the inevitable result of eight years of Bush's failed Conservative low tax low financial regulatory polices - the debt keeps going up.

Amazon, Facebook, Uber, eBay and Google do all they can to avoid tax. They employ thousands of staff to check every loophole. They also retain the services of the big accounting and global law firms with the sole aim of driving down the effective rate of tax they pay wherever they operate.
So why wouldn’t everyone else do what they could to play the same game? It’s a question that has leapt up the list of pressing issues for tax authorities across Europe.
Last week, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which is attempting to standardise tax rules across the world’s 34 richest nations, said that its members had agreed to consider benchmarks for taxing digital services.
“Countries and jurisdictions will step up efforts toward reaching a global solution to the growing debate over how to best tax multinational enterprises in a rapidly digitalising economy,” it said.
It might not seem like much of a victory. The 34 nations in question, ranging from the UK, US and France to Mexico, South Korea and Slovakia, look like climbers that have just reached base camp on their way to conquering Everest.
For Pascal Saint-Amans, the OECD director’s of tax policy, it is an obvious move now that digital businesses are viewed by many voters as undermining the very fabric of the tax system.
That may be true, but his scheme has become attractive because it represents the slowest route to the summit. Other proposals get there more quickly, and much more painfully for the jurisdictions that play host to tax avoiders – for example Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.
To all the EU countries involved, it is a better option than the more draconian rules proposed by Brussels. Just before Christmas, the European commission reheated plans to adopt majority voting for tax rule changes with a view to implementing a new digital tax. This tax, which would tackle corporation tax and VAT avoidance by companies based in Ireland and Luxembourg, is likely to stay tethered to its moorings all the time unanimous voting governs tax issues.
Take the case of Ireland. There are corporation tax receipts in its budget, but they are small relative to the number of wealthy companies in Dublin and Cork. The tax-to-GDP ratio in Ireland has decreased from 30.8% in 2000 to 22.8% in 2017.
The Irish have already suffered an adverse tax judgment courtesy of the European court of justice, which ruled that it had allowed Apple to avoid €13bn of tax, which must now be collected. The last thing Irish officials want is a switch to majority voting on tax that would trigger a wider clampdown.
Britain, in or out of the EU, has promised to press ahead with a modest digital tax. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, says he will join the OECD scheme when it comes to fruition but can’t wait for that moment without making a move.
It is a measure of the way digital companies have destroyed a sense of fair play on tax that a Tory government that presides over a financial centre built largely on clever wheezes to avoid tax has stepped forward with a plan in advance of Brussels and the OECD.
Hammond knows there is more to gain from righting a wrong on tax than he could lose by upsetting major digital businesses. Other countries should follow his lead.
BP has thrown its weight behind an initiative by its own investors to make the company spell out how corporate strategy is compatible with the goals of the Paris climate agreement.
That is welcome news. BP has been something of a laggard compared with European peers such as Shell and Total in its efforts to transition away from oil and gas, and reduce its global warming impact.
The company and investors, which include Hermes EOS, Legal &amp; General Investment Management and the Church of England, hailed agreement on the resolution as “good news for the planet” and giving “investors better clarity”.
Action to tackle climate change is clearly a good thing. But there’s also a risk of dressing up business-as-usual fossil-fuel extraction as progressive action.
With that in mind, what exactly is BP committing to here that is new? The main requirement is a business strategy in line with the Paris agreement’s demands of holding temperatures “well below 2C” and reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero in the second half of the century.
BP believes its strategy is already consistent with those goals. So why will it feel moved to make any substantive changes when it publishes the new version?
The other requirements are that BP weighs how expenditure on new projects, including drilling for oil and gas, is compatible with Paris, and sets metrics and targets to keep in line with the accord’s goals.
This is all useful, but it’s debatable whether it will materially change the fact that the company’s investments in solar power and electric cars are a drop in the ocean of its hydrocarbon-dominated $15bn-$16bn spending last year. Or that it wants to be producing 25% more oil and gas by 2021.
The growing wave of investor pressure on oil and gas majors to do more on climate change is good news – but the BP resolution also lays bare the limits to engagement.
‘I didn’t think I would end up owning House of Fraser,” Mike Ashley said last year, soon after his Sports Direct paid £90m to buy the department store chain out of administration. And he surely never expected to enter the world of upholstered furniture by buying Sofa.com.
Yet the latter deal happened on Friday and is Ashley’s most baffling in his current buying spree. Sofa.com is a supplier to House of Fraser, so one can see the superficial logic, but the business wouldn’t have been up for grabs for a nominal sum if it weren’t struggling. Ashley now has one more headache to solve – this time in an alien (for him) corner of the retail market. He’s getting in deeper and deeper.
It is tempting to ascribe a grand plan to this dealmaking, in which the next arrival could be HMV. Is Ashley on a mission to save the high street? Does he just spy cheap opportunities that others are afraid to take? The price tag for House of Fraser suggested Sports Direct got the stock at about 15p in the pound, which certainly has short-term appeal, even before one counts the opportunity to beat up landlords over rents.
There will definitely be cold commercial appraisal at work, of course. But one also suspects this is a case of one damn thing leading to another. The losses Ashley suffered on the original 11% stake in House of Fraser will have hurt. He made a bad bet, just as he did with a near-30% stake in Debenhams, on which Sports Direct took a £85m writedown last year. Maybe the motivation (or part of it) is just the gambler’s desire to get even by making bigger bets.
It would be a fine thing if Ashley succeeds in his attempt to rejuvenate so many ailing retail businesses, but chasing your losses is rarely a winning strategy.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/03/tech-giants-facebook-oecd-digital-tax-must-become-reality

Trump did not mention rising temperatures or extreme weather, although he did tout the country’s status as the top producer of oil and gas and boast about how quickly his officials have moved to cut regulations. 
Lisa Graumlich, the dean of the environment college at the University of Washington, attended the State of the Union address as a guest of the Washington congresswoman Pramila Jayapal.
“I have been doing research on climate change since the 1970s, and it always seemed very far away in time and space. It was something that was going to happen when people’s grandchildren were alive. And that has changed,” Graumlich said. “I don’t think that future presidents will find themselves in this position, because people are feeling the effects of climate change.”
Joel Clement, who resigned from the interior department because he said the administration was muzzling scientists and ignoring climate change effects on vulnerable communities, now works with the Union of Concerned Scientists. He was invited by the Maine congressman Chellie Pingree.
“The Trump administration’s strategy is to ignore climate change and pretend it doesn’t exist and pretend the science doesn’t exist even if it’s coming from its own agencies,” Clement said. “To not say anything about it is just ignorance, and it’s irresponsible.”
In 10 years, Clement said, climate change will be central to all policy discussions, as one of the top three or four issues in the world, Clement said.
Several other high-profile climate advocates were invited by other Democrats protesting against Trump’s doubts of the science and his rollbacks.
This administration’s strategy is to ignore climate change, pretend it doesn’t exist and pretend the science doesn’t exist
The New York congressman Paul Tonko invited the League of Conservation Voters’ Gene Karpinski and the Maryland congressman Jamie Raskin brought along 350.org’s Bill McKibben.
The Massachusetts senator Ed Markey attended with the head of the youth-led Sunrise Movement, Varshini Prakash, who is calling for a Green New Deal to tackle inequality and quickly cut greenhouse gas emissions. Markey is expected to join Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez this week in releasing expanded language on the high-level goals of a Green New Deal.
Even the Democratic rebuttal to Trump’s speech, by the ex-Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, only mentioned climate change once, in a list of priorities the US could pursue. However, Bernie Sanders, in his own response speech, noted warnings in reports from the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
“How can a president of the United States give a State of the Union speech and not mention – not one word – about climate change when the leading scientists of the world tell us that climate change is real, that climate change is caused by human activity, that climate change is already causing devastating harm in the United States,” Sanders said. “Furthermore, the scientists tell us we have a very short, 12 years, not a lot of time in order to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels.”
While very little of the primetime speeches focused on climate change, Democrats will hold two hearings in the House on Wednesday about its effects.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/06/trump-state-of-the-union-climate-change

Obsessive, authoritative, energetic and compelling in his approach, he spent decades in scholarly observations on nature and natural phenomena in mountain environments. Studying birds and mammals, soil erosion and snow patches, and developing unrivalled datasets on longterm changes in nature, Adam amassed a treasure trove of vital information on the impacts of climate change and human land use. 
By the mid-1960s he had written classic papers on mountain bird behaviour and ecology, and as recently as autumn 2018 he published a seven-decade study of mountain hare population declines in north-east Scotland. He also established Europe’s longest-running study of golden eagles.
Aged seven, Adam had developed a fascination for snow, and in the Guardian 10 years ago he described how “I could see these pale veils coming out of the sky, and as it got near the ground I saw they were actually snowflakes.”
Influenced by the naturalist Seton Gordon, young Adam took notes on the occurrence of mountain “snow patches”, and by 14 was keeping a diary of snow events. This developed in the 40s into systematic monitoring of long-lasting snow patches in the Cairngorms, which continues to this day, with annual reports for the Royal Meteorological Society, in collaboration with the snow expert Iain Cameron. This gives a unique record of climate influences across Scotland’s highest mountains.
His research on the elusive ptarmigan, one of the world’s hardiest birds, involved Adam ascending Scotland’s highest mountains each day, often consecutively, over several weeks, for 73 years from 1943. Sheltering in bivouacs, he would survey the summit plateaux and boulder fields, sometimes with pointer dogs, for every nesting bird, in order to develop an accurate population estimate, recording numbers, breeding success and habitat use.
Born in Turriff, Aberdeenshire, Adam was the son of Adam Watson, a solicitor as well as a fine naturalist, and his wife, Margaret (nee Rae). He went to the Turriff schools (and was dux in both), then took a degree in zoology at Aberdeen University, graduating with first-class honours in 1952, having studied ptarmigan winter ecology for his honoursproject.
The explorer Col Pat Baird, having met Adam on Derry Cairngorm, invited him as his zoologist on an expedition to Baffin Island in the Canadian Arctic the following year.
Adam subsequently returned to the island on a Carnegie Arctic scholarship, and took his PhD in 1956 on the annual cycle of the ptarmigan. 
The following year he joined the UK government’s Nature Conservancy unit of grouse and moorland ecology to study population changes in red grouse. Building on the 1911 Lord Lovat report on red grouse population fluctuations, Adam and his team led a new study in the north-east Scotland heartland of grouse moors. His Collins New Naturalist book Grouse (2008), co-written with a colleague, Robert Moss, provides the detailed findings. 
He continued to work in north-east Scotland for the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) Institute of Terrestrial Ecology (now Centre for Ecology and Hydrology), even after retirement in 1990, when he was made an emeritus fellow.
Adam’s conservation activism was sparked by two threats. The prospect of a major skiing development in the northern corries of the Cairngorms in the early 80s galvanised his study of human-related disturbance, in contrast to extreme weather-related impacts on mountain soil and wildlife. His research featured prominently in the Lurchers Gully public inquiry in 1981, which essentially redefined the nature of further ski developments in Scotland. 
The unstinting persecution of birds of prey on grouse moors was also intolerable for Adam. His record of golden eagle territories, with some suffering from interference each year since the 1940s, increased his outrage at the victimisation of these and other birds of prey.
An outstanding mountaineer, climber and cross-country skier (the first person to ski-tour the six tops of the Cairngorms in a day, in 1962), Adam checked most of the cliff routes in the Scottish Mountaineering Club’s climbers’ guide, The Cairngorms, revised it in 1968, rewrote it in 1975, and repeatedly updated further editions.
His north-east Scots burr, heard frequently on TV and radio shows such as Radio 4’s The Living World, concealed a scholarly mastery of Deeside Gaelic, which was to the fore in his textbook The Place Names of Upper Deeside (1984).
Adam had a fascination for landmarks and features that each had a local name, and through talking endlessly with local people in Gaelic, he developed an encyclopedic knowledge of the cultural roots of the Cairngorms landscape.
A scourge of what he termed “establishment” thinking and practices, Adam was vehemently condemnatory of anyone who did not conform to his understanding of nature, and unsparing in his criticism of traditional land managers and scientific competitors, regardless of their pedigree.
Having published more than 30 books, and 600 papers and reports, Adam was possibly the most widely published ecologist in Europe. A fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1971), Royal Society of Biology (1980) and Royal Meteorological Society (2009), and of many international bodies, Adam held four doctorates and received several awards, including the John Muir Trust’s lifetime achievement award (2005). His portrait hangs in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery.
Adam met Jenny Raitt in 1954, when she worked as a secretary to the agricultural statistician David Finney at Aberdeen University. He was studying in the nearby department of natural history and, following a “hillwalking courtship”, they married in 1955 in Aberdeen, and in 1962 settled in Crathes, near Banchory, south of the city. 
Jenny died in 2016. Adam is survived by their daughter, Jenny, son, Adam, and two granddaughters.

This jives well with Gandhi's quote, ""there is enough on this planet for everyone's need but not enough for everyone's greed"".

Today we are living longer, our resources are depleting faster, and technology is making human labor more and more redundant.

People have 6 plus girls or 6 plus boys because they are still obsessed with having a boy or a girl respectively. The biggest offenders are the poorer people who have large families despite being unable to take care of themselves.
In olden days humans especially the poorer sections of society used to be more content with simpler life. Three square meals a day, roof over the head and two sets of clothes. Now with increased consumerism everyone wants the latest smartphone, more meat in their diet, and fancier and more clothes.

Some examples: 
The nonsensical Green New Deal eliminates all air travel and moves to high speed rail instead. California (blue state) embarked on building a high speed rail line from LA to San Francisco, approved in 2008 and breaking ground in 2015. It is currently billions of dollars over budget, years behind schedule and is not expected to carry a single passenger anywhere for at least another decade. 
The Green New Deal also rules out nuclear power as part of its energy reforms. Bernie Sanders tried this in Vermont (blue state) when he embarked on an ambitious plan to move to renewables and cut emissions. Instead, Vermont's emissions have risen faster than anywhere else in the country because of their reliance on fossil fuels to make up for the failure to renew their only nuclear plant.

We worry that to truly decarbonize, we’d need an authoritarian government or endless austerity. But a big and bold enough Green New Deal could finally make us truly free.
The principles that animated the New Deal are often associated with Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s proposed (but never fully enacted) Economic Bill of Rights. These included rights to employment, medical care, housing, education, and social security. Those goals are tragically unrealized for many Americans, and any just version of the Green New Deal must start there. They’re familiar goals for the left, ones we’ve been fighting over for decades. But we also need to rework another New Deal-era statement of principles – FDR’s Four Freedoms.
In the twilight hours of 1941, as New Deal progress stalled in the face of white southern resistance to federal power, and the war against Hitler intensified in Europe, FDR sought to describe freedom in new terms. He was struggling to bolster support for his faltering domestic agenda and anticipated foreign one; the Four Freedoms were eventually mythologized and sentimentalized in paintings by none other than Norman Rockwell.
We’re not trying to reclaim American patriotism or generate support for a coming world war. But the task of reimagining freedom is critical. In 1941, the Four Freedoms idea was a bridge between the New Deal’s unprecedented federal activism, pressed forward by a huge wave of labor and community militancy, and the wartime mobilization that followed, whose speed and scale now inspire the vision of a Green New Deal.
The right has claimed the language of freedom for decades. But their vision of freedom as your right as an individual to do whatever you want – so long as you can pay for it – is a recipe for disaster in the 21st century, when it’s clearer than ever that all our fates are bound up together. Freedom has to mean something more than the capitalist’s freedom to invest or the consumer’s freedom to buy.
Freedom has to mean something more than the capitalist’s freedom to invest or the consumer’s freedom to buy
Here, we modestly upstage FDR with five freedoms that can orient us to an uncertain future.
Freedom from fear: FDR called for freedom from fear of military conflict. We’re still working on his call for disarmament – we could start with the US army, the world’s biggest consumer of oil and a purveyor of fear worldwide. We must transform our built environment to grant us freedom from fear of the physical changes that already locked-in global warming will bring: fire and hurricanes, extreme temperatures, sea level rise and storm surges – and freedom from the fear that those dangers will grow exponentially worse. It also means abolishing the social disasters a volatile planet could exacerbate. We need freedom from food scarcity and water shortages, freedom from racist, colonial, and sexual violence, and freedom from militarized borders. Freedom from fear means guaranteed jobs and homes so that we can survive every storm, every relocation, and every reorganization of industry.
Freedom from toil: We can’t escape work altogether, and there’s a lot of work we need to do, immediately and in the long term. But work doesn’t need to rule our lives. The great nineteenth-century English socialist William Morris made a distinction between useful work and useless toil: we need the former but should free ourselves from the latter. We can escape the crushing toll of working long hours for low wages to make something that someone else owns. At present, there’s a lot of work that’s worse than useless; it’s toil that’s harmful to the people doing it and to the world in which we live. But even useful work should be distributed more widely so that we can all do less of it – and spend more time enjoying its fruits.
Freedom to move: We live on a beautiful planet that belongs to everyone; we should all be free to move around it. Freedom to move is particularly crucial for those whose homes are being rendered unlivable by rising temperatures and seas. But we should also be free to travel to enjoy our vibrant world’s wonders. Not as quickly as we do now; we can’t all fly everywhere at the drop of a hat, and some of us need to fly less often. But it’s the reckless waste of the affluent that must end, not the ordinary person’s occasional pleasure in discovering a new corner of the world. Free public transit is necessary to get around without relying on emissions-spewing cars and airplanes. The freedom to move also means the freedom to pack up and live in another city, region, or country. To cope with inevitable climate displacements, we need solidarity without fences or walls.
Freedom from domination: Liberals say the market gives us freedom to choose. But under capitalism, the market is master, determining what we can do and who we can be. Every year or two, we can mark a ballot paper. Every hour of every day the compulsion of the market stamps its will on every aspect of our lives. The left has long sought to end the arbitrary power of the few over the many. We must continue to pursue freedom not only from toil, but from the despotism of the boss, from a viciously enforced racial order, and from the intimate violence of patriarchy. Now, the outrageous power of the few threatens billions with ruin. Domination also names our helplessness in the face of global capitalism. We need to know it’s possible to change our own fate, to be able to imagine the end of capitalism more easily than the end of the world. But we must also let go of old fantasies of achieving freedom by recklessly dominating nature to serve human ends – those dreams have turned into nightmares. We need to live on this planet with other people and species. With innovation, equality, care, and wisdom, we can all have freedom within the realm of ecological necessity.
Freedom to live: There is enough on our Earth for people everywhere to have what they need to live well. Reusing, recycling, and – most important – redistributing our abundance will open new vistas. The freedom to live includes freedom from want: plentiful access to the basics, such as food, drink, shelter, healthcare, dental, education, music, art, and green spaces. People are also entitled to the freedom to want: the freedom to enjoy life, to be creative, to produce and delight in communal luxuries, to soak up the public goods we create for everyone’s pleasure, to love those we love, and to find new people to love too. The freedom to live a good life spans the shared wonders of knowledge, leisure, and adventure.
Enemies of climate action warn of totalitarian dullness, while the fossil industry commits crimes against humanity to maintain the privileges of a few. The point of a Green New Deal is to build the opposite: a colorful democracy for all, to live through sun and storm.

The court in question here is the New South Wales Land and Environment court, the jurisdiction of which includes civil claims about planning, environmental, land, mining and other legislation. Such civil claims are not about an accused and their offence but are a means of deciding whether actions which affect the environment, the land, planning and mining go ahead or not and in which manner they do so. This decision by the Land and Environment Court was not about offences committed by the mining company concerned - nor was it about offences committed by other people or organisations.
""Courts are spectacularly bad at making these kind of calls"" as to whether a coal mining operation will be allowed to go ahead at a particular place - or whether a wind farm will be built in a particular place - or whether a school will allowed to be built in a particular place. In the case discussed in the article above, the coal mining company had applied for a mining license at the particular site. The Minister for Mines had rejected the application on the advice of his department. The mining company appealed to the Land and Environment Court. The appeal was rejected.
You give no reason as to why you consider the decision by the Minister for Mines was a bad decision and why the decision by the Land and Environment Court to uphold the Minister's decision on civil appeal by the mining also was a bad decision.
""That's why government, and not the courts, should weigh up the best ways of meeting international obligations.""
Executive government had already weighed up how the development of a mine at this site affected how we meet our international obligations and decided against the mine going ahead. The court had rejected the mining company's appeal against that government decision.
""They"" (executive government) ""have the wider context over time and are accountable to the electorate"".

The emissions-free steel will cost 20% to 30% more than conventional steel, but that difference should narrow in the years ahead as the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme ratchets up the cost of putting carbon emissions into the atmosphere from the industrial sector.

There's around one ton difference ascending between France, the UK of Britain and China. All three countries don't lack for nuclear power generation
BQEND
Huh? I find comments like this to lack sincerity and no more than a weak attempt at obfuscation. . Britain and China do lack for nuclear generation. Nuclear supplies about 20% of UK electricity and about 4% of China's electricity. The standout difference is percentage of electricity supplied by nuclear power in France. 
Furthermore as fuel switching from fossil fuels to electricity (mandatory for deep decarbonisation) proceed, the low carbon electricity supply will cause France to pull further ahead. If you want a graphic example go and find out, and compare, the emissions/passenger km of high speed rail in France and China.
Here's the single most important metric of progress on climate change. Twenty six years and no progress. Twenty six years of of every contrived ""reason"" why nuclear power is not needed. These three decades are when the opportunity for a safe climate was lost. Thanks.

BQEND
It appears that Judge Preston knows, too:
BQSTART
It may be true that currently most of the world’s steel (around 74%) is produced using the BOF process, which depends on coking coal... 
The current and likely future demand for coking coal for use in steel production can be met, however, by other coking coal mines, both existing and approved, in Australia...
On this basis, it is not necessary to approve the Project in order to maintain steel production worldwide.

No, because, in reality, there is no shortage of places in Australia where wind farms can be located.

There's around one ton difference ascending between France, the UK of Britain and China. All three countries don't lack for nuclear power generation but France is much warmer than Britain and China eclipses both with heavy industry. Also unlike the most populous country in the UK France does not lack terrestrial wind farms.
Despite the world's largest uranium mine nuclear power generation was found to be uneconomic for South Australia's 1.7 million inhabitants. I've yet to see a study of its viability for 13.9 million people of New South Wales and Victoria.

""Threatened Species Recovery Hub rejects media claims"".
""21 January 2019.""""The Threatened Species Recovery Hub has rejected reports by the Courier-Mail media outlet that the hub is an anti-coal activist group and is involved in a review of Adani coal mine environmental plans.
Hub director Brendan Wintle said that claim that the hub, based at the University of Queensland, was conducting a review of the Adani plans was totally false.
'It is essential to set the record straight, which is why the hub has written to the Courier-Mail and other outlets which have picked up the story to request a retraction and correction.'
 'It has also contracted the Press Council,' he said.
'The Threatened Species Recovery Hub is not involved in the Adani environmental management review, and has nothing to do with coal research or activism.'
'I have been engaged as a Melbourne University expert by the Queensland Government to lead the review of Adani's southern black throated finch management plan, due to my expertise in the area of threatened species conservation planning', Dr Wintle said.
'The research hub - which comprises researchers from 10 Australian universities and the Australian Wildlife Conservancy - is part of the Australian Government-funded National Environmental Research Program.""
'It is a national program to undertake research to prevent extinctions to aid the recovery of Australia's most threatened species'
'We collaborate with more than 200 partners across the country, such as landcare groups, national park managers, Indigenous land managers and Government agencies, to ensure our work is practical and targeted to the most pressing needs.'
'More than 150 independent scientists from many organisations collaborate on Hub projects, many of whom have simultaneous projects that receive funding from multiple sources.'
'The Threatened Species Recovery Hub is not involved in the Adani environmental review.' 'However, the five other scientists named by the Courier-Mail, including UQ researchers Associate Professor Rod Fensham and Professor James Watson are nor involved in the review.'

Let's see if you can cite their papers.
There are about 8 million research scientists in the world.
Around 70,000 or so publish research papers connected to climate change.
The confusionist sites constantly quote the same handful of scientists, because they don't have anyone else.
Most of their handful are retired - and are connected to various political 'think-tanks' in the USA.
No matter who has investigated this and collected evidence, no matter who pays for the research, the outcome has been the same.
Exxon researchers in the 1970s? The same result, which didn't please their employers.

Chief judge Brian Preston dismissed an appeal by Gloucester Resources, which was seeking to overturn a New South Wales government decision to reject an open-cut mine because of its impact on the town of Gloucester, north of Newcastle.
The Environmental Defenders Office joined the case last April, arguing on behalf of its client, Groundswell Gloucester, that the mine’s detrimental impact on climate change and on the social fabric of the town should be considered as part of the merit appeal.
David Morris, the chief executive of EDO NSW, called the decision “momentous” and said it would be “profoundly influential” in the approval of future fossil fuel projects.
“It’s very difficult to see how any future coal project avoids the judge’s finding about this being the wrong time for it,” he said.
In his judgment, Preston explicitly cited the project’s potential impact on climate change, writing that an open-cut coalmine in the Gloucester Valley “would be in the wrong place at the wrong time”.
“Wrong place because an open cut coal mine in this scenic and cultural landscape, proximate to many people’s homes and farms, will cause significant planning, amenity, visual and social impacts,” he wrote.
“Wrong time because the GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions of the coal mine and its coal product will increase global total concentrations of GHGs at a time when what is now urgently needed, in order to meet generally agreed climate targets, is a rapid and deep decrease in GHG emissions. These dire consequences should be avoided. The project should be refused.”
In a “first of its kind” hearing, the EDO had argued that the mine should be refused in part because of its impact on Australia’s commitments to the Paris climate agreement.
In his judgment, Preston noted that while there was “no proscription” on the approval of new emissions sources such as coalmines under the agreement, approval of the project “cannot assist in achieving the rapid and deep reductions in GHG emissions that are necessary” to meet the goals of the agreement.
“It matters not that the aggregate of the project’s greenhouse gas emissions may represent a small fraction of the global total”, he said.
“The global problem of climate change needs to be addressed by multiple local actions to mitigate emissions by sources and remove greenhouse gases by sinks.”
He rejected GRL’s argument that the project should be allowed because emissions from the mine would be abated by other emissions reductions schemes as “speculative and hypothetical”.
“There is no evidence before the court of any specific and certain action to ‘net out’ the GHG emissions of the project,” he wrote in his judgment.
“A consent authority cannot rationally approve a development that is likely to have some identified environmental impact on the theoretical possibility that the environmental impact will be mitigated or offset by some unspecified and uncertain action at some unspecified and uncertain time in the future.”
The judgment also rejected the mine on the grounds of its visual impact and the social impact of factors such as dust and noise on the surrounding community.
Morris said the ramifications would be felt by state and federal ministers and other decision makers who assess fossil fuel projects.
“This is necessarily a case-specific judgment. It relates to this coalmine proposed in the Gloucester Valley,” Morris said. “It is persuasive, influential but it is not binding on any future decision.
“But it will weigh heavily on the minds of decision makers.”
He said the judge’s comment that the mine was being proposed at the “wrong time” was “applicable to every fossil fuel project that’s proposed in this country and internationally going forward.”
Morris said Australia was increasingly approaching a moment when approval of a fossil fuel project could be considered “unreasonable”.
“And unreasonableness is a ground of legal challenge,” he said.
Climate Council chief executive Amanda McKenzie also welcomed the decision.
“The NSW Land and Environment court has effectively ruled that coal – just like tobacco and asbestos – is bad for us,” McKenzie said.
“I’m thrilled to see the law catching up with the science.
“If I was proposing to build a coal mine right now, I’d be feeling pretty nervous.”
NSW planning minister Anthony Roberts was asked for the government’s reaction to the court’s decision.
“That is the legal process and we respect the court’s decision,” he said.
A spokesman for the NSW planning and environment department said the department was pleased the court had agreed with its recommendation on the proposed coal mine. He said the decision supported the current process of assessing developments on a case-by-case basis.
In 2017, the independent planning commission rejected the mine because of its proximity to the town of Gloucester, its visual impact, and contravention of the city’s zoning plans.
“The judgment confirms the Department of Planning and Environment was correct in its decision to recommend refusal of the application to the Independent Planning Commission, and the Commission was correct to refuse the application,” the spokesman said.
“This decision shows NSW has a robust and transparent planning process that is delivering the best outcomes for the whole community.”

13 March 2018 Labor’s retiree tax - Joint media release with The Hon Kelly O'Dwyer MP
BQSTART
Incredibly, today's announcement means he has now proposed more than $200 billion worth of new taxes - that's a tax hike roughly equivalent to the entire GDP of New Zealand, and that's what we know so far.
BQEND ITS.NOT.A.TAX!
Turnbull Mar 2018 - Australians right across the country are worried about Labor’s new tax on their savings. 
Murdoch outlets are overwhelmingly the ones belting out the Coalition message.
When I look at other outlets even from early 2018, I see this ...Labor wants to scrap a policy which means some who pay no tax get $2.5 million refund 
BQSTART
""We can't afford this any longer, the budget's under pressure, and difficult decisions are necessary to ensure the budget returns to surplus.""
BQEND Compare that to the Murdoch's latest ""Labor's TAX"" articles and those Liberals using government hearings into franking credits as a fundraising forum.
What grubs Liberals are.
 MP Tim Wilson referred to AFP over franking credits inquiry 
BQSTART
Mr Wilson has come under fire for not previously disclosing at the hearings into franking credits that he invests in two separate funds that are managed by Wilson Asset Management — a firm that is campaigning against the proposed tax reform. 
A distant relative of Tim Wilson, Geoff Wilson, owns Wilson Asset Management.
BQEND This is what happens when the IPA get a Liberal seat and apply their view of what government and the tax system should be.
A grubby cash grab for wealthy leaners like Murdoch.
Like flies to shit.. Murdoch and his media - Murdoch organisation IPA - The Liberal party - His IPA MP's.
How anyone can call Criag Kelly a ""MP"" is beyond me. He spends more time on SkyNews than Allan Jones. Labor refers Tim Wilson to police over claims he shared voter details with fund manager 
BQSTART
Liberal MP Craig Kelly, another member of the committee, said he thought it was perfectly reasonable for the party to raise funds off the back of the taxpayer-funded $160,000 inquiry after The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age revealed the Liberal Party was using it to drive donations. 
""Everyone is free to attend,"" he said. ""They can stand here and hand out forms for the Labor Party, for GetUp! and for One Nation or for the Greens.""
BQEND What a compete and utter grub. Waht more can you expect from an ex real estate agent in corrupt NSW who is seen in fundraisers, the Murdoch press and 2GB more than sitting on his backbench in the house of reps.
Kelly better take an adult nappy into the house next week. There will not be time to race off and talk to 2GB Tuesday to Thursday.

The parliamentary weeks show the Morrison government at its most vulnerable because the Coalition no longer commands a majority in either chamber, but it’s not the resumption of parliament many MPs are fretting about.
It’s the looming campaign.
Speaking generally, Liberal and National MPs are more buoyant than they were at the end of last year, when the mood around the government was funereal. People certainly aren’t predicting The Great Comeback – Labor remains the favourite in the contest – but people have rested, and they hope if the conversation turns to the economy, and Labor’s tax measures, that the contest will tighten.
But the looming campaign creates significant anxiety. Labor and progressive third-party activists are already mobilising on the ground in marginal and less marginal seats. One government MP in a relatively safe seat in Queensland told me this week he’d never seen so much activity, so early.
Government MPs report the Liberal party’s federal director, Andrew Hirst, is making strides trying to bring the Coalition’s campaign machine into modernity, but they still feel a long way behind their opponents.
Coupled with the structural disadvantage created by Labor’s superior ground resources, there are also changes to voter behaviour, changes that are not particularly well examined, that increase the degree of difficulty in election seasons.
The one you hear a lot about is the significant increase in pre-poll voting. Australians are casting their votes before election day in rising numbers and that trend changes the dynamic of campaigning.
Elections used to build up, steadily, to crescendos in the final week, or weeks, and that pattern benefits political parties, because you can conserve finite resources at the beginning and reserve firepower for the closing week.
It’s much harder to pace a campaign through to a late focal point when voters in increasing numbers are voting earlier in the contest. The behavioural shift means campaigns need to assume a different rhythm, and implicit in that challenge is having the resources to communicate with voters from day one until polling day. Having enough resources also means having enough volunteers to staff pre-poll booths for the duration.
The Liberals see opportunity to rally their base, and harvest undecided voters, by banging the drum as loudly as possible about Labor’s tax measures
The purpose of this preamble is twofold. I want to point you to the practical concerns occupying the minds of government MPs hoping to be re-elected in May, and also tell you something about the psychology of the contest, because having some insight into that explains some of the behaviour we are seeing at the moment.
If we boil it down, government MPs are looking for ways to try and level the playing field between themselves and their opponents. In practical terms, that means mobilising an army for an election campaign – an army motivated enough to not only vote for the government, but actively assist the re-election effort (that latter point being crucial).
The Liberals see opportunity to rally their base, and harvest undecided voters, by banging the drum as loudly as possible about Labor’s tax measures, particularly the policy on franking credits, which has stirred up the retirees who will lose a benefit if Labor wins the election (unless of course they follow the advice of fund manager Geoff Wilson and restructure their affairs).
The hunt for a very specific form of political fightback, a fightback centred on raising money, recruiting bodies to give practical help, encouraging the creation of Liberal-linked “grassroots” bodies to amplify the message, using data to better target communications to voters – all hallmarks of Labor’s efforts in recent years to professionalise its ground game – gives important context to the overreach we’ve seen from Tim Wilson, using travelling taxpayer-funded roadshows to leverage what is a privately-funded partisan campaign.
When you are in a tearing hurry, when you need to recruit an army because the invaders are already in the field, you will be tempted to cut corners. When you are in a tearing hurry, and the need is great, senior people will also justify their decision to turn a blind eye to the consequences of this latest escalation, even if one of those consequences is your “clever” fightback morphing into yet another integrity crisis for the political class.
Part of the problem is egregious escalations like Wilson’s are often viewed inside the political and media complex through the prism of political chess – as artefacts of the race call, rather than picked apart substantively. I suspect that gives politicians a level of comfort that they can continue to push the boundaries of parliamentary conventions with a certain degree of comfort, and often be rewarded for doing it.
The impulse to dial everything up to eleven can be seen across a range of fronts: Scott Morrison’s thundering about pedophiles coming into the country if there are better procedures for medical transfers for people kept in indefinite detention; Peter Dutton swung so hard at Bill Shorten this week his left hook almost connected with his own jaw; the leaking of security advice to select media outlets – a development which appears to have troubled officials sufficiently to see them call in the cops.
It’s clear that no one is going to die wondering in this election year, except perhaps, the voting public, who remain resolutely nonplussed at the whole freewheeling, self-justifying, shebang.
A couple of final observations about the imperative of building fighting machines. The imperative does help to rapid set one of the more genuinely interesting dynamics of the looming federal contest.
The whole boomers versus millennials motif is a generalisation that can be overworked to the point of cliche, but there will be an element of generational face-off in the coming contest, because the programs of the major parties are inviting that debate.
If we think again about franking credits, and the government’s efforts to mobilise on that issue, Labor will attempt to counter with a mobilisation on a sustainable funding of public services message, and on climate change.
The franking credits issue is hottest in the coastal communities where self-funded retirees cluster, but the risks of climate change is also red hot in those same coastal communities, where anxiety is currently at 2007 levels because of the wild summer.

It has happened five times in the last 4bn years, as a result of meteorite impacts, long ice ages and huge volcanic eruptions. But this one is the result not of natural causes, but of humanity’s actions.
Extremely. By some measures, the biodiversity crisis is even deeper than that of climate change. Since the dawn of civilisation, humanity has caused the loss of 83% of all wild mammals. In the last 50 years alone, the populations of all mammals, birds, reptiles and fish have fallen by an average of 60%.
The new global review says it’s even worse for bugs, with the proportion of insect species declining being double that for vertebrates. The insect decline is at least a century old, but seems to have accelerated in recent decades.
Yes. There are more than a million species of insect, compared with just 5,400 mammals, and they are the cornerstone of all terrestrial ecosystems. Without them, you get what scientists call a “bottom-up trophic cascade”, in which the knock-on effects of the insect collapse surge up through the food chain, wiping out higher animals. And without healthy ecosystems, there is no clean air and water.
The lack of bugs on car windscreens after a drive in the country, compared with a few decades ago, is real. But hard scientific data requires careful and long-term research, and relatively little has been done. Insects are small and often hard to identify, and they are certainly much less charismatic than elephants or eagles. Worse, just when we need more information, researchers say entomology courses are being cut.
Ultimately the size of the human population and how much land it uses for the food, energy and other goods it consumes determine how much wildlife is lost. Protecting wild spaces is important, as is reducing the impact of industrial, chemical-based farming. Fighting climate change is also vital, particularly for the many insect species in the tropics. So demanding political action, eating fewer intensively farmed meat and dairy products, and flying less could all help.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/10/why-are-insects-in-decline-and-can-we-do-anything-about-it

The NSW land and environment court ruled last week Gloucester Resources’ Rocky Hill coalmine in the state’s Hunter Valley should not go ahead, in part because of its social impact on the town of Gloucester and because a new coalmine was not compatible with Australia’s commitments under the Paris agreement.
The planning commission has been considering plans by the South Korean company Kepco for an open-cut mine in the Bylong Valley, north-east of Mudgee.
Late last year, the NSW department of environment and planning recommended the development be approved subject to strict conditions and referred it to the commission, which is due to make its decision soon.
The proposed mine has been debated by farmers, environmentalists and residents, who have voiced concerns about the social impact, the greenhouse gas emissions from a new coal development, and also whether rejecting the mine could hurt employment in the region.
The Rocky Hill decision was a “fantastic shot in the arm for us”, said Phill Kennedy, a farmer who lives in the Bylong Valley. “The Rocky Hill proposal was minuscule compared to Bylong, which is five times the size in terms of the emissions.”
Lawyers who acted in the Rocky Hill case for community group Groundswell Gloucester said the Bylong Valley development had similarities to their case. 
In his judgment, Chief Judge Brian Preston said a new open cut coalmine in the Gloucester Valley “would be in the wrong place at the wrong time”.
David Morris, the chief executive of NSW Environmental Defenders Office, which acted on behalf of Groundswell Gloucester, said there were a number of proposed mines being assessed in the state that “should now logically follow the approach outlined by Chief Judge Preston”.
“The one to my mind that is the closest comparison to the Gloucester project is the Bylong Valley mine,” he said. “This is another scenic valley, it’s another greenfield coal project. There’s a whole raft of aspects of this decision in Rocky Hill which would seem broadly applicable to the project proposed in the Bylong Valley.”
Morris said other proposals where the case could prove relevant were Whitehaven’s Vickery extension project, Peabody’s Wambo joint venture and the Hume coal project.
Gloucester Resources has 28 days to decide if it will appeal the court’s decision.
The NSW Minerals Council has rejected the suggestion the case will have widespread ramifications.
“We’ll take a close look at the judgment, including what appears to be a range of different reasons for the outcome,” said Stephen Galilee, the council’s chief executive. “However, we don’t believe this is in any way a ‘landmark case’, given the department of planning had already recommended against the approval of the project.”
But George Woods, the NSW coordinator of the anti-mining action group Lock the Gate Alliance, said communities would be looking to the Independent Planning Commission for “leadership and direction” in the wake of the court’s decision.
“Bylong is the very next decision the commission will make about a new mine,” she said. “What we’d hope is this judgment would prompt the commission to seek advice that would put the emissions from Bylong in the context of a carbon budget consistent with meeting the Paris agreement.”
Brendan Sydes, the chief executive of Environmental Justice Australia, said the Rocky Hill case was “dramatically different in the sense that every argument that has been successfully put forward by mining companies in the past has been completely considered, discredited and rejected”.
He said that included considering the impact of emissions from coal that was exported and burned elsewhere, as well as the argument that if coal was not dug up and burned from one mine, it would simply happen somewhere else.
“We now have this anomalous situation that the most up-to-date and thoroughgoing analysis of the impact of new coalmines by an Australian court has adopted reasoning in a manner that’s inconsistent with the reasoning that has been adopted to support the approval of the Adani mine,” Sydes said.

Economists try to capture the dynamics of economic systems in their models to understand the relative impact of different policy options.

As always, these forces will be weakened again at the next collapse. That may be our first opportunity to redefine human relationships with Earth and each other.

£45bn in HPC subsidies ...... and for those using weird foreign money, that's approx Aus$82,800,000,000. 
Is that based on your £50/MWh gas pricing when it's £70/MWh?The power of Mazternomics™
BQEND
Hiya, simply trying to keep you honest by pointing to real numbers not your fake ones.
So, first HPC - It has a CfD of £100/MWh which lasts for 35yrs. A capacity of 3.2GW. A capacity factor of approx 92%. Expected to start generating in the late 2020's. And the NAO predict an average wholesale price that falls to about £45/MWh by the early 2030's.
So if we put all that info together we get a subsidy cost in todays money of approx:
3200MW x 92%cf x 24hrs x 365days x 35yrs x £55/MWh (£100CfD - £45 wholesale price) = £49.64bn, or Aus$91.34bn.
I tend to use the lower £45bn figure for comparisons against renewables, as the NAO expect a price of upto £55/MWh in the 2020's, giving us an average of £50/MWh for their 15yr CfD's. But I'm more than happy to use the higher £50bn figure for HPC if you'd prefer.
Next UK gas prices. I never said £50/MWh I said £20/MWh, whilst you claim £70/MWh.
Please do some research as you will immediately find that prices are approx 70p/therm. So I'll do the complex maths for you again:
70p/therm divided by 29.3kWh to a therm = 2.4p/kWh = £24/MWh
I don't see anything complicated, nor contentious in any of these numbers. I appreciate that throughout your posting history your claimed numbers always differ with reality, but that's your cross to bear, not mine.

We’ve been seeing numerous impacts catching many scientists by surprise with how soon they are occurring. In 2014 two independent teams of scientists reported that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is likely irreversibly retreating. 3.3 meters of sea level rise equivalent of ice there is being destabilized by a warming ocean and energy is going into the net melting of ice all over the planet. 
The paleoclimate record indicates that increasing global temperature by just 1.5-2°C above preindustrial temperature commits the system to an eventual 6-9m of sea level rise, a large fraction of which could arrive within the next 100 years.
Corals may not survive this century of warming and acidifying oceans, and droughts and floods linked to global warming—and conflict linked to those droughts—have already caused four countries to face famine.
Because of the decades to millennial long lag between a climate forcing and our feeling the full effect, due to the thermal inertia of the ocean and response time of the ice sheets, the effects we are feeling now are largely just the beginning of the result of emissions from the 20th century. And emissions have been increasing steadily for decades.
We are also seeing numerous amplifying feedbacks: loss of albedo (heat reflectivity) from ice melt, permafrost melt, methane release and massive wildfires; the Earth is starting to wrest any possible further human control of the climate away.
We're about out of time on this, if not already, and leaders are not only still acting as if this is not a planetary emergency, but some are acting as if there isn’t a problem at all.

I have read it, twice. It's a bit brief and looking at some interesting aspects. But, from my reading of it and other information I think that when we do observe over the next few years we are going to find that there is "" a significant excursion above the trend line is underway"".

This happened again in the Australian this week based on work by a long-standing economic modeller of climate policy, Brian Fisher.
So, what do economic modelling exercises tell us of the impact of reducing Australia’s contribution to global warming, and more importantly, what do they not? Should we cower in fear of action or embrace the inevitable change and manage the human and economic costs of transition?
Firstly, economic modelling results are not predictions. They are based on hypothetical future worlds. Economists try to capture the dynamics of economic systems in their models to understand the relative impact of different policy options. This means they are always wrong because economists can’t predict the future. Economic modellers are not the crystal ball gazers we read about in fantasy books.
Leading energy commentator and founder of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, Michael Liebreich, sums this up nicely. His graph shows what US government energy models have been projecting over the years compared with what is happening in the real world. Over and over again models have failed to capture how fast the cost of clean energy has been falling and the scale at which it would be deployed.
This does not mean the economic models are not useful, it just means they should be used to test the relative impact of different policy options and not be presented as predictions of the future. They have a long history of overestimating the costs of environmental regulations because people and markets can innovate faster than they often expect.
Secondly, the way economic modelling results are presented is very important. Industry groups in particular like to attach themselves to particular results and scream that thousands of jobs will be lost, or wages will be slashed. This is designed to scare people into not acting on climate change by making them feel insecure in their lives. The headlines in the Australian did just this.
It is also dishonest because they also don’t clearly put the results in the context of the broader change in the economy. (David Gruen, one of Australia’s top economic officials gave a great speech about this in 2008 to illustrate how long this silliness has been going on.)
To illustrate my point, the economic impacts Fischer has projected for different emissions targets are in the same ballpark of those projected for work commissioned by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade a few years ago. This work also presented results in a similar way to the Australian. However, what is also showed is that the economy, jobs, income, etc continued to grow regardless. We keep getting richer and have more jobs, we just do so at a slightly slower rate. 
Thirdly, because Australia exports a lot of coal and other emissions-intensive products to other countries, what they do matters an awful lot to the Australian economy. As other nations reduce emissions, demand for these products falls regardless of what we do. It has been established for some time that a significant part of the economic impacts of climate change on Australia comes from things we can’t control and this is generally presented in the results (see here for an example). While he does not report this, Brian Fisher knows this because he spearheaded economic analysis in the 1990s that was targeted at convincing Japan, one of our major coal markets, it would be too costly for them to reduce emissions.
Lastly, whenever these headlines are blasted across the papers one point is always lost: these results don’t include the cost of climate change itself. This summer, we have again seen a glimmer of what climate change will mean for Australia. Recent economic analysis indicates the benefits of limiting global warming far outweigh the cost of doing so, in one case by 70-1 (a good summary is here). (Again, this is something Fisher has considered in the past as he once said it would be cheaper to move people from the Pacific and put them in condos on the Gold Coast than act on climate change.)
So, as we head into another cycle of climate change politics in Canberra, beware the economic doomsayers and the threats from industry groups that credible action will be a “wrecking ball” to the economy. To be glib, no one said saving the Earth would be free. Acting on climate change will have costs but the costs of not acting will be far, far larger. Better that we come together and manage a fair and effective transition than continuing to delay and pay a much, much greater bill later.

The environment committee of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) meets on Monday in Montreal behind closed doors to discuss measures to reduce emissions from international aircraft. Domestic and international flights emitted 895m tonnes of CO2 last year – 2.4% of global energy-related CO2 emissions, according to Carbon Brief. In terms of emissions, if aviation were a country it would be the sixth largest in the world.
But the body in charge of reducing the carbon footprint of international aviation has little or no public scrutiny. Its agenda and discussion documents are not released to the public or the international press, and the meetings are not open to the media.
Anyone who leaks documents being discussed faces “unlimited liability for confidentiality breaches”, according to ICAO rules.
Key observers at Monday’s meeting of the committee on aviation and environmental protection (CAEP) are a number of industry bodies. They include the International Business Aviation Council, the International Federation of Air Line Pilots’ Associations, the Arab Civil Aviation Commission, the International Coordinating Council of Aerospace Industries Associations, the Airports Council International and the International Air Transport Association. The only non-governmental body not linked to the airline industry allowed into the meeting is the International Coalition for Sustainable Aviation, made up of a small group of international environmental NGOs.
Nadja Kostka, climate project coordinator at Transparency International, said: “Agencies which set common global standards for large, international industries have to be transparent in order to prevent capture by corporate interests, or even the appearance of undue influence.
“The ICAO currently meets behind closed doors, including for discussion about emissions, which affect the entire planet. We’ve seen similar situations at other UN agencies … we strongly believe that all UN bodies need to commit to transparent ways of working in order to gain the public’s trust.”
The key discussions on reducing emissions come amid growing pressure from some countries – and their airlines – to open the doors to all types of biofuels, including those which cause environmental destruction, such as palm oil-based fuels.
Indonesia, one of the largest palm oil producers in the world, is one of 24 member states whose representatives will be deciding in secret to recommend whether future new airline fuels have to be sustainable.
Malaysia, which is not a member of CAEP, is pushing a campaign – Love my Palm Oil – to extend it to non-food use, supported by its three main airlines.
Twenty-four countries, including the UK, France, Canada, Singapore, Russia and the US, have representatives at this week’s meeting.
This year international aircraft will for the first time have to start monitoring their emissions as part of ICAO measures to reduce emissions with a market-based system of purchasing emissions offsets – rather than by directly reducing aircraft emissions.
They can reduce the amount of carbon emissions they have to offset by using biofuels, but as yet there has been no agreement by member countries on restricting the new fuels to those which are sustainable.
The scheme was agreed in 2016 by the ICAO countries. But few believe it will have the required impact on cutting emissions in a growing aviation industry in which passenger numbers are predicted to double to 8.2 billion in 2037.
The International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) said it could only be expected to “modestly reduce” the net climate impact of international aviation up to 2035.
Andrew Murphy of the NGO Transport and Environment, said the lack of transparency gave little confidence that the ICAO would tackle emissions, adding: “Media are free, and in fact encouraged, to cover similar meetings in other UN agencies …
“It’s well past time that ICAO brought its media practices into line with the rest of the UN family, a move which would help raise confidence in its decision-making.”
Last year Saudi Arabia – with the backing of the US – secured a new definition at the ICAO of alternative fuels to include “clean oil” because the refinery producing the oil was run on renewable electricity – something Murphy said amounted to “greenwash oil” and was “an awful deal for the climate”.
The environmental NGOs are calling for the ICAO and all its committees to open to the public and remove threats of “unlimited liability” for members who release documents.
“At present, state and observer submissions to CAEP remain unavailable to those outside of CAEP,” they said.
“When such submissions contain commercially sensitive information, such secrecy may be acceptable. However, this justification oftentimes deserves to be challenged, as information from manufacturers which is submitted to CAEP is, as a matter of course, available to other manufactures, and therefore no harm can be identified from making it available to a broader range of actors.
“Such a level of secrecy stands in contrast to other UN agencies.”
Under the Paris climate change agreement, emissions from international aviation are not specifically included in national climate targets required by countries to pursue efforts to limit global temperature increases to 1.5C. This leaves ICAO as the primary body for reducing airline emissions.
A spokesman for ICAO provided the Guardian with a list of attendees to the meeting and said the meeting results would be made available, but not the discussion papers. “Only the CAEP members and recognized observers are permitted in the room for said discussions,” he said.

Venezuela is an environmental disaster, as the rest of the continent, something that only these parties says around here. But it should be treated as other countries, like those of the Northern Triangle (Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador) or Colombia, who has an actual civil war. The Old Left never cared about the land factor, it's something that shares with capitalism, this focus on just one term of the equation. But the first people affected in environmental crises are poor people, so if you are in opposition to the system you realize how those problems interconnect. Healthcare and education area the two biggest ways that you can make change at the individual level and the societal level at the same time.We have the technology, it just not viable under capitalism to do carbon capture or provide healthcare and education for an improved life. For those complaining about ""providing those unwilling to work"", the biggest advantage cost-wise from a universal plan is to avoid the costs of a regulatory regime that balloons over time. I can't estimate exactly how much people are willing to not work and live with a breadbox and a public library, but my guess is lower than the workers that are going to be needed to check for fraud when you work- or mean-test the grants. Economic security is not a live of luxury, but is something that many people crave right now. And all this you pay it with hard, remunerated work; reducing capital independence in the equation with new property rights that ties land use with people's needs and a democratization of bureaucracy to put a check in its power and costs. At the beginning it will need a mobilization akin of a war to pay for the up-front costs, but as economy of scale and technologic breakthroughs from public, open research reduce them we will relax until one day our grandchildren would not understand what this crisis was about. The only people who has something to fear are moneylenders, shareholders and landlords casually the ones that don't work in this society and get paid more than the rest.', u'recommendation_count': u'3', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1549987290000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u""her picture it 's here does n't mean"", u'effect': u'that this is about her increase'}], u'author_id': u'18392786', u'id': u'125789493', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'MassiveKitten', u'text': u'With Hollande it was all about the romance of him riding in the streets of Paris with his scooter ;)', u'recommendation_count': u'2', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1549987272000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'15787310', u'in_reply_to': u'125788232', u'id': u'125789481', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Waster1000', u'text': u'Control of media, state nationalisation.

We are quite in a lot of trouble. A new study by the Institute for Public Policy Research suggests that a series of crises – from global warming to soil infertility – are set to hit us at the same time. The consequences could include massive destabilisation, not just in individual countries but on a global level. From the damage inflicted on human health, to a possible economic meltdown caused by mass insurance claims if the US is ravaged by floods and forest fires, we are not remotely prepared.
Consider just one scenario. According to Laurie Laybourn-Langton, the lead author of the report, climate crisis could lead to 10 times more refugees from the Middle East than the 12 million who fled during the past few years of upheaval and turmoil. The far right skilfully manipulated and inflamed backlash over this last refugee crisis: that’s partly why Donald Trump is now president of the US, why the far right are in coalition governments in Italy and Austria, and why Viktor Orbán’s Hungarian regime has been able to consolidate its authoritarian rule. What will happen when refugees come in far greater numbers? A twisted irony beckons: that extremists in the Trump administration, aptly labelled climate change “arsonists” by writer Naomi Klein, will make mass forced migration more likely because of their environment-wrecking policies, and then reap perverse political benefits by whipping up hatred against the resulting tide of human misery.
But there is hope. That’s important to state, because the danger with exclusively focusing on apocalyptic climate change scenarios is that much anxiety is caused, but nothing else: it is demobilising, demotivating, because it seems to present an insurmountable challenge. It is too late to stop many of the adverse consequences of overlapping environmental crises, but not too late to stop catastrophe. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s game-changing political ascent has transformed the conversation on climate change in the US: the Democratic establishment has been forced to embrace her Green New Deal agenda, such as committing to zero carbon emissions, repairing and upgrading national infrastructure, making all buildings energy efficient, and investing in affordable public transportation and high-speed rail.
The magic of the Green New Deal is it argues that confronting the environmental crises cannot be separated from social and economic justice: its other proposals include guaranteeing every American a job with decent wages and conditions, as well as high-quality healthcare, affordable housing and economic security. This is critical. Climate change, to many, seems important in the abstract, but too technical, and seemingly in competition with what seem, superficially, to be more immediate concerns.
When confronting environmental crisis becomes a bread-and-butter issue, about housing, jobs and living standards, public enthusiasm is all the more likely. Investing in renewable energy, after all, could create millions of secure, skilled jobs across the world. Environmental crisis risks exacerbating existing inequalities; a just transition would reduce them.
The Labour MP Rebecca Long-Bailey has done admirable work in developing ideas for a so-called Green Transformation. But the party as a whole – and the wider left and labour movement – is failing to put sufficient emphasis on tackling the impending crises, and needs to be more radical in its answers. Ocasio-Cortez has shown that even in the age of Trump, a national debate on tackling the existential crises facing humanity can be triggered. Labour must follow her lead, and passionately make the case that saving the planet will help free it of the social and economic injustice that blights it.

Of hearing a noise outside, pulling open the drapes and seeing a polar bear looking in through the window.
Of walking around a corner at night, coming face-to-face with a bear and, implausibly, scaring it off with the strobe light on a cellphone.
Of encountering an old man with a walker, determinedly clacking past a puzzled bear that peered at him from behind a rock and muttering defiantly: “If it gets me, it gets me.”
Of being about to, against all better judgment, walk the couple of hundred yards from restaurant to hotel room at night, only to be pulled back by a warning that a pair of polar bears had been spotted across the street.
(OK, the last story is mine. The line between being a teller of tales and the subject of an obituary can be thinner than one might like.)
Such is everyday life, particularly during October and November, in this small town on the shores of Canada’s Hudson Bay. A little more than 1,000 miles north of the provincial capital of Winnipeg, Churchill is not just remote, it is defiantly so, accessible overland only by rail, its residents bonded by the conjoined challenges of living on the fringes of the Arctic and sharing their streets with the largest land carnivore in the world.
“If you were to build a town today, you would never put it here,” explains Geoff York of Polar Bears International, a research and advocacy organization whose members, understandably, spend much time in Churchill each year. “Polar bears are creatures of the sea ice, and they come ashore in the summer here when the sea ice on Hudson Bay melts and then they wait for the ice to return.” That return tends to begin sometime in November; by October, the bears are already stirring, wandering in anticipation toward the bay along a route that takes them past, and sometimes directly through, Churchill.
From a cold war peak of about 5,000 people, when it hosted a military base, Churchill is now home to roughly 900 year-round inhabitants, slightly more than half of whom are Native. Theirs can be a harsh and at times tenuous existence, one that is leavened by the income from tourists who come to gaze at the northern lights in the winter, paddle among the hundreds of belugas that throng the river in summer and, in October and November, visit the polar bear capital of the world.
Polar bears have made Churchill famous, and led to it being dubbed the “jewel of Manitoba” and one of the top destinations in Canada. But as it emerges from the most testing two years in its modern history, Churchill may be about to embark on an entirely different path, as this frequently frigid community considers embracing a warmer future.
It is estimated that about 10,000 people descend upon Churchill annually during the five- or six-week “bear season”. The bulk of bear viewing takes place on the tundra outside of town, from the safety of bespoke vehicles approximately the size of school buses atop airport fire truck wheels, the immense size of which enables the trucks to traverse treacherous terrain and keep their occupants beyond the reach of even the largest and most curious bear.
The challenge for Churchill residents is to encourage the bears to head to the tundra without tarrying in town. In the past, the policy was less one of deterrence than immediate destruction. “When I was growing up, it was common for conservation officers to shoot 25 bears a season,” explains the mayor, Mike Spence, who is of Cree and Scottish descent. These days, the community, in conjunction with the Manitoba department of conservation, employs a different approach: the Polar Bear Alert Program.
Signs around the town remind residents and visitors alike to exercise caution and report bear sightings on the hotline – 675-BEAR. Culvert traps, baited with seal scent, line the perimeter of the community; bears that are caught in them are taken to a holding facility, popularly known as the polar bear jail, where they are held for up to 30 days (without food, to enhance the deterrence factor of the experience), before being drugged and helicoptered to a spot safely away from town – or, if late enough in the season, on to the sea ice.
If a bear does make it past the perimeter defense and into town conservation officers’ first plan is to help it on its way, motivating it to leave by firing cracker shells (loud, blank shotgun shells) and following it with vehicles. Only the recalcitrant and the repeat offenders are incarcerated.
For residents, living with polar bears is an unavoidable fact of life, and one that instils an understandable caution. As one former resident once said to me with a chuckle: “In Winnipeg, they say you can tell when someone is from Churchill because they always look carefully before walking around a corner.”
House and vehicle doors are always unlocked, should anyone need to fling one open and leap to shelter. As much as they can, residents simply avoid peak bear sites – anywhere along the coast or the riverbanks, in the willows on the edge of town, alleyways – especially at night, and particularly during peak bear season. For some, however, that isn’t always an option. Parker Fitzpatrick works for Manitoba Hydro, the provincial utility company, and if a line is down, he and his team have to repair it, no matter when and where. As a result, they exercise due caution.
“You try your hardest to not put yourself in that predicament,” he explains. “But if you have to go out in an area that’s a bad area or where bears have been spotted, and there’s a line down, I always get resources: set up security fences, for example, and carry shotguns with cracker shells. Ninety per cent of bears won’t bother you at all, but there are some who are hungry or are curious and want to bat you around like a baseball.”
Since the establishment of the Polar Bear Alert Program in 1983, serious attacks have been rare. There has been just one fatality, during the program’s first season: a homeless man, Tommy Mutanen, was rummaging through the freezer of a fire-damaged motel, stuffing meat into his pockets, when he rounded a corner and bumped into a bear. Nearby residents heard his screams, but although they rushed to his aid, they could not make the bear stop his attack, and by the time they shot it, Mutanen was dead.
There has, however, been one exceptionally close shave.
Erin Greene first arrived in Churchill from her native Montreal in 2012; she planned to spend a few months working at a local restaurant and then go back home, but she liked it so much she returned to stay the following summer.
“And then,” she said, “I got mauled by a polar bear.”
On Halloween night 2013, Greene and two friends were walking home in the early hours from a party when, she later recalled: “We all looked and there was a polar bear that was barreling down the street, just running towards us. Our first instinct was to run.”
Her friends escaped, but the bear caught Greene and grabbed her by the head and shoulders, tearing off part of her scalp as it tossed her around like a rag doll. As blood poured down her body, Erin was convinced she was going to die, and she might well have done, had it not been for a 69-year-old man with a shovel named Bill Ayotte.
Ayotte heard Greene’s screams and, clad only in a sweater and his pyjamas, ran toward the scene and brought his shovel down as hard as he could between the bear’s eyes.
The bear dropped Greene, who scrambled toward the safety of Ayotte’s house, and turned its attention to Ayotte instead, tearing off an ear and clamping down on a leg. Other residents arrived, firing cracker shells and, ultimately, driving at the bear with headlights flashing and horn blazing, sending it off.
Greene and Ayotte were airlifted to Winnipeg. Greene’s scalp was repaired; Ayotte’s ear was reattached. Both spent weeks recuperating in the hospital; both returned to Churchill.
Today, Greene teaches yoga in the community; during bear season, she works at a gift shop and, in the summer months, leads standup-paddleboard tours on to the river when the belugas are at their peak.
She could not, I suggest, have been blamed had she elected not to return to the scene of such an ordeal.
“I was trying to heal myself from the trauma I had experienced, and I believe that facing it head on is the way to do it,” she said. Besides, the community had helped pay her medical bills; she could hardly abandon them. “Knowing that this community produced someone who would risk their life to save another person’s, I definitely wanted to be somewhere where humans turned out like that.”
The sense of community, of a populace that bonds together and looks out for each other, is a common theme among residents. It was both tested and strengthened over the last two years, when the very viability of Churchill was threatened as never before.
It all began with the largest blizzard anyone could recall.
The blizzard began on 7 March 2017 and lasted for 57 hours. As the snow fell, it was driven by 120 km/h winds into massive drifts. By the time it was over, drifts in some places were 25 to 30 feet high; “huge stretches” of roads were buried under eight to nine feet of snow.
“We had to tunnel out of our house, tunnel up and out,” recalls Sandra Cook, a local artist. “My son Max was 13 at the time, so we figured he was the strongest and the thinnest. So, we dug this tunnel up and sent Max up there. He had to lay down on the top of the snow pile, because he couldn’t stand up [because of the wind], and shovel until [Sandra’s husband] Kevin could get out. Then Kevin and Max went out and started shoveling out others. People were looking out across the street, looking out for neighbors. The whole community came together. Our streets were like tunnels. It was an extraordinary amount of snow.”
The response to the blizzard, said Cook, “brought out the best in people”. But the community would face a bigger challenge two months later, one that stretched it to the limit.
The snow melted.
The melt caused massive flooding which, among other things, damaged the final 249km stretch of the railway track connecting Churchill to Winnipeg and thus the world. An engineering study found 20 washouts and damage in 130 places. The estimated repair bill was $43.5m. OmniTrax, the Colorado-based company that owned the track and which was already looking for a way to offload it, said it couldn’t afford to foot the repairs and wouldn’t. The federal government took the company to court. And Churchill found itself effectively isolated.
A week without the train became a month. A month became two, then three, then six, then 18.
With no road connection to the outside world, the only way out for residents was a $1,200 round-trip air ticket that few could afford. Everything that the town needed – every nail and screw, every can of beer, every pallet of produce – had to be flown in at exorbitant cost. Residents found themselves with far less cash on hand. Business at some stores in town dropped 90%.
The hit to the community was not just financial. “There are kids in this town who haven’t seen their grandparents for a year and nine months,” said Dave Daley, a Métis community leader and owner of a dog mushing company that caters to tourists. “A lot of families constantly go back and forth; there’s been none of that.” The school hockey team had to content itself with practice, because there was no way for them to travel and compete. For some, the uncertain future was too tenuous to risk staying.
“I think there were 40 less kids in the school last year,” said Daley. “There were some people struggling with addiction, some families breaking apart,” said Cook. “We had a spurt of crime, which is normally very low here.”
The impasse was finally broken when a consortium of industry and First Nations communities banded together as the Arctic Gateway Group to buy the rail track and the port in late August. Repairs to the rail line began almost immediately, and on 31 October last year, the still of the Churchill night was pierced, for the first time in 18 months, by the whistle of an approaching train.
“People were just stunned,” recalls Cook. “I was handing out Halloween candy and I suddenly thought, ‘What am I hearing?’ The smiles plastered on people’s faces were unbelievable.”
The following day, the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, flew into town to formally announce the restoration of the railway and increased funding to improve the line and repair and redevelop the port. A street party celebrated the start of a new chapter. On the deck of the Seaport Hotel, owned by Spence, a sign declared: “The hostages are free.”
But with new beginnings come new challenges, and as it emerges from its darkest hour, Churchill finds itself at a crossroads.
“I think there’s a bright future for us,” asserts Daley. “But we have to be careful: we don’t want Churchill to lose its identity. I don’t want a road here. The minute we get a road here, we lose our identity and who we are.”
Even without a road, that identity may ultimately face a reckoning. The challenge isn’t posed by a renovated railway, but by the prospect of a refurbished and revitalized port, the decrepit husk of which looms over the town. In the past, the port regularly exported grain and provided diesel fuel to remote Nunavut communities, but the new owners have a much grander vision: of links to Europe and India and the possible export of oil and gas.
“A few years ago, OmniTrax raised the prospect of shipping oil through the community, and unequivocally the community was resolutely against doing so for a number of reasons, the biggest one being that the shipping industry at the time was ill-equipped to deal with the prospect of accidents or disasters,” said John Gunter of Frontiers North Adventures, one of the premier ecotourism companies in town. “So, it looks like we’ll have to deal with that prospect again in the future.”
Of course, for a port in an Arctic environment to become truly viable, it will require shipping lanes that aren’t clogged with ice much of the year; and so Churchill may ultimately find itself as both the most famous home of the ultimate icon of climate change and a community that, in the words of Spence, “will have to take advantage” of that warming climate.
“The Northwest Passage offers a 7,000km shortcut from New Jersey to Shanghai,” Murad al-Katib, CEO of Arctic Gateway, said at the railway reopening ceremony. “Churchill is the only commercial deep-water port in northern Canada, and climate change has extended the shipping season.” It is a view cautiously echoed by many in town, even as they express anxiety about not losing what makes Churchill unique.
“I’m not against oil, because I think it can be done safely,” said Daley. “With global warming and the strait open more often, I think there’s a market for it. But this is the jewel of Manitoba – it’s the jewel of Canada – and we have to protect it. The port will in time become viable, but our economic future is tourism.”
For a community that in the last two years has been buried by snow and cut off from the world, and that even in the best of times must beware of polar bears around the corner, it is just the latest challenge among many. But at least, for now, with the sound of the train whistle regularly reminding the community of its re-connection with the outside world, there is hope.
“We find a way; it’s what we do,” saids Cook. “We hang in there, and we’re going to find a way.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/13/churchill-canada-polar-bear-capital

The academics, including almost 100 professors, say the “tragic and desperate facts” of the unfolding climate breakdown – and the lack of meaningful action by politicians – leave young people with little option but to take matters into their own hands.
In a letter to the Guardian, they write: “[Those taking part in the strike] have every right to be angry about the future that we shall bequeath to them, if proportionate and urgent action is not taken.”
The number of those taking part in Friday’s strike is growing rapidly, amid mounting evidence of the scale and impact of the climate emergency. There are more than 50 confirmed events from Fort William to Hastings, with more added each day.
The UK day of action is part of a movement that started in August when Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old schoolgirl, held a solo protest outside Sweden’s parliament. Globally, up to 70,000 schoolchildren each week are taking part in 270 towns and cities.
Individual demonstrations have already been held in the UK, but Friday’s coordinated day of action is expected to see the biggest protests by students and young people in the UK since the student strikes of 2010 over tuition fees.
There has been some criticism of the strikes by climate change deniers and politicians who claim the strike amounts to little more than truanting.
Earlier this month a Belgian environment minister was forced to resign after falsely claiming the country’s intelligence services held evidence that the tens of thousands of children skipping school were being directed by unnamed powers.
But the strike has been backed by one of the UK’s leading teaching unions and the academics say the young people who are prepared to organise and take part in the strike are setting an example that others should follow.
“We are inspired that our children, spurred on by the noble actions of Greta Thunberg and many other striking students all around the world, are making their voices heard.”
The letter highlights the growing signs of climate breakdown, from the latest UN report that warns there are 12 years to avoid the worst impacts of global warming, to record-breaking droughts and heatwaves, warming oceans and melting ice sheets.
The academics added: “It is with these tragic and desperate events in mind that we offer our full support to the students, some of whom may well aspire to be the academics of the future, who bravely plan to strike on 15 February to demand that the UK government takes climate action.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/13/academics-back-uk-schools-climate-change-strikes

Tailor-made meal kits save waste by providing people with precise amounts of fresh ingredients for chosen recipes, meaning leftovers are minimised and less food goes off before people have a chance to use it.
But while the delivery services score well on reducing food waste, buying the same ingredients from the supermarket almost always saves energy overall simply because meal kits use so much single-use packaging.
“The good news is that if you have meals that are tailored for consumption, people won’t over-buy and you have less food waste. You fine-tune the portions to what people will actually eat,” said Michael Webber, acting director of the Energy Institute at the University of Texas in Austin.
Beyond the cost of the waste itself, discarded food generates methane that contributes to climate change. If food waste was a country, it would rank third in emissions behind the US and China. A 2018 report from the Boston Consulting Group found that the waste was set to soar by a third by 2030 when global food waste was estimated to reach 2.1bn tonnes.
According to Webber, meal kits can reduce transport emissions if they mean people take fewer trips to the supermarket. If people only went to buy non-perishable goods such as soap and toilet paper, they may only have to visit once every couple of months, he said. “That delivery truck can carry meals for you and dozens of neighbours, so you might replace dozens of car trips with one truck trip,” he added.
The study found that even if delivered meal kits reduced food waste to zero, they would still use up more energy overall than buying the same food from the supermarket unless the energy used for the meal kit packaging was cut by a fifth. Details of the study were presented on Thursday at the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Washington DC.
“The packaging is a killer if it’s single-use and thrown away. All the environmental benefits are lost,” said Webber. “But if the packaging can be reused, if it’s glass bottles, like in the old days, you can get some benefits.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/14/meal-kits-cut-food-waste-but-packaging-is-a-problem-study-finds

It’s the only power I have | Rosie Smart-Knight,article,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/15/school-climate-strike-classroom-climate-change,0,"Today, Friday 15 February, thousands of students from schools, colleges, and universities all around the UK will be going on strike, and I’m one of them. I’m taking part in the Youth Strike 4 Climate movement because I want to make a difference. I want my generation’s voice to be heard and listened to. We stand to lose the most from catastrophic climate change, yet we’re the ones who’ve been excluded from the most serious conversations.
I don’t believe that previous generations wanted to create a world that faces such catastrophe, but when confronted with the stark reality, many have pushed it to one side because it doesn’t seem an immediate threat. We can’t run down the clock on this issue. Twelve years – the amount of time climate scientists have given us to keep global warming in check – seems like a long time to me: it’s two-thirds of my life. But it’s no time at all to instigate the sort of radical change that we need. It scares me to think that my life could be defined so rigidly from so early on.
In the space of 12 years, we could have three separate governments, each with their own agendas. This issue cannot be one that is used for popularity contests, it’s one that requires immediate, unified and urgent action. Politicians are gambling with the future of all known life.
I’m often asked if I think my actions will make a difference. How can students skipping school change anything except our grades? Only time will tell, but what I do know is that the nation is suddenly talking about climate change again, and that’s because of our actions. Greta Thunberg’s individual action has shown we can get noticed, and conversations are starting. Imagine how much attention the climate crisis will get when thousands of us demand our right to a healthy planet and a future to look forward to.
I’m not striking because I know how to tackle climate change, I’m striking because I want the people with the power to do something to start addressing it. They need to listen to the scientists who have been warning us about climate change for years – and who understand how best to solve this mess. We’ve been called truants and snowflakes, but if we were really involved in this because we wanted a day off school, there are much easier ways to go about it. Standing in the cold, demanding that those in power take our futures seriously isn’t something we’re glad we have to do. I wish that the burden didn’t fall on any of our shoulders. We are being asked to write our epitaphs before most of us are even able to vote, but I refuse to be passive in the face of catastrophe.
Several of my friends and classmates are striking with me, and many who aren’t are supportive. We are aware that we will be skipping lessons for something that may not make a big difference – and we’re all conscious of how precious our education is. It’s only due to the severity of the issue that we are jeopardising it. 
My college has been less than supportive, as it believes that there are better ways to make a difference than encouraging students to participate. I sent a college-wide email to let people know what I was doing and how they could get involved. I was quickly told by a staff member that I wasn’t allowed to use the college system to spread political messages. It saddened me that demanding a say in my future, and the future of all life on Earth, was regarded as a political message. Surely me doing nothing would be a breach of my duty of care for future generations, just as our leaders doing nothing now is a failure to live up to theirs?
I want the people in power to wake up, become leaders, and realise that they only have 12 years to change their legacies. The fact that the movement so far has received so much positive attention gives me hope that it will prompt change – because we need drastic and immediate action.
Even if the climate strike doesn’t prompt the change we need and demand, it has given so many young people across the country a chance to raise their voice and make it heard. This movement is allowing young people to realise they’re not alone, that others care about the climate, and are worried about the future. I will continue to raise awareness of the climate crisis, and I will continue to demand change – starting with the global school strike on Friday.

Absolutely true. Why were the Conquistadors able to kill the Native Americans with blankets laced with small pox? Edward Jenner was not born at that time so there was no vaccination. No there was smallpox in Europe and many tens of thousands died each year. However, the ones who survived had developed a very strong immunity to it. On the other hand the Native Americans had never encountered any small pox germs before and hence they could not fight it.
I had measles, mumps and chicken pox. Big deal. I was at home sick for a week or two. I have turned out perfectly fine. Practically everyone I know had chicken pox and they are all fine. One college mate had it twice and he is still fine.
I would categorize vaccines into two categories. One is necessary to get rid of illnesses or diseases that can be life-threatening or can cause permanent damage. Like small pox or polio. The others like measles and chicken pox cause temporary discomfort to most people but overall they are fine. Those are unnecessary vaccinations. The biggest scam in the United States is the flu vaccine.

Thanks to vaccines, we have eradicated diseases that used to be feared as scourges and controlled others to the extent that seeing a very few cases is an event. But there have been mistakes, and there will always be a few individuals who react badly - the same as for any intervention. In these cases, first we need to understand the actual, rather than the apparent, causality of the reaction. We also need to understand why some people treat vaccine reactions so differently from other drug reactions. For example, many people are hypersensitive to penicillins, but it's no big deal - ""OK, I can't take penicillins, so please give me a different antibiotic."" Their reaction is not, ""I can't take penicillins, what's more all antibiotics are the Devil's work that I will neither take myself nor allow anywhere near members of my family."" Why is that?
People, and especially parents, must decide whom they will trust. Will you trust your physician and other medical professionals, or will you trust strangers whom you met on social media? If you are inclined toward the latter, why? Do you believe that they are transparently honest, factually correct and unconflicted? If so, why? If you trust medical professionals in other health care matters, why might you not trust them on vaccination?
As for what to do about anti-vaxxers, calling them stupid is clearly a mistake. Education is important, and some may change their views. For those who don't, they must be allowed their civil rights, which should include the right to refuse vaccination under the principle of informed consent.

per year specifically due to measles for the previous 25 years was 214.

increasing regulation is leading to additional costs and longer development times with consequently reduced times to patent expiry;increasing risk aversion by executive management teams is contributing to a slowdown in the appearance of novel pharmaceuticals;reducing risk tolerance in patient populations and regulatory bodies is leading to a lower success rate for marketing authorisation approvals;cost pressures within national health services are leading to progressive downward pressure on prices;market penetration by generics is increasing rapidly; andmany people consider that the current research pharmaceutical business model is no longer sustainable, but no-one has yet come up with a better one.""

The only way I can see this link people think they see is to give the MMR vaccine to children later then what it is given now primarily when children have began to communicate and socially interact effectively otherwise this problem is not going to go away.
BQENDMy daughter is autistic. Nobody had a clue until she fell apart at 11 years old, many years after receiving the MMR vaccine. Many people are now being diagnosed in their thirties and forties, thanks to growing sophistication in the diagnosis mechanisms, and parents recognising traits in themselves that have been picked up in their children.
So just how great a delay in administering the MMR vaccine are you proposing?
Bear in mind too that the greater the delay, the greater the increase in the proportion of the population that remains unvaccinated, and so the greater the threat to herd immunity.
The only way to address the misperception of a link between MMR and autism is to look at the data objectively and scientifically, and it has long since been established that there is no link whatsoever. If people choose to deny the science, then yes, their stupidity becomes a problem. Indeed, there is a compelling argument that if children cannot be protected with their parents' blessing, they deserve to be protected without it, for children should not be held responsible for the stupidity of their parents.
Incidentally, there is a very good reason that (ex-)Dr Wakefield was 'a lone voice', and that is that he was a fraud.

It wasn’t from a member of Donald Trump’s administration, or part of a frenetic, grammatically challenged Facebook post – it was from a classmate when I was at school. Her family wasn’t waging a crusade against medical science: they simply gave credence to disgraced former doctor Andrew Wakefield’s study that wrongly asserted a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Back then, the study had not yet been discredited.
One only has to stray into anti-vaxxer internet forums for a few minutes to see that they’re stuffed with conspiracy theorists, opportunists, reactionaries, and – worst of all – hubristic idiots. This is the vanguard of the anti-vaxxer movement.

A number of the anti-vaxxer vanguard may have started life as concerned parents, but have gradually sunk into increasingly extreme positions because the only communication they’re getting from the other side is that they’re foolish and irresponsible. Almost every week the internet produces another diatribe against anti-vaxxers, or a listicle of their “horrifyingly stupid” social media posts.
A neat example of poor communication by those who are trying to stem anti-vaxxer conspiracy theories is a 2017 study called “Misinformation lingers in memory” by the University of Edinburgh, which found that using myth-busting techniques actually increased participants’ tendency to wrongly believe in a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. In other words, simply repeating a vaccination conspiracy theory and then debunking it with facts makes people more likely to believe the conspiracy theory than they did before, because reminding people of the conspiracy theory – even in order to discredit it – lodges it deeper in the public consciousness. This is not only the fault of the people hearing these arguments – it is our failure; it is a failure of communication.
The Public Interest Research Centre , a communications organisation I sometimes work with, argues that miscommunications like these happen because we tend to think of human beings as fact-processing machines. We assume that if we make a factual argument loudly and often enough, people will eventually become overpowered by its inherent logic, believe it, and even start arguing it themselves. Most of the recent events in politics and society, including the finding that measles cases are increasing, should be evidence enough that this is assumption is entirely wrong, and that by leaning on it, we simply enlarge a gulf of understanding between us and the people we are trying to communicate with. Frustrated that they cannot see the world in the same way we do, we call them idiots and chancers, we denounce their beliefs – and then we wonder why they’re not coming around to our way of thinking.
Over the past 30 years, during which free-market technocratic politics has been the dominant ideology, populations have been encouraged to believe that there is an agreed set of facts that we all must adhere to for the greater good, and that those who question these facts are a dangerous menace. But in the last five or 10 years, this ideology has begun to crumble, and as a result more and more people are beginning to question who is giving them facts and what their agenda might be. Following events such as the Iraq war and the financial crisis, which were so defined by greed and deception, some public scepticism is rational and maybe even welcome. But the anti-vaxxer movement has been given a shot in the arm, no pun intended, by this general collapse of trust in the establishment, which has been largely misunderstood, dismissed or even demonised by the traditional gatekeepers of public discourse.
What began as scepticism about political ideals and ways of organising societies has spilled over into scientific disciplines where a shared agreement of the facts and reliance on empirical evidence is absolutely necessary. The anti-vaxxer movement is what happens when public scepticism is not fully understood or empathised with, and when defunct methods of experts shouting facts over and over again are the only response. The vacuum created by this lack of empathy is then filled by malicious actors who want to present themselves as the authority instead, and to erode trust in science to promote phenomena such as climate change denialism, or in a shared understanding of human rights in order to discriminate against others. This week, Darla Shine, the wife of the White House director of communications, went on a Twitter tirade  (something for which she has form – having previously used the platform to question why white people aren’t allowed to use the n-word, given its use by black people) against measles vaccines. People like Shine, and Trump, take advantage of the general atmosphere of disinformation in order to assert harmful and inaccurate arguments as universal truths.
If we want to defeat the anti-vaxxer movement, we need to understand why it exists, and the increase in its popularity. We need to look at the wider context that allowed such a dangerous and obviously wrongheaded movement to flourish so unchecked. It might make us feel good to denounce anti-vaxxers as villains, but it doesn’t seem to be working. And as long as the attempts to stop anti-vaxxers fail, more and more children will be put at risk.

What does that mean?
You are hoping to force everyone to keep burning fossil fuels?
Why?
""Combustion of available fossil fuel resources sufficient to eliminate the Antarctic Ice Sheet"" - Winkelmann et al 2015.
When CO2 was last at over 800 ppm, there was no ice on Antarctica - CO2 levels had to drop to below that level to produce temperature conditions where glaciation began there. So if we get to that sort of CO2 value - about twice the current 400 ppm - the reverse would happen.
There's 58 metres of sea level rise in those ice sheets, before we even consider Greenland or other land-based ice masses.

It seems like the anglophone right have created a kind of ideological ecosystem where they can essentially believe whatever they want almost regardless of reality. If you convince yourself that anyone who disagrees with you or says something you don't want to hear is a Marxist and that everyone is arguing cynically with their only concern being their own self-interest, and if you create a network of information sources which give some kind of appearance of providing impartial fact-based information, then you can essentially believe whatever you want without having to worry too much about whether it's true.

In Westminster, our supposed leaders – men and women of mature vintage – keep stamping their feet and demanding what no one can give them.
They insist they should be allowed to gobble up all the birthday cake and still have cake left to eat, threatening to storm out of the European Union and slam the door behind them. As Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general, rightly puts it: “Threatening to leave is the behaviour of a three-year-old who says that they are going to hold their breath if they do not get the toy that they want.”
In Washington, meanwhile, Donald Trump, aged 72 and three-quarters, has screamed and screamed and screamed until he is sick, pounding his little fist on the table as he demands money for the big wall of bricks he wants to build, and today declaring a national emergency to get his way. The House speaker, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, assessed the situation accurately last month, when Trump was shutting down the government: “It’s a temper tantrum by the president. I’m the mother of five, grandmother of nine. I know a temper tantrum when I see one.”
But perhaps these comparisons are unfair – not to Trump or the Brexiters, but to children. Because while Trump has invented a wholly fake emergency – there is no threat of imminent invasion by migrants on the US’s southern border – and while the threat of a no-deal crashout from the EU is, if all too real, entirely avoidable via a simple vote of the House of Commons, it has fallen to children to point to the emergency that is neither fake nor easily averted. It has fallen to those so young they are not trusted to decide what they can eat or when they can go to bed to sound the alarm about the crisis that matters most: the crisis of the climate.
What are we to make of today’s strike by schoolchildren, in Britain and across the world, part of a rapidly growing movement aiming for a global walkout of kids on 15 March? How should we react to a phenomenon that began with a single child, a Stockholm teenager by the name of Greta Thunberg, who skipped class one Friday last August to sit in protest on the steps of the Swedish parliament, and which today saw primary-aged children, as well as teenagers, following her lead, wielding placards as they marched in Parliament Square and the streets of dozens of British towns and cities?
At first sight the reaction surely has to be one of unfettered joy. Many will share the enthusiasm of those veteran environmentalists hailing this as the most exciting, most hopeful development they have witnessed in decades of campaigning. A young generation so easily caricatured as disconnected and self-absorbed, heads tilted permanently downward towards their phones, Instagramming pictures of themselves, are instead taking a moral lead.
Liberal parents have been beside themselves with pride, bundling up their little ones in scarves and gloves as they watch them bunk off school to save the planet. I suspect there will be many Guardian readers who shared the dilemma I myself faced this week. Not whether to allow their kids to miss lessons in an exam year for the higher cause of tackling climate change: that one was a no-brainer. No, the dilemma I have in mind is rather more finely balanced. Should the conscientious liberal parent reveal their excitement about seeing their son or daughter take a stand, or should they pretend to disapprove, thereby supplying their young with the thrill of principled rebellion?
Teachers have grappled with the tension between the law, which says that children must be in school, and the obvious truth that this is a “teachable moment”, a learning experience. In fact, the law says children must be in school unless there are “exceptional circumstances”. As the country’s sole Green MP, Caroline Lucas, told me while marvelling at child protesters on the streets in her Brighton constituency: “When David Attenborough is warning that the future of civilisation is at risk, that counts as ‘exceptional circumstances’.” 
It’s not just the case against carbon emissions that this moment can teach. Thunberg is also demonstrating the power of the individual act. It’s so easy to feel impotent given the sheer scale of the climate crisis. But Thunberg, whose Twitter bio describes her as a “16-year-old climate activist with Asperger”, is the living embodiment of the case against defeatism. Rabbi Jonathan Wittenberg, an early and tireless environmental advocate, is right to say that the #FridaysForFuture movement is “not the first great change to begin with the action of just one person”: from Abraham onwards, our history and tradition is full of people who, alone at first, changed the world.
All of these are reasons to be heartened. And yet, there is a harsher truth to face. These demonstrations by the young are a terrible indictment of the rest of us. They are a mark of our failure. Their action is only necessary because we have failed to act. As one placard at the Belgian protests told politicians: “I’ll do my homework when you do yours.”
This week marked the first anniversary of the Parkland school shooting in Florida, a massacre of 17 that led to a mass movement of young Americans demanding gun control. That effort too is a product of failure, children having to act because adults have failed in their basic duty: to protect the young. There was great poignancy in Thunberg’s words to the UN climate change conference in Poland in December: “You are not mature enough to tell it like it is – even that burden you leave to us children.” Any delight, pride or joy we feel in these protests has to be tempered by the realisation of the adult world’s failure.
There’s a last question, one that feels unfair given the idealism written on the faces of these children. Will this effort work? The sceptic will say not, speculating that the attention of the young is a fickle thing, that this will be – as parents have told their kids through the ages – just a phase. They might also add that the powerful are very skilled at co-opting, and thereby often neutralising, the young: witness Thunberg’s recent invitation to Davos.
What’s more, polling suggests there’s not much in the way of heightened environmental consciousness among the young. According to Ipsos Mori, only 12% of 18- to 24-year-olds named the environment or pollution as an important, or the most important, issue facing the country – no higher or lower than the overall average. Ipsos Mori’s Ben Page reckons that until kids are blocking the roads in most towns, this latest effort “won’t cut through”.
I’m more hopeful than that. There are signs that the climate crisis is finally getting the attention it deserves. Watch would-be Democratic challengers to Trump in 2020 fall over themselves to embrace the “green New Deal”, a vision of transforming the economy to save the planet with appeal beyond those who have previously tended to prioritise the environment. Watch too the way the Extinction Rebellion has captured the imagination; or the reaction to news that the world’s insect population is plummeting, a destruction that threatens the collapse of nature itself.
Page warns that humans are exceptionally bad at spotting slow, long-term dangers: “We’re wired for sabre-toothed tigers,” he says. We can find it hard to envisage the future. The only way we can visualise it, perhaps, is through our children. When they tell us we are burning their future, as they are now, we have to overcome our shame at having failed them – and listen.

In a paper published this month by the American Geophysical Union, researchers say sharp rises in levels of methane – which is a powerful greenhouse gas – have strengthened over the past four years. Urgent action is now required to halt further increases in methane in the atmosphere, to avoid triggering enhanced global warming and temperature rises well beyond 2C.
“What we are now witnessing is extremely worrying,” said one of the paper’s lead authors, Professor Euan Nisbet of Royal Holloway, University of London. “It is particularly alarming because we are still not sure why atmospheric methane levels are rising across the planet.”
Methane is produced by cattle, and also comes from decaying vegetation, fires, coal mines and natural gas plants. It is many times more potent as a cause of atmospheric warming than carbon dioxide (CO2). However, it breaks down much more quickly than CO2 and is found at much lower levels in the atmosphere.
During much of the 20th century, levels of methane, mostly from fossil fuel sources, increased in the atmosphere but, by the beginning of the 21st century, it had stabilised, said Nisbet. “Then, to our surprise, levels starting rising in 2007. That increase began to accelerate after 2014 and fast growth has continued.”
Studies suggest these increases are more likely to be mainly biological in origin. However, the exact cause remains unclear. Some researchers believe the spread of intense farming in Africa may be involved, in particular in tropical regions where conditions are becoming warmer and wetter because of climate change. Rising numbers of cattle – as well as wetter and warmer swamps – are producing more and more methane, it is argued.
This idea is now being studied in detail by a consortium led by Nisbet, whose work is funded by the Natural Environment Research Council. This month the consortium completed a series of flights over Uganda and Zambia to collect samples of the air above these countries.
“We have only just started analysing our data but have already found evidence that a great plume of methane now rises above the wetland swamps of Lake Bangweul in Zambia,” added Nisbet.
However, other scientists warn that there could be a more sinister factor at work. Natural chemicals in the atmosphere – which help to break down methane – may be changing because of temperature rises, causing it to lose its ability to deal with the gas.
Our world could therefore be losing its power to cleanse pollutants because it is heating up, a climate feedback in which warming allows more greenhouse gases to linger in the atmosphere and so trigger even more warming.
It was assumed, in Paris, that dealing with methane levels in the atmosphere would be relatively easy.
In 2016, in Paris, nations agreed to cooperate to hold global temperature rises to 2C above preindustrial levels and, if possible, to keep that rise to under 1.5C. It was recognised that achieving this goal – mainly by curbing emissions of CO2 from fossil fuels – would always be difficult to achieve. Accelerating increases in a different greenhouse gas, methane, means that this task is going to be much, much harder.
This point was backed by Martin Manning of Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand. “Methane is the gas ... that keeps us to a 2C rise in global temperatures. And even more significantly, we do not really know why.”
If nothing can be done about this, he added, then even more cuts will have to be made in CO2 emissions. Continued increases in methane levels will only make this situation worse, he said.
This point was backed by Nisbet. “It was assumed, at the time of the Paris, agreement, that reducing the amount of methane in the atmosphere would be relatively easy and that the hard work would involve cutting CO2 emissions.
“However, that does not look so simple any more. We don’t know exactly what is happening.
“Perhaps emissions are growing or perhaps the problem is due to the fact that our atmosphere is losing its ability to break down methane.
“Either way we are facing a very worrying problem. That is why it is so important that we unravel what is going on – as soon as possible.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/17/methane-levels-sharp-rise-threaten-paris-climate-agreement

The British NGO Tearfund is working in the country to improve the collection and disposal of waste and the Department for International Development has agreed to match each donation given to the NGO, up to £2m.
Nearly a third of people in Pakistan live below the poverty line and rubbish is one of their biggest challenges. Uncollected waste builds up in rivers and causes flooding, which can lead to diarrhoea and infectious diseases.
An alternative method of waste disposal is to burn it in the streets, which poses a health threat and contributes to climate change.
With the help of the UK government’s aid match scheme, the charity is extending its work in Pakistan’s slums and creating recycling hubs.
Ashraf Mall, Tearfund’s representative for Pakistan, said: “Pakistan produces more than 20m tonnes of rubbish each year and in cities like Karachi, two-fifths remains uncollected. The generous funding from the UK government will allow us to transform the daily lives of people living in Karachi and Hyderabad.”
The UK’s international development secretary, Penny Mordaunt, said: “Tearfund’s appeal will play a vital role in helping communities across Pakistan recycle plastic waste, stopping it from ending up in the country’s water supply.
“This work will not only improve the health of generations of people, it will also create jobs and prosperity while reducing harmful plastic waste and pollution.”
Inefficient management of rubbish in the developing world is a growing problem, with 2 billion people worldwide lacking access to regular waste collection.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/18/uk-government-recycling-bases-pakistan

Not from the point of view of being able to go home with a warm feeling in their tummies but because it was important to stand up and be counted. I'm guessing this is partly a holdover from the days of Franco but I despair a bit of the lack of imagination or community that this protest has revealed in people. It's like we think what's the point if we don't get what we want straight away. Or you can't change things. The truth is that our country has changed so much in the past few generations but this has been against the interests of the many or if not then towards the interests of the few. (and I say this independent of the current political slogan but it does have a ring to it)No. Not everybody on the demo will have a pragmatic approach on how to solve the problem but neither should they have to.

Meanwhile, out there in the real world... Offshore wind power cheaper than new nuclear
BQENDSomewhat revealing that you have to compare the cost of FOAK/New nuclear with the price of offshore wind being installed in 2022/3.
The price of offshore wind currently being commissioned is:
Hornsea 1 is just coming online this week at a cost of £155.53/MWh https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/11/biggest-offshore-windfarm-to-start-uk-supply-this-weekIn 2022 there's Neart na Gaoithe offshore.. at a cost of £127.21/MWh
That's a lot more expensive than nuclear, even the very expensive First Of a Kind reactor, Hinkley point-C.
The current bid price for non FOAK new nuclear is £75/MWh, pretty much identical to the 2022 price for offshore wind at Triton Knoll.Even more are 'new' Thames Array at £220/MWh or the Swansea Tidal Lagoon proposal at £123/MWh index linked for 90 years!
If you're going to use Hinkley point-C (a baseload plant) as your nuclear benchmark then you'll have to use FOAK offshore wind as its level... and not forget[!] to add the cost of intermittency, which UKERC say is up to an additional £45/MWh for just a 50% penetration of your preferred intermittent supply.

Why are these men considered to be at their political peak? I speak as a nan myself. Will I be running for office in 15 years’ time?
The blokes who govern the “free” world were brought into sharp relief by last week’s strike against climate change. My God, it was something. Suddenly in my house and on TV screens there were angry, informed teenage girls – and yes, it was mostly girls – talking about how we have just 12 years to do something. They were passionate, articulate and unafraid. Their energy was contagious. The fact they were having a fabulous time at a protest was inspiring and all the daft criticism about bunking off came from the zombie class such as Andrea Leadsom and various dullard rentagobs who don’t even seem to understand what school is: an hour a day of learning followed by hours of crowd control. But then I guess bunking off is as outre as running through fields of wheat for these alien suck-ups.
I am not pretending to be down with the kids – that is an entirely pointless exercise – but I do wonder about the way generational differences are playing out at the moment. The denunciation of the protests by the right wing is also a refusal to take climate change seriously. It is an entirely blinkered view. This “I’m all right, Jack” attitude is fine, I suppose, if you don’t have children or grandchildren who you would like to be able to breathe, and not be subject to the breakdown of society that climate change inevitably brings. What links those currently attacking the kids is not age but a certain political word view. Being rightwing makes you disturbingly ancient, somehow. Yes, I know the cliches about young folk being liberal until they are 30, when their heads take over from their hearts; or the US political writer Irving Kristol saying that a conservative “is a liberal mugged by reality”. The idea is that, as we get older, we become more conservative.
What actually seems to make people more conservative, from my observation, is becoming parents; what makes them fearful of change and social liberalism is the lack of money and choice, which brings a clinging to familiar structures. None of this is properly addressed by just shouting at old people to die soon, which is one of the tactics of some remainers. The divvying up of the generations ultimately amounts to some seemingly advocating a cull as the solution to Brexit: old, illiberal people voted for it and they will die out. But none of this speaks to the interdependence of generations, the fact that we live in an era in which adult children share parental homes, in which job opportunities have diminished in many areas of the country and further education has been decimated. Bringing the country together means just that. When youth bursts through, of course we cheer: whether its Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the US, or our own stroppy girls in the UK.
I cannot wait for these people to grab the reins of power. I neither want the closed and aged mindsets of the Tories banging on about wars they didn’t fight, nor the inflexibility of old Labour men obsessed with revolutions that produced dictators. Ageing is a fact, but open minds stay youthful. Those with old ideas need to get out of the way.

As others have pointed out, the numbers flatly contradict the idea that population growth is driving emissions.
The richest 10% of the world's population emit 50% of the CO2, and the poorest 50% emit 10%. You could reduce the world's population by half and be left with 90% of the problem.
Population growth does contribute to CO2 emissions, obviously, but the problem is chronic, whereas the intensity of consumption by the richest 10% is an acute threat to our climate.', u'recommendation_count': u'3', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1550683079000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'2484923', u'in_reply_to': u'126086162', u'id': u'126120196', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'sharethewealth', u'text': u'BQSTART

I simply cannot believe that 99% of bands and singers continue to make music as usual, and in the case of pop and rap with completely narcissistic lyrics, while we have several acute way-of-life-changing crises going on.

Back then, he was still a student, and a little nervous – but he could sense the future. Now, Comte’s recent works incorporating black carbon fallout from the jet stream, shown in Rome, Milan and Hong Kong, prove just how right he was to speak out.
Comte’s message was echoed last week in the UK, when thousands of schoolchildren – inspired by 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg – took to the streets to pressure the government into taking action on climate change. Like Comte, they have seen a bleak future ahead and are speaking out.
Sadly, that hasn’t been the case for most artistic and cultural institutions, which have spent the last few decades responding to climate change with little more than silence. They have been dangerously complicit in desensitising society to what’s really at stake.
It hasn’t always been this way. In the mid-90s, when a post-Chernobyl generation made its voice heard, the ecological protest movement was nurtured by critical theatre, radical art shows, public debate and avant garde music. Then something changed. In response to the backlash against fossil fuels, major energy suppliers became involved with arts sponsorship. This was no harmless philanthropy. Parallel to the rise of the blockbuster exhibition the importance of Shell and BP to the artistic budget of arts centres grew, to a point where many major national institutions were on the payroll of the fossil fuel giants. Some still are today.
For decades arts institutions have effectively engaged in self-censorship, denying us a debate on fossil fuels
But even for those who have freed themselves of it (or exchanged them for carmakers), the damage to a generation has been done. For decades arts institutions have effectively engaged in self-censorship to pay for their productions, putting on amazing programming and covering critical topics, as long as it wasn’t a thorough debate of our addiction to fossil fuels. This strategic exclusion of a topic from public debate over more than a generation has led to ignorance, with repercussions in education, academic and public life.
But there is hope in the air. Tate Modern have an Olafur Eliasson retrospective scheduled for this summer – his Ice Watch project was recently invited to melt away outside the museum, with the carbon impact of each block accounted for. As for Comte, he is about to board a sailing boat for a challenging passage to the Arctic, creating a monumental light installation calling for us to change our ways before it’s too late. If we allow more artists such as these to become part of the conversation, we will have a culture fit for the generation of children who took to our streets.
Nuclear fallout, rising sea levels and … nail clippingsWhen artist Yi Dai opened her first solo show in Berlin, she received rapturous reviews praising her subtle and intelligent coverage of environmental topics. Misfits, Offcuts and Castaways, in 2016, was an urgent statement reflecting on the aftereffects of nuclear fallout and rising sea temperatures, and the fragility of our ecosystem. Her exhibition was as much a personal account of her experience on the Marshall Islands as it was a call to action following the then-warmest winter in recorded history. Her show, Discarded… During My 20s (at House of Egorn in Berlin until 23 February), explores the subject of the human body: the artist juxtaposes bodily remains – hair, nail clippings, blood – with construction materials such as steel, concrete and glass that surround, contain, or reflect our bodies.
Sailing to the Arctic for a climate vigilWavelength Foundation was formed on a sailing boat in late 2017 by an international group of journalists, writers, environmentalists, cultural workers, artists and scientists. One of the foundation’s fundamental principles is that a rich and meaningful cultural engagement with nature is needed to readjust their lost relationship. Comte will soon set sail to the Arctic with the foundation for his large-scale 3D-mapping light installation Black Light, inviting sailors from around the globe to join his monumental climate vigil. Meanwhile, the foundation’s Change Maker scheme is helping to build a sustainable arts and culture centre in South America, to bring the opportunities of a circular economy to the lives of children and younger people looking to escape the cycle of poverty.
Remembering Earth before the cataclysmsParis-based artist Nadine Rotem-Stibbe explores environmental issues with a keen eye for design. Her installation In Loving Memory, 2018, 0.8°C, a collaboration with Ryan Cherewaty, can be found at an abandoned building site at the Ebbingekwartier of Groningen, the Netherlands. It takes a part mocking, part melancholic view of our time, looking back from a fictitious (yet by no means unrealistic) future in which a large cache of archaeological objects has been uncovered in the Trans-European floodplain. The artefacts offer an unprecedented look into human life in 2018, prior to the great cataclysms that struck. There is a profound obsession with objects created from the industrial processing of complex carbon-chain polymers – plastics – an industry that was a key factor in heavily increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. These objects seem to have survived extreme climate changes and offer a glimpse into our perplexing culture. 
The art school on the edge of the worldPerched on the shore of a sea loch and overlooking the Minch and the hills of Harris and Skye, Lews Castle College in the Outer Hebrides has been referred to as the “art school on the edge of the world.” Sustainability is a key element to the teaching, with students responding to the environment and the unique wilderness of the unusual location. The college hosts talks from practitioners across a range of areas, from marine biologists and archaeologists to traditional makers working with natural materials. Part of the college building is the site of a recently commissioned light installation by Finnish artists Timo Aho and Pekka Niittyvirta, which interacts with the tidal changes, activating on high tide. The work provides a visual reference of future sea level rises and explores the catastrophic long-term impact of our relationship with nature.
Mountain biking through our tumultuous weatherTales of Change brings together stories of how climate change is impacting communities in some of the planet’s most iconic mountain ranges. Its protagonist, Florian Reber, cycled across the Alps, starting in Trieste on the Adriatic coast and arriving in Cannes, at the Mediterranean Sea. Along the way, he talked with farmers, foresters, conservationists, tourism experts, alpinists and professional athletes, psychologists, writers and journalists about climate change. Periods of tumultuous weather extremes are the consistent findings, including a pronounced drought that left many rivers and sources in the southern Dolomites dried out. This was followed by the strongest föhn storms in recent years, causing record temperatures in October 2018. Next came torrential rain and strong winds brought about by cyclone Vaia, uprooting thousands of trees and causing casualties. While this trip involved cycling 1,180 miles, climbing more than 35,000 vertical metres and mastering two dozen mountain passes in winter, the intrepid explorer is now getting ready to widen his reach towardsthe Rocky Mountains and Himalayas. The project has been on display in Switzerland and Italy but, like Reber, is constantly moving. 
Solar robots transforming snow back into glaciersHoused in Barcelona’s magnificent historical pavilion Sant Cosme y Sant Damià, Quo Artis is an international non-profit organisation dedicated to advancing the dialogue between arts, science and technology. Recent activity includes Glaciator, an art installation in Antarctica composed of solar robots that help to compact and crystallise the snow by turning it into ice, then adhering it to the glacier mass. As glacial melting is one of the most alarming effects of global warming, the mission of these robots is to accelerate the ice formation process, allowing glaciers to regain the mass they have lost as a result of the thaw. 
The old furniture factory where ‘waste is a failure of the imagination’This 1930s furniture factory, in southern Sweden, is being turned into one of the most exciting places for interdisciplinary research and innovation in sustainability. The brainchild of former gallerist David Risley, the hub brings culture together with science, philosophy, free thinking and business, and is scheduled to open in summer 2020. With more than 12,000 square metres of open-plan space set over several floors, Funkisfabriken could become a test bed for new sustainable approaches. “Waste is a failure of imagination,” reads its founding slogan. Located a short walk from the botanist Carl Linnaeus’s house and garden, the space will feature an array of labs (wet, dry, clean and dirty), an urban farm, a circular economy centre, and conference facility, exhibition spaces and sculpture parks – not to mention a hotel, indoor garden and a zero-waste restaurant set up by Doug McMaster of the Brighton restaurant Silo.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/feb/20/artists-fighting-climate-change

Donald Trump’s staff have drafted an executive order to establish a Presidential Committee on Climate Security, according to reports from the Washington Post and New York Times. It would include senior aide William Happer, a Princeton physicist who has suggested – in conflict with the vast majority of climate scientists – that higher levels of carbon dioxide are beneficial.
A recent assessment from the national intelligence director, Daniel Coats, called climate change a significant security risk, the Post noted.
Under former president Barack Obama in 2014, the Pentagon said climate change posed “immediate risks” to national security and laid out plans for boosting resilience and readiness as seas rise, disasters intensify and drought exacerbates instability around the world.
However, Trump and his cabinet have dismissed several federal government reports that said climate change is worsening and already threatens public health and the economy in the US.
“I don’t believe it,” Trump said in November. His agencies have suggested that the reports are based on the worst-case scenario, although the scientists who wrote them said they project what could happen based on current trends.
Trump’s former environment administrator, Scott Pruitt, long planned to host debates on climate science but was thwarted by some White House staff. Happer helped create a list of possible participants for that debate, according to emails obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.
In 2017, Happer told the Scientist that climate change research has become a “cult movement”.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/20/white-house-climate-change-national-security-panel

Scientists believe the “astonishing” drop in bogong moth numbers is linked to climate change and recent droughts in areas where the moths breed.
At the same time checks on the endangered mountain pygmy possum, which exists only in Australia’s alpine regions, have revealed dead litters in the pouches of females. The moths are a key food source for the possums as they wake from hibernation.
In 2018, scientists revealed bogong moths were the only known insect to use the earth’s magnetic field to help them navigate from grasslands in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland – sometimes at distances of 1,000km. Around two billion moths are estimated to make the journey.
The ecologist Dr Ken Green has been monitoring bogong moths for 40 years. He said: “Last summer numbers were atrocious. It was not just really bad, it was the worst I had ever seen. Now this year it’s got even worse.”
The moths find caves and cracks in boulders to hide away in a torpor state. A cave at Mount Gingera, near Canberra, has been known to house millions of the moths but last month Green and colleagues counted just three individuals. Searches of about 50 known sites have turned up similar catastrophic absences.
“They haven’t just declined. They’ve gone,” he said. “We have done mountains from down to the Victorian border all the way to Canberra. We have checked every cave we know.”
A site at South Ramshead in the Snowy Mountains in New South Wales had just 1,000 moths last year. “That is very, very low,” says Green.
“This year we found just six moths. Last week we went back and there were none.”
Green believes the cause of the crash is drought in the moth’s breeding areas. The Bureau of Meteorology has said the drought was exceptional in those areas, but noted there had been similar dry periods in the 1960s and earlier. 
Dean Heinze, an associate at Latrobe University, has been monitoring and researching mountain pygmy possums since the early 1990s. The possum populations are spread across Kosciuszko national park in New South Wales, and in Victoria at Mount Bogong, Mount Higginbotham and Mount Buller.
As the possums emerge from hibernation in September and October, the moths are a key food source as they breed and raise young.
“Bogong moths are an incredible food source and very high in protein. Last year we found that some populations of possums were losing litters. It’s happening again this year. We think that the fewer moths means the possums are carrying less weight and losing the litters.”
In recent weeks Heinze has visited about 12 locations in Victoria and discovered dead litters in female pouches at “most of the sites.”
“It’s a widespread event,” he said. “I inspect the reproductive system of the animal and I look in their pouch to see how many young there are. I have been opening pouches and discovering dead and decomposing young ... For some, the young have been dead for days.
“The concern is that over time, if this happens more frequently we will see declines in the adult population as well. And this is the second year that they have lost litters. The litmus test will be next season.”
Around Mount Buller in Victoria, the possum habitat is fragmented by ski resorts. Captive breeding and release programs have been used to keep numbers up.
“We have put a huge effort into the population at Mount Buller,” says Heinze. “We have brought the population back from the brink and now we have this happening. I’m optimistic, but if we get more of this then it doesn’t look good. Here we are dealing with a species that only occurs in the alps, but what’s impacting it is happening hundreds of kilometres away.”
In 2016, a national recovery plan was agreed for the possum, outlining multiple threats including habitat degradation, predation by invasive cats and foxes and climate change.
A study published in October 2018 and led by scientists at the New South Wales Office of Environment and Heritage looked at the climate change threats to the possums and the moths. The study suggested the moths had a “reduced survival in a warmer world” and this would “likely further affect survival” of the possums.
Prof Lesley Hughes, an ecologist at Macquarie University and councillor at the Climate Council of Australia, said the potential role of climate change in the decline of the moths and possums were what ecologists and climate scientists had predicted.
“Unfortunately the general predictions of the ecological risks of climate change are now turning into observations for particular species. And it should be no surprise we are seeing these impacts in the alpine zone, long recognised as one of the most vulnerable ecosystems to climate risks.
“Sometimes these changes can appear to happen abruptly – one year there are millions of moths and the next almost none. This shows how particular extreme events, such as droughts or severe bushfires, can suddenly tip a species over the edge, with flow-on effects to others in the ecosystem.”
The environment minister, Melissa Price, said she was aware of the reports of low bogong moth numbers and the government was working with a leading possum researcher “to understand the potential toll that reduced number of moths may be having on the species”.
The removal of feral cats and foxes in Kosciusko national park was helping possum protection, she said, and two government-backed projects were tackling weed infestations, building resilience to climate change, and managing loss of genetic diversity among possums in the Victorian Alpine region.
Victoria’s Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning spokesperson Adrian Moorrees said the reduction in moths “is likely to be due to recent droughts” in NSW and Queensland.
He said tools and processes were being developed “to better monitor and predict the impact of bogong moth populations on endangered mountain pygmy possums.”
A spokesperson for the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage said no litter deaths were reported in NSW possum populations, but the drought was believed to have impacted most species.
He said when moth numbers were low, possums turned to other food sources, including insects, fruits and nectar, adding “OEH will continue to implement the species recovery plans for the mountain pygmy possum.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/25/decline-in-bogong-moth-numbers-leaves-pygmy-mountain-possums-starving

Pollution is the presence in or introduction into the environment of a substance which has harmful or poisonous effects.
Most harmful or poisonous effects due to substances are dose dependent. Lead levels in the soil of my suburban street are lower than lead levels in the copper/lead ore mining town of Mount Isa. My neighbours' kids can dig in their back yards without risk of poisoning. This is not the case in The Isa where human activities have added much more lead to the soil than they did in my street increasing the levels of lead in parts per million in the soil that kids play in.
The burning of fossil fuels has added more CO2 to the Earth's atmosphere increasing the level of atmospheric CO2 to more than 400 ppm causing an increased greenhouse effect which has so far warmed the global climate by about 1 degree C resulting in climate changes which have been harmful.
Just as the introduction of lead into the environment has been shown to be harmful to growing children in Mount Isa, the introduction of CO2 into the global atmosphere has also been shown to be harmful to people and ecosystems around the globe. Therefore CO2 is a pollutant at its current atmospheric levels and rate of introduction into the environment.
""It might be a greenhouse gas, but it is not pollution.""
It is a greenhouse gas. That's a fact, and because it's an effective and long lived greenhouse gas, it has caused harm when introduced into the environment at current levels and its introduction is therefore a form of pollution.
""We put CO2 in fizzy drinks. It hasn't killed anyone yet.""
I like to eat Macadamia nuts with my fizzy gin and tonic. These nuts are native to the dry rainforest near where I live. There are four species - M. integrifolia, M. ternifolia, M. tetraphylla and M. jansenii. All four species contain cyanide but the level of cyanide in the first three is too low to be harmful. Not so with M. jansenii, which means you need to know which species you're gathering huts from in the rainforest.
The rate at which my G&T releases CO2 to the atmosphere of the room I'm in is not harmful as it does not raise the level of CO2 in the room to levels which are harmful to me. Nor does it raise the net level of CO2 in the atmosphere as my tonic water manufacturer sourced their CO2 from BOC Gas who removed it from the atmosphere.
However, the burning if fossil fuels has raised the level of CO2 in the atmosphere to a level which is harmful because of the global warming and consequent climate change it has caused. Over 400 ppm CO2 won't directly affect you but 40,000 ppm will cause you physiological distress and over 70,000 ppm will kill you in minutes. Such levels are found in some mines and caves. I once decided not to explore a new cave with CO2 around 30,000 ppm and large loose boulders above a small ravine. I didn't fancy being pinned beneath a boulder in the stream at bottom of the ravine where CO2 was possibly over 40,000 ppm.
The harm caused by pollutants is concentration or dose dependent and CO2 is no exception.

Not much could have been expected from the government given that the prime minister has only been in the role six months, and not much was delivered.
There is not a lot of detail around the total package, the $3.5bn cash splash. What we have is enough to make clear that this is not the climate policy solution that the government thinks it is.
The emissions reduction fund is a pool of money that the commonwealth government uses to buy “carbon abatement” from private parties around the country. This carbon abatement occurs when an organisation takes some action to avoid or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. For instance, a waste company could capture and burn off the methane from its landfills, or a farmer might draw greenhouses gases from out of the atmosphere, by planting trees. At present 26 different methods of abating our emissions are at play under government contracts.
The current funding allocated to the scheme is $2.55bn. About $2.33bn of that money has been allocated to projects already over the ERF’s eight auctions. A little over $480 million has been paid to those running the projects so far.
The government claims that the fund will provide 193 million tonnes of abatement between 2015 and 2028, an average of about 14 million tonnes per year. Those numbers may seem big, but that’s about one third of the emissions per year from Australia’s largest emitter, AGL.
Among a suite of measures announced by the government on Monday was a $2bn boost to the emissions reduction fund, as well as a rebrand. The climate solutions fund will use the same mechanism as the emissions reduction fund and will spend $200m per year over the next 10 years to offset our emissions.
If that funding arrives, and the average price stays the same as recent auctions, that mechanism will deliver approximately 90 million tonnes of abatement in the next decade, with a further 60 million tonnes being delivered after 2030.
That’s a big if. While the government’s headline figure is $2bn, at most only $600m of that will be delivered in the next term of government.
Ignoring the fact that there are many better and more legitimate ways to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions than by direct investment from the government, the ERF fails on its own terms through a series of bespoke issues across the methods.
These have been reported over the past four years and provided a picture of a deeply flawed scheme.
For example, research published by myself and a colleague at Melbourne Law School and reported in the Guardian found that most projects contracted under the ERF’s landfill gas method predate the scheme – some by more than a decade. The fund is supposed to drive new abatement. This is expressly in the goals of the scheme itself. The ERF provides little benefit to the environment by funding these old projects, and the funding is rapidly converted into shareholder dividends.
The revegetation methods while generally robust will be dwarfed by land-clearing elsewhere in Australia. The ERF has secured commitments to deliver 111 million tonnes from revegetation projects across Australia over 2015-2028. Research out of ANU estimates that Australia’s recent land-clearing rates have been releasing up to 38 million tonnes per year. We wouldn’t need to invest this money at all if Australia could get its land-clearing under control.
Another story on Monday revealed that major polluters such as the Granny Smith Gold Mine are being paid by the ERF to switch out one form of fossil fuelled power for another. This is occurring even though the proponents themselves indicated that the funding played no role in their decision to upgrade. Again, this runs counter to the express goals of the fund, which is supposed to drive new emissions abatement opportunities, rather than subsidise project activity that may have occurred anyway.
These problems have pervaded the ERF and will continue into the new climate solutions fund.
Australia is blessed with opportunity when it comes to dealing with climate change. We are the sunniest and windiest inhabited continent in the world, with ample opportunities to build our renewables as well as the necessary infrastructure to support them (such as batteries).
We have incredible potential to reduce our emissions across the country, with analysis released last year from Reputex showing that even Labor’s higher goal of -45% below 2005 levels by 2030 can be reduced on a cost negative basis.
We need to do so much more than accounting tricks and the direct purchase of spurious abatement.
The IPCC’s special report on a 1.5-degree target, released last year made it clear that to have a moderately safe climate, things will be far easier if we start now. The precipitous declines in our emissions that will be needed if we wait until after 2030 are something that I struggle to believe possible.
But if we start now, a relatively safe climate future is achievable. Despite the hyperbole thrown around in certain sectors of the media, and by certain politicians, it is not economy-wrecking, too hard, or not worth it.
More importantly, it is entirely necessary. The world where we choose not to act to prevent the worst of climate change is not looking great.

During the Howard government, Fisher headed up its agriculture, energy and resource economics analysis agency ABARE (now the Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics). 
Working first for Charles River and Associates and then Concept Economics he was paid by the oil and gas industry, electricity generators and the mining industry, each separately, to paint grim pictures of the economic consequences from government efforts to reduce carbon emissions in the near term.

There is a mean budget of 600 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon dioxide left to emit before the planet warms dangerously, by more than 1.5-2.0 °C. Stretching the budget to 800 Gt buys another 10 years but at a greater risk of exceeding the temperature limit.
If we exceed the 1.5-2.0 °C limit positive feedbacks will very rapidly send the planets temperature to more than 5 °C above current and there is no going back. 
This is the sort of temperatures the Earth had in the Permian Extinction where 95% of all species died 250 million years ago. 
It is not a matter of political ideology. It is a matter of survival.
The majority of known coal, oil and gas reserves MUST stay in the ground. Otherwise it is game over.
If you do not understand this graph then you did not pay attention at school.
We are headed for end of empire stuff folks and there will be nothing left for the barbarian victors as our life support system called Earth will be uninhabitable for most forms of life.
There are millionaires and billionaires buying bunkers that are so called self supporting and underground so that they will be immune to the dystopian future they all know is coming.
They are fools if they think they can ride out a 100,000 year uninhabitable planet.
They have guns and everything to keep out the marauding hordes. I wish them luck with that false hope.
The idiocy and ignorance shown by some contributors here and I use the term loosely is a sight to behold. Do you people go out of your way to prove how stupid you all are? Or are you really that stupid? No need to answer as your pathetic posts convict yourselves.

I guess we should be grateful that at least the government now realises it needs to look as if it gives a damn about reducing emissions, because for a while they couldn’t even be bothered to do that.
But stuff it. I’m done with giving out prizes for pretence. I’m done with being satisfied with something not even worthy of being called a fourth-best policy. I’m done with the lies.
Do not for one second think this is a policy designed to reduce emissions. It is a political Band-Aid while the actual wound to our economy from its greenhouse gas dependency is open and festering.
It is a fraud, and not even a new one.
It’s the same bulldust that the Liberal National party has been selling the public for nigh on a decade with a different badge. Gone is the Emissions Reduction Fund; say hello to the “Climate Solutions Fund”.
This fund of $2bn over 10 years is not just a rebranding of Tony Abbot’s Direct Action, it is actually a diminishment of it. At $200m a year on average it is less than half the money a year that was spent on Direct Action – a policy that was so laughably bad that a government with any level of shame would quietly have dumped it and pretended it never happened.
Yet, here we are. Nine years after Lenore Taylor ripped apart the Liberal party’s policy of reliance on “soil magic”, we have the prime minister still thinking such measures of carbon sequestration are worth pursuing and will achieve anything close to what is required.
But before we go further, let’s bring out the graphs again.
First the one showing annual greenhouse gas emissions going back to 2004. You’ve seen it before, it shows that yes, a price on carbon reduces emissions:
The next one shows the most recent projections for our emissions. These are the government’s own figures. And they show we are a long way from being on target to reduce emissions by either 26% or 28% below 2005 levels:
So we have that reality, but the prime minister says we will meet the target “in a canter”. Why? Because our target will also include “carryover credits” which comes from exceeding our Kyoto reduction commitment.
That might be defensible if our Kyoto commitment did not already include some dodgy work involving the counting of land use, land-use change and forestry, which allowed us to reach our target even if we actually increased our emissions.
It means we are using dodgy counting of previous dodgy counting to meet our targets.
The University of Melbourne’s Dylan McConnell estimates over half of the reduction will come via this trick accounting method, while 15% will come via “technology improvements and other sources of abatement” which is code for, “dunno, but here’s hoping someone does something good, in spite of our efforts”.
But you don’t really need to be told the ins and outs of this policy. You know it is a terrible joke on us all – the suggestion that we can do what is needed on climate change by spending a mere $200m a year.
With annual GDP of around $1,950bn, that represents just 0.01% this year, and because our GDP will grow, by 2030, $200m will be a mere 0.006% of GDP.
Now let us look at our emissions compared with other nations in the OECD:
Yes, the United States emits a lot more than we do, but when you look at per capita and per GDP you see how integral greenhouse gas emissions are to our economy. Australia is basically the most carbon-dependent economy in the OECD.
It means it is going to be tougher for us to reduce our emissions than it is for other nations.
Yet the government would have you believe it can all be done painlessly. Just write a cheque for a mere $200m a year – less than is spent on SBS each year, and we’re done?
Do you really think that governments around the world have been avoiding action on climate change for the past three decades because they would have to spend this pathetic amount?
If that was all that was needed, we wouldn’t even be worrying. It would have been done.
The reality is cutting emissions is going to be tough. We are finally paying the bill for 200 years of gorging on carbon for free; and the bill is large.
We need to be honest about this. If it was easy – anywhere near as easy as what Scott Morrison or Tony Abbott or Josh Frydenberg would have you believe – it would have already been done. The reason it hasn’t is because it is bloody hard.
But it needs to happen and I have a few graphs to illustrate why.
First, the average annual temperature over the past 60 years:
Remember when all the climate-change deniers (for deniers they are) said 1998 was the hottest year and the planet had not warmed since then? Well the temperature anomaly of the past five years have averaged almost 40% more than what was reached in that year.
What if we extrapolated out the 20-year trend since 1998 into the future? If we use an absurdly conservative linear trend we reach 2C above pre-industrial levels by 2066 – just 47 years time.
But if we use a more realistic exponential trend line, we get there by 2049. A point at which my 15-year-old daughter would be the same age I am now:
Enough with the lies and fraudulent policy. It is beyond time for politicians to be honest with us. Action on climate change will be tough, and we need to stop pretending it can be done with ease.
What we don’t need is this current putrid policy from the government. They have shown they cannot get serious about the issue; it’s time they got out of the way.

Yes, I agree with your point about day to day weather events being 'noise' superimposed on a long term climate trend.
I guess the answer to my original question is that, whilst, a single weather event in isolation means little, a statistically significant number of weather events, even in different locations, are significant.

Extremely warm days for February in Britain or extreme rainfall events such as the recent Townsville and North West Queensland floods are signs to start watching for patterns.

Partly this is what people are getting at when they say climate is always changing. The point they often miss is that a lot of noise in no way means you can't also have a long-term trend. Take a regular sine-wave and tilt it up at one end.
Over a large enough scale (time or area) the noise drops away - zoom out of your sine-wave far enough and it would look like a straight line going up. The difficulty is when you're riding those bumps in real time, it's hard to separate the noise from the trend. Often the best you can do is look at the change of probabilities - how much more often does the sine wave reach this high because it is tilted.
To take a different analogy, in a recession a lot of businesses might go bust. At the national level the increase in closures is a clear signal of the economy. But if you walk through town and point to one particular business, maybe it would have closed anyway; maybe it was badly run or taken over or the sector was failing. Can you say one event was caused by the recession? Maybe not. But you can say the recession caused a lot of this kind of event.
There comes a point when the trend outrides the noise; when the sine wave reaches higher than its non-tilted partner ever could; when the most established bankable business in town goes to the wall... or when you have 20C days in February(?).

Would it have been a record anyway? Undoubtedly there is a climate change driven warming trend underlying the weather.

But a recent experiment in the US suggests a dose of climate change news with the weather forecast is no bad thing.
Seventy per cent of Americans think climate change is a distant risk, and 40% believe it will not have any impact on them. Yet its effects are increasingly being felt close to home, with wildfires in California, a “snow drought” in the Pacific Northwest and the recent spell of extreme winter weather across much of the country. Can TV weather forecasters help undo some of the misconceptions?
To answer this, scientists at George Mason University in Virginia analysed viewers’ reactions to weather forecasters explaining local climate change. More than two-thirds of viewers were interested, and even climate change deniers failed to be irritated or angered by the coverage.
Previous research has shown that people are more receptive to pro-climate policies when they realise climate change is happening to them.

The people in short sleeves or sandals. The ones with sunglasses ostentatiously hanging from the front of their shirts or balanced on top of their heads. The beer gardens and riverside pubs of the capital were heaving; corner shops ran out of ice-cream. Outside it was 17C (62F).
Monday was another warm day, without a cloud in the sky, and in the late afternoon the light took on a magical, honey-coloured hue. It brought to mind one of those summer evenings you remember from childhood, when you’d be in the park all day and your parents let you stay out until bedtime, and you felt like you were doing something deliciously naughty just by being there.
Except it isn’t early summer: it’s February. And the entire developed world has not so much been doing something slightly naughty as systematically attacking the global ecosystem over a period of decades, and that’s how we go into this mess.
We should try to hold on to this fact as young, posh men the nation over develop a strange delusion that anyone would want to see their elbows; this is not supposed to be happening. Less than a month ago, there was video footage of extreme cold weather coming out of Chicago. Forks supported in midair by suddenly frozen noodles, water poured from kettles instantly freezing on its way to the ground: you know the sort of thing. OK, that was on the other side of the world, and was extreme and terrifying enough. But at least it was terrifying in the right direction.
On Monday, though, the temperature hit 20.3C in Ceredigion, west Wales: the highest February temperature ever recorded in Britain and the first time the thermometer had breached 20C in winter. The BBC weather account tweeted it out with a gif of the sunshine icon and the same excitable breathlessness with which Springwatch would announce it had found a new type of vole. My response contained a single word, repeated seven times. It began with F.
Because this isn’t good, is it? However enjoyable the unreasonable sunshine feels, whatever feeling of relief it instils in you after weeks of grey sky and Brexit, the idea of beach temperatures in February should be scaring the living shit out of you. It shouldn’t be possible to wander round London half-naked in February without bits of you falling off. There is a fairly direct inverse correlation between your ability to go out without a jacket at this latitude in winter and a polar bear’s likelihood of surviving the winter – yet the population of Britain wandered round with their shirts undone looking pleased with themselves. Nation of animal lovers my arse. Something has gone wrong.
John Lanchester’s latest novel, The Wall, portrays a dystopian, post-climate change Britain in which the entire country has been walled off to prevent “others”, from the ruined, flooded world beyond, getting in. The young resent the old because the change happened on their watch; the state kills with ease, and slavery has returned. But it is set in a place that is still recognisable as this country, in which people go to pubs, get pissed, commute on crowded railway lines and think the Lake District is a nice place to go. It’s a vision that’s haunting precisely because it is so banal. You can believe in this future. The world is ruined, and the British people have conspired as much as possible to ignore the fact.
The country’s response to this unseasonably warm spell suggests Lanchester may be on to something. The 20 hottest years on record have all happened within the past 22 years; the five hottest were the last five. Yet the beaches and the beer gardens fill up, while the papers describe the weather as glorious and expend more words on the latest Westminster soap opera than on the looming climate crisis. The thing about an environmental apocalypse is that it doesn’t have a face.
There were those on Sunday who gave in to the heatwave a little too easily. They let themselves forget it was winter and found themselves, when the sun went down and the temperature dropped, suddenly shivering and unprepared for the cold. It feels uncomfortably like a metaphor.

The 21.3 C degrees Tuesday record in London was mentioned because of the effect it had on the large number of people in that city but the scientists conclusions were not based on that record.
As scientists have already used unbiased readings to establish the reality of global warming and published their findings in numerous scientific papers and IPCC reports, there is no point in, nor is it possible in five paragraphs that, the article above repeats the process.
The very small article above mentioned two record temperature from the past week, one of which is from an unbiased site which as a record would be greater than February temperatures recorded 100 years ago. I am not making any assumptions but instead am referencing the large body of unbiased temperature data published in numerous peer reviewed scientific papers and IPCC Reports that shows that global climate warming has occurred. My only assumption was to expect that someone engaging in a discussion on global warming would be familiar with this literature.
When did you refer to the little ice age? You claimed erroneously that graph of the last 2,000 years of Northern Hemisphere temperature stacks showed steady global warming from 1600 to 1800, and and I described the two lower temperature plateaus from 1400-1600 AD and lower still from 1600-1800 AD illustrated in that graph which followed the slightly warmer period from 1000 -1400 AD and preceded the steep rise from the middle of the 1800s.
I did not say ""ah that"" (little ice age) ""was just in Europe and North America not global.""

You then say - ""The high late February temperature records are a consequence of global climate warming rather than proof of it. Proof or indication of the reality of global climate warming has been provided by a plethora of temperature readings from locations unaffected by urban heat island effect."" So then the article should have taken the unbiased readings from the unaffected areas, as should any scientists.

Historical records of cyclone destructiveness are far from complete only recording the extreme events in highly populated regions such as Bangladesh. As population grows more people and their houses can suffer destruction from cyclones of the same potential destructiveness. Economic growth and technological innovation can put more structures in the path of a cyclone but can also produce structures less prone to destruction as has occurred in Northern Australia since the 1970s.
In his 2005 paper Kerry Emanuel used worldwide data from the early 70s to the early years of this century that had been gathered by meteorologic and defence organisations. Prior to that time the data was not sufficiently complete to make comparisons of the potential destructiveness of tropical cyclones. Kerry found that overall the potential destructiveness of tropical cyclones had increased over that 30 year period as sea surface temperatures had warmed. This is due to a combination of a greater proportion of tropical cyclones being higher category storms and the storms being slower moving and hence staying longer over a particular area.
""You are correct that this is a worry thing, a part of OCD"" (obcessive compulsive disorder).
Worrying about the potential destructiveness of cyclones, such as I did last week as Oma approached, which involved some rearrangement of my flood prone downstairs storage area, had nothing to do with obcessive compulsive disorder, and everything to do with minimising destruction from muddy floodwaters.

Rignot: It’s a little bit shattering to say, “hey this is it”, even for the scientists looking at it. It’s kind of a big step to say “I think this place is falling apart”. 
Interviewer: How do we communicate this to the public?
Rignot: I don’t know, but we're not doing a good job at that. I think most of the scientists are not trained for that, so they've been taken by surprise, they don't know how to deal with that very well.
I'm trying to learn. I talk to people from digital media to ask them how do we reach the people? The feedback I get right now is, “you guys really suck at it, you're not doing it right, I can tell that you're not trained to do this. The message is not passing.”
You know you talk about these things like [monotone voice] ‘business as usual, this glacier is falling apart. West Antarctica is going to be in an irreversible state of retreat’, and the people who listen to that may not click, they feel like, ‘well he doesn't seem so shattered by this, so why should I worry about it?’ We should be a little bit more vocal and direct about these things. You have some how to take your scientist hat off and take a different hat to communicate that.
You cannot communicate to the public the same way you communicate to your colleagues. It has to be a different level of communication.

In fact in this little local area we've got Permo-Triassic, Carboniferous and Silurian.
Russell Coope was my palaeontology lecturer as I've mentioned many times; Prof Fred Shotton was my physical geology lecturer.
Both great teachers, but with very different styles.
The first field trip I went on while doing geology at uni was led by Russell Coope - he took us to a Jurassic brick claypit near Moreton-in Marsh, full of wonderful ammonites and other excellent fossils.
Fred didn't lead any field trips for us at that time, but years later I was on a trip he led for an amateur geological society, to an Ice Age gravel pit.
He was retired by then, but still as sharp as ever.

Are you suggesting that I am saying that the over 20 degree C maximum for one day in London was evidence that the warmer climate resulting from global warming had increased the number of warm days. The evidence that the warmer climate of Britain due to global warming has increased the number of warm days is to found in the records of regional temperatures collected from sites away from the microclimate of the one large city that is London. I mentioned the above 20.3 degree C record maximum temperature in Wales as illustrating a consequence of this increase in the number of warmer days, not as evidence. That evidence is already in. Increase the number of warmer days and you increase the number of new record breaking outliers such as that February maximum in Wales.

In the 21st century, this has become a delusion. The unpredictability of weather in the UK, particularly during summers that many wish were drier and sunnier, is associated by many people with what it means to be British. It has big variations – temperatures in the north of Scotland can be up to 20C lower than in southern England – and is characteristically unsettled due to the jet stream.
Its unreliability may have aided those wishing to avoid the truth about global warming. But the evidence of our senses, as well as what meteorologists and other scientists tell us, is becoming overwhelming. While many people are enjoying this week’s record-breaking temperatures – 20.3C in Wales on Monday, and 21.2C in London on Tuesday, the hottest winter days on record – many of the same people are also worried. Extreme or unusual weather in the UK is becoming widely recognised as an indication that the climate is changing, though this realisation has been a long time coming.
That is understandable. Connections between one-off weather events and longer-term patterns must be drawn with caution. Greenhouse gas emissions do not explain everything. But over the past few years, the science of weather attribution has made dramatic advances. Using computer models combined with observational data, meteorologists can now analyse extreme events including floods, droughts and heatwaves to determine the contribution of manmade climate change. Last summer’s UK heatwave, when average temperatures in June, July and August were 2C above pre-industrial levels, was made 30 times more likely by greenhouse gases.
Simply facing this reality as a nation would be a big step forward. For too long, and in defiance of evidence, climate deniers such as former chancellor Lord Lawson were offered prominent platforms to air their views without challenge. Partly as a consequence of such mixed messages, public opinion lags behind scientific knowledge. Recent survey data shows that while 93% of British people know climate change is happening, only 36% believe that humans are mainly responsible, while just 25% describe themselves as very worried. It is too soon to say whether this month’s unseasonal warmth, following last year’s extremes of cold and hot, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s warning that we have just 12 years in which to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C will shift minds further in the right direction.
International cooperation remains the key to averting a global catastrophe. Next year’s US presidential election will be a crucial moment, with President Trump committed to withdrawing the world’s second-biggest carbon emitter from the Paris climate change agreement. But the UK too has a vital role to play, either within or outside the EU. As our heating planet turns from a threat into an emergency, with emissions still increasing, we must reject passivity in favour of action. Climate change won’t affect the UK as severely as it will poorer countries, or those more vulnerable to desertification or flooding. Our target of 80% reductions in greenhouse gases by 2050 is already more ambitious than many comparable countries. But the government should be far more active in advancing public understanding. It is no longer permissible to pretend that ice-creams in February are a quirk of nature.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/26/the-guardian-view-on-the-hottest-winter-day-sunny-side-down

Based on the worst-case scenarios foreseen by science, his article portrayed a world of drought, plague and famine, in which acidified oceans drown coastal homelands, dormant diseases are released from ancient ice, conflicts surge, economies collapse, human cognitive abilities decline and heat stress becomes more intolerable in New York City than in present-day Bahrain. Critics called this irresponsibly alarmist. Supporters said it was a long-overdue antidote to climate complacency. Whatever your view, it was among the best-read climate articles in US history. Now he is back with a book-length follow-up.
Jonathan Watts: You have written a hell of a book. Your now-famous opening lines – “It’s worse, much worse, than you think” – are like a voice from a nightmare. Are you deliberately upsetting people about the climate?
David Wallace-Wells: That is one of the intentions. My hope is first of all to tell the story as I see it. That has a couple of components. One is to show the crisis is happening much faster and is more all-encompassing than people think. And then also to think how those dramatic changes are going to cascade through the lives we live, the way we relate to one another, our politics, our culture, our psychology, all that stuff. I would like people to be scared of what is possible because I’m scared. And because I am motivated by fear, I also hope they will be motivated.
The sense of speed comes across very strongly. It is as if people have got used to seeing the climate crisis as an old horror film with slow-lurching zombies but, in your version, the zombies are the much faster, scarier ones you see in modern horror films. You address the risks of heat death, hunger, drowning, wildfire, dying oceans, economic collapse and conflict, and suggest the climate problem driving them has super-accelerated beyond what many people think.
That is the thing that first opened my eyes to the change. When I learned the astonishing fact that more than half of the carbon we have emitted into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels was emitted in the past 25 years, that really shocked me. This means we have burned more fossil fuels since the UN established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) than in all of the centuries before – so we have done more damage knowingly than we ever managed in ignorance. That is a horrifying fact. It also means we are engineering our own devastation practically in real time. How much will depend on how we act, how we behave, how we respond.
The book is based on the piece you wrote for New York magazine last year that focused on worst-case climate scenarios. Were you prepared for the storm that caused?
It had about 6m page views. Within a couple of days, it was the most-read article we had ever published. It was a true phenomenon. That was thrilling in a way because the conventional wisdom about climate writing – at least in American journalism – was that it was traffic Kryptonite, that nobody would read these stories. I felt that was in part because we had left a lot of storytelling tools on the table and weren’t embracing a certain kind of writing that might reach people dramatically. I felt the article was a proof of concept for that.
In the book, you focus more on warming of around 2-4C, which is more likely than the worst-case scenarios, though still bad enough. Was this different approach an attempt to tighten up because there was quite a lot of scientific pushback on some of the claims you made in the original article?
I had anticipated a pushback. I wrote in the original article about scientific reticence and the way many researchers were reluctant to talk about their own scary findings in public in the terms they might have included in their papers. But I do not feel the science of my story was irresponsible. We ended up publishing four corrections to the piece. What it motivated me to do – and not just me, but my fact checker and the editor – was to publish this fully annotated version of the piece within a couple of days, in which we footnoted every fact with a paper. I do believe that basically answered that first reflexive criticism of the piece as being scientifically irresponsible.
There were also questions about rhetoric. Scientists said your article was “hyperbolic” and “exaggerated”, and your alarmism was as irresponsible as climate denial. In the book, you are unapologetic. You write: “The facts are hysterical” and the only way to address them is with the language of theology and mythology. Is this Armaggeddonising a way to reach new audiences and break down barriers?
Yes, and to activate people who are only casually engaged. To me, that is the most important messaging mission. It is important to mobilise people who at the moment are concerned, but basically complacent, and turn them into people who are much more activated and essentially voting about climate as a first-order political priority rather than a third- or fourth-order priority – judging politicians on the basis of their climate policy.
Disruption is important. But to what extent? You talk of last year’s UN IPCC 1.5C report. It is a science paper and it is sober. It spells out the huge – and horrifying – differences between 1.5C and 2C of warming, and the actions we need to take right now if we are to avoid the extra half a degree, which will require a 45% reduction in emissions by 2030. You say the message of the report is: “It’s OK now to freak out.” But I guess most scientists would say: “Don’t freak out! Act! Focus! Do not succumb to paralysing fear.” Is “freak out” what you really mean?
The short answer is yes. We should not sit back and feel complacent that the world beyond us will figure this out without political pressure. We cannot continue on the path we are on and believe our future will be secure and stable. We need to dramatically change our climate policy globally. That was the very clear message of the UN report. You are right that, in a certain way, it was written soberly, but it is also the case that it was saying we need mobilisation on the scale that we saw in the second world war in Europe and the US – and that is not a keep-calm message. It is saying we have to light the fuse and get going.
On the question of what kind of motivation is most effective, I don’t believe fear and alarm are the only options; there is a place for hope and optimism. There are many shades in between. But fear is what animated me. We do not tell people only about the positive benefits of quitting smoking. We tell them about what will happen to them if they smoke. And to go back to the second world war analogy, we did not mobilise in that way because we were optimistic about the future. We mobilised in that way out of fear, because we thought nazism was an existential threat. And climate change is obviously an existential threat and it is naive to imagine we could respond to it without some people being scared. I think it is silly to throw that rhetorical tool away. My basic perspective is that any story that sticks is a good one. If you can get people engaged, it is good, however you do it.
But I also come to this subject not as an advocate, not as an environmentalist. I have been drawn into that role to some extent as a result of this work. I come into it as a journalist and as a storyteller and, at some level, the imperative for me is to tell the story true, to tell it as I see it. As you say, and as I wrote in the book, it is simply the case that the facts are hysterical. To shy away from that, I think, is irresponsible – in part because it would encourage complacency but also from the basic truth-telling level. We know these things are true to the extent that scientists can know them. I don’t think the public should be shielded from them.
What struck me in the book was that you shake the reader up and say, “Look, wake up, get going!”, and yet there isn’t much there in terms of where to go next. You delved into solutions, but you didn’t give them much chance of achieving anything. Do you believe there isn’t much out there that could help us?
I think the book does a fair amount of hope-giving. The most important thing anybody can do is vote. If people are mobilised, we can relatively quickly usher in – perhaps not globally, but in many of the more important nations – a much stronger commitment to a more aggressive climate policy.
My hope is that the US and China, with support from some other countries, start making dramatic investments in [negative-emissions] climate technology in the near future. I’m sceptical of conventional decarbonisation. We will need these additional technologies. We need to invest in them quickly.
Putting hope in technology is the excuse George HW Bush gave for not doing anything decisive in the late 1980s when he was president and it is the message of the Trump administration. You don’t sound as if you are aligned with them. What about a carbon tax?
We have to do everything we can. I would absolutely support a carbon tax and what we are talking about now in the US: a green new deal of massive investment in renewable energy. But when you look around the world, small taxes on carbon haven’t had a meaningful impact. I think we have to learn from that and realise we need much more aggressive taxes or other solutions.
In the past year, we have seen more radical action such as student strikers led by Greta Thunberg and protests by Extinction Rebellion. Do you think groups like this are useful?
Absolutely. I’m an enormous admirer of Thunberg and I am in awe of how much energy and attention Extinction Rebellion has generated in such a short time. I think their imperative to tell the truth is very important and powerful.
Would you join?
They are organising another major event soon in New York that I will be going to. Temperamentally, and by background, I am not an activist and I still think of myself primarily as a journalist and storyteller. But no matter how disinclined you are, how temperamentally reluctant you are to be a joiner, it is hard to think about the state of the climate and not be called to action.
What about individual choices? Early in the book, you state very clearly you are not environmentalist, you eat meat, and you think it is better to have economic growth than protect nature. But then you write: “Like many Americans, I am fatally complacent and wilfully deluded.” That was your starting point. How has writing this book changed you?
Everybody should live according to their values. There are people who want to radically change their lives to reduce their carbon footprint, and there are people who want to make symbolic gestures. Air travel is the one thing that I really do feel guilty about. I make choices about travel with that in mind in a way that I didn’t even a year ago.
And meat?
Personally, I don’t feel that it is my thing. I admire people who give up meat for this reason. I think globally we need to be eating less meat, especially those of us in the wealthy parts of world who eat too much of it; for health reasons, too. But if I go from eating three hamburgers a year to zero, the impact on my carbon footprint is quite trivial. I have to say right now it feels so overwhelmingly the case that political action is the most important thing anyone could do, including me, that it overwhelms any of the other things.
In the book, you ask whether it is moral to have children in this climate. In the past year, you have done just that. What hope do have that your child won’t live in the uninhabitable world of your title?
I come at the question of hope from the perspective that truly total devastation is possible and something close to that is where we are heading now. So every degree cooler, every tick of temperature that we prevent, is an improvement and therefore a reason for hope. So, if we stabilise the planet at 3C that is better than 3.5C, 2.5C is better than 3C, and so on.
 For reasons independent of climate, I wanted to have children. Most people do. I don’t think this is an impulse we need to disavow before we have finished the final act of this story. I think it is a reason to fight now so that we can continue to have those children and continue to live in the ways we want to live. It is possible regardless of how bad the news from science is.

When he came back from Vietnam, he went to work in the coalmines. At 22, he was nearly killed by a roof collapse.
He spent a year on his back in the hospital. When he was mobile again, he got a job with the United Mine Workers Union. But after 12 years his injuries flared up and he had to quit. Then Vietnam memories started coming back, and he took to alcohol and pills.
“I was a wasted man for several years,” he recalled.
In September 2005, everything changed. He went to church and got sober. When his mind was clear, he didn’t like what he saw.
“Man,” he said, “I seen all this destruction the coal companies were doing, tearing the mountains down.”
Since then, Shoupe has worked with Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, a grassroots environmental and social justice group that wants to do things like insulate old camp homes and use the energy savings to pay the costs. It is also looking to create jobs to replace those that left with the mining companies as coal use declined.
Such ideas could now form the backbone of a national strategy that more and more Democrats are supporting and which will also aim to help slow the pace of climate change: a Green New Deal.
The concept has the backing of the 2020 presidential contenders Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, and Elizabeth Warren and the likely candidate Bernie Sanders. The New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Massachusetts senator Ed Markey will soon roll out a brief outline.
A Green New Deal will aim to spur jobs and tackle inequity. It will aim to help people of color and indigenous communities. And it will try to help places like Benham, Kentucky. But most importantly, people involved say, the document will push candidates for the White House to explain what they plan to do about climate change.
“Where 2020 contenders stand on this legislation will make it clear who is using the Green New Deal as a buzzword and who is serious about transforming our economy in line with what science and justice demand,” said Varshini Prakash, founder of the Sunrise Movement, a youth climate advocacy group.
The concept is already entering the mainstream. Earlier this week, Harris declared her support, telling an Iowa town hall: “Climate change is an existential threat to us, and we have got to deal with the reality of it.” The California senator also touted statistics projecting huge growth in wind and solar power jobs.
Behind the scenes, environmental groups, unions and climate justice advocates have been laying out their thoughts on what a Green New Deal should include.
For people like Shoupe, it’s hard to get excited just yet. They need help now, while climate scientists stress that the world is already off the pace, having failed to begin phasing out coal and petroleum and working to limit greenhouse gas emissions from industry, agriculture and land use.
Donald Trump is still president, still openly doubting climate change science.
Then there is the legislative challenge a Green New Deal would present, even if all the groups involved could agree on the best way forward. So far, organizations are aligning around general aspirations, people familiar with discussions said. As concrete policy is generated, that will become more difficult.
One conflict will come around whether a Green New Deal can include nuclear power, which is carbon-free but runs on mined uranium. Another will regard the use of carbon sequestration, a technology to collect and store emissions from power plants, thereby letting them keep running.
Basav Sen, who works with a national consortium of groups, the Climate Justice Alliance, is against the inclusion of nuclear and carbon sequestration.
“There can be disagreement about other things,” he said, “[but] those are things there’s no compromise on.”
For Paul Getsos, national director of the Peoples Climate Movement, an umbrella group for community organizations and environmental justice and labor groups, the Green New Deal “has to be about reducing emissions” as well as building a more just economy.
Working with unions, meanwhile, could make it hard to set specific goals for phasing out fossil fuels, because organized labor represents people working in coal, oil and gas, steel and concrete: all sources of greenhouse gases.
The plan could also divide Democrats in Congress. Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland has been calling for a “green deal” including a carbon fee and dividend.
“Enthusiasm on the Democratic side is overwhelming,” he said, adding that he favored “a comprehensive deal that commits us to meet goals [with] some detailed policy commitments built into it”.
But he acknowledged: “I know some members of the House have concerns about overly ambitious goals built into the Green New Deal, such as trying to wean us off fossil fuels in a decade.” One such member was John Delaney of Maryland, who left the House last month in order to run for president.
In January, he told the Guardian: “There’s a way of doing something really big on climate change in my opinion: it involves putting a price on carbon … That’s the best way to do it: it’s a market-based solution. But suddenly some people are saying, ‘No, no, that’s not good enough, we’ve got to go further, we’ve got to basically ban carbon in 10 years.’ Now, that’s just not going to happen.
“I worry that they move the goalposts to a point where you can’t get anything done and I think that plays into Trump’s hands, actually.”
Advocates insist nonetheless that they have an opportunity to overcome such obstacles. Ben Beachy, with the Sierra Club, said he has been happy “to see just how much alignment on the broad goals there has been”.
Furthermore, for once, some say they might have an advantage in the messaging war.
Julian Brave NoiseCat, a policy analyst for the climate group 350.org and a Guardian contributor, said: “Climate change and climate policy has been framed through tradeoffs, scarcity and sacrifice for so long.
“But what’s powerful about the Green New Deal is it frames it as: ‘We can build and provide millions of jobs and do phenomenal things for everyday people through climate policy.’”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/03/green-new-deal-climate-change-jobs-plan

Researchers say the colour changes are down to the effect of climate change on populations of tiny water-dwelling organisms, known as phytoplankton, that convert sunlight into chemical energy through photosynthesis, as well as effects on levels of other colourful components of the oceans.
“In the same way that plants on land are green, phytoplankton are green as well, so the amount and different types of phytoplankton affect the colour of the ocean surface,” said Dr Anna Hickman, co-author of the research from the school of ocean and earth science at the University of Southampton.
Being able to detect changes in levels of such organisms is important, Hickman added. “We are interested in phytoplankton because they are tiny marine plants, they contribute about half of global photosynthesis, they are the base of the marine food web.” 
Writing in the journal Nature Communications, Hickman and colleagues from the UK and US report how they came to their conclusions by using a computer model that predicts how factors such as temperature, ocean currents and ocean acidity affects the growth and types of phytoplankton in the water, as well as levels of other coloured organic matter and detritus. However, in an important twist to previous studies, they also explored how such changes would affect the absorption and reflection of light at the ocean surface.
The results reveal that if the temperature of the global sea surface rises by 3C (5.4F) by 2100 – as expected from the current scenario – the colour of more than half the oceans, including the north Atlantic, will change.
Hickman said: “Crudely speaking, where the water is currently quite blue because the phytoplankton [have a] relatively low biomass, you are going to see the water getting more blue, and where the ocean is relatively more green because the biomass is higher, you are going to see [it] getting [greener].”
That, the authors say, reflects shifts in phytoplankton populations, and knock-on effects, that stem from factors including a retreat of sea ice near the poles, rising temperatures and less mixing of waters.
“Looking at just the colour of the ocean, and how that is going to change in the future by monitoring it from satellites, is actually going to give us an early warning signal of changes in the phytoplankton,” said Hickman.
Importantly, she said, the shift in reflectance of blue/green light appeared to give an earlier indication of changes to phytoplankton than estimates of the amount of chlorophyll present, a measure currently used to monitor phytoplankton levels.
That, the researchers said, was probably down to a number of factors, including that shifts in ocean colour take into account not only changes in the overall amount of phytoplankton – which can vary dramatically, for example with the season – but also changes in the species present, an important consideration since different types of phytoplankton use chlorophyll yet absorb slightly different wavelengths of light.
Hickman said this was helpful, as using satellite data to examine specific changes in blue/green light can reveal changes in the phytoplankton population. This can then provide a more accurate reflection of the climate trend than calculating chlorophyll levels from this data, which only gives a sense of the amount of phytoplankton.
However, it seems artists need not worry about upgrading their palettes. “I would probably predict that the colour change isn’t going to be perceptible to the naked eye,” said Hickman.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/04/rising-temperatures-to-make-oceans-bluer-and-greener

The power is out. The courtroom has gone black.
It’s a brown-out – caused by stress on the electricity grid due to the Thursday’s extreme heat in Sydney.
In the sun all the cops, defendants, solicitors and a TV crew stand under a paltry few trees. The temperature is around 40 degrees and the air feels viscous and substantial. Our case is eventually moved into the main courtroom in the city.
There would be millions of these tiny vignettes being told all over Australia this summer, small stories of the things that happen to us (and happen to our infrastructure and our environment) in the heat. They are stories about the way things break down, or are interrupted or are made difficult because of the heat.
But these vignettes all add up to something, a sort of mosaic that shows us what it is like to live in this country at this moment.
In this heat we live cautiously and reactively. We plan around the weather. Even if it’s not as dramatic as a court being closed mid-case, the rhythms of our daily life are changing.
We’ll avoid going outside, particularly when the heat is at its most intense. We’ll use our cars more instead of walking, we’ll head to a shopping mall rather than the beach. We’ll move slower, do less. Psychologically the heat is also having an effect. Over 35 degrees, and our sleep is interrupted, we exercise less, and feel more irritable. Domestic violence cases rise. 
I’ve had only two nights at my house this summer. I’m a climate change refugee of sorts
In extreme heat, our worlds shrink to a manageable size. Give us a chilled room and a cold drink, and we can sit there all day, waiting for a cool change.
Without the chilled room, there is discomfort – even suffering.
I’ve had only two nights at my house this summer. I’m a climate change refugee of sorts. I can’t stay there right now, it’s too hot – and so I’ve sought out places that are around 10 degrees cooler, and on the coast. My house is old and not air-conditioned in inland Victoria, and for almost two months now the temperature there has been in the 30s and 40s. The mornings start cool but the days heat up and reach their zenith around 6 or 7pm and don’t drop much at night. Relief from this type of heat used to be found up the road in a dam, but when I swam there last week, the water was warm, thick and brackish, like swimming in something with the consistency and temperature of blood.
My garden is fried, while inside the fans turn warm air but provide little relief. I suppose I’ll relent and get air conditioning – but isn’t that the sort of thinking that got us here in the first place?
Australia in summer is morphing from what currently exists in our popular imagination of long days at the beach, to long days indoors. January has been our hottest month on record.
In short, we are becoming more like Dubai and less like the version of ourselves that existed 10 year ago. Dubai, where the summer temperature hits 50 degrees, is a hellscape where life is lived mostly indoors.
Residents, particularly moneyed expats, don’t so much live in Dubai over the summer as exist in a climate-controlled version of it. They spend time in cars going between their offices, homes and the mall - and buildings are connected via air conditioned walkways. Leisure time is spent not outdoors or in nature, but in indoor play centres and gyms or enjoying long hotel brunches, where for a fixed price (and fixed temperature) it’s bottomless glasses of Veuve and all-you-can-eat buffet.
Dubai shows you can build an alternate reality that ignores the actual reality of what is happening out there – that it is 50 degrees and dangerously hot. And of course building that reality around the climate is an intensely neo-liberal exercise. The rich are comfortable in the cool indoors, the poor bake outside, on boiling building sites and in substandard accommodation.
Australian summers have long had their heatwaves and the odd day that is freakishly hot but this summer feels different.
It feels different because it is. The run of hot days in a row are longer, and hotter. The minimum temperatures are rising, and it doesn’t cool down dramatically at night. Records are tumbling all over the place.
In Melbourne last week, when I left the tennis to get a tram, it was 41 degrees at 6pm, and the air was so hot and dry that being outside felt like being placed in a kiln, and the idea of anything more than five minutes in it seemed dangerous. The streets of Melbourne that evening were empty except for people like me, scurrying as quickly as they could from one cool place to the next.
But yet there still exists in the popular imagination this idea of Australia being the land of the glorious summer. Of long beach days and life lived outdoors. Instead it’s been the summer of dead fish clogging warm rivers, while we watch the devastation on television, inside our chilled houses.
When will we acknowledge that our summer selves are more akin to those of Dubai’s residents than our former all-day-at-the-beach selves? That we seek cool, dark places now? That Australia has become too hot?
Because things are only going to get worse.

The UK oil and gas company supported a resolution, put forward by a group of shareholders including the investment arms of HSBC, Legal &amp; General and the C of E, forcing it to be more transparent on climate change.
But BP urged investors to reject a tougher climate resolution brought by a Dutch shareholder activist group, which it said was too prescriptive.
The moves are part of a wider, growing wave of shareholder power being exerted on oil and gas companies to be clearer about their contribution to rising carbon emissions, and what they are doing about it.
BP will encourage shareholders at its AGM in May to back the resolution organised by the Climate Action 100+ group, which represents 320 investors managing more than $32tn (£24tn) of assets.
The proposal calls for BP to publish a business strategy in line with two of the Paris deal goals by the end of its 2019 financial year: holding temperature rises to well below 2C and reducing carbon emissions to net zero by the second half of the century.
The company has also been told to justify how capital expenditure in fossil fuel projects was consistent with the landmark climate deal, and set new metrics and targets.
BP and the investors spent months in talks over the resolution, leading to some changes to the proposal but not on the core demand of a business strategy in line with Paris.
The two sides disagreed on whether the company had shown it was consistent with the goals of the climate accord. Investors said BP was yet to demonstrate that.
Helge Lund, BP’s chairman, said: “The additional reporting specified in the resolution will build on BP’s history of progressive action in this area.” The company agreed four years ago to be more transparent about reporting on climate risks.
The resolution said: “Investors remain concerned that the company has not yet demonstrated that its strategy, which includes growth in oil and gas as well as pursuing low-carbon businesses, is consistent with the Paris goals.”
The company’s contribution to climate change could also undermine its stated mission of lifting people out of poverty because of the impact of global warming on the world’s poorest people, the investors added.
However, Bruce Duguid, the lead coordinator of the resolution and the head of stewardship at Hermes EOS, welcomed BP’s decision to back the proposal. “This is good news for both investors and the planet,” he said.
BP has not specified what metrics and targets it might set if the resolution is passed, but they could include targets for the carbon intensity of its products and linking executives’ bonuses to carbon emission cuts.
But the company will not be setting targets any time soon for “scope 3 emissions” produced by customers using its products, such as burning petrol in a car. These emissions are much bigger than those from the company’s operations.
BP said it was not supporting a separate resolution, brought by the Dutch investor group Follow This, seeking to make BP set a goal for scope 3 emissions. The group has previously been credited with influencing Shell’s decision to set such targets.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/01/bp-to-explain-how-business-chimes-with-paris-climate-agreement

In the Reddit thread titled “Former climate change deniers, what changed your mind?” the most popular comment comes from chucklesthe2nd (probably not his real name). Chuck, as we’ll call him, essentially inherited his dad’s views on climate change.
“I grew up actively and obnoxiously denying climate change because my dad told me it wasn’t real,” Chuck wrote last year. Then, during a high school science course, he learned about feedback loops: “It suddenly hit me. As the atmosphere heats up, more CO2 is released, which heats up the atmosphere, which releases more CO2, which heats up the atmosphere, which releases more CO2, which heats up the atmosphere, which releases more CO2……etc.”
It looks like Chuck is at the forefront of an encouraging trend. A recent Monmouth poll found that 78% of Americans believe climate change is real and leading to sea-level rise and more extreme weather. That’s up from 70% three years ago. The headline-grabbing takeaway: a majority of Republicans – 64% – are now believers, a 15-point jump from 2015.
To learn more about these converts, researchers at Yale and George Mason crunched the numbers from a blend of responses to surveys conducted between 2011 and 2015. They found that 8% of Americans said they had recently changed their opinion on the matter, according to a new analysis from Yale University and George Mason University. Nearly all of the recent converts said global warming had become a bigger concern for them.
But who are these people, anyway, and what’s their deal? Let’s take a closer look.
“All kinds of people are changing their minds” and accepting the science, regardless of age, education level, or political affiliation, said Jennifer Marlon, a research scientist at Yale and an author of the new analysis. “I was surprised to see how consistent it is.”
There are some clear trends. One interesting tidbit: 11% of adults 65 or older reported that they’d recently shifted their views, more than any other age group.
So do retirees just have more time to read the news or what? It might have something to do with having been around for longer. With age comes wisdom, as the saying goes, or at least perspective. “You have a longer baseline,” Marlon said. “I’m noticing that myself – I remember what the winters were like when I was growing up, and there was really more snow.”
There also appears to be a gender dynamic: women were 4% more likely than men to say they had recently shifted their opinion. (The hard part about changing your mind is, of course, admitting that you were wrong.)
To try to explain this gender gap, Marlon pointed to a Yale analysis from 2018 that showed American women tend to be a bit more worried about global warming than men. Women also report having less certainty about the science behind it. The less sure we are about our opinions, the more easily we can be swayed by evidence.
Researchers combed through open-ended survey responses and identified three main reasons why Americans were shifting their perspectives on climate change. They’d either personally experienced the effects of global warming, like extreme weather and warmer seasons, or realized how serious the problem was, or simply become more informed (hey, that’s Reddit Chuck!).
“We seem to have more major storms,” one responder said. Another noted, “We don’t get as much snow.” Others said they wanted their grandchildren to be able to see glaciers, or that they’d seen more about global warming on TV.
It’s in line with other research that shows extreme weather is turning into the latest symbol of climate change. Over the past decade, the number of free associations people made linking climate change with the weather has quadrupled, according to analysis from Yale and the University of Westminster, London.
A word of warning: people don’t change their minds easily about controversial issues.
Marlon recommends helping people make the connection themselves. People overwhelmingly report in surveys that they want to learn more about climate change, she said. They just might not have the time or initiative to look up that information.
Keep in mind that it’s not exactly easy to admit that you’re wrong. If a friend shares fake news about climate change, it’s probably more effective to reach out to them in private than to attack them in front of their friends and family on Facebook. “To some extent, changing your mind can appear to be losing face,” Hugo Mercier, coauthor of The Enigma of Reason, told WBUR’s Here &amp; Now. “It may be easier for them to change their mind if they do it less publicly,” he said.
You might have to prepare yourself for some thorny conversations. Note that climate change isn’t just about facts – it’s also about politics. While a majority of Republicans already believe climate change is happening, caused by human activity, and worth addressing, many conservatives are skeptical about climate policy because it’s seen as liberals’ pet issue. “This tribalism leads to political fights over differences between the parties that either do not exist or are vastly exaggerated,” wrote the psychology professors Leaf Van Boven and David Sherman in the New York Times.
Hundreds of other studies have shown that the best way to get people to stop demonizing each other is to introduce them to the actual human beings they disagree with, as I wrote last month. So if you’re trying to get someone to open their mind, you might consider the idea of a having tough, nuanced conversation … and actually hearing them out.
Good, old-fashioned, respectful debate? I’d take that over a rage fest or shout-a-thon any day.

The purpose of the Million Dollar Vegan campaign, led by 12-year-old Genesis Butler, is to encourage people to eat less meat and dairy in order to fight climate change. Global warming cannot be beaten without huge cuts in meat eating in rich nations, research shows, while reducing consumption of animal products also tackles pollution and the destruction of forests and wildlife.
The Pope, leader of the world’s 1.2 billion Roman Catholics, has been outspoken on environmental issues. “Climate change is a global problem with grave implications: environmental, social, economic [and] political,” he said in his 2015 encyclical. He also  told the UN in the same year: “The ecological crisis, and the large-scale destruction of biodiversity, can threaten the very existence of the human species.”
Butler, from Long Beach, California, has been vegan since the age of six and has staged many protests against animal cruelty. She said there were many reasons for eating a plant-based diet.
“There is an animal side, a health side and an environmental side,” she told the Guardian. “If I tell people about the damage that the animal agriculture industry is doing to the planet, then some of them want to go vegan. I also tell them about health and how when you go vegan it can help prevent cancer, heart, disease and diabetes, or how animals have to die or suffer.”
The campaign is backed by celebrities including Paul McCartney, the actor Mena Suvari, the musician Moby and naturalist and TV presenter Chris Packham. Young environmental protesters are becoming increasingly high profile, with Greta Thunberg’s school strikes for climate inspiring tens of thousands of other students to follow suit.
In her message to Pope Francis, Butler says: “In your encyclical letter, Laudato si’, you stated that every effort to protect and improve our world will involve changes in lifestyle, production, and consumption. I agree with all my heart and seek your support in tackling one of the largest underlying causes of the problems we face: animal agriculture.”
Matthew Glover, CEO of Million Dollar Vegan and who co-founded the Veganuary campaign, said the Pope had been selected for his environmental leadership and influence, particularly in South America, where great forests continue to be cut down.
“We are launching this deliberately bold, audacious campaign to jolt our world leaders from their complacency,” Glover said. “We are thankful that Pope Francis has spoken out and that is why we are humbly asking him to try vegan for Lent, and set an example of how each of us can align our principles of caring and compassion with our actions.”
The $1m has been donated by the Blue Horizon International Foundation, the charitable arm of the Blue Horizon Corporation, which invests in companies producing plant-based foods and aims to “accelerate the removal of animals from the global food chain”.
Lent is a period of about 40 days that ends just before Easter and during which many Christians practise abstinence of some kind. It reflects the Bible story of the 40 days Jesus spent fasting in the desert and in 2019 runs from 6 March to 18 April. The Vatican had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication.
Daniel Hale, at the Catholic aid agency Cafod, said: “Pope Francis has been the standout world leader on climate change this decade. Like all Christians, the Holy Father will make his own choices about how to give, act and pray this Lent.
“It’s a period of reflection for all Catholics and a chance for us to respond to the Pope’s call for us to live a simpler and more sustainable lifestyle in various ways,” he said. “For some, that will mean cutting down on meat, while others are switching to renewable energy or campaigning for action to reduce emissions.”
Packham said: “We’ve made an enormous mess of this precious little planet in all sorts of ways. [Million Dollar Vegan] is important, brilliant and audacious. If the head of the Catholic church can be vegan for [Lent], think of the message that will send to all of those followers across the world.”
Butler’s activism began early. “When I was about to turn four I asked my mom about where we got our chicken nuggets from, because I would always eat them,” she said. “I was devastated. I told her that I never wanted to eat meat again. But I still love chicken nuggets – the vegan version – and I love vegan mac’n’cheese.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/feb/06/pope-francis-offered-1m-charity-donation-to-go-vegan-for-lent

These are all things I support, but the way we progress must be driven by our desire to protect our way of life and standard of living. It should not be a crusade against Capitalism.
BQEND
Climate change used to be fairly politically neutral. Famously Thatcher helped get the issue recognition. Bush signed the Rio Earth summit. Conservative councils were as likely as Labour ones to prioritise action.
That seems to have shifted. Now left wing voices are far more likely to want action. If the narrative of mitigation is too socialist for your liking, the fault doesn't lie with the people proposing solutions, but with the conservative right who have consistently failed to engage with the problem.

Yes, I do.
When I was a child, a teenager, I was having a bath only on Saturdays nights. Sunday was the day of the Lord, and we had to be clean.Soo.. all week went along, and Saturday night was bath time. I never showered. That was the norm in my family and many others.
I remember I was walking to school too (no, my mom wasn't a soccer mom with her own SUV). Then during highschool years, since the school was 10 KM away, so the only way to go to high-school was to take a trolleybus (no spam, safe to click, just a Youtube video show a trolleybus in 1996 in a town in Romania) in the 90's.
I remember the summers when I was sent to the village where my grandparents lived.
Again, in the village I was only bathing once a week, Saturday night, sometimes, not even that, my grandpa gave me a bucket of warm water to clean my feet and face and I was set.
My grandpa also was using horses (youtube video, safe to click, showing a romanian farmer using a horse to plow) in the the fields. Cutting down grass (Youtube video, safe to click, showing Romanian men using scythes to cut down grass) wasn't done by some machine. No, that all you needed to do was use a scythe, and will to work the grass field. You worked, you ate. Simple as that.
There were some tractors used, but since Communism collapsed, few afforded to use them. So they mostly rot away or were sold to scraps.
I remember the summers in the town, when for 2 weeks, we had no running water. Revisions and such in the whole town. We had to go to a fountain and brig water home. Yes, walk. 
Yes. It was my fault. Yes it is our fault the Romanians, for global warming. Among other non-westerners.Yes, it the fault of the 6 billion of people that live a tens of dollars a month. Yes it's our fault.
It's not the fault of the westerners, who shower 1 or 2 times a day. Who take their children to school in their cars. Who heat their homes in winter and cool it in the summer.No. The West is right in being only 18% of the population of Planet Earth and consuming 50% of the oil produced each year. It's their right.The standards of living in the West should not change. 
It's us, the rest, who should consume less. We, the 6 billion, we the 80% of the population of this Earth, should not infringe of the God given rights of the westerners to shower every day, to use automobiles, to use motorized vehicles for agriculture, to fly on their cheap Ryanair city breaks to Ibiza, Bali, Magaluf, Paris or Rome or Prague (stag nights), to use their electronic devices, to air-condition their skyscrapers.After all... the westerners are civilized. 
We, the non-westerners, we should only walk, never use a car. We should only shower once a month. We should never eat meat if possible. We should buy clothes only once every 5 years. We should not use electronic devices. Who should stay put, be sterile (no children) and be invisible in general, less we upset the civilized westerners. I think we should also watch our oxygen consumption, we should be very carefully we don't consume too much.

Global warming could be one of humankind’s longest lasting legacies. 
The climatic impacts of releasing fossil fuel CO2 to the atmosphere will last longer than Stonehenge. Longer than time capsules, longer than nuclear waste, far longer than the age of human civilization so far. 
Each ton of coal that we burn leaves CO2 gas in the atmosphere. The CO2 coming from a quarter of that ton will still be affecting the climate one thousand years from now, at the start of the next millennium. 
And that is only the beginning.

Although the experience and process of growing up has in many ways profoundly changed through history, our understanding of children has failed to keep pace.
Nothing makes this clearer than the children’s climate strikes. These protests, involving school-age children refusing to attend class to focus the attention of political leaders on the global climate crisis, have spread from Australia to Germany, from Sweden to Belgium; the first strikes in the UK take place on Friday 15 February and in the US later this month. But instead of taking themseriously, many “adults” (usually, though not exclusively old men in leadership positions) are still dismissing them with the utterly paternalistic argument that all these protests are nice and cute, but skipping school? Why can’t the children protest in their “free time”, instead of endangering their own education and their future which we, the adults, supposedly have provided for them.
The most absurd reaction has emerged from Belgium, where an environment minister, Joke Schauvliege, has been forced to resign after claiming that the Belgian children skipping school were being directed by unnamed foreign powers.
Schauvliege suggested that the protests were a “set-up” and she falsely claimed that Belgian intelligence had knowledge that the children’s actions were “more than spontaneous actions of solidarity”.
There was a paternalistic dismissal of the school protests too from the Australian resources minister, Matt Canavan, who said in a radio interview that the action was setting the children up for failure: “Walking off school and protesting, you don’t learn anything from that.”
Meanwhile, consider an interview the German news magazine Der Spiegel did with Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish mastermind of the school strikes movement, who travelled 32 hours by train to get to Davos while the “adults” who were supposed to meet to talk about climate change there arrived in 1,500 private jet flights.
The Spiegel journalists flew (although at least not by private jet) to Sweden just to meet Greta and their most pressing question was: who is really behind the girl who’s become an inspiration for children across the world?
So, after suggesting to the child that her speeches seem a bit too good to have been written by a kid, they then asked her directly: “Who stands behind Greta”? She patiently answered that she herself is “behind Greta”, and added an important lesson to the journalists and adults: “Some people claim that my parents have brainwashed me, but it was the opposite: I brainwashed my parents. I convinced them not to fly any more and to stop eating meat”.
When the journalists asked her whether she found it acceptable that tens of thousands of children were skipping school, Greta, fully aware that the school strikes are the only effective but also somehow “traumatic” part for most of the adults (or world leaders) who are otherwise fine with co-opting the children’s leader as a sort of entertainment at Davos, simply answered: “You have to stop destroying our future.”
Faced with the same paternalistic complaint that children shouldn’t be skipping school, 13-year-old US pupil Alexandria Villasenor, who has started walking to the UN in her own climate strike every Friday, speaks in blunt terms: “If we’re not going to have a future, then school won’t matter any more.”
She couldn’t be more right. While in Belgium tens of thousands of children have been skipping school to join demonstrations for action against climate change, at the same time, in another corner of Europe, the children of Macedonia have been forced to skip school because of air pollution. This shows that some children are denied school because of the way “adults” manage the world. 
What the children’s protests are bringing back is a sort of universalism (children in Belgium are also protesting about the future of the children in Macedonia), but a much-needed debate about the very notion of a common future. For this reason we have to understand this wave of children’s disobedience (even skipping school) as an attempt to literally take back time (the future) from a system that is founded on extraction not only of natural resources, but of time and the future itself.
There is a wonderful children’s fantasy novel published in 1973 in German with the full title Momo, or The Strange Story of the Time Thieves and the Kid Who Brought Back Stolen Time to Humans, which deserves new recognition. Not just because it actually imagined such children’s protests, but because it offers a much-needed inversion of “adults” and “children”.
It was written by Michael Ende, the author of the more famous The Neverending Story. Momo is not just a surprisingly accurate depiction of the world of acceleration and indebtedness in which we are living today, but a rallying call to resistance to young people. Now it seems, the children’s climate strikes are precisely an answer to the events that started to be unleashed in the 1970s and were best summed up by the famous Sex Pistols song from 1977 No Future.
In an interview on German television in 1993, Ende predicted that the world was headed toward either an economic or an ecological catastrophe, that we are, in fact, waging war against our children. 
The first war against our youngest citizens is the destruction of the planet, which is the theft of their future; the second war is the overreaction to the current children’s protest. It reflects our western cultural tendency to simultaneously treat children like pets – sentimentalising and infantilising them while at the same time dismissing their concerns. The billionaire business leaders of Davos applauded the Swedish girl at Davos, but from the outside it looked like a sideshow, a piece of diversion, rather than anything that would really cause them to change direction.
But what if the children today were considered the true grownups, and the “adults” who are leading the world into an ecological catastrophe – as they fly into an Alpine resort in 1,500 private jets to pay lip service to climate change – were considered the spoiled and dangerous children?
If we want to have a future at all, the children of the early 21st century have to be taken seriously – and the adults should join their protests.

The deputy prime minister visited the fish-kill ground-zero site with local Nationals MP Mark Coulton, who was also making his first visit since the mass death was reported early last month.
McCormack, who attempted to limit the water returned to the environment even further in the 2012 Murray-Darling Basin plan, calling it an “assault on regional Australia”, and had earlier prescribed the mass deaths to “it just hasn’t rained”, told reporters “we’re all experts in hindsight” when asked if the river could have been managed better.
“The fact is it hasn’t rained in some catchments for seven long years,” he said.
“Everybody will have a different opinion on what should or shouldn’t have been done – the fact is the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, with the CEO, Phillip Glyde, he’s putting into place what the Water Act of 2007 asked him.
“The authority is an independent statutory body, it’s doing what is legislated and been passed in a bipartisan way between all the states and the commonwealth.”
A royal commission ordered by the former South Australian Labor government into issues with the Murray-Darling River at its end found gross maladministration, negligence and unlawful actions in creating and administering the basin plan had led to the river system’s poor health.
The senior counsel to the royal commission, Richard Beasley, has subsequently said politics, not science, dictated how the Murray-Darling Basin plan was implemented, which led to irrigators receiving too much water at the expense of the environment.
McCormack, who has followed his predecessor’s lead in defending irrigators in the wake of the fish kill, said the blame pointed at cotton and rice farmers was “not entirely fair”.
“The fact is in the Cubby Station area there’s only been 300 hectares of cotton grown and they’re growing 1% of cotton across the basin that they could in a generally good season.
“They’ve had no water allocations – the fact is it is dry and governments can’t make it rain. If we could, we could. It’s a dire situation.
“It will be solved through better water sharing access and we appreciate that. That is why the federal government has asked to have a chair of an independent panel which will look at the fish kill, to look at other provisions of the plan and he will report back to government, back to the agriculture and water resources minister federally, David Littleproud, by 31 March.
“We will take action on his recommendations. I know there are other inquiries going on as well.
He also said the government was doing “everything we can”, acknowledging it was “a crisis”.
“Mark and I acknowledge that,” he said.
“So we’re doing everything we can. Mark, as a good, responsible, local member, has turned up today. We have, in good faith listened to the passion and seen the determination and we’ve heard about the devastation that this fish kill incident has caused.”
Asked if he would be visiting other towns in the region which are now running out of water, McCormack said he heard from people “in Walgett and other parts”, but made a point of mentioning his workload.
“That’s why I’m pleased I have such a good local member, Mark, who is getting out and about in his region and reporting back,” he said.
“The fact is it’s a big nation. You know, I’m dealing with fires in Tasmania, I’m also, you know, hearing about the devastation of the floods in Townsville and Julia Creek and Queensland.
“So, as the deputy prime minister and minister for infrastructure, transport and regional development, it’s a very big nation.
When asked about climate change, McCormack pivoted to attack Labor over energy policy differences.
“We are looking at climate, of course, climate has been changing since year dot,” he said.
“We’re more than meeting our emissions targets. We don’t want to deindustrialise Australia, or stop farmers from their agricultural pursuits.
“What we don’t want is what the Greens and Bill Shorten would have us do, and have 45% emissions targets which are unrealistic.
“We don’t want to go down a path of renewables, which is not going to solve anything, apart from de-industrialising Australia and making sure we don’t do manufacturing here and push electricity bills into the unaffordable state.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/07/michael-mccormack-makes-first-visit-to-menindee-since-fish-kill-were-all-experts-in-hindsight

Nothing throws all of this into sharper relief than the accelerating climate crisis, with figures from the UK Met Office suggesting 1.5C of warming could be reached in as little as five years.

Just for clarity on this:
The Met Office decadal forecast show that global average surface temperatures may be close to reaching 1.5 °C, but this would be a temporary exceedance rather than the climatological level of warming in the Paris 1.5 °C threshold.

Low-Effort Thought Promotes Political ConservatismEidelman et al University of Arkansas

""In Study 1, alcohol intoxication was measured among bar patrons; as blood alcohol level increased, so did political conservatism (controlling for sex, education, and political identification). In Study 2, participants under cognitive load reported more conservative attitudes than their no-load counterparts. In Study 3, time pressure increased participants’ endorsement of conservative terms. In Study 4, participants considering political terms in a cursory manner endorsed conservative terms more than those asked to cogitate; an indicator of effortful thought (recognition memory) partially mediated the relationship between processing effort and conservatism. Together these data suggest that political conservatism may be a process consequence of low-effort thought; when effortful, deliberate thought is disengaged, endorsement of conservative ideology increases.""https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167212439213?journalCode=pspc', u'recommendation_count': u'4', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1549613601000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'16020012', u'in_reply_to': u'125627389', u'id': u'125628342', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Roel1963', u'text': u'I think a lot of UK young people, accustomed to wander around and travel freely nowadays, will vote with their feet rather than ticking a box come 2022.

Global warming could be one of humankind’s longest lasting legacies. 
The climatic impacts of releasing fossil fuel CO2 to the atmosphere will last longer than Stonehenge. Longer than time capsules, longer than nuclear waste, far longer than the age of human civilization so far.
Each ton of coal that we burn leaves CO2 gas in the atmosphere. The CO2 coming from a quarter of that ton will still be affecting the climate one thousand years from now, at the start of the next millennium.
And that is only the beginning.

I assume you talk about military and young people going to a war? You don‘t think it has to do with younger people being more healthy, therefore they can stand war/military better?

You don‘t think it has to do with the economy, meaning older people have jobs, that are needed to keep the country on the road during a war, while young people mostly go to the military BEFORE they start a career.
I could go on with the logic, why all countries have young people in the military - and not one single reason for that is, that „young people are so easy to manipulate“. People per se are easy to manipulate, if one wants that, as we all have our weak spots. Children often have a remarkable ability to spot this manipulation. And I think the older ones fall easier for ideology and lies, because at one point the present moves too fast for them (this happens to all of us, this is nothing bad, it is just how it is. I begin to feel the beginning of it myself) and too many then close down their minds.
I think especially the current situation in the world, where it are the older people, who fall for the hate and manipulation of the conmens, that brought us brexit, trump and co, shows, that it is a good thing to get teenagers involved in politics/society much earlier than we allow it now.

Often, the suggestion is that someone older has put them up to it. Flemish environment minister Joke Schauvliege took the patronising tactic much too far when she said that recent school strikes across Belgium were a “set-up”, and that security services knew who was really “behind this movement”. On Tuesday, after Belgian security services issued a rare denial, Ms Schauvliege resigned. On Thursday, the youth-led demonstrations spread to the Netherlands, as thousands of people marched in The Hague. Similar protests are scheduled to take place across the world in the coming weeks.
They show that, in fact, young people are able to influence their elders. When a journalist asked Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg who was pulling the strings behind her school strike last summer, she replied: “Some people claim that my parents have brainwashed me, but it was the opposite: I brainwashed my parents. I convinced them not to fly and to stop eating meat.”
Ms Thunberg has said that her decision to picket the Swedish parliament in Stockholm last year was inspired by the March for our Lives gun control protests that began after the Parkland school shooting. But there are older precedents for the recent upsurge in youth activism, with children playing key roles in historic civil rights and labour struggles. School desegregation in the southern US states and the 1888 London matchgirls’ strike are two famous examples.
Young people have a distinctive and valuable perspective. They deserve to be heard. Teenagers can already join British political parties, most of which grant full membership rights to mid-teens. In Scotland, 16-year-olds can vote in some elections. That should be extended to all elections across the UK. Few endorse politics professor David Runciman’s recent suggestion that the voting age should be lowered much further – to six. But many would acknowledge the sense in Scottish children’s commissioner Bruce Adamson’s criticism of the “absolutely ridiculous” double standard whereby children are held criminally responsible for their actions years before they are allowed to take part in elections.
There are sensible questions to be asked about the influence exerted by parents and other adults on children professing strong opinions. But we should respect and welcome efforts by children and teenagers to make their voices heard and influence decision-making. After all, they will be living with the consequences for longer than the rest of us. Nothing throws all of this into sharper relief than the accelerating climate crisis, with figures from the UK Met Office suggesting 1.5C of warming could be reached in as little as five years. If children want to take to the streets and demand tougher action to avert disaster, who can blame them?",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/07/the-guardian-view-on-teenage-activists-look-whos-pulling-the-strings

While I have respect for Steggall, I would prefer someone a bit more 'central' in her/his general policy outlook - but as a survivor of what hopefully will be a massacre of unprecedented proportions for the LNP in May, I also know that one does NOT get good government without a strong opposition - and Steggall evidently has the intelligence and drive to fill that role for the electorate.
My dream for the upcoming election is that the coprolite that makes up the vast majority of the LNP is flushed away, that a centre-socialist oriented government replaces it and that a strong, intelligent and effective cross-bench of Independents has sway over the passing of legislation.

The barrister and former Olympic ski champion is leading the former prime minister 54% to 46% on a two-party-preferred basis, according to a ReachTEL poll of 622 residents commissioned by activist group GetUp and published in the Sun-Herald and the Sunday Age on Sunday.
In the poll, 60% of the residents canvassed rated Abbott’s performance as a local member as “poor”. And 78% of those who had voted for him previously said they would vote for someone else.
GetUp is campaigning to oust Abbott from the Sydney northern beaches seat he has held for 25 years.
In an interview published on Sunday, Abbott criticised his opponents in Warringah as “all negative”.
“I’m very much aware that one of the mooted independent candidates said that she was running to stop me becoming leader of the opposition and prime minister,” he said in reference to Alice Thompson, a former employee of Malcolm Turnbull, who has since pulled out of the contest to back Steggall.
“These people just can’t help themselves. They are all negative. They don’t know what they’re for, but by God, they know what they’re against.”
Steggall, who has vowed to fight Abbott on his stance on climate change, has also challenged Labor to adopt a more ambitious climate change policy and commit to blocking Adani’s Carmichael coalmine.
“The attention should be with renewables, technology, clean transport, clean energy – not projects like Adani,” she told Guardian Australia last week.
But on Sunday Abbott said “if you look at the polls, climate change rates no more strongly today than it did a decade or so back” and he also questioned Steggall’s climate change policy.
“What’s her policy on climate change? My government presided over policies which mean that we will overachieve our Kyoto target and we’re well and truly on track to achieve the Paris target. What’s her policy?” Abbott said.
“It’s quite possible [the Coalition] might go back to Direct Action and renew the Emissions Reduction Fund.”
Private polling conducted for the environment movement and for the major parties suggests community concern about climate change is currently sitting at levels not seen since the federal election cycle in 2007.
Steggall told Guardian Australia last week that climate change had become “a political football” and voters were desperate for action.
“I’ll be advised by experts, I’m not an expert on climate change, I’m a concerned resident,” she said. “To me, this is something that needs to be bipartisan, [the policy] needs to be supported by facts and experts and across industries so we can come up with a strategy that has longevity – a long-term plan.”
Steggall, who entered the contest in Warringah in late January, said her fundraising goals and volunteer sign-ups were running ahead of expectations.
She described the contest against Abbott as “a huge mountain to hope to climb, but you’ve got to set the goal high, and if the current level of dissatisfaction is high enough, that’s how people can really make their voice heard”.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/10/tony-abbott-on-track-to-lose-warringah-to-zali-steggall-poll-shows

And without healthy ecosystems, there is no clean air and water.

Rehabilitation will occur only where it promises profits, which will usually not be the case in a deteriorating environment.
From Hawke’s time, the (“greed is good”) aim of “reform” has been to plunder the real wealth of society to feed the greed of the rich. One mechanism is bosses' plunder of productivity. Housing's pyramid scheme is another. Relentless extraction of productivity gains from agriculture - a third - is an especially potent driver of environmental stresses. Insecticides introduced in the last 20 years are extensive, persistent, and genocidal.
Financial deregulation and its companion Laberal Party and mainstream media-promoted dogmas of the past thirty years represent a counter-revolution by the rich against the Enlightenment, progressive economic thought and progressive democratic socialism. Public policy has been perverted to feed the greed of the filthy rich. As we see with the parliaments full of politicians owned by the fossil-fuel industry, it is absolutely determined to pay for its today with our tomorrow.

Death and ruin are everywhere—
And all that is left of the last year’s flood
Is a sickly stream on the grey-black mud;
The salt-springs bubble and the quagmires quiver,
And this is the dirge of the Darling River.”
— Henry Lawson (1891)
The northern hemisphere faced a polar vortex, while Australia during December and January was the hottest on record. People and the environment are suffering at both ends of the planet because of the extreme events.
Australia’s heatwave has exposed cracks in our unsustainable water, land-use and climate policies.
Fish kills in the Darling River, followed by more in other waterways, are being blamed on drought. More than one million fish died following multiple events in December and January.
The public has been aghast. The catalyst for outrage has been viral videos of hundreds of Murray cod floating dead and being displayed by angry locals. Murray cod is an icon of Australian waterways and one of the world’s largest species of freshwater fish. The biggest Murray cod – allegedly 114kg – was caught in 1902, during the federation drought in a tributary of the Darling, near Walgett.
But extreme conditions and fish kills are natural here in the “land of drought and flooding rains”, right?
The Darling is the longest river on the driest inhabited continent – prone to harsh and variable conditions. Lawson’s 1891 poem, which followed one year after the largest flood, is used often to depict the naturally occurring extreme conditions of our rivers. Indeed, European explorers who set off to chart flows to the “great inland sea” were surprised instead to discover a drought-stricken river – the Darling. Though the water was too salty to drink, it abounded with pelicans, swans, ducks and leaping fish.
Heatwaves and drought have always occurred here but unsustainable levels of water extraction and climate change are much more recent. Vast quantities of water are now extracted and used, during drought and flood, to irrigate crops including rice and cotton.
The amount of water used for irrigated agriculture varies, but ranged from about 50% of all flows in the Murray during the 1980s and 90s, to more than 76% during the Millennium Drought. Standards for healthy rivers are debated, but extraction of more than 20% of flows typically results in adverse changes to biodiversity and the benefits people derive from clean water.
Worldwide the demand for fresh water is expected to increase by 55% by 2050.
Australia is experiencing this water stress now. We are thus a canary, and the coalmine, for the rest of the world.
Bottled water is now being trucked to Walgett where the largest Murray cod on record was swimming during the Federation Drought. The major rivers that join near Walgett are dry. Aboriginal elders say both rivers have not run dry in their lifetime.
Large irrigated farms and harvesting of flood waters have been implicated in increasing water stress. About 150km north of Walgett lies Cubbie Station, and at 230,000 acres it is apparently the largest irrigated farm in the southern hemisphere. Cubbie Station doesn’t pump water from rivers that flow through Walgett, nor has it reported harvesting water since April 2017.
Given that less than 2% of all water pumped from the Murray-Darling goes to household consumption it’s hard not to sympathise with those who argue that corporate irrigators have something to do with water stress.
The flood waters harvested in recent years by irrigators could have been saved through water storage and wetlands to maintain dry-land agriculture and ecosystems during the current heatwave.
Unlike the fish, people and small farms spread throughout the Murray-Darling – a few lobbyists and several hundred rice and cotton irrigators, occupying less than 1% of the land, profit from using about 40% of all water extracted.
There is plenty of water to go around for people and the environment, but not enough to simultaneously sustain the current irrigation entitlements.
Banning cotton and rice and degrading farmers will not solve the problem.
What will solve it is reducing total water entitlements for irrigation and increasing flows for rivers and wetlands.
Environmental flows have expanded in many regions, but the Darling and northern-basin still seem to be a wild west of water extraction. Minimum environmental flow standards have either not been in place or have been insufficient to sustain dry-land rivers. Minimum flow standards and policies around land use and run-off must be sufficiently robust to prevent further large-scale blue-green algae events, which are the proximate causes of the current hypoxia and fish kills.
The best available science reviewed by the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists has recommend an increase in environmental flows, to a minimum of 3,200 GL per year to maintain healthy freshwater ecosystems.
So, what can the world learn from our experience on the driest inhabited continent?
Agriculture and water policies must be sufficiently robust to keep rivers flowing and communities supplied with clean water despite extreme conditions. With climate change, some lands that were once suitable for irrigated farming will not be viable in the future.
The shift to sustainable water and land-use practices requires visionary long-term planning and generous funding for regional communities. Given the rising population density, housing and business costs in Melbourne and Sydney, maybe it’s time to revisit the Whitlam-era ideas of luring people and business outside the major cities?
Subsidies that perpetuate the – hydro-illogical – cycle of unsustainable irrigation around the world should stop being funded. Instead, funding for communities must be targeted at helping farmers adapt and growing industries that will be viable during water scarcity, climate change and extreme conditions. Regional communities and freshwater ecosystems are much more than irrigation ditches and will thrive if presented with new opportunities.
If global carbon emissions remain high, the 48.3C record temperature in Bourke, situated near the Darling River, a few weeks ago should be expected to become 50C or 51C by 2090. Temperatures in Death Valley are sometimes that hot, but then again no one is growing cotton or cod there.
This does not have to be the dirge of the Darling, regional communities or farming. But it is time for change.

Roughly 1 tonne of CO2 per tonne of cement. Or 1 million tonnes per year of CO2 for a small-sized plant. Cement consumption per capita is between 50kg and 2,000kg per person per year, depending on the phase of development of the country and the availability of alternative building materials. Taking an unholy average, each member of the human population is responsible, through their fondness for a built environment, for roughly 500kg per year of CO2 from cement. What you forgot to point out is that human metabolism contributes roughly 300kg per person per year of CO2 through exhaled breath. Perhaps more in Westminster, the offices of newspapers and the vicinity of sports grounds. The annual US dollar turnover of the worldwide cement industry, by the by, is only 60% of that of Walmart.
Suffice to say that the most destructive material on Earth is not concrete. It’s not oil or coal either. The most destructive material on Earth is human flesh. The clue is in the anthropo part of anthropogenic climate change. If you really want to save the planet a radical cull is required, but if you’re too tender for that, worry not. The Verhulst model for population growth suggests that the adjustment will happen of itself.Peter Anderson(Consulting engineer to the cement industry), Barwick-in-Elmet, West Yorkshire
• In George Monbiot’s manifesto for climate strikers (Opinion, 20 February), he suggests: “The world has been thrown into climate chaos, caused by fossil fuel companies, the billionaires who profit from them and the politicians they have bought.” And he proposes the restoration of the “benign conditions in which humans and other species can thrive”.
Unfortunately, he’s completely missed one of the main issues driving climate change, namely the huge increase in the number of people living on this planet. When he was born in 1963 the world population was 3.2 billion. Today, just 56 years later, it’s around 7.7 billion. It’s precisely the success of our thriving human population that is causing untold damage around the world to the “other species” he mentions. We’re adding around 81 million people a year to the world’s population, and climate change is just one of the consequences of massive population growth. It’s no good just reducing carbon emissions; we also need to have fewer children. This will be the fastest way to save our planet.
And politicians, economists and businesspeople must stop talking about “growth” being a good thing. We urgently need to start planning to decrease our population growth and our economies and world travel, and put a halt to flagrant spending on throwaway goods etc. Only then will our (far fewer) grandchildren have a better life.Jonathan CockburnHewelsfield, Gloucestershire
• Jonathan Watts does us an important service (Decline in biodiversity ‘threatens food crisis’, 22 February) in bringing to our attention the comprehensive UN report on the state of the world’s biodiversity with respect to our need for food, and the many factors threatening food production.
Too often, particular threats to humanity are identified, attracting justified concern and attention, when they themselves have a more fundamental upstream cause. Climate change is driven by climate changers, all 7.7 billion of us, increasing at more than 80 million annually. Each new soul will need additional food, energy, housing, education and health services, and clean water and air in an increasingly polluted world.
We have to talk about population. Charities such as Population Matters, for whom Sir David Attenborough and several other scientists are patrons, show how entirely non-coercive and proven ways are available for the reduction and reversal of population growth urgently required. When women have access to education and contraception, they will not choose to have more children than they can support. Population decline follows.Richard VernonIffley, Oxfordshire

There are approximately 1 billion years before the Sun expands into a Red Giant and engulfs the Earth.
BQEND
No, it'll be 5 billion years before the Sun reaches the red giant stage of its evolution. However, due to the process that powers the Sun, it gets about 10% hotter every billion years.

It ended with a call for some hope and optimism about a generation of children being raised with an awareness of the impending climate catastrophe. Wallace-Wells may well have been thinking of Greta Thunberg.
The problem for any of us when thinking about the vast scale of the climate crisis is “what difference can I make?” That didn’t seem to be a consideration for the Swedish teenager. Last August, as we reported in the Guardian Weekly, Greta refused to go to school and sat outside the Swedish parliament demanding her government take more urgent action on the climate. Within weeks, the School Strikes For Climate spread, from a handful of teens in The Hague to tens of thousands in Australia. This week, thousands of British and Swedish teens were expected to walk out of their schools. Then, on 15 March, a global, coordinated strike will take place across the world. In this week’s big story we look at this heartening, angry reaction to a world set on fire by adults. Then, on page 48, the novelist John Lanchester laments the legacy of those happy to bequeath a burning earth. We also have a handful of other “climate fightback” stories throughout the magazine that ought to inspire as much hope as fear.
Speaking of iffy legacies ... the ghost at the wake of Britain’s shambolic last two and a half years has been David Cameron. The former Conservative prime minister won re-election in 2015 promising a referendum that would solves his party’s EU infighting for ever. Alas, that didn’t quite go as he planned and since he walked away from 10 Downing Street in July 2016, the moderniser formerly known as “Dave” has mainly been sat in a $30,000 caravan/wooden writing hut working on his memoirs. Gaby Hinsliff investigates Cameron’s six-year rule and the decision to call the fateful in/out vote and asks the important question: how did it all go so terribly wrong? 
We also return to Venezuela, where Nicolás Maduro remains in power despite the best efforts of self-declared president Juan Guaidó. Our report looks at the role the house-arrested opposition leader Leopoldo López played in the rise of Guaidó. We also head to Nigeria, where Muhammadu Buhari – who won office on an anti-graft ticket – seeks re-election this week, and Oliver Wainwright visits New York to try to get to the top and bottom of why Manhattan’s skyline is being taken over by incredibly thin, incredibly tall “skinnyscrapers”.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/feb/13/kids-v-climate-change-inside-the-15-february-edition-of-the-guardian-weekly

In 2016, I had an article published in the scientific literature entitled Insect biology – a vulnerable discipline?, highlighting the good that insects do as well as the bad, and how necessary research is on insects, but also how this has been eroded for many years by reductions in both government and industrial funding.
For example, Rothamsted Research in Hertfordshire, where I spent most of my career, used to have a thriving entomological research community working on various aspects concerning the role of insects in the agroecosystem. However, especially since the early years of this century, most of this vital work has been terminated due to severe cutbacks in funding, with very few projects surviving. In my view, considering the importance of insects as described in your article, renewed funding is urgently required to continue such essential exploration of insect science in all its diversity.Hugh LoxdaleHonorary visiting professor, School of Biosciences, University of Cardiff
• A stark warning has again been issued by scientists over the catastrophic damage that intensive chemical farming and the use of agricultural pesticides is doing to wildlife, insects, nature and the environment. Not only that but these highly toxic agrochemicals are already known to be causing devastating damage to the health and lives of rural residents and communities around the world, as pesticides have been associated with a catalogue of chronic health conditions including neurological diseases, various cancers, respiratory problems and others.
Pesticides are poisons and should never have been used in the production of food in the first place, and certainly not for spraying where people live and breathe, especially babies, children, pregnant women, the elderly, and people already ill and/or disabled. A vital amendment to the agriculture bill has recently been tabled by Caroline Lucas for the prohibition of agricultural pesticides near residents’ homes, schools, nurseries, and hospitals, among other areas. Now is the time for MPs – especially those in rural constituencies – to also sign up to and support this crucial amendment.
Removing toxic chemicals completely from food production would protect not only the health of rural residents and communities, as well as other members of the public, but also the environment, wildlife, pollinators, and other species that – as the new global scientific review has rightly identified – are being wiped out from the continued use of such toxic chemicals.Georgina DownsUK Pesticides Campaign, Chichester, West Sussex
• Stating that the rate of extinction of insects is eight times faster than that of mammals, birds and reptiles is highly misleading. I have shown the rate of extinction of many insect groups is remarkably close to that of terrestrial vertebrates, at least for areas and insects for which we have good data. Indeed, birds may be the best indicators of rates of terrestrial species extinction overall – enabling rapid assessment of priority areas.
Population loss, which is what you are describing, is of less concern than extinction, because extinction cannot be reversed. Fortunately, population loss can sometimes be reversed – particularly by rewilding. Moreover, some of the reported population “collapses” are disputable, as in Puerto Rico, because they confound insect abundance with reduced activity. It can be argued we are in a mass extinction event – but not on this evidence.Clive HamblerLecturer in biological and human sciences, Hertford College, University of Oxford
• Your excellent editorial (A silent global catastrophe is under way among the insects all other life needs, 12 February) alerts us to this looming catastrophe. But you let us off the hook by suggesting that change relies on individual actions. These are not enough. The crisis needs more than this from us. We need to act together as warriors for a humanity threatened by gathering climate breakdown. Everything needs to change, as Naomi Klein spells out so brilliantly in This Changes Everything. We should eat organic food, of course, but also join a movement like Extinction Rebellion and harass our MPs to take the planet seriously.Alastair SawdayPublisher, Bristol
• Your two editorials of 12 February expose the, perhaps insurmountable, problem in addressing the environmental catastrophes we face. The first editorial demanded policies to create more economic growth, ie more consumption, while the second stated a few paragraphs later that “we must consume less in every way”. No one seems to have noticed the blatant contradiction. It is a contradiction fundamental to all attempts by our current economic and social systems to address the existential ecological crisis confronting humanity.Stephen SmithGlasgow
• If that innocent cow pictured in your article on insect decline had been an organic creature, she would have been outside eating grass, feeding myriad insects on her blood and cowpats. In turn swallows and swifts would be feeding on the same insects. If grazing animals are banished from fields and moorlands and mountains, the insects will never survive the predations wrought on them by pesticides in the arable fields. The answer is of course organic mixed farming. Crops in this system are grown without artificial fertilisers derived from petrochemicals but depend on healthy and vigorous soil nourished by animal manure. Growing strong on this, in a proper rotation, they resist insect damage.Penelope ReidWantage, Oxfordshire

Organisers said more than 10,000 young people in at least 60 towns and cities from the Scottish Highlands to Cornwall joined the strike, defying threats of detention to voice their frustration at the older generation’s inaction on the environmental impact of climate change.
Anna Taylor, 17, one of the most prominent voices to emerge from the new movement, said the turnout had been overwhelming. “It goes some way to proving that young people aren’t apathetic, we’re passionate, articulate and we’re ready to continue demonstrating the need for urgent and radical climate action.”
Organisers estimated around 3,000 schoolchildren and young people gathered in London, with 2,000 in Oxford, 1,000 each in Exeter and Leeds and several hundred in Brighton, Bristol, Sheffield and Glasgow.
In London, the protesters held banners and chanted as police and onlookers watched. They blocked the roads outside parliament chanting “Turn off your engines” at passing cars, and “We want the chance for change now” before mounted police moved them away. There were three arrests in London in connection with the protests. A 19-year-old man and a 16-year-old girl were arrested for obstructing the highway, and a 17-year-old boy for a public order offence.
In Manchester, hundreds gathered outside the Central Library before marching to the Royal Northern College of Music with signs reading “Climate over capitalism” and chanting “Whose future? Our future.”
Matt Sourby, 18, said his journey from Queen Elizabeth school in Kirkby Lonsdale, Cumbria, was worth it: “This is our future and this is making a difference. The government has to listen. I feel incredibly powerful just being here.”
The protests won the backing of a former UN climate chief, who said it was “time to heed the deeply moving voice of youth”.
Christiana Figueres, who led the historic 2015 Paris agreement, said the fact that children were so worried about their future they were prepared to strike should make adults sit up and take notice.
“It is a sign that we are failing in our responsibility to protect them from the worsening impacts of climate change,” she said.
The school strike movement started in August when Greta Thunberg, then 15, held a solo protest outside the Swedish parliament. Now, up to 70,000 schoolchildren each week hold protests in 270 towns and cities worldwide.
On Friday, tens of thousands marched again, some for the sixth week in succession, through towns and cities across Europe.
For the first time up to 1,000 pupils demonstrated in Paris chanting “Don’t go breaking my earth” and “One, two, three degrees – a crime against humanity”.
In Berlin, a large crowd gathered for the sixth week in a row. “We’re here now because we want to be able to be here in 50 years’ time,” read one banner.
Thunberg (16) began a solo climate protest by striking from school in Sweden in August 2018. She has since been joined by tens of thousands of school and university students in Australia, Belgium, Germany, the United States, Japan and more than a dozen other countries.
Speaking at the United Nations climate conference in December 2018, she berated world leaders for behaving like irresponsible children. And in January 2019 she rounded on the global business elite in Davos: “Some people, some companies, some decision-makers in particular, have known exactly what priceless values they have been sacrificing to continue making unimaginable amounts of money. And I think many of you here today belong to that group of people.”
Veteran climate campaigners are astonished by what has been achieved in such a short time. Thunberg has described the rapid spread of school strikes for climate around the world as amazing. “It proves you are never too small to make a difference,” she said. Her protests were inspired by US students who staged walk-outs to demand better gun controls in the wake of multiple school shootings.
Her mother, Malena Ernman, has given up her international career as an opera singer because of the climate effects of aviation. Her father is actor Svante Thunber. Greta has Asperger’s syndrome, which in the past has affected her health, he says. She sees her condition not as a disability but as a gift which has helped open her eyes to the climate crisis.

Individual protests have previously been held in the UK, but the nationwide action on Friday was the first coordinated walkout.
Organisers in the UK said that two weeks ago they would have been happy if hundreds of young people had taken part. But they said the huge turnout – in the face of threats of recriminations from some schools and criticism in sections of the media – showed the strength of feeling among young people about the climate crisis.
Jake Woodier, of the UK Youth Climate Coalition, said: “What we’ve witnessed today is thousands upon thousands of students and young people descend on their towns and cities to demonstrate the urgent need for radical climate action.” 
He said a new generation of young leaders was emerging – many of them young women – who had spread the message about the climate crisis and the strike through social media, radio, television and newspapers over the past two weeks.
“The size of the Youth Strike 4 Climate is testament to the passion and awareness among young people that we need to fight for a future that simply doesn’t exist because we’ve been betrayed by the inaction of those in positions of power.”
The strike was supported by the Green MP Caroline Lucas and several frontbench Labour MPs. Their leader, Jeremy Corbyn, tweeted that climate change was the greatest threat people faced and young people were “right to feel let down by the generation before them and it’s inspiring to see them making their voice heard today”.
There was also support from some Tory MPs – including the energy minister Claire Perry – although others criticised the protests. Downing Street said that while it was important for young people to engage with issues such as climate change, the disruption to planned lesson time was damaging for pupils.
“It is important to emphasise that disruption increases teachers’ workloads and wastes lesson time that teachers have carefully prepared for,” a spokesperson for No 10 said. “That time is crucial for young people, precisely so that they can develop into the top scientists, engineers and advocates we need to help tackle this problem.”
However Thunberg hit back at the Conservative government, saying on Twitter that political leaders had wasted 30 years by not taking action against climate change.
British PM says that the children on school strike are “wasting lesson time”. That may well be the case. But then again, political leaders have wasted 30 yrs of inaction. Andthat is slightly worse.#schoolstrike4climate #FridaysForFuture #ClimateStrike https://t.co/PoSCXin3VN
The latest UN report warned there were 12 years remaining to avoid the worst effects of global warming, from record-breaking droughts and heatwaves to warming oceans and melting ice sheets.
In the last week alone scientists have warned of a catastrophic collapse of insect population with devastating consequences for humanity, and a separate report said human-caused threats to climate, nature and the economy posed a danger of systemic economic collapse unless radical action is taken.
The young people taking part in Friday’s strike called on the government to declare a climate emergency, communicate the severity of the ecological crisis and change the curriculum to make the state of the environment an educational priority.
They also want recognition that since young people have the biggest stake in the future they should be involved in policymaking, and are demanding that the voting age be lowered to 16.
Earlier this week, more than 200 academics, including almost 100 professors, backed the strike, saying the “tragic and desperate facts” of the unfolding climate emergency and the lack of meaningful action by politicians left young people with little option but to take matters into their own hands.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/15/uk-climate-change-strike-school-pupils-children-environment-protest

I’ll add that we have something approaching hysteria about CO2 in the atmosphere and the resultant changes in climate.

However, the chemical load on the environment from all sorts of petrochemicals and other synthetics will almost certainly, I’m beginning to think, be far more significant in the long run. Certainly, plastics are getting a lot of attention these days alongside several other issues, but this placement of CO2 at the center of the story is bothering me as a tremendous and dangerous oversimplification of the continuing efforts we will have to make in order to maintain a pleasurable human existence on this planet.

The potato blight, that was associated with the death of a million Irish in the years around 1847 and the emigration of a million more, infected potato crops throughout Europe without famine on that scale. In the decades following the famine, a movement among the Irish to reclaim their land took hold and when the next potato blight took hold in the late 1870s exports of food from Ireland were stopped and the country avoided famine. The famine motivated Irish nationalism and increased the influence of the Catholic Church.

'Abrupt thaw' of permafrost beneath lakes could significantly affect climate change models Date: August 16, 2018 Source: University of Alaska Fairbanks Summary: Methane released by thawing permafrost from some Arctic lakes could significantly accelerate climate change, according to a new study. Unlike shallow, gradual thawing of terrestrial permafrost, the abrupt thaw beneath thermokarst lakes is irreversible this century. Even climate models that project only moderate warming this century will have to factor in their emissions, according to the researchers.

In five grand canvases, Thomas Cole described an arc from nature, through pastoralism and empire, to desolation. This is the archetypal story of rise and fall.
In The Uninhabitable Earth, David Wallace-Wells now takes up Cole’s mantle, updated for the 21st century. We’re at the apex of the story arc, pivoting from blind triumph to hubristic ruin. He tells of coming climate catastrophes, brought on by our complacency and profligacy. These devastations will likely end history, culture and ethics as we know them. The portents surround us, but we wilfully turn away. A glimmer of hope, though, is present if we mend our ways.
There is much to learn from this book. From media and scientific reports of the past decade, Wallace-Wells sifts key predictions and conveys them in vivid prose. He trebles the size of the Book of Revelation’s posse of horsemen, elucidating a dozen categories of anguish including heat death, conflagration, poisoned air and water, psychological trauma, and societal collapse. As he points out, none of this is news. Yet for most of us, the terrifying projections of where our planet is headed arrive in our ears overwhelmed by a cacophony of media reports blaring the day’s politics and entertainment.
For those not steeped in news about climate change, this is a lively introduction to both the latest predictions and their uncertainties. Wallace-Wells not only summarises recent projections, but excavates important unifying themes. Rapidity is one of these. The climate crisis was largely created by the actions of just a single generation. The physiological and psychological limits of human life are another. Many climate projections indicate that we’ll increasingly cross these limits. The latter part of the book is less grounded in science and data, and comprises a series of riffs about the future of human culture and society.
Billions know how bad things are, through their intellects, emotions and lived realities
If you’ve snoozed through or turned away from the climate change news, this book will waken and update you. If you’re steeped in the unfolding climate drama, Wallace-Wells’s voice and perspective will be stimulating, even when you don’t agree with every interpretation and rhetorical move. This is part of his aim: to startle and shake us.
The valuable core of the book is contained within a rind of unnecessary exaggeration. The book’s title belies its contents. Nowhere does he claim that Earth will be uninhabitable. Bill McKibben’s recent summary is more apt: the habitable area of the planet is shrinking, a calamity vast enough not to need overstating. The opening paragraphs of the book burn strawmen to fuel the claim that “you” readers do not understand how bad things are. Billions of people do, in fact, understand how bad things are, through their intellects, emotions and lived realities. The claim that bitcoin “consumes more electricity than is generated by all the world’s solar panels combined” misuses a speculative projection in a Grist article and is off by a factor of 100 (in 2017, bitcoin used about 2.55GW, global photovoltaic capacity was 398GW). Such claims are eye-catching and get the story in front of the insouciant. But they are also what alienated many climate researchers from Wallace-Wells’s New York Magazine essay of the same title.
Yet, occasional factual errors aside, where “exaggeration” starts is hard to say given our improvident trajectory. A time of crisis demands a multiplicity of responses, including voices of alarm. Not every call to action will strike the same balance between woe and hope. That Wallace-Wells has irritated some contemporary specialists in “climate communication” is perhaps a healthy sign that discussions of climate are now reaching far beyond the measured discourse of academia and intergovernmental panels.
How, then, to act in the face of these frightening projections? This is not a book of solutions. Wallace-Wells outlines some political and economic pathways – taxes and public investments – but gives them little exposition. He’s dismissive about the value of changes in individual behaviours. He writes that choices by the “consumer class” about food and childbearing are manifestations of “ascetic pride” and “cop-outs”. He insists that he’s “not about to go vegan”, delivering a critique of consumerist neoliberalism with a burger in his hand. Consumer choices are largely distractions from or substitutes for political action, he argues. But this ignores the possibility that individual action might be a prerequisite to political change. Reformation of the self, including our behaviours as consumers, can inspire, inform and sustain political and cultural action. This is perhaps especially true for storytellers who wield influence through their widely heard voices.
Like Cole before him, Wallace-Wells’s project is a moral one, an indictment of his culture. Both narratives aim to convince us that the guiding beliefs of our times are wrong. But unlike Cole, who believed that self-annihilation was inevitable, Wallace-Wells insists that we can snap the narrative arc of rise and fall. Amid his stories of desolation and travail, he underscores our agency. This accounts for the excitement he feels about his newborn daughter’s future. She will live on a planet burned, flooded and baked out of recognition. But she will also, he believes, be a participant in what he calls “literally the greatest story ever told”, the possibility that calamity might somehow catalyse “a happy ending”.
If we are to find such an ending, it will not come from disembodied analysis alone. The book’s greatest omission is a lack of fieldwork. In its pages, we don’t go into the streets to talk to people, to hear their insights and perspectives. Instead, we hear Wallace-Wells interpreting an impressive stack of news clippings, interviews with specialists, and papers. But even the best scientific paper is one step removed from its subjects. In Walt Whitman’s words, we “take things at second or third hand”. Our greatest fear should perhaps be that we have forgotten how to listen to the living Earth.

In a tense exchange in a Senate estimates hearing on Monday, senators Anne Urqhuart and Kristina Keneally asked the environment department and Coalition senator Simon Birmingham to explain the most recent emissions projections published by the government.
On current trajectories, the department’s report projects Australia’s emissions will reach 563m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2030, which would equal a 7% cut on 2005 emissions levels. Australia’s target is for a 26-28% reduction on 2005 levels. The department told the hearing 2018 emissions levels reached 534m tonnes.
Urquhart asked if this meant the country’s emissions were increasing, but the department argued its numbers were “conservative”.
“It’s not a forecast of what is the potential to happen,” said Jo Evans, the deputy secretary for climate change and energy innovation. “I guess what I’m saying is while it’s a projection, it’s very conservative.”
Evans told the hearing there were measures the department hadn’t factored into its projections that could close the gap further, such as more technological innovation, or a change in policy.
The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has claimed Australia will meet its targets “in a canter”, but multiple quarterly emissions reports have shown the country’s greenhouse gas emissions tracking upwards.
Urquhart asked if it was correct that, based on the department’s current data, Australia would miss its target by 19%.
“The only way that would be a true statement is if nothing else happened between now and then ... either in unexpected ways or in changes or amendments to the current policy suite.”
But Keneally challenged the government on the extent to which current policies were working and what its confidence was based on that it could meet its commitments.
Birmingham replied the current policies had “steered” the country towards beating its 2020 target.
“So it’s hope?” Keneally said.
“When you assert that we are going to meet our targets, is it based on policies you have already announced or policies you intend to announce in future?” Keneally asked.
Birmingham said the government had made it clear it would be making further announcements on climate change policy leading up to the election.
“We indeed are continually working, as the prime minister has publicly acknowledged, within government on further policy settings that will help to ensure we meet the same trajectory in relation to our 2030 commitments,” he said.
Keneally replied: “So if I could summarise, you’re hoping that past performance is an indicator of future success and that future success will be predicated not on policies you’ve already announced but on some things you’ve yet to announce.” 
Later in the hearing, the independent senator Tim Storer grilled the government on its intentions to rely on carryover credits from Kyoto to meet Australia’s target.
Birmingham said “as has been made clear previously and as is consistent with the way in which the Kyoto agreement has worked previously, the government would intend to use carryover if required”.
Storer said the department’s emissions projections data suggested Australia could rely on carryover credits from beating previous Kyoto targets to meet more than half of its international commitments.
He asked if other countries intended to rely on carryover, which Birmingham said he would have to answer on notice.
Richie Merzian, the director of The Australia Institute’s climate and energy program, said it was little wonder school students were protesting about a lack of climate leadership at a national level.
“It is disheartening to hear the government defend Australia’s woeful climate policies and rising emissions in Senate estimates,” he said.
“The government confirmed it is openly using loopholes from a past agreement to meet over half its 2030 reduction target and doesn’t share the view of neighbours like New Zealand that such dodgy practices are not in the spirit of the Paris Agreement.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/18/labor-accuses-coalition-of-relying-on-hope-to-meet-paris-emissions-targets

Among those that have set climate goals, only one in three stretch beyond 2025, according to the annual Carbon Disclosure Project report.
Instead, corporate action has focused in the boardroom, with 47% of firms rewarding their CEOs for climate performance, and a quarter tying incentives to environmental goals.
European firms now make up half of the CDP’s environmental “A-list” and the managing director for Europe, Steven Tebbe, praised climate disclosure’s entry into the financial mainstream.
“The next decade is vital if our shift to a sustainable economy is to be successful, and companies lie at the heart of this transition,” he said.
A-list companies on the Stoxx global climate change leaders index outperformed their peers by 5.5% per annum this decade, he noted.
Although 53% of companies surveyed did not yet have climate goals, 58% reported carbon cuts in 2018, amounting to a total reduction of the equivalent of 85m tonnes of CO2 – as much as Austria’s annual emissions.
One third of companies reported increased emissions.
One A-listed property management firm, Landsec, has cut its greenhouse gases by 17% since 2014 – on the way to a planned 40% tail-off by 2030.
Caroline Hill, Landsec’s head of sustainability, said: “We set what was the first science-based carbon reduction target in real estate, based on what was needed in our sector to to ensure the world keeps within 1.5 to 2C of global warming.”
She said the company drove down energy consumption in London offices and suburban retail parks by upgrading to LED lighting and systematically installing rooftop solar panels.
This year, CDP received climate disclosures from 849 European companies in 23 countries, with combined emissions of around 2.3bn tonnes of CO2 – a total greater than the UK, Germany and France combined.
Campaigners responded angrily to the inclusion on the A-list of fossil fuel firms such as Engie, Naturgy Energy Group SA and Neste Oyj, chemical firms Bayer AG and BASF, and food companies such as Nestlé.
Pascoe Sabido, a spokesman for Corporate Europe Observatory, said: “If these companies represent the crème de la crème of environmentally-friendly big businesses, then we really are in trouble. 
“They shouldn’t be celebrated, they should be kept as far away from our policy-makers as possible.”
Tebbe said: “We are not claiming these are perfect companies – far from it – but they are really going beyond the consensus and showing leadership in their sectors.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/19/majority-of-european-firms-have-no-co2-reduction-targets

The authority’s chief executive, Phillip Glyde, has invited the scientific community to collaborate on its work on climate change.
“The overwhelming scientific consensus is that climate change is currently affecting the Basin so more work is needed to inform future management strategies,” Glyde said.
“The MDBA’s discussion paper kicks off the next phase of work to better understand the likely impacts of climate change on the Basin in the future and to identify where the information gaps are.”
But the MDBA has strongly rejected the findings of the South Australian Royal Commission into the Murray Darling which accused it of gross maladministration of the plan. It said the royal commission effectively proposed abandoning the basin plan and starting again.
“The MDBA considers this would be a reckless act – setting back progress towards a healthy and sustainable Basin, and causing substantial uncertainty for Basin communities,” Glyde said.
“While many people support the concept of a Basin Plan, there is often sharp disagreement up and down the rivers, and across different stakeholder groups, about the most appropriate settings,” he said.
The MDBA’s role was to apply the best available science, feedback from the community and expert judgement to administer the plan and propose amendments.
On Monday a group of eminent scientists convened by the Academy of Science released a report saying that the fish kills at Menindee, which killed up to one million fish, were due to the low flows, caused by over-extraction upstream and exacerbated by the drought.
“Our review of the fish kills found there isn’t enough water in the Darling system to avoid catastrophic outcomes,” they warned.
The scientists pointed to serious deficiencies in governance and management, which have eroded the intent of the Water Act 2007 and the framework of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan.
One of the main criticisms of the basin plan by the royal commission and by scientists has been that the MDBA’s models use historical data to assess the variability of flows in the river, but do not take account of how climate change may be permanently altering rainfall and flows in the river system.
The models and the whole basin plan was based on work done in 2009 and it did not include any mechanism for taking account of climate change. It is due to be reviewed in 2026, but scientists say there is an urgent need to update the plan and the models that inform it, in light of what is actually happening to the river.
The Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists released a report last week, which studied the actual flows at two sites along the river – Wilcannia and Chowilla. It found that actual flows were much lower than those predicted to occur as a result of the plan being implemented.
The MDBA says that’s because the plan is partway through but in the case of the floodplains at Chowilla, none of the targets for environmental inundations needed to keep river red gums alive had been reached.
Glyde said the basin plan was drafted “as an adaptive plan with climate change in mind” though almost every decision to amend the plan has been about reducing environmental water targets in favour of irrigators.
Glyde acknowledged that the information about climate change, particularly in the northern basin, had advanced.

About 150 people from Extinction Rebellion formed human roadblocks and brought traffic to a standstill outside event venues on Sunday to cause disruption and urge the industry body to declare a climate emergency.
Farrell, who is also a spokeswoman for the direct action group, said she was approached by a police officer who addressed her by name when she was in the queue for the Bethany Williams show at 180 The Strand, London, on Tuesday afternoon, and was told she was not allowed to enter. 
“The police liaison officer said I could queue up but that the venue wouldn’t let me in,” Farrell said. “She referenced Extinction Rebellion and pointed to a badge I was wearing.”
Farrell, a fashion designer, said that she had helped produce Williams’ line, which is dedicated to social justice and sustainability, and that she had not been intending to protest at the event.
“To exclude a designer who was both involved in the production of the line and working to bring attention to the climate and ecological crises from the show is just unbelievable,” she added.
The group said Farrell had a ticket for the show, and that staff at the venue were informed of her multiple roles in the production of Williams’ award-winning line. Williams was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II design award for her work, which addresses environmental issues, by the Duchess of Cornwall on Tuesday night.
A spokesperson for the Metropolitan police said: “On Tuesday 19 February, the organisers of a private event taking place on The Strand in central London took a decision not to admit a member of the public to their event. This decision was conveyed to the member of the public by a police officer at the scene.”
On Sunday, the British Fashion Council said that it was “pleased that we live in a country where we have a right to protest peacefully”.
It said in a statement: “We believe that more than any other capital, London has an opportunity to be a part of a cultural change around sustainable business practices that put creative product at their core.
“This week we hope to both encourage the showcasing of these creative businesses whilst increasing the dialogue around mindful consumerism, one that we are raising ourselves through our Positive Fashion programme.”

By analyzing the fish fossils inside, researchers determined that global temperatures were stable for a long time before the asteroid impact, but then, afterwards, temperatures quickly rose and stayed about 5 degrees Celsius warmer for about 100,000 years. 
MacLeod says it's notable that the impact pumped up carbon dioxide over a short time span that, geologically speaking, is comparable to what humans have been doing in burning fossil fuels since the start of the Industrial Revolution.
""The atmosphere was loaded for a very brief interval of time, and the consequences of that change in atmospheric composition lasted for 100,000 years,"" MacLeod says. ""So it illustrates, I think, really strongly, even if we went back to 1850 levels of carbon dioxide emission, it's going to take a 100,000 years for the carbon dioxide that we've already put in the atmosphere to cycle through the Earth's systems.”

“A single chlorofluorocarbon factory can produce gases with a climate forcing that exceeds the forcing due to Earth orbital perturbations.” James Hansen, 2011 http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/mailings/2011/20110505_CaseForYoungPeople.pdf 
These “orbital perturbations” caused huge changes in climate due to amplifying feedbacks like ice melt and release of CO2 from warming oceans and methane from permafrost.
From PNAS in 2014: “Using satellite measurements, this analysis directly quantifies how much the Arctic as viewed from space has darkened in response to the recent sea ice retreat. We find that this decline has caused 6.4 ± 0.9 W/m2 of radiative heating since 1979, considerably larger than expectations from models and recent less direct estimates. Averaged globally, this albedo change is equivalent to 25% of the direct forcing from CO2 during the past 30 y.” https://www.pnas.org/content/111/9/3322
As the other half of the surface area of Arctic sea ice largely goes away by mid-century, that amplifying feedback will increase substantially. And the loss of seasonal snow cover in the North adds a similar amplifying feedback.

But if I cast my mind back to the middle of February 1998, I can still recall my surprise at the unusually mild weather.
I was filming at a west London gravel pit with Bill Oddie, and during the course of the day we saw four different species of butterfly on the wing. They were the quartet that habitually overwinter as adults – comma, peacock, small tortoiseshell and brimstone – each emerging on a mild spring day to feed on nectar.
The cause of this unexpected warm spell was high pressure over the continent, which brought warm air up from the Canary Islands and north-west Africa. This tropical maritime airstream meant temperatures reached the mid-teens across much of southern Britain, and even at night stayed much higher than normal. On 13 February, at Greenwich in south-east London, the temperature reached 19.7C (67.5F), breaking the UK February record.
Of course, it could not last, and by the 15th a cold front began to bring slightly cooler air – along with Sahara dust.

A report by the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) says that from 2025 at the latest, no new homes should be connected to the gas grid – with super-efficient houses and flats heated using low-carbon energy instead.
It also warns that UK homes are not fit for the future, with efforts to cut greenhouse gases from housing stalling and properties at growing risk of overheating and flooding.
The committee called on the government to get serious about tackling emissions from homes and ensuring they are adapted to cope with a future of more extreme weather.
The way new homes are built and existing properties are “retrofitted” with energy efficiency measures often falls short of stated design standards, deceiving householders and inflicting costs on the future, the committee said.
Closing the “performance gap” between design standards and what is achieved could save those in new homes between £70 and £260 a year on their energy bills, the report said.
Cash-strapped councils need better funding to help enforce building standards and there should be stiffer penalties for non-compliance, it said. The Treasury should support, as a “major infrastructure priority”, measures in existing homes to install low-carbon heating such as heat pumps, loft and wall insulation, and protection for properties at risk of flooding.
Support is also needed to train designers, builders and installers of climate-friendly technology to address the low-carbon skills gap and create green jobs.
Baroness Brown, the chair of the CCC’s adaptation subcommittee, said: “There are almost 30m homes in the UK, and the depressing fact is most of them are not in a condition to keep us comfortable and productive and well as the climate changes.
“They are a huge part of the problem – energy use in our homes is around a fifth of greenhouse gases, and the biggest part of those emissions is from burning gas for heating and hot water.”
A government committed to meeting climate targets, which require net zero emissions to curb rising temperatures, “has to get serious about this” she said.
Brown suggested the government should be demanding much higher standards through measures to encourage building 300,000 new homes a year.
“We shouldn’t be allowing 300,000 substandard homes that will need upgrading to be built, they should be built to the right standard now,” she said.
“We could tell house builders who are making a lot of money from help to buy that it’s only available for homes of a really high quality.”
A government spokesman said it would carefully consider the recommendations, adding: “The UK has reduced emissions faster than any other G7 nation, and moving to a greener, cleaner economy while continuing to grow the economy is at the heart of our modern industrial strategy.
“Over the next 10 years, we have committed to drive £6bn to improve the energy efficiency of lower income and vulnerable households.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/21/ban-new-gas-boilers-by-2025-says-committee-on-climate-change

After nine Aboriginal children died in a hepatitis epidemic, the council built them houses made of tin (it was nicknamed Silver City).And speaking of epidemics, the 50s was the age of the worldwide polio epidemic - plenty of children to be seen wearing calipers on their legs, and left with life-long health problems - if they lived. Vaccines for polio and TB were not introduced until the mid-50s, and I remember lining up at school to be vaccinated. With hepatitis, there was a vaccine, but it was only available from a GP (no Medicare then), which is why the Aborigines died. Also, many baby-boomers were damaged by the effects of the 2nd World War, either because they lost their fathers, or because they were harmed or abandoned by fathers brutalised or traumatised by war. Not to mention the children of refugees and displaced people, who ended up in this strange country, and had to pretty much fend for themselves. My generation is the generation that fought for social justice, the rights of women and children, and against war. It has been a long hard fight, and it's always been one step forward, two steps back, because of the vested interests stacked against us - those are the vested interests against which you should be railing, not damning a whole generation. FYI We also implemented the technological revolution without which you would not survive today. We remember a world without computers, the Internet, and even TV. We didn't always have free education - it was brought in for a very short time under Gough Whitlam, but did not last.

In 1992, LA erupted in response to police violence. Throughout the 1990s, the pioneers of third-wave and intersectional feminism challenged all expressions of misogyny, patriarchy and homophobia. 
If the boomers had the abortive revolution of 1968, we had 1999 and 2000. In Seattle, at Woomera and in Melbourne, an anti-authoritarian, leftwing protest politics was enacted which was unconnected to authoritarian state socialism, and had nothing to do with the cold war.
BQEND
Much of which began well. These movements have since themselves become authoritarian, often without those inside even realising it, and are now a bigger risk to society than what they sought to change (or now, replace).
Many of gen x, including myself, looked hopefully, even smugly, to the promise that the rapid development and widespread deployment of new technologies would solve the most the most difficult of our problems. And great strides have been made. The mistake was in thinking that they would, or even could, solve social problems. In a world of greater physical surplus, it won't and it can't. 
This:

As the last who remember the cold war, who were adults as the war on terrorism began, it is up to us to remind people why they must resist such solutions.

Most importantly we must, as we age, know when to exhibit what may be our best trait, and a skill that the boomers never mastered. We must remember when to fade into the background, when to let others say their piece. We should endeavour to become, where circumstances require it, like ghosts.

You cannot preserve in the minds of all the lessons of the past and at the same time fade into the background. Of course, the caveat ""where circumstances require it"" is the catch.

The other thing I find curious is this constant waiting on baby boomers to die. I'm not a baby boomer but my parents are and, call me sentimental, I can't say I'm in any rush to see them go!
But this is the thing about breaking things into tribes. Whether we're turning on other races or ages, it's all about de-personalising the ""other"" so we can blame someone else.
Presumably moaning G-X'ers, millenials and Whatever-am-I-als all have parents many of whom are baby boomers. I wonder do they blame their own parents or just ""other people's parents"". I want my parents to live but those lot over there to die. 
The main reason for this impatience is of course the advances in modern medicine which have blessed us all with living longer. One of the downsides to living longer is that everything gets drawn out. I'm making shit up now but for Baby Boomers the model was basically:
20-30 Get a job, get married, buy a house, have children30-65 Work65 Retire.
For later generations that's all been pushed back by at least 10 years:
20-30 study and travel30-40 Get a job, get married, those lucky enough buy a house and use IVF to have children40-75 Work75 Retire.
There's a good chance that people may become first time buyers (if at all) in their 50s when the sad day comes that our parents can no longer be with us.

If we're going to tackle climate change we need to unite people behind a single objective. The war generation had a single objective - winning the war. Everything was viewed in relation to that one goal. People sacrificed their lives and their money for that one goal. Today that is how that generation is defined. We look upon that generation with gratitude and respect. They sacrificed themselves so that we could live in freedom.
Our generation has the chance to be remembered in the same way. Except the sacrifice we make will not involve dying. It will simply involve re-adjusting our lives. We won't even need to get anywhere close to the level of rationing that the WW2 generation reached. And we will be remembered fondly for it.
We could call this period The Great Sacrifice (don't forget the capital T). For a sustained period of 5 to 10 years our generation will declare a world war on climate change. Every man, woman and people who identify as neither will work towards this one goal.
Here's what some countries spent in WW2 dollars:
1. U.S : $296 billion (roughly $4,104 billion dollars today)2. Germany : $272 billion3. Britain : $120 billion4. Soviet Union : $192 billion5. Italy : $94 billion6. Japan : $56 billion.
How did they afford this?
Well because governments with their own currencies can afford lots of stuff but also because all resources, all spending, everything was directed to the war effort. Imagine this money being thrown at the war against climate change?
What would that look like:
Some of the solutions are just about putting in the hard yards. Nearly every building needs new insulation so we just need to get on and do it. In Australia we need to paint the roofs of houses a brighter colour. [Go the war effort]
Some the solutions require existing or emerging technology like smart meters, new battery technology, new sources of power etc. So for this we just need to get on and innovate. 
Some of the solutions require a whole new forms of science and technology. This would require bringing all of the finest minds together to deal with this one challenge. A global Manhattan Project. We need new developments in food production (e.g. lab grown food), new types of cities (domed and floating cities) and, yes, colonisation of Mars or another planet. There's 7.5b people and counting on this planet and that is one of the main causes of climate change. We need another planet. 
Like the actual world wars, it is not guaranteed that we will win the climate change world war. We may never be able to get off this planet. But by god can we try.
If we try and fail then future generations might look at us like the Gallipoli generation. But if don't try at all, well, we'll be viewed like the generation of Germans from the 1930s to 1950s.

I sometimes wonder, though, whether whatever is distinctive in my generation’s experience (and haunting our minds) might have something to offer the future.
After a brief flurry of interest in the 1990s, thinkpieces on my demographic quickly waned. There were never that many of us; the meat in the sandwich was and is meagre.
Tired of their younger cousins and brothers, around the turn of the century, boomer pundits pivoted to an obsession with their millennial children. Those children stared back at them with mostly well-founded resentment. Both sides continue to have this out, ad nauseam.
This oedipal struggle has tended to crowd us out; as the New Yorker writer Emily Nussbaum pointed out, Generation X is now sometimes forgotten altogether in articles pondering generational difference. In a tweet Nussbaum called our generation “gloomy, curmudgeonly ghosts”. By trying to relieve the gloom with a self-deprecating wisecrack, she exemplified another generational tic.
The flipside of the irony and gloom that characterised Gen X culture may be a kind of pragmatic resilience
This relative invisibility has had many consequences. One is that, while the economic plight of millennials has been considered at length, the difficulties of Generation X, which in some ways paralleled or even prefigured them, have received less attention.
My sliver of Generation X (I’m 45) exited high school into the early 1990s recession. The oldest Xers did the same a decade earlier. On the way to Brisbane for university back then, I remember that each provincial Queensland town I passed through looked like a bomb had hit it. After a brief moment where the same towns were full of jet skis and new utes, post-boom, post-flood, many have now returned to their former state.
This was formative: I for one never expected to find a real job. (Outside a few brief stretches, this expectation has been met).
Although Generation X were the last to taste the fruits of postwar, middle-class stability in advanced economies, they were also the first to see major elements of it snatched away – especially in Australia.
In Australia, after 1989, we didn’t receive a free higher education as many baby boomers did (I still have student debt). We were the first whose adult lives unfolded entirely under the cold skies of a “reformed” neoliberal economy, with weakened worker power and radically diminished job security (not to mention social security). We were the first not to exceed their parents in terms of many markers of wealth and success.
We have also had to wait longest for the boomers to leave the stage. Way back in 1997, Mark Davis’s Gangland spelled out the stranglehold that baby boomers retained on Australian cultural life. Sadly, while the book expressed the feelings of a generation, it didn’t change much. Even now, many of the commanding heights of the culture are still in the possession of a generation that refuses to retire, despite Gen Xers entering what would ordinarily be understood as their late career.
As was pointed out in a recent episode of US-based The Nostalgia Trap podcast, those early economic travails may be what gives so much of the youth culture of the 1990s – the only decade that Generation X can really call its own – a distinctive, depressive quality.
Grunge – both the Seattle-born musical genre and the short-lived Australian literary movement – aestheticised the conditions of unemployed dirtbaggery that the 1990s forced upon us.
Praise, the ur-grunge-lit novel by recently deceased Brisbane writer Andrew McGahan, blankly told the story of Gordon, a man who lives in a boarding house, and drifted drunk and aimless through his life. Gordon can’t be described as a failure because there’s little indication that he’s really trying.
To the extent that Generation X received much attention, it was during this period: the time when we — and our designated generational representatives — were declaring ourselves creeps, losers, slackers. It may have displaced analysis away from the structural causes of our failure to economically thrive, but there are worse coping strategies.
Other more militant expressions of disenfranchisement that were not simply generational appeared in hip-hop. NWA’s records anticipated the grimness of much of the alt-rock boom but transmitted the devastated post-Reagan social landscape of the United States much more vividly. Hip-hop was also more specifically targeted for censorship in the wake of the Los Angeles riots. During the 1990s Australia’s pop culture institutions, such as Triple J mostly shut out hip-hop altogether.
The achievement in all of this cultural expression was to take seriously the idea that there may be no golden future. Some of it questioned the idea that there may be any future at all.
Unfortunately (for some of us at least) a future has after all arrived. According to most definitions that offer precise generational boundaries, Generation X are those born between the mid-1960s and the late 1970s. (Boomers and millennials even get to inhabit larger slices of time, with two decades apiece).
This means that, as of 2019, the entire generational cohort has entered the broadly recognised parameters of middle age; the oldest Gen-Xers are now in their mid-50s, and some now eligible to cash in whatever superannuation they might have managed to accumulate.
The next stop is old age. What will we do with it? Many boomers have failed the test of ageing gracefully. That generation’s youth has endlessly been replayed to the rest of us as a moment of near-revolutionary exuberance (in his book Generation X, Douglas Coupland identified the mandatory veneration of the 1960s as “legislated nostalgia”).
But now, some boomers have hardened; too many are shouty Facebook uncles or Nimby aunts. Not all boomers are reactionary, or economically privileged, of course. But disproportionately it is boomers – especially white boomers – who elected their generational counterpart Donald Trump president of the United States. Also, boomers disproportionately voted in favour of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union.
Given its more cramped and gloomy formative years, can Generation X age more gracefully? Once again, the answer may come in the midst of circumstances we would not have chosen, given the chance. The tests ahead are sterner than those that any generation has faced in some time.
Generation X will grow to old age in a world which (it seems inevitable now) will be ravaged by the effects of climate change. We may be the last to grow old in anything resembling a stable form of modern civilisation.
The stresses currently warping politics in liberal democracies are set to become worse. There will be more refugees as a result of climate change, and the refugee crisis may hit even closer to home: parts of Australia and the American south-west will be effectively uninhabitable. Some places are almost there already.
Our economies are likely to be irreparably damaged as cities and towns are repeatedly pounded by storms, wildfires and floods. We may not be able to grow enough food — we may even have trouble pollinating some food plants due to the decline of insects.
As resource constraints increase, so will conflicts over them. Wars of all kinds – civil, global – will be more likely in a world turning upside down. A new book by David Wallace-Wells, The Uninhabitable Earth, spells out all of the likely consequences in detail.
The boomers can take comfort in the fact that most of them will be dead before the worst of this arrives from the middle of the century. Generation X will likely face dire crises in what may otherwise have been its golden years. Those of us with children have even more to worry about. When we understood, early, that we may not do as well as our parents did, we didn’t know the half of it.
To the extent that the world looks to the old for wisdom, we will be in the hot seat. What will we do? What advice can we give? We may be better prepared for it than we imagine.
For one, some of us have been hearing about climate change since we were schoolchildren. We are far less likely to deny the realities of what is happening than our predecessors. (Research in the US suggests an age gap on climate change – only 31% of 65+ Americans in 2015 believed it was happening due to human activity, whereas majorities did in all age groups under 50).
So we may be more prepared to recommend or support radical solutions in a way that our complacent elders have not.
We also have a radical political history of our own, which the culture has not memorialised, which too many of us have forgotten, and which we may be able to draw on.
In 1992, LA erupted in response to police violence. Throughout the 1990s, the pioneers of third-wave and intersectional feminism challenged all expressions of misogyny, patriarchy and homophobia.
If the boomers had the abortive revolution of 1968, we had 1999 and 2000. In Seattle, at Woomera and in Melbourne, an anti-authoritarian, leftwing protest politics was enacted which was unconnected to authoritarian state socialism, and had nothing to do with the cold war. On its own terms, much of it found short-term success – the police were outwitted in the Battle of Seattle by technology-enhanced protesters; the Woomera protests contributed to the centre’s closure, although the policy of immigration detention remains in place and is harsher than ever.
This protest wave was interrupted by 9/11, the so-called war on terror, and the subsequent ramping up of security states around the world.
There will be plenty of authoritarian solutions preferred for what’s coming down the pike. Eco-fascism is on the march; its solution to the climate crisis is genocide. “Normal” conservatives will seek to build walls and detain or refoul the desperate, and if recent history is any guide, the centre-left will dutifully maintain them. The radical left, too, has succumbed to the temptation of authoritarianism in the past in the face of perceived disorder and subversion.
As the last who remember the cold war, who were adults as the war on terrorism began, it is up to us to remind people why they must resist such solutions. It is up to us to preserve, as long as we can, the memory of what flourished in the gaps during the 1990s as the world transitioned from one system to another.
The flipside of the irony and gloom that characterised Generation X culture may be, if we can maintain it, a kind of pragmatic resilience. We have survived. Any future that may be left to us is a bonus. We were never really in charge anyway, so let’s keep rolling with the punches.
Most importantly we must, as we age, know when to exhibit what may be our best trait, and a skill that the boomers never mastered. We must remember when to fade into the background, when to let others say their piece. We should endeavour to become, where circumstances require it, like ghosts.

Temperatures in Trawsgoed, Wales, reached 20.3C, (68.5F) on Monday morning and rose to 20.6C in the afternoon. The previous highest recorded temperature in February had been 19.7C in London in 1998.
It is the first time temperatures have exceed 20C during winter, according to a Met Office official. The weather starkly contrasts with the beginning of the month, when sub-zero temperatures were recorded across the country.
The Met Office’s chief meteorologist, Steve Willington, emphasised that the gap was notable, saying: “By the weekend we could see temperatures almost 10 degrees higher than what we might normally expect at this time of year, so there will certainly be a spring-like feel in the air across the country.
“North-western parts of the UK will be wet and windy at times this week, but settled conditions will spread to all parts of the country by the weekend, bringing plenty of sunshine and unseasonably mild temperatures that could well compete with current February temperature records.”
Responding to the Met Office reports, the Green party MP, Caroline Lucas, said the warmer temperatures were concerning. She added: “I like spending an afternoon in the sunshine as much as anyone, but it’s impossible to shake the feeling that this isn’t right. After last year’s unprecedented global heatwave and last month’s deadly temperatures in Australia, our baseline perception of what’s normal is shifting.
“We are living through climate breakdown and, instead of taking urgent action, ministers carry on as if nothing has changed. The government must wake up to this crisis, urgently declare a climate emergency and introduce a ‘Green New Deal’ to provide a green job to everyone who wants one and transform our economy to prevent climate catastrophe.”
A Met Office representative said that temperatures in Wales were affected by local geography, with southerly winds rising over the east of the Welsh mountains and warming while descending down the other side in west Wales.
The country is experiencing warmer temperatures in general this week. London reached 19.8C on Monday – also the highest temperature recorded in February since records began.
This time last year there was widespread snowfall across the country between late February and March and some areas of the country were hit by blizzards.
Bob Ward, of the centre for climate change economics and policy at the London School of Economics, said that while warmer temperatures are often welcomed, they can be deadly. “People may find it very pleasant to be in warmer temperatures but they must also remember that it’s the same trend that saw hundreds of people die last summer as a result of overheating.
“Over the last five years we also had two record wet winters during which there was severe flooding. This is a sign of the fundamental and profound way that Britain’s climate is changing.”
He said the weather change could also have disastrous consequences for wildlife. “If we have a cold [snap again] now there is a danger it will kill a lot of wildlife that has emerged early due to the spring-like temperatures.”
The spell of warm weather is expected to continue over the weekend, and bookmakers are offering odds of 5-2 that this summer will be the hottest on record.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/25/uk-experiences-winter-temperatures-of-more-than-20c-for-first-time

The drilling and extraction of natural gas from wells and its transportation in pipelines results in the leakage of methane, primary component of natural gas that is 34 times stronger than CO2 at trapping heat over a 100-year period and 86 times stronger over 20 years [3]. Preliminary studies and field measurements show that these so-called “fugitive” methane emissions range from 1 to 9 percent of total life cycle emissions

Let's review a few facts on the public record:
Scott Morrison's Chief of Staff is John Kunkel, the former deputy CEO of the Minerals Council. He was previously the head of Government Relations at Rio Tinto. 
Scott Morrison hosted the Minerals Council of Australia dinner at Parliament House last week. In his speech, he denounced the ""noisy, shouty voices"" trying to ""shut the industry down"".
Finance Minister Matthias Cormann engaged former Minerals Council chief executive Brendan Pearson as a policy advisor on company tax reform. 
Melissa Price, the Environment Minister, was a mining industry lawyer. She served as Vice President of Legal and Business Development for Crosslands Resources. 
Angus Taylor, the Energy Minister, was a member of the Victorian taskforce on the Coal Seam Gas industry. He subsequently became a prominent anti-wind campaigner. He organized the 2013 ""wind power fraud rally"". He has expressed opposition to renewable energy targets in interviews conducted before he joined the ministry. He referred to the RET as ""industry pork barreling""
Patrick Gibbons, the former advisor to Greg Hunt when he was environment minister, is now the head of environment and climate policy at the Minerals Council. The irony of Scott Morrison denouncing others as ""shouty"" is delicious. 
Sid Maris - former policy officer at the Minerals Council - was Malcolm Turnbull's senior advisor when he was PM. 
Communications Minister Mitch Fifield appointed Dr Vanessa Guthrie - the Chair of the Minerals Council and councillor for the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies - to the board of the ABC. In interviews with the financial review,, she expressed concerns that 'social activists' are unfairly targeting the mining industry.
The Minerals Council made a submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters hearing on foreign donations asking that environmental groups be regulated as associated entities of political parties under the Electoral Act, forcing them to publish the source of all donations. This was immediately adopted as LNP policy, but is languishing in limbo due to popular opposition.

The multinational company qualified for climate funding to help pay for the fossil fuel plant at its Gove Peninsula bauxite mine despite the generator being commissioned before the fund opened.
It is one of several fossil fuel developments by large companies registered with the fund, which the then prime minister Tony Abbott introduced to pay farmers and businesses to cut greenhouse gases below what they otherwise would have been.
Environmentalists and academics are calling for the scheme to be scrapped or narrowed so it does not support fossil fuel projects and includes a tougher test of whether developments would have gone ahead without public money.
National emissions have risen each year since the fund was introduced with an initial $2.55bn four years ago. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced on Monday the fund would be renamed and receive an extra $2bn over a decade, or $200m a year.
Rio Tinto has received carbon credits and related payments for a 24MW diesel power station built in 2014 after it closed an alumina refinery and heavy fuel oil generator.
A 180MW heavy fuel oil station had provided electricity and stream for the refinery, mine and the town of Nhulunbuy and nearby Indigenous communities. The fuel was expensive and contributed to the refinery becoming unviable. Rio Tinto considered replacing it with gas but could not reach an agreement with the Northern Territory government on a supply deal.
It’s literally paying people to do what they already had to do
In December 2014, the company announced it had installed the smaller diesel plant, saying it was “better suited to the needs of our operations and the community”. The plant was registered with the emissions reduction fund 10 months after starting operation and has since sold 188,221 carbon credits to the government through the fund, estimated to be worth about $2m.
Projects that receive backing from the fund are required to be new. Asked why Rio Tinto had been allowed to register a diesel plant that was already operating, the Clean Energy Regulator, which administers the fund, said the company was required only to give a “notice of intent” before the project started.
A Rio Tinto spokesman said it did this in August 2014, more than a year before its registration under the fund was formalised and became public. He said eligibility for carbon credits informed the decision to build the plant, which had resulted in a reduction in emissions of about 215,000 tonnes.
Paul Burke, an economist at the Australian National University’s Crawford School of Public Policy, said it was clear from when the emissions reduction fund was introduced that it could lead to “anyway projects” – developments that would have existed regardless – getting public money.
He said the fund was better suited to a niche role paying for emissions cuts from activities that could not easily covered by other policies.
“This type of subsidy scheme is much more useful for projects such as savannah burning,” he said. “We have much smarter policies available for the electricity sector and large industrial projects.”
In the case of Rio Tinto, he said: “A carbon price would have fully given them the incentive to do this project if they needed an additional nudge. It would have been a smarter approach.”
Cash from the fund is distributed through reverse auctions, with the cheapest cuts proposed winning contracts. Across eight auctions, $476m has been paid and another $1.8bn contracted, with $226m left unspent.
A Guardian Australia investigation last year found it was at best often unclear if the fund was offering value for money. Some methodologies paid for cuts that would have happened anyway. Others have had any cuts more than wiped out by increases in pollution allowed elsewhere.
More recently, it revealed Vales Point coal-fired power plant had registered a proposal to upgrade some turbines and South African gold miner Gold Fields is receiving climate funding for a gas-fired power plant it says it would have built anyway.
Asked on Monday whether climate funding should help miners pay for gas plants they would have built anyway, the environment minister, Melissa Price, told ABC radio that most of the money had gone to land projects.
She said the fund was a good environmental and economic policy. It was part of a $3.5bn suite of climate measures announced by the prime minister, including support for pumped hydro storage, a second Bass Strait electricity cable and promised energy efficiency and electric vehicle programs.
Tim Baxter, an associate with the Australian-German Climate and Energy College, said a further issue with the payments to Rio Tinto is that the site was also covered by the safeguard mechanism, which is meant to ensure industrial facilities do not increase their pollution above business-as-usual levels.
Major emitters that breach an agreed baseline are supposed to buy carbon credits to offset the increase. But the mechanism has been criticised as lax for allowing companies to nominate their baselines.
Baxter said in the case of companies both covered by the safeguard mechanism and registered under the emissions reduction fund, taxpayers ended up paying polluters to make cuts they were supposed to pay for themselves to meet their baselines. Rio Tinto’s Gove operation fell into this category.
“In this situation, the fund is no longer delivering actual carbon reductions,” he said. “It’s literally paying people to do what they already had to do.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/26/rio-tinto-gets-2m-from-emissions-reduction-fund-to-switch-to-diesel

BQSTART
If it is to press for specific government action, then No, because 1) that is why we have a democratic political system that will give these people a chance to vote when they reach 18 2) because every political decision involves trade-offs which schoolchildren do not understand, and which are largely a matter of personal taste/conscience 3) if schoolchildren can strike about government policy on climate change, then why not also about tax or defence policy?

I'm sorry, but i struggle to find any part of that to be anything other than extremely alarming*. Plus it is not just us - we are having to face up to the prospect of a new mass extinction event driven purely by human behaviour, and it seems notable to me that you and the other poster whose views you say you agree with and who is also attacking me seem quite unconcerned about this aspect of the problem. You may consider it to be a cheap shot, although it isn't meant to be, but as you are an engineer, i must assume that you know this - when systems fail, they often do so suddenly and catastrophically with very little warning. Your point about timescales is a reasonable one in itself: i spend a fair amount of time explaining to students the difference between 'time' and 'timescale' in physics, however, nature is vastly more complicated than any engineering system (many of which are pretty complicated i know), and we don't understand all the details. In other words, we don't know whether what we are doing could lead to catastrophe much sooner than we think, and it is - in my view - pure folly to take such a huge risk on what is after all a planet-sized scale. From a professional point of view, you presumably worry about whether a bridge will fall down with people on it, or whether a high rise building will withstand an earthquake etc, and these are, of course, important matters which i am not seeking to belittle at all, but they pale into utter insignificance compared to climate change and its likely effects on a global scale.I also assume, that from a design point of view, you take a cautious, conservative approach to designing such structures don't you, since i presume that killing lots of people would be bad for business and bad for your career. Again, i am not saying this to be facetious. On this basis therefore, i cannot understand why you would not apply those principles of caution and conservatism to the environment as a whole.

However, I wonder how many of these protesting students were in possession of the real facts of Climate Change rather than just a few sensationalist headlines about Pacific islands disappearing beneath the waves.
Per head of population, our Climate Change emissions have been in steady decline for some time but some of the areas of increase that need addressing might be best looked at by the students, who share culpability.
For example, the modern trend for throw-away fashion keeps thousands of student-age people employed in countries such as Bangladesh and India; and creates lots of ‘waste’ clothing that is going to landfill. Only recently have we heard of efforts being made to recycle this clothing but surely it would be wiser to stop throwing it away by going for improved quality and higher cost, which might help improve the lives of the workers on the sub-Continent if consumer pressure is applied to those that run the garment factories.
The school run did not exist in my day. We walked or cycled to the local school.

In a letter to the Guardian, more than 200 academics backed the students’ stand, but the two headteacher unions said it was disruptive for schools and raised safeguarding issues. So should pupils have time off to protest?
professor of education, Cambridge University
“Yes, definitely. I’d like to think that had I still been teaching in a school, I would have taken a stand and gone on strike in support. The older generation has really let young people down with short-termism and by prioritising self-interest, and I think young people in the UK lack opportunities for democratic engagement.
“Most of those involved in the strike are too young to have a vote. Protesting is one of the very few ways in which they can take political action and be part of a participatory democracy. I encouraged my niece to go and she came back full of enthusiasm, and also much better informed about the state of the environment. Some people have argued that children are missing out on learning. Well, I think it’s a positive learning experience to come together collectively in a common cause.” 
executive headteacher, Harrogate grammar school, and president of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL)
“No. I don’t agree with pupils taking strike action as a protest against climate change. The cause is vital to humanity and I feel personal shame that my generation has allowed this crisis to happen on our watch. But a pupil strike is not the right approach. Each day’s learning is important for their life chances and their potential to go out and change the world. Schools are also in loco parentis and it is a concern if pupils are off site.
“We had a small number of very able and principled students let us know they planned to take strike action. Colleagues met them and explained why this was difficult for the school to support as we would struggle with our duty to keep them safe. The head and deputy voiced their support for the cause and showed them what the school was doing to respond to the challenge of climate change. We are not aware of any students who were absent because of strike action.”​
A-level student, Brighton, Hove and Sussex sixth-form college
“Yes, we should be allowed time off. I think if you care passionately about something enough that it makes you want to go on strike, you should be able to.
“I say that as someone who values my education, especially right now, with my A-level exams coming up. Missing a day of sixth form meant a lot to me – it was very costly for me to go when I am right in the middle of revising for my mocks – but I think it was important the strike took place during the school term. If it had not, it would not have been so impactful or controversial.
“I have heard people arguing that young people went on strike to get out of school. Those people are not taking us seriously, they are not taking the issue of climate change seriously, and that attitude is part of the reason why we went on strike. When I read the statistics about global warming and what is going to happen in the future, I don’t think enough is being done by older people. If I can do something to make a difference, even if it’s just making everyone around me aware that I’m concerned, then I’m going to jump at that. If older people don’t want us to strike, they need to act.
“My parents signed me out of college along with my younger brother, who is in secondary school, so they took responsibility for ‘safeguarding’ us that day. I know other young people whose parents didn’t want them going, and schools that didn’t allow it. And those young people felt silenced.” 
head, Heathfield community college, East Sussex
“I’d like to say yes, but I’m struggling. A school cannot authorise absence for this purpose. A parent can withdraw their child, but must be willing to accept the consequence of a fine. Headteachers rightly have safeguarding concerns for those who miss school yet whose whereabouts are unknown in uncoordinated events such as Friday’s marches. 
“However, I believe peaceful, powerful protest has a valuable place in a civilised, democratic society; much good has historically come from it. Teenagers must be able to form, express and share their views. Adults need to listen to young people. They are voters of the future and dismissing or patronising their actions and views now may be something politicians later regret.”
head, Sibford school, Banbury, Oxfordshire
“Yes. The school community felt very strongly about the strike and I was happy to authorise the absences of those who wanted to take part. I sense a great deal of exasperation from children that political leaders of the world today seem to be unable or unwilling to take decisive and unilateral action on climate change. Instant gratification and myopic political point-scoring blindly trumps all.
“As the head of a Quaker school that takes its responsibility towards the environment seriously, I believe it is incumbent upon us to support the children of today in making their voices heard. What is education about? If we do not have a planet to live on, then there is not a lot of point in learning about Pythagoras or Shakespeare. 
“Whatever the debate about climate change, there is clear and troubling scientific evidence, which cannot be ignored. Many children rightly have a sense of urgency and they absolutely should have a voice.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/feb/26/should-children-be-allowed-time-off-school-to-strike

Temperatures in Kew Gardens, south-west London, reached 21.2C (70.2F), breaking the record for the warmest February day. The Met Office defines winter from the beginning of December to the end of February, so Tuesday’s sunny spell is also a winter record.
The record had already been broken on Monday, when temperatures exceeded 20C during winter for the very first time. This week’s unseasonably warm weather differs dramatically from the beginning of the month, when sub-zero temperatures were recorded across the country.
The previous winter record had been 19.7C in Greenwich, south-east London, in 1998.
“The average temperature for this time of year is 9C in London and 9C in north Wales, so what we’re seeing is 10 degrees above average,” said Martin Bowles, a Met Office meteorologist.
Bowles said: “We can’t blame climate change directly because we’re talking about weather, not the climate. But it is a sign of climate change. There’s been a gradual increase of temperatures over the last 30 years so the extreme weather has also been increasing.”
Parts of Britain on Tuesday were hotter than Malibu, Athens, Crete and Barcelona.
The warm weather is in stark contrast to this time last year, when the “beast from the east” swept across much of the UK, bringing heavy snow showers and lows of -5C. The cold conditions caused travel delays and power cuts in what were the lowest temperatures in the week leading up to 1 March since 1986.
Bowles said the warm temperatures were largely because of an area of pressure over the North Sea, which was drawing up warm air from the south.
Last year’s cold weather was because of a similar weather pattern, but the high pressure came from Arctic Russia, before moving over Scandinavia. The conditions seen this week come from the tropical Atlantic and parts of north Africa.
While temperatures are forecast to reach 19C on Wednesday, the Met Office is expecting to see a change from Thursday onwards, when weather from the Atlantic will bring colder showers.
“We’re having a very warm end to winter, but will see a typical beginning to spring,” Bowles said
Heavy showers are possible at the end of the week, as temperatures will struggle to get above 11C or 12C.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/26/uk-hottest-winter-day-ever

During a recent Q&amp;A live-streamed on Instagram, apparently shot while she was pottering in her kitchen, the rising star of the Democratic party – and one of the few frontline politicians to get the scale of the environmental emergency – pulled no punches in telling viewers that unless we take urgent, radical action on emissions, there is no hope for the future. “It is basically a scientific consensus that the lives of our children are going to be very difficult, and it does lead young people to have a legitimate question: is it OK to still have children?”
With this one question put to her 2.5 million Instagram followers, Ocasio-Cortez has stumbled into a highly contentious area. Population has long been a controversial factor in the climate change debate; one recent study said the most effective thing individuals can do to address the crisis was to have one less child.
However, critics insist we should focus instead on overconsumption, and that putting the onus on individuals to address climate change obscures the systematic nature of the crisis. Crucially, they say, it lets the real culprits – fossil fuel corporations and successive global governments’ inaction – off the hook.
And even if you accept the premise that having fewer children will tackle climate change, there is also the thorny question of exactly who should be having fewer kids: an American is responsible for 40 times the emissions produced by a Bangladeshi, but often those who advocate population reduction focus on women in the developing world.
Ocasio-Cortez is not encouraging people stop having children. And as the leading advocate of the Green New Deal plan – which aims to radically transform the US economy by 2030 – she is one of the few politicians to be working on a plan that might just offer a way to avoid the worst impacts of this crisis.
But perhaps she is raising a more profound issue. Faced with a future of social and political breakdown, flooding, deadly heatwaves and food shortages – and a world full of politicians in various states of denial – why shouldn’t young people question whether bringing children in the world is a good idea?
The answer is one we must all grapple with. But it is worth remembering that throughout history – even in the most horrific circumstances – people have continued to have children. It is a profoundly human act.
And the thousands of young people who took to the streets to voice their concern around the climate crisis in recent months are a reminder that often – far from being the problem – children embody a profound hope for the future.

Even if carbon emissions are dramatically and rapidly cut and succeed in limiting global warming to 1.5C, 36% of the glaciers along in the Hindu Kush and Himalaya range will have gone by 2100. If emissions are not cut, the loss soars to two-thirds, the report found.
The glaciers are a critical water store for the 250 million people who live in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya (HKH) region, and 1.65 billion people rely on the great rivers that flow from the peaks into India, Pakistan, China and other nations.
“This is the climate crisis you haven’t heard of,” said Philippus Wester of the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (Icimod), who led the report. “In the best of possible worlds, if we get really ambitious [in tackling climate change], even then we will lose one-third of the glaciers and be in trouble. That for us was the shocking finding.”
Wester said that, despite being far more populous, the HKH region had received less attention than other places, such as low-lying island states and the Arctic, that are also highly vulnerable to global warming.
Prof Jemma Wadham, at the University of Bristol, said: “This is a landmark piece of work focused on a region that is a hotspot for climate change impacts.”
The new report, requested by the eight nations the mountains span, is intended to change that. More than 200 scientists worked on the report over five years, with another 125 experts peer reviewing their work. Until recently the impact of climate change on the ice in the HKH region was uncertain, said Wester. “But we really do know enough now to take action, and action is urgently needed,” he added.
The HKH region runs from Afghanistan to Myanmar and is the planet’s “third pole”, harbouring more ice than anywhere outside Arctic and Antarctica. Limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels requires cutting emissions to zero by 2050. This is felt to be extremely optimistic by many but still sees a third of the ice lost, according to the report. If the global rise is 2C, half of the glaciers are projected to melt away by 2100.
Since the 1970s, about 15% of the ice in the HKH region has disappeared as temperatures have risen. But the HKH range is 3,500km long and the impact of warming is variable. Some glaciers in Afghanistan and Pakistan are stable and a few are even gaining ice, most probably due to increased cloud cover that shields the sun and changed winds that bring more snow. But even these will start melting with future warming, Wester said.
The melting glaciers will increase river flows through to 2050 to 2060, he said, pushing up the risk of high-altitude lakes bursting their banks and engulfing communities. But from the 2060s, river flows will go into decline. The Indus and central Asian rivers will be most affected. “Those areas will be hard hit,” said Wester.
Lower flows will cut the power from the hydrodams that generate much of the region’s electricity. But the most serious impact will be on farmers in the foothills and downstream. They rely on predictable water supplies to grow the crops that feed the nations in the mountains’ shadows.
But the changes to spring melting already appear to be causing the pre-monsoon river flow to fall just when farmers are planting their crops. Worse, said Wester, the monsoon is also becoming more erratic and prone to extreme downpours. “One-in-100 year floods are starting to happen every 50 years,” he said.
The new report highlights how vulnerable many mountain people are, with one-third living on less than $1.90 a day and far away from help if climate disaster strikes.
Political tensions between neighbouring nations such as India and Pakistan could add to the difficulties. “There are rocky times ahead for the region. Because many of the disasters and sudden changes will play out across country borders, conflict among the region’s countries could easily flare up,” said Eklabya Sharma, the deputy director general of Icimod.
Hamish Pritchard, a glaciologist at the British Antarctic Survey and not part of the report, said it is “a substantial piece of work” that takes due note of the uncertainties resulting from the limited snowfall and ice measurements in the high mountains.
He said glaciers currently provide an essential buffering role as their meltwater flows into the rivers during the summer, which is when water is in greatest demand downstream and periodic droughts have the deadliest impacts on populations. “Take the ice away and those people are exposed to serious water stress and the consequences of that are local, regional and potentially global, in terms of conflict and migration,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/04/a-third-of-himalayan-ice-cap-doomed-finds-shocking-report

Its latest report – Weather Gone Wild, released on Wednesday – says climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of events such as extreme heat, intense rainfall, droughts, tropical cyclones and bushfires.
It comes amid unprecedented flooding in north Queensland and out of control bushfires in Tasmania.
Australia had its third warmest year on record in 2018 and the mean temperature was up by 1.14C, the report said.
The report noted that parts of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and eastern South Australia were affected by drought and annual rainfall was 11% below average. 
You can’t really work safely outside if it’s 47C
It paints a snapshot of Australia’s extreme weather events in 2018 such as cyclone Marcus’s landfall over the Northern Territory in March which was the strongest to hit Darwin since cyclone Tracey in 1974. December’s severe storms in Sydney and the NSW central coast that brought golf ball-sized hail and were the most expensive event for insurance companies in 2018.
The council’s Lesley Hughes said Australia’s beloved summer sports calendar – which includes the popular Big Bash cricket series, AFLW games, the Tour Down Under cycling race, the Australian Open tennis and A-League football – could face potential disruptions in the future.
“I do think that as climate change continues to bite over the next few decades, sporting bodies are going to have to look at changing the timing of events that are commonly held in summer,” Hughes said.
“It’s not just the big international events, it’s kids’ sporting events as well.”
Temperature records were broken around the globe in 2018. January was New Zealand’s hottest month on record, and 3.1C above the national average from 1981-2010. Europe had its hottest April in 2018 since records began in 1910. The US experienced its hottest May since record-keeping began in 1895 but more recently has been in the grip of the polar vortex.
The Macquarie University professor said that during the last drought community ovals and sports grounds became so dry they were deemed too dangerous for children to play on.
The Australian Open brought in a new extreme heat policy in 2019 following complaints in previous years about player welfare. Matches have been called off and the roof has been closed because of high temperatures.
Hughes said Australians would have to make dramatic changes to work life too which impacted on productivity. “You can’t really work safely outside if it’s 47C,” she said.
State governments are also going to have to ramp up resources to firefighting services. Previously Australia used to share firefighting equipment with places like California because the seasons were different but now they are overlapping.
“The really expensive water-dumping aircraft are leased in the northern hemisphere during one season and the southern hemisphere during the other season,” Hughes said. “Now there’s quite a lot of competition to get those aircraft.”
The window for hazard reduction in cooler months is getting smaller, Hughes said.
She said some rainforests in Queensland that had never burnt before are drying out and being ravaged by fire. “We’re seeing things we haven’t experienced before.”
She pointed to Tasmania’s hottest and driest January ever: 2.5C above average. “You’ve got massive destruction of commercial forests in Tasmania, huge health impacts of smoke, really significant stress on communities,” she said.
On Tuesday the prime minister, Scott Morrison, toured flood-ravaged Townsville but declined to say much about climate change.
“I’m not engaging in broader policy debates today. I’m engaging in the needs of people here on the ground, people in evacuation centres,” he said.
Hughes said politicians needed to wake up. “It’s a question of facing the facts, accepting the science and actually forming a climate policy,” Hughes said.
FAST FACTS
The past four years have been the hottest on record for global surface temperature.
Nine of the 10 hottest years on record in Australia have occurred since 2005.
There were 12 times more hot temperature records than cold temperature records in Australia between 2000 to 2014.
Rainfall has declined by around 11% in south-east Australia since the late 1990s.
The atmosphere contains more energy than 50 years ago which means more extreme weather events.
Insurance companies in Australia paid out more than $1.2bn in claims last year.

Here’s what happened in politics this evening:
A new report outlining the first National Drug Control Strategy was released today, just as new director Jim Carroll was sworn in to his role heading the White House’s National Drug Control Policy. 
The department’s priorities center heavily on combatting the opioid epidemic, and reducing drug-related deaths. Along with the report, the agency launched a new multimillion dollar media campaign targeting young adults and teens. 
From CNN: 
The first four ads of the campaign are all based on true stories illustrating the extreme lengths young adults have gone to get a hold of Oxycodone and Vicodin — from smashing their hand or arm, to wrecking their car or breaking their back”. 
The 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, agreed to by Russia and the US to stop both nations from developing and deploying ground-launched ballistic and cruise missies may be dissolved at the end of this week, after negotiations failed today. 
Breaking: @SecPompeo expected to announce Friday US will suspend participation in Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) arms control treaty with Russia that has been a centerpiece of European security since the Cold War - @kylieatwood @NicoleCNN reporting
Reuters is reporting that a the six-month withdrawal process will likely move forward on February 2 unless the Russians admit and amend their alleged violation of the agreement:
U.S. Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Andrea Thompson on Thursday held last-ditch talks with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov in Beijing ahead of the expiration on Saturday of a U.S. 60-day deadline for Moscow to return to compliance with the treaty.
Thompson and Ryabkov said afterwards that the two countries had failed to bridge their differences. They met on the sidelines of a meeting of the U.N. Security Council’s five permanent members - the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain - all nuclear powers.
European officials are concerned about the treaty’s possible collapse, fearful that Europe could again become an arena for nuclear-armed, intermediate-range missile buildups by the United States and Russia”.
In a statement issued by the NATO Foreign Ministers in December, which was updated today, the INF Treaty was described as “crucial in upholding NATO’s security for over 30 years”. Russia, the allies concluded, violated the pact by developing a missile system that poses risks to European countries:
 We continue to aspire to a constructive relationship with Russia, when Russia’s actions make that possible. As most recently confirmed at the Brussels Summit, we remain open to dialogue with Russia, including in the NATO-Russia Council. We call on Russia to return urgently to full and verifiable compliance. It is now up to Russia to preserve the INF Treaty”. 
Russian leaders have vehemently denied the allegations, and on Wednesday President Vladamir Putin threatened the US with an amping up of nuclear arms should the treaty fall apart. 
“Now it seems our American partners believe that the situation has changed so much that the United States must also have such a weapon,” Putin said on TV in Moscow. “What’s our response? It’s simple: in that case we will also do this”. 
ABC News is reporting that the identities of the blocked-number phone calls with Donald Trump Jr around the Trump Tower meeting in June 2016 have been revealed to be NASCAR CEO Brian France and developer Howard Lorber, two close friends of the Trump family who publicly and financially supported his campaign. 
The three phone calls with Donald Trump Jr. to blocked numbers in June 2016 have until now fueled questions about whether Trump Jr. informed his father about the now-infamous Trump Tower meeting before or after it occurred. The controversial meeting between high ranking members of the Trump campaign and an ensemble of Russians has been a source of intense interest from investigators seeking to determine whether the campaign worked in concert with agents of the Russian government to impact the election”.
Today the Trump campaign shared that they have raised more than $21 million this quarter and that most of the contributions came in small doses. According to a press release published by the President’s team, 98.5% of the funds came from donations of $200 or less. 
Trump has, throughout his first term, raised unprecedented amounts of money and claims to have $19.2 million in cash on hand to start 2019. Comparatively, President Obama had raised $4 million with $2.3 million on hand by 2010, when he was at the same point in his first term, and George W. Bush raised $3.2 million with $2.8 million on hand in 2002. 
Just a day after Trump insulted his intelligence chiefs saying they should “go back to school” for contradicting his foreign policy priorities in an on-camera testimony to Congress, the president is now claiming they were misquoted by the media. 
....I would suggest you read the COMPLETE testimony from Tuesday. A false narrative is so bad for our Country. I value our intelligence community. Happily, we had a very good meeting, and we are all on the same page!
On Tuesday, a team of top intelligence officials including Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats, CIA Director Gina Haspel, and FBI Director Christopher A. Wray outlined the biggest threats to the US for the Senate Intelligence Committee. 
They diverged from the President’s claims in several key areas and described what they believe actually poses the greatest risks to American safety. They cited Russia and China among the biggest threats, saying the two countries were becoming more aligned and could continue to use cyber attacks to disrupt US elections, and said North Korea was unlikely to give up its nuclear weapons. They also negated Trump’s claims of victory over the Islamic State — which prompted him to announce a highly disputed and controversial troop withdrawal from Syria — and told Senators that ISIS still commands thousands and could have a resurgence.
 The testimonies were televised and transcribed, but Trump insists his team was taken out of context. 
As Trump tries to misconstrue the testimony from his intel chiefs, remember that not once did they, in hours of discussion of security threats, mention the need for a wall along the southern border, which Trump has portrayed as the single most pressing need facing the country.
Progressives are preparing to take on Starbucks CEO Howard Shultz — who is considering a run for president in 2020 as an independent — hoping to arm themselves with information about the billionaire’s governmental dealings. 
Axios reports that Democratic super PAC, Priorities USA, has requested documents from roughly 70 national and state agencies who may have connected with Shultz or his coffee company over the last 3 decades:
The group is gathering as much potential opposition research as they can on Schultz and his business in anticipation of his decision to possibly run for president as an independent. This is yet another example of liberals trying to push Schultz out of the 2020 race before he begins, in part because they view his candidacy as a “threat” that could be “a major step toward re-electing Donald Trump,” Priorities USA communications director Josh Schwerin told Axios”.
“While we hope he reconsiders and this never needs to be used” Schwerin said, “Priorities is sending out a full round of FOIA requests ... as a start to our research efforts combatting his potential candidacy.”
A new poll released by Monmouth University says more than 60% of Americans think the president knew that high-ranking members of his campaign lied to investigators and half believe he asked them to do it. 
The survey also found that there’s still significant concern among the electorate that Russia has influence over Trump, and that not enough has been done to stop the Kremlin from meddling into elections. 
Was Trump aware of campaign associated trying to mislead investigators or Congress?62% Yes 32% No Do you think Trump personally asked people to mislead investigators or Congress?50% Yes42% NoMonmouth poll
“After a number of indictments and guilty pleas, there’s a pervading sense that Trump was aware that others were trying to cover up his business dealings or what his campaign may have known about Russian meddling in the 2016 race”, Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute said in a statement released with the results. 
But, the results are still heavily divided along party lines:
‘Views of the president’s ties to Russia look like almost any other aspect of public opinion related to Trump. Very few Republicans believe anything negative about him and nearly all Democrats are inclined to accept damaging information, while independents are almost evenly split’, said Murray.
Just over half of Americans (51%) feel that the special counsel’s investigation into Russian election interference and possible links to the Trump campaign should continue. Another 45% say this investigation should be brought to an end. Support for continuing the special counsel investigation has hovered between 52% and 54% in polls taken between April and November 2018. Prior to that, about 6-in-10 Americans supported continuing the investigation (60% in March 2018 and 62% in July 2017)“.

Today Facebook and Twitter announced that hundreds of accounts and groups with links Iran, Russia, and Venezuela, appear to have been part of coordinated influence operations with aims to perpetuate anti-West views. 
From my colleague Julia Carrie Wong: 
Facebook removed 783 pages, groups and accounts that it said posed as local actors in countries across Europe, the Middle East and South Asia and shared content that was largely repurposed from Iranian state media. The accounts, some of which had been active since 2010, had garnered about two million followers on Facebook and more than 250,000 followers on Instagram...
...Separately, Twitter announced that it had deleted thousands of “malicious” accounts from Russia, Iran and Venezuela. The accounts had “limited operations” targeting the US midterm elections in November, the company said, and the majority were suspended prior to election day.”

The chair of the House Armed Services Committee is raising questions about the Trump Administration’s plans to deploy more troops to the border.
In a letter to acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, Democrat Adam Smith raised concerns that the Pentagon was “not transparent” about the move and may have intentionally withheld information from Congress.

The Senate overwhelmingly backed an amendment this afternoon that argued the continuing presence of ISIS in Afghanistan and Syria is a threat and requires a continued military presence. The vote is a rebuke for Trump who is seeking to withdraw U.S. forces from both countries.
A well-known skeptic of the seriousness of climate change will join the Environmental Protection Agency’s science advisory board. Alabama climatologist John Christy has been a favorite of Republican lawmakers who disagree with the science that shows humans are heating the planet and causing an environmental crisis.
Christy was a lead author of a section of a 2011 report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. But that year he testified to a House panel that “it has become popular to try and attribute certain extreme events to human causation.”
“The Earth, however, is very large, the weather is very dynamic, especially at local scales, so that extreme events of one type or another will occur somewhere on the planet in every year,” he said.
International scientists have warned that climate change will cause more heat waves, stronger storms, and more erratic weather.
In 2014, in a column he co-authored in the Wall Street Journal defending his views, Christy said scientists at one time had achieved consensus that the Earth was flat. 
The Trump administration’s picks for EPA science boards have been controversial, as they have removed scientists who received agency grants to conduct research and replaced them with more representatives from industry and state government. The panels review the research EPA uses to make major decisions about protecting public health.
Another new member, Richard Williams, is a consultant and the former director of regulatory studies at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, where he focused on cost-benefit and risk analysis.
New addition Hugh Barton retired from the biopharmaceutical company Pfizer. 
An appointee to a chemical assessment committee, Michael Jayjock, has previously consulted for Dow Chemical, as well as government agencies, according to his website.
Democrats are revisiting how they approach social media and a digital operation in advance of the 2020 presidential campaign. 
As McClatchy reports:
As the 2020 Democratic presidential primary gets underway, the current and potential White House contenders are trying to connect with supporters online, convinced it’s an essential way to gain an advantage in what could be the biggest Democratic field ever.
These public, seemingly lighthearted moments reflect something going on behind the scenes, where strategists — racing to adjust to power of social media — are grappling with how to build a digital-first operation that can cultivate an online army. That could mean radical changes to the personnel and organization of the campaign itself — including a fundamental rethinking of traditional roles in areas such as communications and fundraising.
“I’ve been talking through that with a lot of people,” said Robby Mook, who managed Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. “Do you even have a digital department anymore? It’s complicated.”
“We don’t talk about having a telephone department,” he added. “We don’t talk about using telephones anymore. We need to get to the same place in digital where it’s just seamlessly part of everything we do.”
Bernie Sanders unveiled new legislation today that would significantly increase the estate tax. The bill by the likely 2020 presidential candidate would lower the current exemption under which estates are not liable for the tax from $11 million to 3.5 million. It also would raise the top rate and tax inheritances over $1 billion at 77%.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2019/jan/31/trump-news-live-latest-updates-wall-mexico-national-emergency-us-politics-today

Donald Trump made a joke about the polar vortex showing the need for 'global waming', and he was ridiculed for saying that cold disproves the global warming hypothesis.
BQEND
Not understanding the problem with the ridicule.
BQSTART
But its promoters use every bit of hot weather to confirm it.
BQEND
Can you give an example? Hot weather is consistent with a long term warming trend globally, so an extreme, record-breaking heatwave occurs in that context and taken with that context is further evidence of global warming.
A localised cold weather event is not indicative of any long-term trend, neither regional nor global, and so is obviously not contrary to the scientific consensus.
BQSTART
You don't just accumulate the evidence for a theory - you try to refute it.
BQEND
Climate change might have been falsified in any number of ways: for instance nights not warming faster than days, or the Arctic not warming faster than the rest of the world, or indeed the world not warming at all in reaction to increased greenhouse gases.
Climate change remains the dominant theory because all of the key phenomena it predicted, came to pass. It's not that its unfalsifiable, it's just that it has never been falsified.

I'm incredibly pessimistic, nihilistic, even, about it, but I know it is possible for us to avoid disaster.
I just happen to think it's not remotely plausible that we will. 
I don't believe we will halve emissions by 2030; even if an optimistic 50% of global carbon emissions are caused by inefficiency and waste, I don't believe we will cut it said waste, and in any case, that's 50% of still-steeply-rising global carbon emissions.
And to think we will have stopped burning carbon by 2044? Pie in the sky. For one thing, those tanks we'll 'need' to jostle for position (ie kill fellow humans competing for dwindling resources and land) won't fuel themselves!
It is pessimistic of me, sure, and I support initiatives that hope to avert it, often run by smart people more optimistic than I. But, sadly, I just don't find it in the least convincing that we will do anything but continue rushing headlong to our doom. I see no reason, based on history and on the world as we find it right now, to think we will make what would amount to, in my opinion, a global paradigm shift, from top to bottom of society. 
Obviously I would be delighted if I'm wrong, but i don't know I can go so far as to say I hope so. That would imply believing it might just happen.

Please justify your daft assertion that today's science is inadequate to provide the answers, and to define the plans of action needed to combat and curb our industrialised society's propagation of global warming.
What is it about the CO2-induced atmospheric greenhouse effect, discovered 2 centuries ago, that you have somehow managed not to understand, yet you can still write ignorantly patronising garbage in your knee-jerk response to this deadly serious global problem? Do you also deny that sheets of glass are capable of heating greenhouses by limiting the outward passage of infrared (heat) radiation while permitting the inward passage of most other solar radiation (which is then converted into heat on contact with plants and other surfaces)? Actually, you neatly demonstrate the existence of a parallel pair of problems: 1) the reality of manmade global warming, to which we already know many of the necessary answers, and 2) the wilful, self-deluding process by which too many comfortable people seek ways to pretend, and to persuade others, that either it isn't happening or can't be stopped.

If nothing else this year of global tragedies should make clear that we can no longer speak in the future tense. The ravages of global warming are here, now, real, devastating. This impulse to continually kick the can down the road, even by those in the field, is part of the very mindset that has doomed us. 
Legions of people lost homes, businesses, land and died this year as the direct result of global warming. And we ain't seen nothing yet. 
I'm in the Midwest; in the span for four days we are going to experience a 100 degree differential; many places hit -45 and we're expected to go over + 55 by Monday. In the moment, the negative numbers posed the immediate and greater threat from freezing, but no one should need to be told that it's the plus 55 that speaks to something terrifyingly wrong. 
Elizabeth Kolbert, Pulitzer-Prize winning author on climate change, spoke at my school thirteen years ago. She warned then that we would see some of the most brutally cold winters ever experienced, pocked by hot spots and surges that would also break records. As she said, ""If global warming were gradual warming we might adapt. It's not. We are going to see nature swing between wild extremes in the bid to regulate."" She also told us that the train left the station decades ago when we were all mocking environmentalists but that if we ""ran like hell, we might catch the tail end of the caboose.""

This only nominally true - it is the consumption of the world's wealthiest that drives climate change. The richest 10% emit 50% of CO2, and the poorest 50% emit 10%, so the correlation between population and emissions is actually pretty dismal.

There is always an economy in ecological terms. uncommodified is talking about the grow-to-death capitalist consumer economy we currently operate under.
With the death of that way of life, a new economy of local efforts to grow food, maintain infrastructure, take care of each other will open up. Your new work will be part of a collectivist effort to stay comfortably alive while minimizing the effects of your existence on your own local environment. Your rewards will be based on how your efforts contribute to the common good; competition will be replaced by cooperation.
The value of your efforts will be based on how well they support your neighbours and community, minus the environmental costs.

I don’t even think of myself as a nature person. I’ve lived my whole life in cities, enjoying gadgets built by industrial supply chains I hardly think twice about. I’ve never gone camping, not willingly anyway, and while I always thought it was basically a good idea to keep streams clean and air clear, I also accepted the proposition that there was a trade-off between economic growth and cost to nature – and figured, well, in most cases I’d go for growth. I’m not about to personally slaughter a cow to eat a hamburger, but I’m also not about to go vegan. In these ways – many of them, at least – I am like every other American who has spent their life fatally complacent, and wilfully deluded, about climate change, which is not just the biggest threat human life on the planet has ever faced, but a threat of an entirely different category and scale. That is, the scale of human life itself.
A few years ago, I began collecting stories of climate change, many of them terrifying, gripping, uncanny narratives, with even the most small-scale sagas playing like fables: a group of Arctic scientists trapped when melting ice isolated their research centre on an island also populated by a group of polar bears; a Russian boy killed by anthrax released from a thawing reindeer carcass that had been trapped in permafrost for many decades. At first, it seemed the news was inventing a new genre of allegory. But of course climate change is not an allegory. Beginning in 2011, about a million Syrian refugees were unleashed on Europe by a civil war inflamed by climate change and drought; in a very real sense, much of the “populist moment” the west is passing through now is the result of panic produced by the shock of those migrants. The likely flooding of Bangladesh threatens to create 10 times as many, or more, received by a world that will be even further destabilised by climate chaos – and, one suspects, less receptive the browner those in need. And then there will be the refugees from sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and the rest of south Asia – 140 million by 2050, the World Bank estimates, more than 10 times the Syrian crisis.
My file of stories grew daily, but very few of the clips, even those drawn from new research published in the most pedigreed scientific journals, seemed to appear in the coverage about climate change we watched on television and read in newspapers. Climate change was reported, of course, and even with some tinge of alarm. But the discussion of possible effects was misleadingly narrow, limited almost invariably to the matter of sea level rise. Just as worrisome, the coverage was sanguine, all things considered.
One California fire burned so quickly, evacuees sprinting past exploding cars found their sneakers melting to the asphalt
As recently as the 1997 signing of the landmark Kyoto Protocol, 2C of global warming was considered the threshold of catastrophe: flooded cities, crippling droughts and heatwaves, a planet battered daily by hurricanes and monsoons we used to call “natural disasters” but will soon normalise as simply “bad weather”. More recently, the foreign minister of the Marshall Islands in the Pacific offered another name for that level of warming: “genocide”.
There is almost no chance we will avoid that scenario. The Kyoto Protocol achieved, practically, nothing; in the 20 years since, despite all our climate advocacy and legislation and progress on green energy, we have produced more emissions than in the 20 years before.
In reading about warming, you will often come across analogies from the planetary record: the last time the planet was this much warmer, the logic runs, sea levels were here. These conditions are not coincidences. The geologic record is the best model we have for understanding the very complicated climate system, and gauging just how much damage will come from turning up the temperature. Which is why it is especially concerning that recent research into the deep history of the planet suggests that our current climate models may be underestimating the amount of warming we are due for in 2100 by as much as half. The authors of one recent paper suggested that slashing our emissions could still bring us to 4 or 5C, a scenario, they said, would pose severe risks to the habitability of the entire planet. “Hothouse Earth”, they called it.
Because these numbers are so small, we tend to trivialise the differences between them – one, two, four, five. But, as with world wars or recurrences of cancer, you don’t want to see even one. At 2C, the ice sheets will begin their collapse, bringing, over centuries, 50 metres of sea-level rise. An additional 400 million people will suffer from water scarcity, major cities in the equatorial band of the planet will become unlivable, and even in the northern latitudes heatwaves will kill thousands each summer. There would be 32 times as many extreme heatwaves in India, and each would last five times as long, exposing 93 times more people. This is our best-case scenario. At 3C, southern Europe would be in permanent drought, and the average drought in Central America would last 19 months longer. In northern Africa, the figure is 60 months longer: five years. At 4C, there would be 8m more cases of dengue fever each year in Latin America alone and close to annual global food crises. Damages from river flooding would grow thirtyfold in Bangladesh, twentyfold in India, and as much as sixtyfold in the UK. Globally, damages from climate-driven natural disasters could pass $600tn – more than twice the wealth that exists in the world today. Conflict and warfare could double.
Global warming may seem like a distended morality tale playing out over several centuries and inflicting a kind of Old Testament retribution on the great-great-grandchildren of those responsible, since it was carbon burning in 18th-century England that lit the fuse of everything that has followed. But that is a fable about historical villainy that acquits those of us alive today – and unfairly. The majority of the burning has come in the last 25 years – since the premiere of Seinfeld. Since the end of the second world war, the figure is about 85%. The story of the industrial world’s kamikaze mission is the story of a single lifetime – the planet brought from seeming stability to the brink of catastrophe in the years between a baptism or barmitzvah and a funeral.
Between that scenario and the world we live in now lies only the question of human response. Some amount of further warming is already baked in, thanks to the protracted processes by which the planet adapts to greenhouse gas. But all of the paths projected from the present will be defined by what we choose to do now. If we do nothing about carbon emissions, if the next 30 years of industrial activity trace the same arc upward as the last 30 years, whole regions will become unlivable as soon as the end of this century. Of course, the assaults of climate change do not end at 2100 just because most modelling, by convention, sunsets at that point. In fact, they could accelerate, not just because there’d be more carbon in the atmosphere then, but because increased temperatures could trigger feedback loops that might send the climate system spiralling out of control. This is why some studying global warming call the hundred years to follow the “century of hell”.
It would take a spectacular coincidence of bad choices and bad luck to make a completely uninhabitable Earth possible within our lifetime. But the fact that we have brought that eventuality into play at all is perhaps the overwhelming cultural and historical fact of the modern era. Whatever we do to stop warming, and however aggressively we act to protect ourselves from its ravages, we will have pulled the devastation of human life on Earth into view – close enough that we can see clearly what it would look like, and know, with some degree of precision, how it will punish our children and grandchildren. Close enough, in fact, that we are already beginning to feel its effects ourselves, when we do not turn away.

In southern California, December is meant to bring the start of rainy season. Not in 2017. The Thomas fire, the worst of those that roiled the region that year, grew 50,000 acres in one day, eventually burning 440 sq miles and forcing the evacuations of more than 100,000 Californians. A week after it was sparked, it remained, in the ominous semi-clinical language of wildfires, merely “15% contained”. For a poetic approximation, it was not a bad estimate of how much of a handle we have on the forces of climate change. That is to say, hardly any.
Five of the 20 worst fires in California history hit the state in the autumn of 2017, a year in which more than 9,000 separate ones broke out, burning through almost 1.25m acres – nearly 2,000 sq miles made soot. That October, in northern California, 172 fires broke out in just two days – devastation so cruel and sweeping that two different accounts were published in two different local newspapers of two different ageing couples taking desperate cover in pools as the fires swallowed their homes. One couple survived, emerging after six excruciating hours to find their house transformed into an ash monument; in the other account, it was only the husband who emerged, his wife of 55 years having died in his arms.
In the summer of 2018, the fires were fewer in number, totalling only 6,000. But just one, made up of a whole network of fires, together called the Mendocino Complex, burned almost half a million acres alone. In total, nearly 3,000 sq miles in the state turned to flame, and smoke blanketed almost half the country. Things were worse to the north, in British Columbia, where more than 3m acres burned, producing smoke that would travel across the Atlantic to Europe. Then, in November, came the Woolsey Fire, which forced the evacuation of 170,000, and the Camp Fire, which was somehow worse, burning through more than 200 square miles and incinerating an entire town so quickly that the evacuees, 50,000 of them, found themselves sprinting past exploding cars, their sneakers melting to the asphalt as they ran. It was the deadliest fire in Californian history.
Two big forces conspire to prevent us from normalising fires like these, though neither is exactly a cause for celebration. The first is that extreme weather won’t let us, since it won’t stabilise; even within a decade, it’s a fair bet that these fires, which now occupy the nightmares of every Californian, will be thought of as the “old normal”. The good old days.
The second force is also contained in the story of the wildfires: the way that climate change is finally striking close to home. Some quite special homes. The California fires of 2017 burned the state’s wine crop, blowtorched million-dollar vacation properties, and threatened both the Getty Museum and Rupert Murdoch’s Bel-Air estate. There may not be two better symbols of the imperiousness of American money than those two structures. Nearby Disneyland was quickly canopied by an eerily apocalyptic orange sky. On local golf courses, the west coast’s wealthy swung their clubs just yards from blazing fires in photographs that could not have been more perfectly staged to skewer the country’s indifferent plutocracy. Last year, Americans watched the Kardashians evacuate via Instagram stories, then read about the private firefighting forces they employed, the rest of the state reliant on a public force full of conscripted convicts earning as little as a dollar a day.
In Sweden, forests in the Arctic Circle went up in flames. Fires that far north are increasing more rapidly than in lower altitudes
By accidents of geography and by the force of its wealth, the US has, to this point, been mostly protected from the devastation climate change has already visited on parts of the less developed world. The fact that warming is now hitting its wealthiest citizens is not just an opportunity for ugly bursts of liberal schadenfreude; it is also a sign of just how hard, and how indiscriminately, it is hitting. All of a sudden, it’s getting a lot harder to protect against what’s coming.
What is coming? Much more fire, much more often, burning much more land. American wildfires now burn twice as much land as they did as recently as 1970. By 2050, destruction from wildfires is expected to double again. For every additional degree of global warming, it could quadruple. At three degrees of warming, our likely benchmark for the end of the century, the US might be dealing with 16 times as much devastation from fire as we are today, when in a single year 10m acres were burned. The California fire captain believes the term is already outdated: “We don’t even call it fire season any more,” he said in 2017. “Take the ‘season’ out – it’s year-round.”
But wildfires are not an American affliction; they are a global pandemic. Each year, between 260,000 and 600,000 people worldwide die from the smoke they produce. In icy Greenland, fires in 2017 appeared to burn 10 times more area than in 2014; and in Sweden, in 2018, forests in the Arctic Circle went up in flames. Fires that far north may seem innocuous, relatively speaking, since there are not so many people there. But they are increasing more rapidly than fires in lower latitudes, and they concern climate scientists greatly: the soot and ash they give off can blacken ice sheets, which then absorb more of the sun’s rays and melt more quickly. Another Arctic fire broke out on the Russia-Finland border in 2018, and smoke from Siberian fires that summer reached all the way to the mainland US. That same month, the 21st century’s second-deadliest wildfire swept through the Greek seaside, killing 100. At one resort, dozens of guests tried to escape the flames by descending a narrow stone staircase into the Aegean, only to be engulfed along the way, dying literally in each other’s arms. There were record-breaking fires in the UK, as well, including one on Saddleworth Moor that was thought to be defeated – until it emerged again from the forest’s peat floor, to become the largest British wildfire in living memory.
The effects of these fires are not linear or neatly additive. It might be more accurate to say that they initiate a new set of biological cycles. Scientists warn that the probability of unprecedented rainfalls will grow, too – as much as a threefold increase of events like that which produced the state’s Great Flood of 1862. Mudslides are among the clearest illustrations of what new horrors that heralds; in January 2018, Santa Barbara’s low-lying homes were pounded by the mountains’ detritus cascading down the hillside toward the ocean in an endless brown river. One father, in a panic, put his young children up on his kitchen’s marble countertop, thinking it the strongest feature of the house, then watched as a rolling boulder smashed through the bedroom where the children had been just moments before. One child who didn’t make it was found close to two miles from his home, in a gulley traced by train tracks close to the waterfront, having been carried there, presumably, on a continuous wave of mud. Two miles.
It gets worse. When trees die – by natural processes, by fire, at the hands of humans – they release into the atmosphere the carbon stored within them, sometimes for as long as centuries. In this way, they are like coal. This is why the effect of wildfires on emissions is among the most feared climate feedback loops – that the world’s forests, which have typically been carbon sinks, would become carbon sources, unleashing all that stored gas. The impact can be especially dramatic when the fires ravage forests arising out of peat. Peatland fires in Indonesia in 1997, for instance, released up to 2.6 gigatons (Gt) of carbon – 40% of the average annual global emissions level. And more burning only means more warming only means more burning. Wildfires make a mockery of the technocratic approach to emissions reduction.
In the Amazon, 100,000 fires were found to be burning in 2017. At present, its trees take in a quarter of all the carbon absorbed by the planet’s forests each year. But in 2018, Jair Bolsonaro was elected president of Brazil, promising to open the rainforest to development – which is to say, deforestation. How much damage can one person do to the planet? A group of Brazilian scientists has estimated that between 2021 and 2030, Bolsonaro’s deforestation would release the equivalent of 13.12 Gt of carbon. In 2017, the US, with all of its aeroplanes and automobiles and coal plants, emitted about 5 Gt.
This is not simply about wildfires; each climate threat promises to trigger similarly brutal cycles. The fires should be terrorising enough, but it is the cascading chaos that reveals the true cruelty of climate change – it can upend and turn violently against us everything we have ever thought to be stable. Homes become weapons, roads become death traps, air becomes poison. And the idyllic mountain vistas around which generations of entrepreneurs and speculators have assembled entire resort communities become, themselves, indiscriminate killers.
And yet I am optimistic
Since I first began writing about warming, I’ve often been asked whether I see any reason for optimism. The thing is, I am optimistic.
Warming of 3 or 3.5C is, I’d wager, the likeliest range this century, given conventional decarbonisation and the existing – dispiriting – pace of change. It would unleash suffering beyond anything that humans have ever experienced. But it is not a fatalistic scenario; in fact, it’s a whole lot better than where we are headed without action – north of 4C by 2100, and the perhaps six or even more degrees of warming in the centuries to come. We may conjure new soutions, in the form of carbon-capture technology, which would extract CO2 from the air, or geoengineering, which would cool the planet by suspending gas in the atmosphere, or other now-unfathomable innovations. These could bring the planet closer to a state we would today regard as merely grim, rather than apocalyptic.
I’ve often been asked whether it’s moral to reproduce in this climate, whether it is fair to the planet or, perhaps more importantly, to the children. As it happens, last year I had a child, Rocca. Part of that choice was delusion, that same wilful blindness: I know there are climate horrors to come, some of which will inevitably be visited on her. But those horrors are not yet scripted. The fight is, definitively, not yet lost – in fact, will never be lost, so long as we avoid extinction. And I have to admit, I am also excited, for everything that Rocca and her sisters and brothers will see, will witness, will do.
She will be entering old age at the close of the century, the endstage bookmark on all of our projections for warming. In between, she will watch the world doing battle with a genuinely existential threat, and the people of her generation making a future for themselves, and the generations they bring into being, on this planet. And she won’t just be watching it, she will be living it – quite literally the greatest story ever told. It may well bring a happy ending.
Western liberals contort their consumption into performances of moral or environmental purity – less beef, more Teslas, fewer flights
Climate change is not an ancient crime we are tasked with solving now; we are destroying our planet every day, often with one hand as we conspire to restore it with the other. Which means we can also stop destroying it, in the same style – collectively, haphazardly, in all the most quotidian ways, in addition to the spectacular-seeming ones. The project of unplugging the entire industrial world from fossil fuels is intimidating, and must be done in fairly short order – by 2040, many scientists say, with others guessing 2050. The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says we’ll need to halve our carbon emissions by 2030 to avoid catastrophe. In the meantime, many avenues are open – wide open, if we are not too lazy and too blinkered and too selfish to embark upon them.
Perhaps as much as half of British emissions, one report recently calculated, come from inefficiencies in construction, discarded and unused food, electronics, and clothing; two-thirds of US energy is wasted; globally, according to one paper, we are subsidising the fossil fuel business to the tune of $5tn each year. None of that has to continue. Americans waste a quarter of their food, which means the carbon footprint of the average meal is a third larger than it has to be. That need not continue. Five years ago, hardly anyone outside the darkest corners of the internet had even heard of bitcoin; today, mining it consumes more electricity than is generated by all the world’s solar panels combined, which means that in just a few years we’ve assembled a programme to wipe out the gains of several long, hard generations of green energy innovation. It did not have to be that way. And a simple change to the algorithm could eliminate that bitcoin footprint entirely.
These are just a few of the reasons to believe that climate nihilism is, in fact, another of our delusions. What happens, from here, will be entirely our own doing. The planet’s future will be determined in large part by the arc of growth in the developing world – that’s where most of the people are, in China and India and, increasingly, sub-Saharan Africa. But this is no absolution for the west, which accounts for the lion’s share of historical emissions, and where the average citizen produces many times more than almost anyone in Asia, just out of habit. I toss out tons of wasted food and hardly ever recycle; I leave my air-conditioning on; I bought into bitcoin at the peak of the market. None of that is necessary, either.
But it also isn’t necessary for westerners to adopt the lifestyle of the global poor. It’s estimated that 70% of the energy produced by the planet is lost as waste heat. If the world’s richest 10% were limited to the average European footprint, global emissions would fall by a third. And why shouldn’t they be? Almost as a prophylactic against climate guilt, as the news from science has grown bleaker, western liberals have comforted themselves by contorting their own consumption patterns into performances of moral or environmental purity – less beef, more Teslas, fewer transatlantic flights. But the climate calculus is such that individual lifestyle choices do not add up to much, unless they are scaled by politics. That should not be impossible, once we understand the stakes.
Annihilation is only the very thin tail of warming’s very long bell curve, and there is nothing stopping us from steering clear of it.

Joke Schauvliege, a minister in Flanders, where the school-strikes movement first emerged, provoked a wave of criticism of the wider political class after suggesting the protests were a “set-up” and “more than spontaneous actions of solidarity”.
“I know who is behind this movement, both of the Sunday demonstrations and the truants,” Schauvliege had told an audience of farmers. “I have also been told that from state security. I can guarantee that I do not see ghosts alone and that climate demonstrations are more than spontaneous actions of solidarity with our climate.”
The comments prompted a rare denial by the Belgian state security services. “We have not reported anything about this to Schauvliege,” they said. “Neither verbally nor in writing.”
The minister initially sought to hold on to her position insisting that she had not lied, but merely gone “too far”. “In recent weeks, I have slept little and I was overwhelmed by frustration, I am a human being and I could be wrong,” she told the Flemish channel Radio 1.
But during an emotional press conference on Tuesday afternoon, Schauvliege announced that she could not continue in her post given the growing controversy. “It is difficult to continue to function as climate minister in these circumstances,” she said, between tears.
Tens of thousands of Belgian children, inspired by the lone protest launched last year by Greta Thunberg, then 15, outside the Swedish parliament, have played truant from school in recent weeks to march on the streets of Brussels, Liège, Namur and Leuven. School strikes have been also been held in Germany, Switzerland and Australia and a global School Strikes 4 Climate Action march is set for 15 March.
Belgium has four environment ministers – one for each region and at the national level – but it has no national policy to reach the 2030 goal set by the UN of limiting global temperature rise to well below 2C, and strive for 1.5C.
Anuna De Wever, the 18-year-old Flemish student who first sparked the demonstrations in Belgium, had described the claims by Schauvliege, a member of the Flemish Christian Democrats, as “manifestly not true” and an “insult to the youth”.
“It is very strange that a minister can lie about such a thing,” she said. “That’s just not the case. Can we stop doubting the movement?”
The largest march so far in Belgium, two weeks ago in Brussels, saw 35,000 children demonstrate.
A spokesman for Youth for Climate, the organisation set up by De Wever to organise the protests by schoolchildren, said the comments were in keeping with the Belgian authorities’ failure to commit to international climate change goals.
“The minister’s allegation is an insult to the authentic engagement of so many young people,” they said in a statement before the announcement of Schauvliege’s resignation.
The Flemish minister-president, Geert Bourgeois, had described the environment minister’s comments as “unfortunate”.
The response of Flemish politicians to the climate change demonstrations has come under heavy criticism.
The chairman of the Flemish nationalist party the New Flemish Alliance, which was until recently in government, last month urged the young protesters “not to believe in the apocalypse” but to go back to their books and have “confidence in the future and in the power of innovation”.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/05/belgian-environment-minister-joke-schauvliege-claimed-children-climate-protests-a-set-up

The world in 2018 was 1.5F (0.83C) warmer than the average set between 1951 and 1980, said Nasa and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa). This means 2018’s average global temperatures were the fourth warmest since 1880, placing it behind 2016, 2017 and 2015.
This follows a broader pattern of human-induced climate change, which is boosting increasingly punishing heatwaves, sea level rises and extreme weather. Last year saw a pair of devastating hurricanes hit the eastern US, while record wildfires ravaged California.
There was disastrous flooding in India, a huge typhoon in the Philippines and deadly wildfires in Greece and Sweden. The Arctic, which had its second warmest year on record, experienced temperature highs that astonished scientists.
“2018 is yet again an extremely warm year on top of a long-term global warming trend,” said Gavin Schmidt, director of Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies.
“The impacts of long-term global warming are already being felt – in coastal flooding, heatwaves, intense precipitation and ecosystem change.”
Schmidt said that 2018 was “quite clearly the fourth warmest year on record and it was probably warmer than many hundreds of years before that”.
He added he was “very concerned with what is going on in the Arctic”, which is heating up at around double the rate of the global average. Average extent of sea ice in the Arctic was the second smallest on record in 2018.
Nasa and Noaa’s annual climate reports, which were delayed because of the federal government shutdown, echo findings by Berkley Earth and Europe’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, which both recently stated 2018 was the fourth warmest on record.
Each new year may not set a temperature record but the long-term warming “resembles riding up an escalator over time and jumping up and down while on that escalator”, said Deke Arndt, chief of Noaa’s climate monitoring division, referring to variables such as the El Niño pattern. “The jumping up and down can be driven by internal processes.”
On Wednesday, the World Meteorological Organization announced it, too, measured 2018 as the fourth warmest on record. It said 2016 remains the warmest on record due to a particularly strong El Niño, which is a periodic event that warms parts of the Pacific Ocean and influences weather patterns around the world.
“The long-term temperature trend is far more important than the ranking of individual years, and that trend is an upward one,“ said Petteri Taalas, secretary general of the WMO. “The 20 warmest years on record have been in the past 22 years. The degree of warming during the past four years has been exceptional, both on land and in the ocean.”
Taalas said the extreme weather events of the past year have had “devastating repercussions” for people, economies and ecosystems.
“Many of the extreme weather events are consistent with what we expect from a changing climate,” he said. “This is a reality we need to face up to. Greenhouse gas emission reduction and climate adaptation measures should be a top global priority.”
Schmidt said that without an El Niño, 2017 would be the warmest year on record, with 2018 the third warmest. This year has started with mild El Nino conditions, “which suggests 2019 will be warmer than 2018 but that’s more a rule of thumb than a firm prediction”, Schmidt said.
The relentless warming has highlighted the steep challenges faced by governments if they want to avoid the worst effects of climate change. The world needs to halve its greenhouse gas emissions by the 2030s to avoid breaching limits set out in the Paris climate agreement, the UN warned last year, at a time when global emissions show no sign of decline.
Britain’s Met Office on Wednesday warned the 1.5C temperature increase limit agreed in Paris, compared with a pre-industrial baseline, could start to be exceeded far sooner than many predicted. The Met Office said there is a 10% chance of at least one year between 2019 and 2023 temporarily exceeding 1.5C.
In January, the same organization warned that levels of planet-warming carbon dioxide will rise by a near-record amount in 2019. Levels of CO2 in the atmosphere have not been as prevalent on Earth for at least 3 million years – a period when the seas were 10-20 meters higher.
“The Earth has taken a walloping since 2014,” said Brenda Ekwurzel, director of climate science at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “Eighteen of the 19 warmest years since record keeping began have occurred since 2001. That means kids graduating from high school have only known a world of record-breaking temperatures.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/06/global-temperatures-2018-record-climate-change-global-warming

Researchers working as part of a Nasa-led study found the cavern, which they said was 300 metres tall and two-thirds the size of Manhattan, at the bottom of the massive Thwaites glacier.
The space is big enough to have contained 14bn tonnes of ice and most of that ice has melted during the past three years.
In a paper published in Science Advances, the scientists said the rapid change in the ice was “unexpected” at some points on the glacier.
The researchers found the cavity using Italian and German satellites and ice-penetrating radar from Nasa’s Operation IceBridge, which uses research aircraft to monitor changes in polar ice.
“[The size of] a cavity under a glacier plays an important role in melting,” said the study’s lead author, Pietro Milillo, who is scientist at the Nasa Jet Propulsion Laboratory. “As more heat and water get under the glacier, it melts faster.”
But Milillo told the Guardian the size of the underwater cavity was not the main concern because the 14bn tonnes it released were already underwater and so would not contribute to sea level rise. The important aspect of the paper, he said, was what it revealed about the interaction between sea and ice.
Jeremie Mouginot, a co-author of the paper and a research scientist at the Université Grenoble Alpes, said ocean water was filling a widening gap between the floating ice shelf and the bedrock.
Thwaites, he said, was a 120km-wide “monster glacier” that is continuing its retreat with huge future implications, because it could potentially add 0.6 metres to rising seas.
Thwaites also supports neighbouring glaciers that, if they melted, would increase sea levels by an additional 2.44 metres, threatening coastal communities worldwide.
Mouginot said further studies would be needed on where and how Thwaites will decline. “The current question is not if the glaciers will retreat but at which pace.”
There are already new investigations of Thwaites under way, including one by a UK team, as well as studies of other Antarctic regions.
The hole is on the glacier’s western side and has been melting at a rate of about 0.6 to 0.8km a year since 1992, a rate that while stable was “extremely high”, Nasa said.
Eric Rignot, a co-author of the study, said understanding how warming oceans were melting the glacier away was “essential to project its impact on sea level rise in the coming decades”.
“We have suspected for years that Thwaites was not tightly attached to the bedrock beneath it,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/07/cavity-two-thirds-the-size-of-manhattan-discovered-under-antarctic-glacier

Tim Wilson never disclosed, before Wilson Asset Management appeared before our committee, that he was a shareholder in that particular company. Now we believe that that may be a breach of the parliamentary standing orders, and we now have evidence that Tim Wilson may have handed over people’s personal data to Wilson Asset Management, after they’d signed the website, in agreeing to provide a submission to the economics committee. That may be a breach of Australia’s electoral laws, and in that respect I’ve written to the AFP commissioner and asked him to investigate that.”
Opening the hearing this afternoon, Wilson tried to tackle the disclosure issue head-on, pointing out that his Wilson Asset Management holding was disclosed on the pecuniary interests register, and in any case he faced no conflict because he paid tax and therefore would not be impacted by Labor’s policy. “Go nuts,” he said.""

I put a 3 Kw/12 panel system costing $2,995 on my roof in April 2014. The first complete billing period I could compare my bill without panels, to the same billing period 12 months later with panels, showed a $200 saving. Over the full year the saving came to just over $800. At first glance it would seem that 4 years X $800 = $3,200 means the system paid for itself in 4 years, the additional $200 being the opportunity cost of having the same $2,995 sitting in a bank account earning minimal interest during that time, less tax on that interest. However this doesn't allow for rising electricity costs during that period, and I calculated the actual break even point at 3 years 8 months. Since then I am in front by about $1,000 a year. I could add an additional 8 panels and have a 5 Kw system, but no more, since I'm not allowed to exceed 5 Kw. I would like to do that, plus another 10 panels on the garage roof (I've had it measured and they fit nicely) for a total of 30 panels, and power a battery or two, but I am not allowed to. If I could do this, I could also power the HWS (hot water service), currently on gas, as well as eventually charge an EV (electric vehicle). But the only way I could legally do this is to withdraw from the grid. I would be happy to do as described, and be paid nil for a FIT (feed-in tariff), or have it run to ground or share my excess power with my neighbours, so my excess production doesn't upset the grid.

While emissions have been rising across the economy since the Abbott government repealed the carbon price after winning government in 2013, they have been falling in the electricity sector because of the closure of ageing coal plants and the rapid uptake of renewables.
The lead researcher, ANU professor Andrew Blakers, says Australia is currently installing renewable power four or five times per capita faster than the European Union, Japan, China and the United States. That finding is based on preliminary data available for installations globally last year.
Blakers says that trend is expected to continue, unless politics intervenes. “The electricity sector is on track to deliver Australia’s entire Paris emissions reduction targets five years early, in 2025 – without the need for any creative accounting,” he says.
“Australia is on track to reach 50% renewable electricity in 2024 and 100% by 2032,” he says. “The Australian renewable energy experience offers real hope for rapid global emissions reductions to preserve a living planet.”
The research notes that in the year to June 2018, total Australian emissions increased by 3.4 megatonnes substantially due to increased liquefied natural gas exports, but predicts that will moderate “because of stabilisation of emissions from LNG, the government’s Direct Action program and increased uptake of electric water heaters and electric vehicles”.
The research assumes emissions outside the electricity sector will increase annually by 2 megatonnes a year “which is much smaller than decreases in the electricity sector from the uptake of wind and PV”.
“The overall decrease of 10-11 MT per year is fast enough to reach Australia’s entire Paris target in 2025,” it says.
The ANU research suggests the net cost of achieving the Paris targets is zero, because renewables are now cheaper than fossil fuels. The co-researcher Matthew Stocks says the price of electricity from large-scale solar PV and windfarms is currently about $50MWh “and steadily falling”.
“This is below the cost of electricity from existing gas-fired power stations and is also below the cost of new-build gas and coal power stations,” Stocks says.
“Nearly all of the new power stations are either PV or wind. We anticipate that this will continue into the future, provided that energy policy is not actively hindering development.”
The Morrison government has flagged using a controversial underwriting program to have taxpayers subsidise new coal plants, and the energy minister, Angus Taylor, has signalled new plants could be indemnified against the future risk of a carbon price.
Industry stakeholders have criticised the short timeframe for the program, and the Australian Industry Group has warned it could leave taxpayers exposed to liabilities “with a net present value of billions of dollars” because the government could indemnify projects against the costs of new climate change policies.
A mix of coal power plants, pumped hydro and gas-fired power have been presented to the government as options for new electricity generation.
The coal baron Trevor St Baker is proposing a $6bn plan for two new coal power plants. But the proposal has been criticised by the Victorian energy and environment minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, who has criticised the Morrison government for seeking to promote fossil fuels.
The government says it is pursuing new generation projects to ensure sufficient dispatchable power is available to the grid to ensure power can be delivered reliably around the clock.
But the new ANU research says stabilising the electricity grid when it is comprised of 50-100% renewable energy is straightforward using “off-the-shelf techniques” that are already widely used in Australia.
The techniques referred to are storage, demand management, and strong interstate interconnection using high voltage transmission lines to smooth out the effect of local weather.
The report says government subsidies for solar and wind are no longer required, but it would be valuable for governments to facilitate new private investment in storage and new transmission lines.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/08/australia-can-meet-its-paris-targets-if-government-doesnt-hinder-progress

But for the past five Fridays, while hundreds of her fellow students file into class, she has stood outside Lochaber high school in Fort William in the Highlands to take strike action.
Her protest is not for better classrooms, nicer meals or more free time. Holly, 13, is helping to build a UK movement of children demanding more action on climate change by withdrawing themselves from the lessons they are legally required to attend.
They are working towards a UK school strike next Friday, which will follow other walkouts by tens of thousands of children across Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, Sweden and Australia.
Holly was inspired by the actions of Greta Thunberg, who in September sat outside the Swedish parliament for three weeks on “school strike”. International interest in her story led to Thunberg going to Davos last month to address world leaders. While she travelled for 32 hours on trains to reach the ski resort, political and business leaders hired 1,500 private jets to get to the summit.
Holly said: “I saw on social media that she was sitting outside the parliament, and then lots of other children started doing similar things and I thought, that is something I could do to make a difference. I thought she was brave and inspirational.”
Each week, Holly and a small group of supporters carry placards with slogans such as “School strike for the climate”, “Beep for climate action” and “Striking for the seas – stop global warming now”, and take time out of classes to demand action.
“It’s the first time I have done anything like this,” she said. “But I feel very angry, very scared and I see that they [political leaders] are not taking climate change seriously. It is an urgent crisis that needs to be addressed.”
Holly has tried to make changes to reduce her carbon footprint and insisted the Guardian did not send a photographer to drive two hours from Glasgow to take her portrait. “I take the bus, I am almost completely vegan, as are my parents, and my family has always been very environmentally aware,” she said.
Taking time out of school is a powerful weapon, Holly believes, to draw attention to the need to act more decisively to tackle climate change. “I am not sure how my headteacher feels, but my class teachers have been very supportive,” she said.
“I have had lots of people joining me, although not as many from my school as I hoped, but we are hoping many other children from schools across the country will take action next week.”
Across Europe, a pushback from adults – particularly those in power – seems to have begun. The Belgian environment minister, Joke Schauvliege, recently suggested the school strikes were not genuine actions of young people angry and frustrated about the future of their planet, but a “setup” and “more than spontaneous actions of solidarity”.
Schauvliege claimed Belgium’s intelligence services had information that the children were being directed by unknown groups or individuals. But such was the political backlash, she was forced to resign last week.
Holly has gained support globally via social media, where a network of young people are reaching out across national boundaries. She has little time for adults who doubt and criticise her actions.
“I say to people who object to us missing lessons, what is the point of studying for a future that if nothing is done, we might not have?” she said.
On her first strike day, Holly explained clearly why she was taking the step. “I am striking because we are running out of time. Thousands of children around the world should not be having to miss classes because of our leaders’ inability to treat the climate crisis as a crisis,” she said.
Over the past few weeks, she has featured in Scottish media and been recruited as an environment columnist for the Lochaber Times.
And her sense of urgency and passion has only increased. As the school strike message continues to spread across the globe, Holly says she is determined to follow Thunberg’s lead.
“Greta Thunberg, thank you for leading the way,” she said in a tweet. “You are right – with action does come hope.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/08/holly-gillibrand-school-strike-climate-action-skipping-class

Over the past fortnight, the northern Queensland city’s 180,000 residents have been hit by a monsoon strengthened by a low-pressure front that dragged moist air south from the equator to Australia’s top end.
It dumped an unprecedented 1.4 metres of rain in less than two weeks – roughly double what falls on London in a year.
The ensuing chaos has wrecked homes and caused hundreds of millions of dollars of damage to property. Two men have drowned and videos posted to social media have shown crocodiles climbing trees and taking to elevated highways in search of shelter.
But amid the deluge, not everyone heeded the evacuation advice.
Mark Parison was one of those who stayed. The tide where he lives in Hermit Park peaked at least two metres high on some homes and the road was decorated with debris – furniture, white goods and children’s toys – pulled from homes as the water receded. But Parison’s traditional Queenslander home, elevated on concrete pillars, remained largely intact.
If anyone mentions [climate change], I’ll punch ‘em.
As he moved piles of damaged property to the roadside for local authorities to collect, he told Guardian Australia why he ignored the advice to run.
“It was a scary old night [but] this house has been here for a long time. We decided … it’s been here that long, it’s been through some big floods,” he said.
Asked if he was concerned that climate change was making floods more extreme, he was clear: “If anyone mentions that, I’ll punch ‘em.”
“The weather events seem to be getting more extreme. Whether it’s manmade or natural or who knows.
“These people crying about climate change, they’ve got to look at how they live themselves. They’re still driving around in cars, they’re still wearing nice clothes. They’re using mobile phones. So give that up, I’ll start listening to you.
“City people are stalling us. We need the economy here to be boosted.”
In a city with nearly one in ten unemployed his view holds purchase. And so goes some of the public debate in Australia about the impact of rising greenhouse gas emissions.
The north Queensland flooding is far from the only punishing event in what has been, even by the standards of the continent, a historically hostile summer. Internal polling for political parties and environment groups suggests Australians are increasingly concerned that this is linked to climate change and want to see action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as a priority at this year’s federal election. It matches public polling that has found a comfortable majority accept it is a significant problem that needs to be addressed.
But after a decade of political fights and ideological warfare, discussion on the subject is often still a combat zone. The Coalition government would prefer not to talk about it at all.
Australia is, of course, no stranger to extreme weather - bushfire, flooding, rains and skin-peeling heat are central to its history and mythology - but the contrasts this southern summer have been particularly stark. Lesley Hughes, a professor of biology at Macquarie University and councillor with publicly funded communication body the Climate Council, says few parts of the continent have not experienced an extreme weather event in recent months.
More than 3000 kilometres to Townsville’s south, Tasmania is burning. For the second time in four years, dry lightning strikes sparked a series of blazes on the usually cool, temperate island, many of them in the vast world heritage wilderness area that covers nearly half its territory. In one 30-hour period in mid-January, an extended electrical storm danced across the summer sky, sending down more than 2400 lightning strikes without rain.
About 200,000 hectares - 3% of the state’s surface - has been burned, including unique alpine heath landscapes that had not been touched by fire for centuries. The fires are expected to burn for another month at least. Hundreds of people, many of them from in and around the southern town of Geeveston, spent the best part of two weeks camping at evacuation centres. Six homes were destroyed before rain late in the week reduced the threat to communities.
The prime minister is still pandering to the right-wing sceptics in his party
Elsewhere, communities in the sparsely populated Australian outback continue to deal with the fallout from a long-term drought. On social media, a Greens MP in New South Wales, David Shoebridge, highlighted a constituent forced to pay $70 a week on drinking water for her and her son after the raw water supply in the town of Walgett was turned off.
A political battle is also raging over the use of water in the vast Murray-Darling river system that fans across the country’s eastern state agricultural districts, with drought-afflicted downstream communities arguing they are being denied water by a national river plan that did not factor in climate change and has been designed to keep dams full at water-hungry industrial agriculture sites in northern states.
This claim has been backed by a royal commission convened by the state of South Australia, which lies at the end of the river system, and the continuing disaster of up to a million fish having perished in three mass kills in the west of New South Wales due to water deoxygenation, with more deaths predicted.
The sense of a country playing extreme weather bingo has heightened as flood and drought collided this week, requiring the defence force to be called in to distribute fodder to cattle that had suddenly found their long-parched home under water. By Friday, it was clear that up to 300,000 cattle had been killed in the floods. With evidence mounting that authorities were unprepared for the extent of the rainfall, the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, announced an independent inquiry.
For most, the most obvious extreme weather shift has been the heat. January was Australia’s hottest month on record by a wide margin, with average national temperatures nearly a degree beyond the previous benchmark and 2.9 degrees warmer than the long-term mean. In New South Wales, the average temperature was nearly 6 degrees hotter than what has been considered normal for the past century.
Blair Trewin, senior climatologist with the Bureau of Meteorology, says: “Even taking into account the sustained long-term warming trend of a degree or so over a century, this is certainly at the far end of expectations.”
It is the heat that seems to be shifting public concern about climate change. Political polling suggests it is registering in the top two or three issues of concern for voters in a way it has not since the 2007 election, when the country was enduring a decade long drought, if not ever. The trend is headed in this direction even in some outer suburban electorates, which have traditionally been more driven by jobs and cost-of-living issues.
But the shift is not universal. The government is hearing similar messages, but there has been no change in messaging from prime minister Scott Morrison. He visited the Tasmanian fires and Queensland floods within a 24-hour period, speaking with people who had been forced to flee their homes, thanking emergency service workers and, in Townsville, was photographed climbing into a tank. He drew no link between the extreme weather and emissions in his public comments and he dismissed as a stunt a suggestion by the Greens that he should apologise for backing coal given there was evidence it was making natural disasters worse.
The Nationals leader and deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, went a step further while visiting the site of the Menindee Lake mass fish kill, choosing language that suggested outright scepticism about climate science.
“We are looking at climate, of course, (but) climate has been changing since year dot,” he said, before adding: “We don’t want to go down a path of renewables, which is not going to solve anything apart from de-industrialising Australia and making sure we don’t do manufacturing here and pushing electricity bills into the unaffordable state.”
While concern about climate change is growing, there is evidence this position retains support – Essential Media polling late last year, for instance, suggested a slim majority of voters may back public financial support for a new coal power development than would oppose it, though more than quarter said they did not know what they thought.
The suggestion governments may force coal industries to close are particularly challenging issues in Townsville, which is the centre of support for the Carmichael coalmine, the long-stalled greenfield project proposed by Indian billionaire Gautam Adani that has become a proxy for debate over climate change. The mining industry posits itself as a jobs saviour. But, as always, views are split.
Katie McGrath was among the lucky ones in the Queensland floods, having got caught up and seeing her car in a metre of water. A social worker who works in Townsville but lives on nearby Magnetic Island, she had not realised how great the threat was before getting into trouble. “I’ve never seen the island flood like this before,” she said.
McGrath has little doubt that what Townsville has been experiencing is part of a bigger picture, but acknowledges she is out of step with many in her community.
“There’s clearly things happening around the world that are alarming,” she says. “It’s like anything, if you don’t know enough about it then you seek advice from experts, and what they’re telling us is that we’ve got a real problem with climate change and we need to do something about it.”
But despite the experts, Townsville is the epicentre of support for the Adani coalmine. For every flood affected resident who is concerned about climate change, several others share Parison’s views.
Roughly one in 10 people in Townsville are unemployed. About 16% of the population is university educated, compared with 22% Australia wide. People want economic growth and employment opportunities. And, for all the boom and bust cycles places such as Townsville have endured in the past, the mining industry still posits itself as a jobs saviour.
But McGrath believes adequate communication about the opportunities that come with a cleaner economy is missing.
“For those people, work’s been hard to come by for a while and that’s been a real issue for people in Townsville,” she said.
“There’s not really been much put forward, and this region is really dependent on mining. People want to see jobs in mining, they want to see Adani go ahead. That’s the priority for people at the moment. Whether they agree with climate change, care about it or whatever, that’s a secondary priority to making ends meet now.
“I don’t necessarily think people are addicted to coal, or think that coal’s great. We haven’t been offered different information or alternatives about different jobs that are available. At the moment that’s not there.”
Her observations underline the challenge in some parts of the country for the Labor party, which is favoured to win the election with a platform of taking climate change seriously, but beyond the electricity sector is yet to explain what meeting its more ambitious greenhouse targets would mean.
Part of the challenge of communicating climate change is explaining the science, particularly the extent to which any extreme event can be linked to increasing emissions.
Attribution science is a rapidly evolving field. Lesley Hughes, who helped launch a Climate Council report called Weather Gone Wild, says emissions are effectively loading the dice to increase the likelihood of an extreme weather event. “What we are now observing is consistent with the climate science – as the Earth warms up, more extreme weather is inevitable,” she says.
In the case of the floods, a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, which in the event of a storm can mean heavier rain in a shorter space of time.
In the case of the Tasmanian fires, not only has the state become warmer (2.5 degrees above average in January) but low-pressure weather patterns that used to produce rain over the state have also moved further south as the climate has warmed, and evaporation rates have increased. Both increase the risk of dry lightning strike causing a blaze. Hobart, the Tasmanian capital, recorded just 0.4 millimetres of rain in January, the lowest on record.
Hughes says governments can obfuscate for only so long before publicly accepting that climate change is now both a mitigation and adaptation challenge. Failing to acknowledge the role humans are playing is holding back conversations about, for instance, whether Australia needs to invest in fire-fighting aircraft rather than sharing with the US, given the northern and southern fire seasons are increasingly overlapping.
“The prime minister is still pandering to the right-wing sceptics in his party by not talking about climate change. But arguing black is white doesn’t make it so,” she says. “The government has to accept these events are going to get worse over the next few decades and plan accordingly – both to adapt and to be part of the solution instead of the problem.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/10/floods-fire-and-drought-australia-a-country-in-the-grip-of-extreme-weather-bingo

She has been coming since 1996 and hasn’t minced her words once.
I doubt too that Greta Thunberg, the environmental activist, had next year’s invite at the forefront of her mind when she accused a room packed with adults of “stealing our future”. Or Guy Ryder from the International Labour Organization, when he called for universal protection for workers in the face of an automation onslaught.
Our own work last month saw us calling out governments for climate inaction, urging businesses to reskill their workers faster and encouraging everyone to eat less meat to reduce carbon emissions.
We hold our annual meeting in January to set an agenda for the year ahead. This is why we will keep on inviting people like Byanyima and Bregman to help us define the priorities. Now that Davos is over, it’s time for the real work to begin – redesigning social safety nets, taxation, job creation and bringing about a reskilling revolution. If we can build a fairer, more inclusive society we have a chance of solving climate change and other longstanding problems. Not even Giridharadas could deny that would be a win-win.Oliver CannWorld Economic Forum

Previous studies show the maximum renewable energy potential is about 22% of current energy demand. Currently renewables are providing less than 11% of global energy demand. In the US wind (6%) and solar (1%) produced only 7% of US energy demand in 2017. The production of renewable generation devices of course a significant petroleum - carbon foot print. Determining realistic solar and wind potential is confused by the total energy in wind and solar - ignoring the many limitations and inefficiencies in actually capturing and storing it. If the Green New Deal is going to have any success, they need to start it with a dose of physical and economic reality. It's taken 50 years of wind and solar development to produce 7% of the US energy supply. If the Green dreamers create expectations that they will eliminate the US carbon footprint by 2028 - they are setting themselves up for a total failure from the start. They are going to have some of that green crap on their faces - like Obama did with biofuels and solar panel companies like Solyndra.

That is because it has a single radical ask: an ecological and economic transformation of the current system to end our addiction to fossil fuels and endless consumption of the earth’s finite assets.
The Green New Deal demands major structural (governmental and inter-governmental) changes (not just behavioural change) in our approach to the ecosystem. In addition, and as in the 1930s, such change to be driven by radical structural transformation of the finance sector, and the economy. It was developed on the understanding that finance, the economy and the ecosystem are all tightly bound together. Protecting and restoring the ecosystem to balance cannot be tackled effectively without transformation of the other sectors. Financing the transformation of the economy away from its dependence on fossil fuels cannot be achieved without a transformation of the finance sector.
Way back in 2009, before the Copenhagen conference on climate change, I watched in dismay as a “green” demonstration assembled in London’s Trafalgar Square. A relatively small group of people (I had witnessed many much larger demonstrations descend on that famous square) were there to demand that world leaders do something to protect societies from climate breakdown. But it was not at all clear what exactly was wanted of those leaders. This was because they, and their leaders had not arrived at a consensus behind an “ask” of the rich and powerful gathered in Copenhagen.
There was no slogan akin to “give women the vote”, “cancel poor country debt by 2000” or “repeal apartheid laws”. The reason why was plain to see. Like a football ground covered in advertising by competing brands, Trafalgar Square was covered in the banners and posters of many different non-governmental organisations – some green, some not. Despite all the “messaging” these organisations were preoccupied with their own survival and had failed to cooperate to unite behind a single demand of world leaders. Instead, like brands displayed in any football ground, they were involved in a competitive game of raising profiles to secure additional funding.
The green movement, dubbed the “largest movement on earth”, is vast, disparate, atomised and marginalised. As the ever-vigilant Paul Hawken notes, it “cannot be seen … by anyone”. It has failed to connect with movements against the “globalist” establishment – and against austerity and insecurity. One reason is that its advocates tend to focus on individual (“change your lightbulbs”) or community (“recycle, reuse, reduce, localise”) action. They have been weak at understanding and promoting the need for radical structural change across sectors and at a global and national level – change that involves state action. And such structural change cannot just be undertaken at the level of international negotiations on the environment. It has to embrace, as the Green New Deal does – the need for structural change to the global financial and economic system.
Its ambition is on a much grander scale than Roosevelt’s 1930s New Deal. (Recall that his administration also faced an ecological catastrophe: the dust bowl). The climate threats we face are on a scale beyond the imagination of New Dealers. Still we must learn from Roosevelt’s administration. To tackle climate change we need simultaneously to tackle the root cause of growing toxic emissions: a self-regulating, globalised financial system that injects exponential supplies of unregulated credit into the hands of speculators and consumers. Credit that is used in turn to inflate the prices of existing assets, and to fuel consumption of the earth’s finite assets extracted via the energy of fossil fuels. Only once we switch off, regulate and moderate the “tap” of “easy money” will it be possible to regulate and “switch off” the toxic emissions of fossil fuels.
The realism of the Green New Deal demand is precisely because it harks back to an era in which the global economy was transformed (almost overnight) by the revolutionary Keynesian monetary policies of an American president. These enabled his administration to deploy fiscal policy to transform both the domestic economy, but also the dust bowl. This was done by creating millions of jobs via the Conservation Civilian Corps, whose workers planted more than  3bn trees and constructed trails and shelters in more than 800 parks nationwide during nine years of existence.
The experience and success of the New Deal – deeply flawed in many respects – nevertheless assures us that transformation is possible. After all, it has been done before, and within living memory.
And we know that can be done, because it was done before – by the popular will that backed Franklin D Roosevelt’s administration as it began (on the night of his inauguration in 1933) to dismantle the globalised gold standard system.
That is the broad, conceptual framework offered by the Green New Deal. An “umbrella” for mobilising and unifying the efforts of millions of people tackling climate breakdown, financial sector failure and globalised economic insecurity. An umbrella that will hopefully unite and inspire vast numbers of green activists across the world – and in turn trigger state action to subordinate finance to the interests of society and the ecosystem – and thereby ensure a livable planet for future generations.

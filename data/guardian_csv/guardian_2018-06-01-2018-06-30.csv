People who actually know about this take a different view. Here's a quotation from the California Forest Carbon Plan, published last month which shows how concerned the local authority is :
California’s forests, wildlands and adjacent communities have seen significant impacts associated with climate change over the past eight years. The series of destructive events includes:• Largest forest fire in the state’s history: Rim Fire (2013), 257,314 acres burned.1• Largest wildfire in the state’s recorded history: Thomas Fire (December 2017), 282,000 acres.1• Deadliest wildfire complex in the state’s history: Northern California Fires (October 2017), over40 deaths.1• Most destructive California wildfire: Tubbs Fire (October 2017), 5,643 structures destroyed.1• Record drought: The 2012–2016 drought was unprecedented in its combination of warmth anddryness.2• Record tree mortality: Due to drought, insects, and high stand density (2010-2017), 129 milliontrees died, mostly concentrated in 10 “high-priority” counties in the Sierra Nevada.3

That’s a speed normally associated with fires driven by the powerful Santa Ana winds, like the ones which helped drive the Thomas Fire, which was the largest in modern California history, last December, when S California should have had 2” of rain.
Two years ago a NSW fire chief said Australian fire fighters were having to change their tactics for the new, more extreme fire behavior. If you increase heat, drought and pests, and reduce snow cover, you load the dice for more extreme fire behavior.

California is rapidly plunging back into drought, with severe conditions now existing in Santa Barbara, Ventura and Los Angeles counties—home to one-fourth of the state's population, a national drought monitor said Thursday. 
The weekly report released by the U.S. Drought Monitor, a project of government agencies and other partners, also shows 44 percent of the state is now considered to be in a moderate drought. It's a dramatic jump from just last week, when the figure was 13 percent.

For an up to date assessment, here is the regional map at the United States Drought Monitor website, date June 21st 2018, in which southern California's current rating ranges from D0 (Abnormally dry), through D3 (extreme drought). According to the data, there is no part of SoCal that isn't experiencing drought.

New research reveals that cloud cover is plummeting in southern coastal California, increasing the chances of bigger and more intense wildfires.
Since the 1970s Californian airports have monitored cloud cover, for navigational safety. Park Williams, from Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, and colleagues studied these records and discovered that over the past 40 years low-lying summer clouds have decreased by up to 50% in the greater Los Angeles area. Typically moist ocean air brings stratus cloud along the coast in the morning, and as the heat builds the clouds dissipate. But now the clouds are higher and don’t hang around as long. “Clouds that used to burn off by noon or one o’clock are now gone by 10 or 11am, if they form at all,” said Williams, whose findings are published in Geophysical Research Letters.
A combination of global warming and increasing city sprawl (the urban heat-island effect) are the main drivers behind the reduction in cloud cover. And less cloud cover means drier vegetation and greater chance of fire. To date firefighters have been swift to deal with summer wildfires, but the increasing danger means they will have their work cut out.

It first gained government approval as long ago as 1946 but was abandoned by the incoming government in 1952. Since then there have been further attempts and in 2009 it once again gained parliamentary approval. This was overturned by the coalition government one year later when David Cameron declared: “No ifs, no buts, no third runway.” This might have been the end of the matter but the ‘aviation mafia’ is nothing if not persistent and never gives up.Philip SherwoodAuthor, Heathrow: 2000 Years of History, Harlington, Middlesex
• There is one vital element of the Heathrow runway debate that has not been aired this time (again) and is surely the central point. In the 1970s, an energy study warned us of the finite nature of oil-based transport. According to the Institute of Mechanical Engineers in 2016, there are 1.3tn barrels of proven oil reserves left in the world’s major fields, which at present rates of consumption should last 40 years. So if it takes 20-30 years to build the third runway, that means just 10 years of use. And that does not take into account current population expansion rates and the likelihood of greater demand on oil reserves over the next 30 years. A third runway at Heathrow is utterly futile and pointless. Air travel in its current form is dying. We need new solutions, new energy sources – not tired out old arguments.Nigel CubbageMerstham, Surrey
• Climate change is a good reason for opposing a third runway at Heathrow. Air pollution is another. The chief executive of Heathrow, John Holland-Kaye, has circulated local residents reassuring them that he takes this issue very seriously. In fact Heathrow uses diesel generators to refuel around 40% of its planes. It has been offered renewable energy generated locally but turned down the proposal as it was slightly more expensive. So pollution and sustainability do not seem to feature in Holland-Kaye’s business decisions.
Nor it seems in the government’s. The real reason for Chris Grayling’s announcement is that Brexit will free the UK from the EU air quality directive; and we already know that Michael Gove’s new Environment Agency has no regulatory teeth. It can issue advisory notices regarding pollution levels at Heathrow, but the government will be immune from prosecution. Those who have hitherto failed to comprehend the cynical rationale behind Brexit need look no further than Heathrow.Dr Robin Russell-JonesChair, Help Rescue the Planet

They have 400 breeding cows that will calve in six weeks. Shortly, 89 of those cows will leave the property, sold to an abattoir because the cost of feeding the animals during drought has become too great.
“There is nowhere to send them to pasture so they are going to be slaughtered,” Kuhn says.
“We’re killing a cow and a calf at this late stage of pregnancy. The drought is so widespread there’s just no options left for stock producers to put them anywhere. That’s why it’s so heartbreaking.
“Australia doesn’t realise. The cattle we’ve got are rapidly diminishing because of the drought.”

She and her partner Paul run beef cattle, producing grass-fed beef for the domestic and export markets.
December was the end of their seventh calendar year of below-average rainfall. In the 12 months to May this year, they have had just over 50% of their annual average rainfall.
“It’s terrible on the back of seven below-average rainfall years in a row,” Fleck says.
“We can’t get over a string of really hot summers. With the sheer consistency of extreme temperatures, the rate of evaporating is so high. We don’t have any surface water left on our property.”
They are relying on two bores and have begun selling their cattle as it becomes harder to sustain the high cashflow that’s necessary to buy in feed.
Everywhere is worse than I've ever seen it
“We spoke to the owners who had this property from 1954 to 1989. We asked what the creek was like in their 34 years. They said it had never dried up,” Fleck says.
During the past 14 months, the Bureau of Meteorology has recorded below-average rainfall across New South Wales, central Queensland, the north-west of Victoria and into South Australia.
NSW has been the hardest hit in 2018. With the exception of the north and south coasts, most of the state has recorded the lowest rainfall in a five-month period since 1900.
Soil moisture levels are below average across much of Australia and in its latest winter outlook, the bureau is forecasting warmer and drier than average conditions across large parts of the country.
Communities in NSW say people are struggling and the rest of the country is not aware of the extent of the troubles in parts of that state. 
“I had noted it hadn’t been getting a lot of attention,” says Jane Judd, a retired science teacher from Coonabarabran who sits on the regional advisory committee of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. 
“I’m on a number of committees and boards and I’ve travelled from Tamworth to Cobar, Moree to Goulburn, and everywhere is worse than I’ve ever seen it.”
Judd owned a farm at the southern end of the Pilliga which she sold several years ago to the national parks service. The property sits in fertile valleys that had permanent water and swamps. She took a drive to the site a month ago and said everything had dried up.
Coonabarabran itself is on level-six water restrictions. Last week the Timor dam was at 23.6 % of its capacity and in recent weeks the Warrumbungles shire council has been sourcing water from four bores and the Castlereagh river, rather than the dam.
“They’re desperately sinking bores around the town to try and augment the storage capacity of the groundwater,” says Peter Brookhouse, a Coonabarabran resident and retired fire management officer with national parks.
“We are seeing extraordinary weather conditions everywhere.”
Malcolm Turnbull has been touring drought-stricken parts of the country with the agriculture minister, David Littleproud, and the deputy prime minister and Nationals leader, Michael McCormack.
Kuhn says while the tour is welcome, any conversation needs to be more open to voices from those affected.
In the next three weeks we’re going to lose our winter crop-sowing window
“I admire that they’re on the ground talking to people but it’s too bloody quick,” she says. “It’s a quick fix, it gives nothing tangible for people.”
She says there are simple things that could be done to assist farmers in trouble: chopping firewood, helping mend fences or offering assistance to eradicate feral animals such as pigs and goats that wander onto properties in search of water – all jobs that get neglected when farmers are in “a vacuum”, consumed with trying to keep their stock alive.
“When you read things about farmers having to destroy their own stock, that’s one of the hardest things a farmer would have to do,” she says.
“If you can get help with that from the government to do that – that would be something tangible.”
Alistair Donaldson runs a mixed cattle and grain property west of Boggabri.
He says the government’s emphasis on preparation for a drought is appropriate because farmers have to make sure the right management approaches are in place before drought sets in. But he believes more can be done to help farmers learn from past experiences and make sure there is solid investment in rural infrastructure. 
Donaldson is 55 and has worked in farming his whole life. He has experienced droughts before and says rainfall conditions on his property are similar to those he experienced in 2002.
“But what’s made it worse is a series of drier summers leading up to this,” he says. 
“The last four or five years we’ve had very dry summers and extreme heat and evaporation events. We’re getting very big temperature spikes now where there never used to be.”
He has started selling some of his cattle to feedlots and needs rain to plant winter crops such as oats, wheat, canola and legumes.
“The big issue for us is in the next three weeks we’re going to lose our winter crop-sowing window,” he says.
“Once you lose that window that will mean that we have no winter crop and that will have huge implications for the whole eastern seaboard.” 
This week, farmer and former Nationals leader John Anderson cautioned Turnbull against politicising the drought by attributing it to climate change, telling the Financial Review the conditions were the worst he had experienced, but not unprecedented.

The trees, aged between 1,100 and 2,500 years and in some cases as wide as a bus is long, may have fallen victim to climate change, the team speculated.
“We report that nine of the 13 oldest … individuals have died, or at least their oldest parts/stems have collapsed and died, over the past 12 years,” they wrote in the scientific journal Nature Plants, describing “an event of an unprecedented magnitude”.
“It is definitely shocking and dramatic to experience during our lifetime the demise of so many trees with millennial ages,” said the study’s co-author Adrian Patrut of the Babeș-Bolyai University in Romania. 
Among the nine were four of the largest African baobabs. While the cause of the die-off remains unclear, the researchers “suspect that the demise of monumental baobabs may be associated at least in part with significant modifications of climate conditions that affect southern Africa in particular”.
Further research is needed, said the team from Romania, South Africa and the United States, “to support or refute this supposition”.
Between 2005 and 2017, the researchers probed and dated “practically all known very large and potentially old” African baobabs – more than 60 individuals in all. Collating data on girth, height, wood volume and age, they noted the “unexpected and intriguing fact” that most of the very oldest and biggest trees died during the study period. All were in southern Africa – Zimbabwe, Namibia, South Africa, Botswana, and Zambia.
The baobab is the biggest and longest-living flowering tree, according to the research team. It is found naturally in Africa’s savannah region and outside the continent in tropical areas to which it was introduced. It is a strange-looking plant, with branches resembling gnarled roots reaching for the sky, giving it an upside-down look.
The iconic tree can live to be 3,000 years old, according to the website of the Kruger National Park in South Africa, a natural baobab habitat.
The tree serves as a massive store of water, and bears fruit that feeds animals and humans. Its leaves are boiled and eaten as an accompaniment similar to spinach, or used to make traditional medicines, while the bark is pounded and woven into rope, baskets, cloth and waterproof hats.
The purpose of the study was to learn how the trees become so enormous. The researchers used radiocarbon dating to analyse samples taken from different parts of each tree’s trunk. They found that the trunk of the baobab grows from not one but multiple core stems. According to the Kruger Park, baobabs are “very difficult to kill”.
“They can be burnt, or stripped of their bark, and they will just form new bark and carry on growing,” it states. “When they do die, they simply rot from the inside and suddenly collapse, leaving a heap of fibres.”
Of the 10 trees listed by the study authors, four died completely, meaning all their multiple stems toppled and died together, while the others suffered the death of one or several parts.
The oldest tree by far, of which all the stems collapsed in 2010/11, was the Panke tree in Zimbabwe, estimated to have existed for 2,500 years. The biggest, dubbed Holboom, was from Namibia. It stood 30.2 metres (99 feet) tall and had a girth of 35.1 m.

It is the IPCC’s task to make sense of the landscape of scientific findings, where they agree, and why they may differ. The authors of the IPCC’s sixth assessment report – hundreds of scientists across many disciplines – have a massive task on their hands, ahead of its publication in 2021.
When the volume of scientific information continues to grow exponentially, so does the difficulty of maintaining a clear overview. Tracking and reading all of the relevant publications on climate change has become impossible, as more emerge in a single year than was previously the case over an entire, or multiple, assessment periods. Even if there was no further growth over the next three years, the relevant literature to be reviewed for the IPCC’s sixth assessment will be somewhere between 270,000 and 330,000 publications. This is larger than the entire climate change literature before 2014. So conducting a scientific assessment is increasingly a “big literature” challenge.
Managing the literature is vital if we are to ensure the credibility of the IPCC in future. We need to let computers help us to read and digest information we can no longer comprehend on our own. 
The IPCC needs to lead the way towards a new era of computer-assisted assessments. Machine learning and natural language processing must be used to understand and synthesise a huge volume of relevant material. New categories of experts – from scientometrics, computational linguistics and data analytics – will need to be involved. 
Decision-makers also want knowledge from the research community that can contribute to meaningful solutions. But systematic progress in learning about climate solutions has been limited within the IPCC to date. The quest to understand what policies work well – and under what conditions – remains in its infancy. 
This problem is particularly acute in the social sciences. Some argue that social science evidence doesn’t lend itself to generalization. But a bigger challenge is the lack of appreciation for research synthesis as a scientific endeavor in its own right. The dearth of synthetic evidence in policy and social science literatures makes it impossible for the IPCC to aggregate the knowledge that is diffused across thousands of individual studies. 
Changing the culture of the social sciences to better support scientific assessment and accumulated learning about climate change solutions won’t be easy. While the IPCC can act as a catalyst, any shift will also require more capacity in synthesis methods, and support for collaborative networks. Research funders and governments also need to direct more funding towards research synthesis. 
The good news is that there are models for such a transformation. Researchers in medicine, education and psychology have been forced to grapple with similar challenges over recent decades –and systematic research synthesis is now well established within these fields as a basis for policy advice. 
The misleading impression that any single scientific study has the same standing as all others is toxic for a culture of evidence-informed policymaking. By elevating research synthesis to the gold standard of scientific policy advice – and using big data and machine learning techniques to deliver it – we can strengthen the IPCC and provide a stronger response to the Trumps and Erdogans of this world, who want to cherry-pick evidence to suit their own agendas.

Drop meat and dairy, 8 June), another way to reduce greenhouse gases is to stop keeping pets. It’s been calculated that an average dog has an ecological footprint twice as large as that of a large car.
Like meat-eating, pet ownership is nowadays encouraged by a vast industry; the pet insurance sector alone is said to generate more of Britain’s GDP than fishing does. The production of pet food, provision of veterinary services and breeding the creatures are big businesses, all with an interest in promoting the alleged benefits of owning a furry friend.
There’s something rather astonishing about humans, especially those concerned about the environmental impact of our species on other ones, cheerfully possessing animals that are the results of generations of selective breeding and which exist purely to give their owners pleasure. It all sounds a bit like a ghastly dystopian sci-fi fantasy.Brian Hughes Cheltenham
• George Monbiot’s article inspired me to cook vegetable curry for dinner, but surely limiting population growth is as important as changing our diets in order to conserve human and other life forms on this planet?Hazel SutcliffeHolmes Chapel, Cheshire
• The headline of George Monbiot’s article curiously echoes one that appeared in the Guardian last year (Best solution to climate change? Fewer children, 12 July 2017).
This earlier article, reporting on a study published in Environmental Research Letters, compares the results of different courses of action. By far the greatest impact is having one fewer child, which equates to saving 58 tonnes of CO2 for each year of a parent’s life. This takes into account the child’s total life, and that of his or her descendants, in proportions described in the article. In comparison, eating a plant-based diet would only save 0.82 tonnes. There is a graphic in the article which shows this very dramatically.
Therefore, while the measures proposed by George Monbiot are helpful, their effect will be minimal compared with reducing our progeny.Roger PlentyStroud
• George Monbiot is correct that the way we currently produce meat is inherently inefficient. But we don’t have to give up meat entirely. Instead, we should make meat from plants and through tissue engineering – no animals required. Plant-based meats are already available in grocery stores. From Moving Mountains’ new “bleeding” burger to Vivera’s groundbreaking steak, there has never been a better time to switch to plant-based meat, which is vastly better for the animals, our health, and the planet. For those who want to eat meat that actually came from animals, meat grown directly from cells, called “clean meat”, is coming soon; like plant-based meat, it will vastly ameliorate the harms spelled out by Mr Monbiot. Bruce FriedrichExecutive director, The Good Food Institute, Washington DC
• I have always been intrigued/confused by the concept that vegetarians and/or vegans would want food to look like the very thing they profess to abhor (Sainsbury’s to sell vegan ‘fake meats’ next to real thing in 400-store trial, 11 June). Why would a vegetarian desire a pseudo-sausage or make-believe burger?Dave CollinsKidderminster, Worcestershire
• While the discovery of meat traces in vegan and vegetarian ready meals (‘Meat found’ in vegan food, 9 June) will have come as a shock to many – including, I suspect, those producing these foods – the reality is that we live in a world where animals are routinely killed by the billions for their body parts, and worrying about trace amounts of animal-derived foods in vegan products won’t help them. It’s no different from eating a veggie burger at a restaurant that also serves meat or off the grill at a friend’s barbecue – there’s always a chance of cross-contamination. What we have to remember is that the packets of bacon and beef sold by supermarkets are composed 100% of dead body parts – so those are the products we should avoid if we want to help animals.
Eating vegan isn’t about “perfection” or a quest for personal purity – it’s about achieving real change for animals suffering in the food industry. Choosing a vegan burger over a meat-based one is a win for them, the Earth and one’s arteries, and Peta offers a free vegan starter kit for anyone wanting to make the shift towards a more compassionate way of living.Jennifer WhitePeople for the Ethical Treatment of Animals

A report led by scientists in the UK and US found the rate of melting from the Antarctic ice sheet has accelerated threefold in the last five years and is now vanishing faster than at any previously recorded time.
A separate study warns that unless urgent action is taken in the next decade the melting ice could contribute more than 25cm to a total global sea level rise of more than a metre by 2070. This could lead eventually to the collapse of the entire west Antarctic ice sheet, and around 3.5m of sea-level rise.
Prof Andrew Shepherd, from Leeds University and a lead author of the study on accelerating ice loss, said: “We have long suspected that changes in Earth’s climate will affect the polar ice sheets. Thanks to our satellites our space agencies have launched, we can now track their ice losses and global sea level contribution with confidence.”
He said the rate of melting was “surprising.”
“This has to be a cause for concern for the governments we trust to protect our coastal cities and communities,” Shepherd added.
The study, published in Nature, involved 84 scientists from 44 international organisations and claims to be the most comprehensive account of the Antarctic ice sheet to date. It shows that before 2012, the Antarctic lost ice at a steady rate of 76bn tonnes per year - a 0.2mm per year contribution to sea-level rise. However since then there has been a sharp increase, resulting in the loss of 219bn tonnes of ice per year - a 0.6mm per year sea-level contribution.
The second study, also published in Nature, warns that time is running out to save the Antarctic and its unique ecosystem - with potentially dire consequences for the world.
The scientists assessed the probable state of Antarctica in 2070 under two scenarios. The first in which urgent action on greenhouse gas emissions and environmental protection is taken in the next few years, the second if emissions continue to rise unabated and the Antarctic is exploited for its natural resources.
The scenario which plays out largely depends on choices made over the next decade, on both climate-change and on environmental regulation, they conclude.
Co-author Profe Martin Siegert, from the Grantham Institute, said: “Some of the changes Antarctica will face are already irreversible, such as the loss of some ice shelves, but there is a lot we can prevent or reverse.
“To avoid the worst impacts, we will need strong international cooperation and effective regulation backed by rigorous science. This will rely on governments recognising that Antarctica is intimately coupled to the rest of the Earth system, and damage there will cause problems everywhere.”
As well as being a major cause of sea-level rise, scientists say the oceans around Antarctica are a key “carbon sink” - absorbing huge amounts of greenhouse gases helping to mitigate the impacts of climate change.
Siegert said: “If the political landscape of a future Antarctica is more concerned with rivalry, and how each country can get the most out of the continent and its oceans, then all protections could be overturned.
“However, if we recognise the importance of Antarctica in the global environment, then there is the potential for international co-operation that uses evidence to enact changes that avoid ‘tipping points’ – boundaries that once crossed, would cause runaway change, such as the collapse of the west Antarctic ice sheet.”
Greenpeace which is campaigning for a large tract of the ocean surrounding the Antarctic to be made into the world’s biggest ocean sanctuary, said government’s must heed the warning.
Louisa Casson, of Greenpeace UK’s Protect the Antarctic campaign, said: “Governments can take a historic step forward in October this year if they decide to create an Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary, protecting 1.8 million square kilometres in what would be the largest protected area on Earth.
“Ocean sanctuaries create havens for marine life to build resilience to a changing ocean, but also crucially help us avoid the worst effects of climate change, by preserving healthy ocean ecosystems that play a vital role storing carbon.”

Energy ministers agreed a binding renewable energy target of 32% by 2030, up from the previous goal of 27%, but fell short of the hopes of some countries and green groups for a more ambitious share.
The EU council deal caps 18 months of negotiations. It was welcomed by the renewables industry and the trade body for European energy utilities called it: “a well-balanced compromise”.
The talks saw the UK call for a target of 30%, below the 32% a newly pro-renewables France wanted and the 35% that new governments in Spain and Italy argued for. 
Miguel Arias Cañete, EU climate commissioner, said: “This new ambition will help us meet our Paris agreement goals and will translate into more jobs, lower energy bills for consumers and less energy imports.”
He added that the binding nature of the goal would provide certainty to investors.
Whether the target will apply to the UK after it leaves the EU will depend on the exit deal reached by London and Brussels.
The agreement also includes plans for a 2023 review on whether the target should be bumped even higher.
Around 17% of EU energy consumption in 2016 was from renewables, with the UK on about 9%. 
Green energy advocates argued the existing 2030 target was unambitious because member states were already on track to exceed it.
Environmental groups said the increase did not go far enough and were critical of a decision to keep counting biomass as renewable energy.
Molly Walsh, renewable energy campaigner for Friends of the Earth Europe, said: “EU decision-makers have agreed a paltry 32% target for renewable energy that is inadequate for a climate-safe fossil-free future, and shows a failure to grasp a shifting energy landscape, including rapidly falling renewables costs.”
However, the group welcomed the deal’s recognition of rights for consumers to produce and sell their own renewable energy, such as from solar panels on rooftops. 
The agreement now needs to be formally approved by the EU parliament and council in coming months.

Members of the Energy Security Board – the architects of the Neg – met on Thursday to sign off on a new technical document that will be distributed to stakeholders after Friday’s phone hook-up with ministers.
Guardian Australia understands the new paper will trigger a final phase of deliberations before the settled policy framework will be shared with Frydenberg and the state ministers on 2 August, ahead of the critical meeting of the energy council on 10 August.
The 10 August meeting will either make or break the national energy guarantee, with any state or territory having the power to veto the policy.
Ahead of the push to the finish line, Environment Victoria has warned that the proposed emissions reduction target for electricity under the guarantee “is woefully inadequate”.
The group says if electricity emissions are reduced by only 26-28% below 2005 levels, other sectors of the Australian economy such as manufacturing, transport and agriculture will have to reduce carbon pollution by 700m tonnes to ensure Australia meets its Paris target.
Emissions in these sectors are currently rising and the Turnbull government has produced no policy roadmap to drive emissions reductions in these sectors.
A new briefing paper from Environment Victoria warns that if emissions reductions in the electricity sector are back end loaded to the second half of the decade between 2020 and 2030 – an option favoured by some government conservatives – “then more disruptive action will be required later to meet Australia’s cumulative national target”.
“In this scenario, between 2021 and 2030, manufacturing, transport and others would need to find emissions reductions equivalent to nearly five years of the electricity sector’s current pollution levels”.
The paper also calls for the notice period for adjusting the emissions reduction target in the national energy guarantee to be changed from five years, which is the Energy Security Board’s current guidance, to three.
It notes that if the ALP wins the next federal election and implements its proposed emissions reduction target of 45% after five years have elapsed, then emissions reductions in the sector would have to occur at a rate of 15% a year.
“This would be historically unusual, disruptive to the economy and could threaten the ability of the government to achieve its Paris commitments. However, with three years notice, the rate of reductions required would be halved and are within the range of reductions achieved by a number of countries in their electricity sectors in recent years,” it says.
The National Security Board has seconded a range of experts, bureaucrats and industry players to help draft the policy in a very tight time frame, with working groups considering a range of issues in detail over the past month.
The Turnbull government’s policy would impose reliability and emissions reduction obligations on energy retailers and some large energy users by 2020.
Guardian Australia understands there has been tension behind the scenes about large energy users and their role in the new policy, including who is caught by the reliability obligations and whether the system should be opt-in rather than mandatory.
There have also been arguments about how transparent an emissions registry created under the scheme should be. Some stakeholders want the registry open to the public, and others only want to report their compliance to the regulator.
As well as differences of views over technical details, political pressures loom.
A number of state energy ministers want the emissions reduction target for electricity to be more ambitious – a demand Frydenberg is not in a position to deliver given a more ambitious target would have to be signed off by the Coalition party room.
The Labor states also want the policy to allow a future government to be able to ramp up the level of ambition for emissions reduction without facing significant parliamentary hurdles – again, a demand that is difficult for Frydenberg to deliver given a noisy pocket of opposition in the Coalition party room.
The policy faces two hurdles – the first at the August Coag energy council meeting, and the second in the Coalition party room in the event Frydenberg emerges with a sign-off from state counterparts.

Despite endless scathing reports of waste and mismanagement, despite having completely botched the integration of customs and immigration and the formation of Border Force, despite half their staff quitting, Malcolm Turnbull decided to give Dutton and Pezzullo even more responsibility and more organisations to oversee. On 18 July 2017, while this audit was in progress, the Prime Minister announced that the government had decided to establish a Home Affairs portfolio. From 20 December 2017, the Department of Home Affairs has assumed all of the department’s functions (including the ABF) in addition to functions from each of the Departments of Prime Minister and Cabinet; Social Services; Infrastructure and Regional Development and the Attorney-General’s department.  In addition to the ABF, the Home Affairs portfolio also includes the following entities: the Australian Federal Police; the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission; the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre; and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. It seems, regardless of how many negative evaluations Dutton’s department receives, he and Pezzullo are untouchable. The only conceivable reason to reward such incompetence, and to promote such incompetents, is to placate a political rival.

On the agenda: screwing Labor on tax and bolstering the Liberals’ default superiority over national security. The giveaway that electioneering is top of mind is the urgency claimed for bills dealing with foreign interference, espionage and sabotage. Absent from the list is the long overdue bill to ban foreign political donations. Labor voluntarily gave up on that cash cow 18 months ago. The Liberals continue to have their hands out to all comers. And that includes Chinese donors – if they are still of a mind to curry favour with the governing party. Why would the Libs want to lose out on this money, estimated to be at least $3 million, when they know they are actively considering a dash to a general election? A clue to the Liberals’ mindset is the fact they voted against a Labor bill to ban foreign donations back in 2009. Their elder statesman, John Howard, is on the record defending the practice as long as there is disclosure. This view is not shared in the United States or most other modern democracies. And not surprisingly. If curbing foreign interference is your most pressing concern, then excluding these donations should surely be top of the list. They are the most direct form of foreign interference to be had.

Better still - turf the fifth columnists out altogether.
The average person is unaware that the Conservatives have been infiltrating and branch stacking ever since bloody Howard became prime minister.
Good Liberal Party mates of mine - of decades long standing - have quit their branches and membership because of the ongoing infiltration by Conservatives. Hounded out.
Go and check out the Mitchell electorate in the uber well off, middle class, leafy green suburbs now home to Hillsong - the whole bloody Baulkham Hills district is now home to masses of wealthy happy clappers.
In my experience, and observation? ""Unchristian Christians"" who are more Calvanists [views the pursuit of wealth as not only acceptable but as a religious calling or duty] than Christians - while ""Social Justice for ALL"" is an absolute heresy to them.
Happy Clappers - all bloody Conservatives - infiltrating the Liberal Party in great numbers.
But they haven't the guts, nor the moral fortitude to stand up for their beliefs alongside Cory Bernardi, join his Conservative Party and campaign under their own true banner. Easier to gain power by stealth - ask Peter Dutton and friends.
The Liberal Party of Australia is doomed if they don't take a decisive stand against the infiltrators - you don't ever compromise on principles - only on issues.

“Baseload” is the amount to power you need every hour of the day, even in the low demand troughs. It’s a term that was relevant to last century power generation, because you cannot turn a big coal station or a nuclear station up and down to match the peaks and troughs. The just run to produce power to match the troughs 24/7 and then you have disparchable power to top it up to the peaks on demand from stations that you can turn on and off over short cycles like gas and hydro. To smooth things out to make it work at all you virtually have to give electricity away at night, sometimes even having a negative price: ie paying people to take electricity at that time. 
Its a concept designed around the capabilities of the technology at the time that is out of date. 
Solar produces power when most of your demand happens - during the day. That’s a better fit to demand than the old baseload technologies.

Frydenberg, the federal energy minister, was clear during a phone hook-up on Friday that Canberra wanted least-cost abatement in the electricity sector, and that meant implementing a linear emissions reduction trajectory between 2020 and 2030, according to sources familiar with the conversation.

Guardian Australia understands that the Australian Capital Territory’s energy minister, Shane Rattenbury, raised concerns during the call about the low ambition of the Neg target, which is a 26% reduction on 2005 levels by 2030, and Frydenberg was pressed to be explicit about the proposed trajectory of emissions reduction – although the tone of the call was said to be constructive overall.
After the hook-up Rattenbury, who is a Greens member, continued to express concerns the Labor states have raised over many months about the “woefully inadequate emissions reduction target” in the scheme.
“I am concerned that this process will be jeopardised by the Coalition’s refusal to negotiate on issues that are critical to achieving energy reforms in the interests of all Australians,” he said late on Friday.
He said he was yet to see evidence that the national energy guarantee would reduce power costs. “It’s more likely that this is a smoke-and-mirrors cost-shift from electricity to other sectors, such as transport and agriculture, that will likely see Australians paying more overall.”
“This intransigence on part of the commonwealth suggests the Coalition doesn’t even want an outcome on electricity reform, and would rather discard some of the good proposals the Energy Security Board has put forward on national energy laws.”
Friday’s phone hook-up was convened to allow ministers to be briefed on the final design principles of the Neg by the architects of the scheme, the Energy Security Board (ESB), before a critical meeting of the energy council of Coag in August.
The 10 August meeting will either make or break the Neg. Any single state or territory has the power to veto the policy. The Neg would impose reliability and emissions reduction obligations on energy retailers and some large energy users by 2020.
The ESB has now circulated updated advice about technical elements of the scheme, and Frydenberg has also circulated an updated discussion paper setting out how the emissions reduction obligation will work.
The text of the emissions paper, seen by Guardian Australia, doesn’t specify whether the emissions reduction trajectory will be linear or the “hockey stick” proposal being championed by the head of the Coalition’s backbench committee on environment and energy, Craig Kelly.
The “hockey stick” trajectory means emissions reduction would be largely deferred to the second half of the decade between 2020 and 2030.
Frydenberg will need to take legislation giving effect to the electricity target through the Coalition party room for approval in the event the states agree to the guarantee in August, and Kelly signalled he could cross the floor if Frydenberg implemented a linear emissions reduction trajectory in a recent podcast interview with Guardian Australia.
The commonwealth’s paper also keeps open the idea that participants in the energy market would be able to purchase offsets, like carbon credits, to help them meet their emissions reduction requirements under the scheme, but the government is now floating a cap.
The paper says capping the amount of offsets that can be used under the scheme “could preserve the investment signal provided by the guarantee, as the market would have certainty about the minimum level of emissions reduction the electricity sector would contribute to meeting the annual electricity emissions targets”.
The new paper also restates a commitment to exempting emission-intensive trade-exposed customers entirely from the obligation to reduce emissions.
A separate paper from the ESB has signalled that the first 50,000MWh of any market customer’s load will be exempt from the emissions reduction requirement “as an additional measure to support retail market competition”.
The exemption means that small players in the energy market will be exempt from the emissions reduction obligation for some or all of their load. “This measure will help smaller market customers meet the emissions reduction requirement, while not having a material impact on overall coverage.”
The ESB recognises that the exemption might encourage participants in the national electricity market to split into smaller entities “to gain the benefit of this exemption and avoid responsibility for meeting the electricity emissions target” – and it flags a new anti-avoidance regime to address the risks. 
Bruce Mountain, head of the Victorian Energy Policy Centre, said the policy was emerging as more Frankenstein’s monster than a light hand.
“The growing predominance of low-emission sources in Australia’s electricity production brings challenges that need to be dealt with, but the ESB’s approach is without precedent; there are much simpler ways to deal with these challenges using the existing mechanisms,” Mountain said.
“Complexity has a cost, and customers are forced to bear it. The complex approach the ESB is proposing is unnecessary and easily avoidable.”
Guardian Australia foreshadowed earlier on Friday there have been tensions behind the scenes in working groups collaborating with the ESB about the treatment of large energy users in the scheme.
The chief executive of the AiGroup, Innes Willox, said after Friday’s phone hook-up there were issues to be ironed out. “One issue that will be important to resolve is whether an opt-out from the reliability obligation for large energy users, as currently proposed, should be replaced with an opt-in arrangement.”
“Either way the outcome needs to support a competitive market for electricity where the long-term interests of energy users are met.”
Despite the concerns, Willox said the Neg remained the best hope of settling Australia’s decade-long climate and energy wars. “We will do our part to get an outcome in August that delivers what we need on price, reliability and emissions.”
“Industry, electricity suppliers, and the wider community all have a stake in the success of the national energy guarantee and in ending a decade of policy uncertainty.”

Progressive thinktank the Centre for Policy Development says that while most companies have committed to considering what climate change and the Paris climate agreement means for their business strategy, too few have begun using scenario analysis techniques to model what its impacts could be and how to respond to it.
Australia’s financial regulator stepped up its warnings last year that climate change posed a risk to the financial system and urged companies to adapt.
The Financial Stability Board’s Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures has identified scenario analysis as a critical tool for companies and investors that are serious about responding to climate risks.
CPD policy director Sam Hurley said while many companies had said they will commit to modelling the impacts of climate change and potential responses for their business, few had actually started to undertake that work.
He said Australia was potentially exposed to large risks due to climate change, but there were also opportunities.
“Scenario analysis is going to be a really important driver of better strategies and of better outcomes for businesses that are preparing for these risks and opportunities,” he said.
“Some organisations in Australia have made a start doing that kind of analysis and more have committed to it.
“But what we’re going to need to see is more consistent, ambitious scenario analysis so that markets and investors have more accurate information when assessing how well companies are placed for transition to a zero-carbon economy.”
Hurley said, internationally, more organisations had begun considering how major emissions reductions and changes in policy as a result of climate change could affect their business and its profitability. 
He said some of Australia’s biggest companies in the financial and resources sector already had sophisticated models in place for thinking about climate change and more needed to follow suit.
Companies that didn’t could expect scrutiny from their shareholders, as well as regulators. 
“The period for words on this is over. What we really need to see over the next reporting season is companies walking the walk as well as talking the talk,” he said.
“Expectations around proper management of this issue are increasing and for companies that aren’t doing it, it’s going to be harder and harder to get away with it.” 
… we can’t turn away from climate change. The Guardian’s environmental coverage reports the scientific facts, social consequences and political choices that are shaping the fate of our planet.

Mazter - However, since nuclear power is more expensive than RE,
BQEND
I see you're still sticking with cost as your key anti-nuclear argument.
EDF Energy's CEO has started making noises about Sizewell C - he wants a Regulated Asset Base model for the funding.
As it happens, this was one of the financing models the National Audit Office looked at in their report on Hinkley Point C (page 66).They calculated that a Regulated Asset Base model for Hinkley Point C, with no construction risk borne by the consumer, resulted in a CfD strike price of £63.50/MWh—£67.50/MWh.If EDF achieve their claimed 20% cost reduction for Sizewell C (and assuming £14/MWh for fuel and operations costs) that gives you a strike price of £53.60/MWh—£56.80/MWh for Sizewell C.
Over the last week, the UK auction price for wholesale electricity has been in the range £47.12/MWh—£55.87/MWh.
The anti-nuclear lobby, in its eternal quest for a rational-sounding anti-nuclear argument, went for the cost argument.The snag was, the cost argument was based on one peculiarly expensive project - HPC.

Well, actually yes: the Climate Change Act, Paris agreement, Carbon Floor Price (has nearly killed coal), Hinckley, Offshore wind. CfD auctions. All of those are effective.

but only the global Green Parties accept the implications.
BQEND
Except even they don't really, because they keep telling us that we have to fix the problem without using one of the most effective low-carbon technologies: nuclear. That is not 'accepting the implications', it's just a different sort of motivated reasoning from the people who don't even accept the problem.
There's no point having the argument all over again here, but Green parties (as opposed to actual individual greens) are just as unscientific on this matter as other (usually conservative) parties which claim that wind-power doesn't work.
We need _everything_ that works: dramatic reductions, social change, renewables, nuclear, and 'new stuff'. Even that is going to be very late at current rates of change, but trying to not use any of them just makes the response slower and less effective. It's a great pity that there is no party in the UK supporting this, and the two parties with the least-bad (i.e. lowest carbon) policies (Libdems and Greens) have negligible chance of forming a government.

The question is, how fast will it happen?
BQEND
It's a process controlled by us. At the moment, atmospheric carbon is accumulating at a faster rate than at the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). At the end of the Paleocene, atmospheric carbon was about three times higher than it is now (with amazing effects on the planet). There was literally no permanent ice on hothouse Earth. Imagine an Arctic with temperate swamps and temperate animals of all kinds. Since we're accumulating carbon faster than the PETM, the onset of hothouse Earth should also be faster than at the PETM.

True dat, but that was part of the dilemma that the Deconto and Pollard (and other) work on Marine Ice Sheet Instability and Marine Ice Cliff Instability was meant to reconcile.

If we burn all the fossil fuels we've already located, we'd create enough CO2 to ensure that eventually Antarctica would be ice-free.
There's a scientific paper on that - ""Combustion of available fossil fuel resources sufficient to eliminate the Antarctic Ice Sheet"" - Winkelmann et al 2015.
Explaining this in more detail might help.
Very high CO2 levels were produced around 56 million years ago, in an event called the PETM, when lots of sequestered carbon became released - there are a number of processes being suggested for that.
After that, CO2 levels very slowly reduced over tens of millions of years.
CO2 in rain makes a weak acid, which causes chemical weathering of rocks.
In the case of those tens of millions of years, the weathering was particularly happening to the rocks of the rising Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau.
Rivers carry the carbon compounds down to the oceans, where various processes (such as the formation of calcareous shells by organisms) eventually deposit the material on the ocean floor.
This is the long, slow, part of the carbon cycle:
""Surface uplift of Tibet and Cenozoic global cooling"" - Garzione 2008
It took around 20 million years for CO2 levels to fall sufficiently for glaciation to begin in Antarctica, at the Eocene-Oligocene transition.
Antarctic glacial inception began at around 750 ppm of CO2, and spread more widely as the CO2 level continued to fall.
So - eventually - if CO2 rises back to those levels (around 800 ppm) allowing for the fact that it takes a lot of (latent) heat to melt ice at zero C to water at zero C - this would create conditions where Antarctica would eventually become ice-free again.
It would not be quick, but reversing the process would be basically impossible - it would add 3 metres to sea level per century during the first millennium alone.', u'recommendation_count': u'27', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1529337028000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'which', u'effect': u'chemical weathering of rocks'}], u'author_id': u'2923581', u'id': u'117142276', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'samiamnotaus', u'text': u'As Professor Kevin Anderson points out, those that think nuclear power is a solution, don't understand the problem.

...These feedbacks make ice sheets in contact with the ocean vulnerable to accelerating disintegration. We hypothesize that ice mass loss from the most vulnerable ice, sufficient to raise sea level several meters, is better approximated as exponential than by a more linear response.

It is also other infrastructure projects that must be started now. Many hate it when suage flows backwards for example. So it is time to allocate money for that. And that is also what we should start to do with coastal rails and roads.

In the first half of the 20th Century, average global sea level rose by about 1.4 millimeters per year (mm/yr). Since 1993, that rate has more than doubled to 3.2 mm/yr. And since 2012, it’s jumped to 4.5 mm/yr.
Thermal expansion (ocean water expanding as it warms) continues to play the biggest role in sea level rise, but its contribution of about 1.3 mm/yr is now responsible for a smaller proportion of total sea level rise (30% in recent years) than its contribution since the 1990s (40% of the total). That’s because of the acceleration in melting ice.
Glacier melt is accelerating, recently contributing about 0.75 mm/yr to sea level rise, up from 0.65 mm/yr since the 1990s. But the biggest jumps have come from ice in Greenland and Antarctica. Greenland had been responsible for about 0.48 mm/yr sea level rise since 1990, but in recent years is up to 0.78 mm/yr. A recent study in Nature Climate Change found that Greenland contributed about 5% to sea level rise in 1993 and 25% in 2014. 
A new study published in Nature using data from a range of satellites found that Antarctica’s contribution has tripled from about 0.2 mm/yr since the 1990s to 0.6 mm/yr since 2012, during which time global sea level rise also spiked. Accelerated ice melt from Antarctica, Greenland, and glaciers have all played a role in the faster recent sea level rise. The question is whether it’s a temporary jump, or if we need to worry about a continued acceleration in Antarctic ice loss.
Another recent paper published in Earth’s Future found that rapid losses from Antarctic ice are plausible. The study found that in moderate to high carbon-emission scenarios, an average expected sea level rise of 2 to 2.5 feet by 2100 could actually become 3 to 5 feet once Antarctic ice sheet dynamics are taken into account.
The vast majority of Antarctica’s current ice loss is coming from West Antarctica, where about 75% of the glaciers are located below sea level. In East Antarctica, which has so far remained stable, only about 35% of the glaciers are below sea level. Warming ocean waters are melting the Antarctic ice from below, which is particularly problematic for that low-lying ice in West Antarctica. Research suggests that the collapse of the Western Antarctic ice sheet is already unstoppable.
Short-term variations in sea level rise do happen. Sea level actually briefly fell in 2010 due to a strong La Niña cycle, which typically results in an increase of rain and snow falling over land. This resulted in a number of epic deluges and flooding across the globe; more water on land temporarily meant less in the ocean.
However, Antarctica and Greenland could potentially cause rapid sea level rise. As James Hansen explains in the video below, there have been periods in the not-so-distant past when sea levels rose at an average rate of 1 meter every 20 years.
In past eras when temperatures and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were similar to those today and to the Paris climate targets, like in the last interglaciation and the Pliocene, sea levels were about 20 to 80 feet higher. Unless we manage to actually cool global temperatures, we’re certainly due for significantly more sea level rise. The large ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica will continue to melt for as long as 1,000 years. That’s why sea levels were so much higher in past eras whose climates remained at hot temperatures like today’s for thousands of years. 
It takes time for ice to melt. The question is, how fast will it happen? Sea level rise unquestionably poses a long-term threat, but how much of a short-term threat largely depends on just how stable the Antarctic ice sheet turns out to be. The recent acceleration of Antarctic ice loss, while not yet definitive, is certainly cause for concern.
16. Greenland is melting faster right now because it is being subjected to rapid Arctic warming. But everybody knows that Antarctica has vastly more *potential* to lose ice than Greenland does.
… we can’t turn away from climate change. The Guardian’s environmental coverage reports the scientific facts, social consequences and political choices that are shaping the fate of our planet. As the world's leaders turn their backs on the environment, we are at a crisis point. Individual consumer choices are important, but we need collective action to achieve the systemic change that will really make a difference. Our pioneering and our fearless reporting on the environment can play a vital role in that. But we need our readers’ support.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account.

While Donald Trump and many conservatives like to argue that climate change is a hoax, James Hansen, the 77-year-old former Nasa climate scientist, said in an interview at his home in New York that the relevant hoax today is perpetrated by those leaders claiming to be addressing the problem.
 Hansen provided what’s considered the first warning to a mass audience about global warming when, in 1988, he told a US congressional hearing he could declare “with 99% confidence” that a recent sharp rise in temperatures was a result of human activity.
Since this time, the world’s greenhouse gas emissions have mushroomed despite repeated, increasingly frantic warnings about civilization-shaking catastrophe, from scientists amassing reams of evidence in Hansen’s wake.
“All we’ve done is agree there’s a problem,” Hansen told the Guardian. “We agreed that in 1992 [at the Earth summit in Rio] and re-agreed it again in Paris [at the 2015 climate accord]. We haven’t acknowledged what is required to solve it. Promises like Paris don’t mean much, it’s wishful thinking. It’s a hoax that governments have played on us since the 1990s.”
Hansen’s long list of culprits for this inertia are both familiar – the nefarious lobbying of the fossil fuel industry – and surprising. Jerry Brown, the progressive governor of California, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, are “both pretending to be solving the problem” while being unambitious and shunning low-carbon nuclear power, Hansen argues. 
There is particular scorn for Barack Obama. Hansen says in a scathing upcoming book that the former president “failed miserably” on climate change and oversaw policies that were “late, ineffectual and partisan”.
Hansen even accuses Obama of passing up the opportunity to thwart Donald Trump’s destruction of US climate action, by declining to settle a lawsuit the scientist, his granddaughter and 20 other young people are waging against the government, accusing it of unconstitutionally causing peril to their living environment.
“Near the end of his administration the US said it would reduce emissions 80% by 2050,” Hansen said.
“Our lawsuit demands a reduction of 6% a year so I thought, ‘That’s close enough, let’s settle the lawsuit.’ We got through to Obama’s office but he decided against it. It was a tremendous opportunity. This was after Trump’s election, so if we’d settled it quickly the US legally wouldn’t be able to do the absurd things Trump is doing now by opening up all sorts of fossil fuel sources.”
Hansen’s frustrations temper any satisfaction at largely being vindicated for his testimony, delivered to lawmakers on 23 June 1988. 
Wearing a cream-coloured suit, the soft-spoken son of Iowan tenant farmers hunched over the microphone in Washington to explain that humans had entered a confronting new era. “The greenhouse effect has been detected and it is changing our climate now,” he said. 
Afterwards, Hansen told reporters: “It is time to stop waffling so much and say that the evidence is pretty strong that the greenhouse effect is here.” He brandished new research that forecast that 1988 was set to be the warmest year on record, as well as projections for future heat under three different emissions scenarios. The world has dutifully followed Hansen’s “scenario B” – we are “smack on it” it, Hansen said last week – with global temperatures jumping by around 1C (1.8F) over the past century.
These findings hadn’t occurred in a vacuum, of course – the Irish physicist John Tyndall confirmed that carbon dioxide is a heat-trapping gas in the 1850s. A 1985 scientific conference in Villach, Austria, concluded the temperature rise in the 21st century would be “greater than in any man’s history”. The changes in motion would “affect life on Earth for centuries to come”, the New York Times warned the morning after Hansen’s testimony.
Three decades of diplomacy has blossomed into an international consensus, albeit rattled by Trump, that the temperature rise must be curbed to “well below” 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times. But in this time emissions have soared (in 1988, 20bn tons of carbon dioxide was emitted – by 2017 it was 32bn tons) with promised cuts insufficient for the 2C goal. Despite the notable growth of renewable energy such as solar and wind, Hansen believes there is no pathway to salvation without a tax on carbon-producing fuels.
“The solution isn’t complicated, it’s not rocket science,” Hansen said. “Emissions aren’t going to go down if the cost of fossil fuels isn’t honest. Economists are very clear on this. We need a steadily increasing fee that is then distributed to the public.”
Hansen faced opposition even before his testimony – he recalls a Nasa colleague telling him on the morning of his presentation “no respectable scientist” would claim the world is warming – and faced subsequent meddling and censorship from George HW Bush’s administration. 
He eventually retired from Nasa in 2013 and promptly reinvented himself as an activist who was arrested, wearing his trademark hat, outside the White House while protesting against the Keystone oil pipeline.
The dawdling global response to warming temperatures means runaway climate change now looms. The aspirational 1.5C (2.7F) warming target set in Paris could be surpassed by 2040. Huge amounts of ice from western Antarctica are crashing into the ocean, redrawing forecasts for sea level rise. Some low-lying islands fear extinction. 
“It’s not too late,” Hansen stressed. “There is a rate of reduction that’s feasible to stay well below 2C. But you just need that price on carbon.” 
John Holdren, who was Obama’s chief science adviser, told the Guardian that the Paris agreement achieved what was possible without support from Congress and that legally binding lawsuits would be “problematic”.
However, he added that while he had reservations about Hansen’s policy ideas he was one of the “true giants” of climate science.
“Poor Jim Hansen. He’s a tragic hero,” said Naomi Oreskes, a Harvard academic who studies the history of science. “The Cassandra aspect of his life is that he’s cursed to understand and diagnose what’s going on but unable to persuade people to do something about it. We are all raised to believe knowledge is power but Hansen proves the untruth of that slogan. Power is power.”
That power has been most aggressively wielded by fossil fuel companies such as Exxon and Shell which, despite being well aware of the dangers of climate change decades before Hansen’s touchstone moment in 1988, funded a network of groups that ridiculed the science and funded sympathetic politicians. Later, they were to be joined by the bulk of the US Republican party, which now recoils from any action on climate change as heresy.
“Obama was committed to action but couldn’t do much with the Congress he had,” Oreskes said. “To blame the Democrats and Obama is to misunderstand the political context. There was a huge, organized network that put forward a message of confusion and doubt.”
Climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer, who testified at the same 1988 hearing about sea level rise, said the struggle to confront climate change has been “discouraging”.
“The nasty anti-science movement ramped up and now we are way behind.”
“I’m convinced we will deal with the problem,” he said. “[But] not before there is an amount of suffering that is unconscionable and should’ve been avoided.”

Opponents of the government’s energy policy used the opportunity of the regular Coalition party room to resume their attacks on the policy that goes to a critical meeting of state and territory energy ministers in early August.
With these two parliamentary sitting weeks the last remaining window for internal opponents to try and blow the policy off course, Abbott raised objections, as did Eric Abetz, Andrew Gee, Ian MacDonald and the voluble Liberal Craig Kelly.

Kelly, who is the chair of the government’s backbench committee, continued to insist that emissions reduction in the electricity sector should be delayed, and that large energy users shouldn’t be part of the putative system.
According to people present, Abetz, the Tasmanian Liberal, attempted to argue during Tuesday’s meeting that Abbott hadn’t given hard commitments when he took the decision to sign the government up to the Paris agreement – that Australia’s undertakings were always aspirational.
Abbott then told colleagues he’d been misled by bureaucrats during the Paris commitment process about the impact of the commitment.
At the time he took the decision Abbott said something quite different. In announcing Australia would adopt an emissions reduction target for 2030 of 26% to 28% on 2005 levels, Abbott said: “There’s a definite commitment to 26% but we believe under the policies that we’ve got, with the circumstances that we think will apply, that we can go up to 28%.”
Materials circulated to the Coalition party room at the time also made it clear that Australia would need to reduce its projected emissions by around 900m tonnes in order to hit the 26% to 28% target.
The government said at the time an emissions budget approach should be used “that is, achievement of our target should be measured in terms of emissions over the period 2021-30 and not simply at our emissions at a point in time in 2030”.
Abbott, the former prime minister, also argued on Tuesday that the owners of the Tomago aluminium smelter were opposed to the Neg, which imposes reliability and emissions reduction obligations on power retailers and some large energy users from 2020.
The energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, begged to differ, noting they were supportive of the policy, as were several other big corporates. 
During the discussion, the Queensland National Scott Buchholz raised concerns about high energy prices. The New South Wales Liberal Trent Zimmerman rose to support the policy.
Tuesday’s skirmish in Canberra followed a phone hook-up of state and territory energy ministers last Friday. During that conversation, Frydenberg told his Coag counterparts the emissions reduction trajectory in the national energy guarantee would be steady over 10 years, not back-end loaded as some of his conservative party room opponents have demanded.
The policy moves into its decisive phase of consideration over the coming weeks, with Frydenberg determined to stare down internal opponents and get wavering Labor states over the line.
The 10 August meeting will either make or break the Neg. Any single state or territory has the power to veto the policy, and a number are concerned about the lack of ambition in the emission reduction target.
Federal Labor is declining to offer Frydenberg much political cover.
The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, on Tuesday pointed to persistent government in-fighting on the issue. Shorten noted an “insurgency from the right” and he said the Neg had “fairly lame targets”.
The Turnbull government will not be able to land the policy in the federal arena without Labor’s support, and the opposition is yet to say what it will do.
For months the shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, has pointed to the lack of ambition in the Neg emissions reduction target as being a significant problem, and he has argued Labor would need to scale it up significantly in the event it ultimately accepted the mechanism.

A partnership of four committees said serious concerns remained about the UK’s commitment to cutting pollution and its impact on public health. 
The Commons environment, food and rural affairs, environmental audit, health and social care, and transport committees had made a series of recommendations to the government in the joint report in March. They included bringing forward a planned ban on the sale of new conventional diesel and petrol cars from 2040.
In its response, published on Wednesday, the government maintained that the existing date would put the UK at the forefront of the global transition to cleaner road transport. 
It said its overall strategy to cut air pollution would “help us achieve our goals of cleaner air, a better environment, zero-emission vehicles and a strong, clean economy”.
MPs remain concerned about efforts to improve air quality. Mary Creagh, the chair of the environmental audit committee, said: “We need cities where people can move and can breathe, so it is worrying that the government is dragging its feet on air quality, even in the face of legal action by the European court of justice. 
“It is also concerning that the government is not ready to demonstrate global leadership by forcing manufacturers to produce only clean vehicles before 2040.” 
Lilian Greenwood, the chair of the transport select committee, said: “Our report called on the government to take action to reduce our reliance on cars and increase the use of public transport. We are disappointed, therefore, that the response does not include any substantial public transport or urban planning initiatives.”
The government has previously been criticised for a lack of urgency in tackling the air pollution crisis. Several other countries including India, Norway, Ireland and the Netherlands have set much more ambitious targets for vehicle bans.
The unprecedented joint inquiry was launched amid concerns over the government’s air quality plans, which have repeatedly been successfully challenged in the courts by environmental groups and found to be so inadequate as to be illegal.
The UN’s special rapporteur on pollution said last year that the UK government was “flouting” its duty to protect the health of its citizens, while the problem was declared a public health emergency by a cross-party committee of MPs in 2016.
Air pollution causes an estimated 40,000 premature deaths a year in the UK and is linked to health problems from childhood illnesses to heart disease and dementia.
Concerns over nitrogen dioxide emissions have grown since Volkswagen was found in September 2015 to have cheated air pollution tests with 11m diesel vehicles worldwide. 
A government spokesperson said: “Air quality has improved significantly but there is still much more to do. We have put in place a £3.5bn plan to reduce harmful emissions and will introduce primary legislation to clean up our air. By ending the sale of conventional new diesel and petrol cars and vans by 2040, we are acting faster than almost every other major developed economy.”

I'm not convinced about nuclear power given the resources required to get it working and later decomission.
BQENDDo you have reason to believe that nuclear power uses more resources per MWh of production than the alternatives?
Do you have a source, because it seems very unlikely.

BQSTART
As for energy storage, I'm not sure it is really a non productive externality if it is helping to cover surges in power demand.
BQENDI think you've confused capability with purpose. Energy storage does not produce a single Wh of power. It is literally non productive.
It is simply a dead cost enabling technology for intermittent power and ultimately needs a gas backup..
BQSTART
Also I'm of the opinion that developments in renewables, efficiency, and storage are likely to continue to out pace nuclear for a good few years yet.
BQENDRenewables efficiency - solar pv is near as efficient as it can be, there's not much meat on that bone.
Three are possible new chemistries but at the end of the day it is limited by insolation - the power hitting the solar panel.
The same with wind (and hydro) turbines - the maximum is driven by Betz law - we are already at the limits.
So scientifically speaking there's no industry changing breakthrough on the horizon.
BQSTART
As for GMO, that must not end up trying to be a replacement for biodiversity
BQENDI don't think it could even it we wanted it to - if a new strain of wheat is grown that needs no fertilizer and is resistant to disease then not only do we save the CO₂ and stop polluting our ground water with nitrates, we also stop spraying pesticides killing off our insect populations including bees.
So that's lower emissions, cleaner water and a return to something like pre industrial biodiversity.
BQSTART
Evolution has a way of negating GMO
BQENDI think that's more a spin on a Jurassic Park quote.
BQSTART
One thing you have missed is how inefficient and wasteful the meat industry is.
BQENDIndeed
BQSTART
Of course the critical question must be is whether human beings are doing enough to avoid the worst potential outcomes of global warming, because those would cause some very serious problems.
BQENDExactly!

Like with coal stocks oii can go south very quickly. It is not so much that coal is never used, it still is, but the scale they depend upon to fuel multinational growth ebbs with lack of sales growth. Growth is the key to multinational success. It is a dynamic which fuels the industry, growth.
Coal in the end many of them folded like a stack of cards. Now recovering a bit but just a bit compared to the past. One cannot fight a tide, and renewables are that tide.
 Research will provide the best option. One utility is expanding into solar and that may be a option.But needless to say as I am in the states, I do use gas to get around.

Quite easy it is to point a finger at big oil but really most of the problem is us. That finger is rightly pointed at them, as they have sought to misrepresent climate change for years. But nevertheless we are the ones which must endeavor to make these companies go out of business.
Nevertheless that these companies appear solid and are showing good balance sheets so did coal companies before about 2006 or so. Those companies like Peabody had stood for a hundred plus years. Now reorganized due to bankruptcy. When they started to go they went in investment terms in a flash. Untouchable really they are in any other than a very short term investment.
Once the oil sector drew long term investment with dividend as a source of gain. But they are simply to uncertain to use that as choice presently.

You cannot call my question about energy efficiency a straw man and then accept that energy storage which is part of that requirement in my opinion. Then, all blase, you say ""but those external costs are costs"", well that is true but are they affordable as you so clearly mentioned was important?
BQENDYou didn't ask a question on efficiency, you said:

"" you've conveniently ignored the increased energy efficiency of devices and buildings. Why would that be? ""
At best that's a rhetorical question.
No matter what source we use we still need to be efficient in its use.
BQSTART
Renewables cannot cover the demand, but striving to make that increasingly the case is surely something worth striving for? For that to happen it is not just a supply problem but also a demand problem as well, is it not?
BQENDThe objective isn't to install renewables, the objective is to cut emissions.
BQSTART
as my question perhaps did not make clear, was why did you choose to ignore energy efficiency as part of the mix I mentioned.
BQENDBecause no matter the source, we still need energy efficiency.
That means using all the tools in the box.

No, Germany's new fleet of coal power stations isn't for ""occasional backup"". 40% of Germany's electricity generation is coal.That's why they've missed their 2020 emissions target by a disastrous margin.

Last week’s spate of studies documenting that its melt rates had tripled is precisely the kind of data that underscores the almost impossible urgency of the moment.
And don’t look to Washington DC, where the unlikely survival of the EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt, continues to prove the political power of the fossil fuel industry. It’s as if he’s on a reality show where the premise is to see how much petty corruption one man can get away with.
But from somewhat less likely quarters, there’s been reason this month for hope – reason, at least, to think that the basic trajectory of the world away from coal and gas and oil is firmly under way.
At the Vatican, the pope faced down a conference full of oil industry executives – the basic argument that fossil fuel reserves must be kept underground has apparently percolated to the top of the world’s biggest organization.
And from Wall Street came welcome word that market perceptions haven’t really changed: even in the age of Trump, the fossil fuel industry has gone from the world’s surest bet to an increasingly challenged enterprise. Researchers at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis minced no words: “In the past several years, oil industry financial statements have revealed significant signs of strain: Profits have dropped, cash flow is down, balance sheets are deteriorating and capital spending is falling. The stock market has recognized the sector’s overall weakness, punishing oil and gas shares over the past five years even as the market as a whole has soared.”
The IEEFA report labeled the industry “weaker than it has been in decades” and laid out its basic frailties, the first of which is paradoxical. Fracking has produced a sudden surge of gas and oil into the market, lowering prices – which means many older investments (Canada’s tar sands, for instance) no longer make economic sense. Fossil fuel has been transformed into a pure commodity business, and since the margins on fracking are narrow at best, its financial performance has been woeful. The IEEFA describes investors as “shell-shocked” by poor returns.
And the third problem for the fossil fuel industry? That would be the climate movement
The second weakness is more obvious: the sudden rise of a competitor that seems able to deliver the same product – energy – with cheaper, cleaner, better technologies. Tesla, sure – but Volkswagen, having come clean about the dirtiness of diesel, is going to spend $84bn on electric drivetrains. China seems bent on converting its entire bus fleet to electric power. Every week seems to bring a new record-low price for clean energy: the most recent being a Nevada solar plant clocking in at 2.3 cents per kilowatt hour, even with Trump’s tariffs on Chinese panels.
And the third problem for the fossil fuel industry? According to IEEFA, that would be the climate movement – a material financial risk to oil and gas companies. “In addition to traditional lobbying and direct-action campaigns, climate activists have joined with an increasingly diverse set of allies – particularly the indigenous-rights movement – to put financial pressure on oil and gas companies through divestment campaigns, corporate accountability efforts, and targeting of banks and financial institutions. These campaigns threaten not only to undercut financing for particular projects, but also to raise financing costs for oil and gas companies across the board.”
Hey, the movement against Kinder Morgan’s pipeline got so big, the Canadian government had to literally buy the thing in order to try and ram it through. Protesters will die, a former Bank of Canada governor predicted this week – though he added the country will have to muster the “fortitude” to kill them and get the pipeline built.
For activists, the best part of the IEEFA report is a series of recommendations for precisely how to hurt the industry the most, from creating delays that “turn a marginal project into a cancelled one” to “strategic litigation” to “changing the narrative”.
The report’s authors write: “The financial world is just beginning to understand the fundamental weakness of the fossil fuel sector, and barely acknowledges the global climate movement’s growing power and reach. This has created a powerful opportunity to develop and foster a new storyline on Wall Street: that the oil and gas industry is an unstable financial partner just as it faces its greatest test.”
That’s work we’re capable of. If a few years of campaigning is enough to convince the pope we need to keep fossil fuels in the ground, a few more quarters might finally persuade the suits that there’s more money to be made elsewhere. But speed is clearly of the essence. If massive losses of money loom over Wall Street, massive losses of polar ice loom over us all.
… we can’t turn away from climate change. The Guardian’s environmental coverage reports the scientific facts, social consequences and political choices that are shaping the fate of our planet. As the world's leaders turn their backs on the environment, we are at a crisis point. Individual consumer choices are important, but we need collective action to achieve the systemic change that will really make a difference. Our pioneering and our fearless reporting on the environment can play a vital role in that. But we need our readers’ support.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute. Thank you.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/21/climate-change-fossil-fuel-industry-never-been-weaker

'complex system' has a specific meaning,,, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system you may want to read about it before commenting
BQEND
Did you read that page? A few quotes...
A complex system is usually composed of many components and their interactions. Such a system can be represented by a network where nodes represent the components and links represent their interactions, for example, the INTERNET
 the modern scientific study of complex systems is relatively young in comparison to established fields of science such as physics and chemistry... ...The study of neural networks was {snip} integral in advancing the mathematics needed to study complex systems.
The notion of self-organizing systems is tied with work in nonequilibrium thermodynamics, including that pioneered by chemist and Nobel laureate Ilya Prigogine in his study of dissipative structures. Even older is the work by Hartree-Fock c.s. on the quantum-chemistry equations and later calculations of the structure of molecules which can be regarded as one of the earliest examples of emergence and emergent wholes in science 
Friedrich Hayek dedicated much of his work, from early to the late 20th century, to the study of complex phenomena,[14] not constraining his work to human economies but venturing into other fields such as psychology,[15] biology and cybernetics. 
the first research institute focused on complex systems, the Santa Fe Institute, was founded in 1984.[17][18] Early Santa Fe Institute participants included physics Nobel laureates Murray Gell-Mann and Philip Anderson, economics Nobel laureate Kenneth Arrow, and Manhattan Project scientists George Cowan and Herb Anderson.
within the emerging field of complexity economics new predictive tools have been developed... ...One of Friedrich Hayek's main contributions to early complexity theory is his distinction between the human capacity to predict the behaviour of simple systems and its capacity to predict the behaviour of complex systems through modeling. He believed that economics and the sciences of complex phenomena in general {snip} could not be modeled after the sciences that deal with essentially simple phenomena like physics. Hayek would notably explain that complex phenomena, through modeling, can only allow pattern predictions, compared with the precise predictions that can be made out of non-complex phenomena
the study of complexity is the opposite of the study of chaos. Complexity is about how a huge number of extremely complicated and dynamic sets of relationships can generate some simple behavioral patterns, whereas chaotic behavior, in the sense of deterministic chaos, is the result of a relatively small number of non-linear interactions

They have found that most are incapable of growing quickly enough to compensate for rising sea levels triggered by global warming.
The study suggests that reefs – which are already suffering serious degradation because the world’s seas are warming and becoming more acidic – could also become overwhelmed by rising oceans.
The research – led by scientists at Exeter University and published in Nature this week – involved studying growth rates for more than 200 tropical western Atlantic and Indian Ocean reefs. It was found only 9% of these reefs had the ability to keep up with even the most optimistic rates of sea-level rises forecast by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. “For many reefs across the Caribbean and Indian Ocean regions, where the study focused, rates of growth are slowing due to coral reef degradation,” said Professor Chris Perry, of Exeter University. “Meanwhile, rates of sea-level rise are increasing – and our results suggest reefs will be unable to keep up. As a result, water depths above most reefs will increase rapidly through this century.”
Sea levels rose by several inches over the past century and measurements indicate the speed of this increase is now rising significantly. Two key factors are involved: climate change is making ocean water warmer and so it expands. And as ice sheets and glaciers melt, they increase amounts of water in the oceans.
At the same time, reefs are being weakened by ocean warming and also by ocean acidification, triggered as more and more the seas absorb more and more carbon dioxide. These effects lead to bleaching events that kill off vast stretches of coral and limits their ability to grow.
“Our predictions, even under the best case scenarios, suggest that by 2100 the inundation of reefs will expose coastal communities to significant threats of shoreline change,” said co-author Prof Peter Mumby of Queensland University.
This point was backed by US marine scientist Ilsa Kuffner writing in a separate comment piece for Nature. “The implications of the study are dire. Many island nations and territories are set to quickly lose crucial natural resources.”
… we can’t turn away from climate change. The Guardian’s environmental coverage reports the scientific facts, social consequences and political choices that are shaping the fate of our planet. As the world's leaders turn their backs on the environment, we are at a crisis point. Individual consumer choices are important, but we need collective action to achieve the systemic change that will really make a difference. Our pioneering and our fearless reporting on the environment can play a vital role in that. But we need our readers’ support.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute.

This week the supermarket ditched transparent plastic bags in favour of recyclable paper ones, in a move it said was prompted by customers’ worries over pollution. But the step is likely to have unintended consequences and trade one environmental challenge for another.
The Environment Agency found that paper carrier bags, across their lifecycle of production, use and disposal, had a greater global-warming impact than plastic ones. The agency’s study found paper ones were only better than plastic if they were used four or more times, but that was unlikely due to durability of paper bags.
While the research was published seven years ago, the government’s top waste and recycling advisers, Wrap, said the findings were still relevant today.
Chris Goodall, an author and environmental expert, said: “This is a retrograde step, moving back to paper.”
He agreed the impact of plastic pollution on marine life was very serious, but said: “Most of the plastic in the sea comes from a small number of rivers, it does not come from me buying green beans in Morrisons.”
Compared to using plastic bags for loose fruit and vegetable, paper bags were a backwards step in climate and energy use terms, Goodall said. One reason for the greater climate impact is that using paper will lessen the life expectancy of produce, he argued, leading to more food waste in landfill, where it generates methane, a powerful greenhouse gas.
Since the 1950s, 8.3bn tonnes of plastic has been produced. Plastic is seen as a versatile, indispensable product, but the environmental impact is becoming more stark. Plastic is now so pervasive that recycling systems cannot keep up and the leakage into the environment is such that by 2050 plastic in the ocean will outweigh fish. Last year scientists found plastic fibres in tap water, and plastic has been found in the stomachs of sea creatures in the deepest part of the ocean. Most plastic waste ends up in landfill sites or leaks into the natural environment, where it is causing huge damage to eco-systems on land and sea, creating near permanent contamination. According to academics in the United States, by 2015, of all the plastic waste generated since the 1950s, only 9% has been recycled, with 12% incinerated and 79% accumulated in landfill sites or the environment.
Producers of plastic include retailers, drinks companies and supermarkets. The Guardian revealed that supermarkets create more than half of the plastic waste in the household stream in the UK. But they refuse to reveal how much they put on to the streets and how much they pay towards recycling it. Supermarkets are under pressure to reduce their plastic packaging and campaigners argue they have the power to turn off the tap. Much of the packaging they sell to consumers is not recyclable: plastic film, black plastic trays, sleeves on drinks bottles and some coloured plastic. The Recycling Association and other experts believe supermarkets could do much more to make packaging 100% recyclable and reduce the use of plastic.
The taxpayer, overwhelmingly. Producers and retailers pay the lowest towards recycling and dealing with their waste in Europe. In other countries, the “polluter” is forced to pay much more. In France, a sliding system of charges means those who put more non- recyclable material on the market pay more.
Supermarkets are under pressure, not least from the prime minister, to create plastic-free aisles. A growing number of zero-waste shops are springing up and consumers are being encouraged to ask for products to be sold without plastic.

However, Friends of the Earth said that it welcomed Morrisons’ switch and that green issues other than climate change should be factored in.
Julian Kirby, a campaigner at the group, said: “The thing about climate change is because it’s such a huge worry it has eclipsed other very serious environmental and health concerns, and that would include … pollution. 
“With a paper bag, if it escapes into the environment it will biodegrade very soon. That is not the case with a plastic one.”
The supermarket appeared aware of the trade-off, saying it had weighed the environmental impact of paper against the potential pollution from plastic.
“We have listened to customers and they are telling us that the overuse of plastic is the most important environmental issue for us to deal with,” a spokesperson said.
… we can’t turn away from climate change. For The Guardian, reporting on the environment is a  priority.  We give climate, nature and pollution stories the prominence they deserve, stories which often go unreported by others in the mainstream media. At this critical time for our species and our planet, we are determined to inform readers about threats, consequences and solutions based on scientific facts, not political prejudice or business interests. But we need your support to grow our coverage, to travel to the remote frontlines of change and to cover vital conferences that affect us all.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute.

Emissions from UK air travel were estimated in 2010 to be the equivalent of between 13 and 15% of UK Greenhouse gas emissions (see https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/apr/06/aviation-q-and-a)
Britain has a legal commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050.
(Although an 80% cut is a step in the right direction, we actually need much more drastic cuts than that to prevent very dangerous climate change, see e.g. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41401656)

However, I think the article has a lot of errors in it. e.g.
BQSTART
CO2 release brings on rapid mass extinction. It has happened 15 times in the geological record. The gas warms the Earth and melts the ice caps. The resultant loss of temperature difference between the poles and the equator leads to loss of wind and ocean currents. The seas become stagnant. They stop producing oxygen and emit hydrogen sulphide instead. The latter is a poisonous gas, and kills all living creatures at 200ppm in the atmosphere.
BQEND
15 mass extinctions seems a bit higher than the 5 which are normally counted. 
The article seems to imply that human CO2 emissions are going to cause mass extinction via release of hydrogen sulphide from the oceans in the very near future. I think that is a long way wide of the mark.
While such an outcome may be possible eventually, I think it's very unlikely to be a threat in the near-term. At the very least we can say that it doesn't seem to be a major concern of the scientific community. I couldn't find a single mention of hydrogen sulphide / sulfide in the 5th assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR5) - a state of the art summary of the science around climate change published in 2014 or so.
A lot of the errors in the article would not have occured if the author had familiarised himself with the scientific consensus in IPCC AR5.

That's not to say that no-one should fly ever. Perhaps two or three times on average in a lifetime might be a sustainable level. And really, those predictions about how much of our carbon budget aviation will take up by mid-century aren't nonsense. Already 3% or so globally, which would be more like 10% of the budget by 2050 even without any increase in aviation.

If the runway is not at Heathrow it will be somewhere else in the South East. If not, then capacity at Amsterdam or Frankfurt will eventually take extra traffic. 
Aircraft have become significantly more efficient, and quieter, with much lower emissions. I think pressure on manufacturers to keep on this is the most realistic way to help.
BQEND
You are assuming that air traffic can only rise. That's looking at the problem backwards. There is a strict limit on how much carbon we can emit and still preserve human civilisation. We will have mitted it all in about 20 years at current rates. If you want to stop this you have to make drastic changes (because we';ve left it so late). That includes a whole heap less flying about. There is no real choice about this. Given a choice between death or less flying and most people could manage less flying really.
And 'if we don't then someone else will' is an equally shitty argument. Do you accept that for heroin selling? Bank fraud? ...No? Right - some things are simply right or wrong, or in this case necessary. It's quite amazing how hard people will ignore even an existential problem if dealing with it might be slightly inconvenient.
More efficient planes is never going to do much more than mitigate the rate of growth. An intercontinental flight is currently 2 tonnes CO2e. You might get that down to 1.5 tonnes one day.

The decision by MPs to put commercial interests ahead of the needs of our planet when it came to vote on the third runway at Heathrow represents a final, catastrophic betrayal. I had just finished a 14-day hunger strike, along with other Vote No Heathrow campaigners, to try to get across our objection to the idea. We are committed. Boris Johnson – supposedly an avowed critic of the plan – couldn’t even be bothered to turn up.
For 30 years scientists have been making clear the catastrophic and inevitable consequences of climate change. CO2 emissions are altering our planet, and it will lead to humanity’s destruction unless we do something about it. It’s real, it’s happening – our politicians must face facts. At present temperatures have risen 1.2C. Another 0.6C of warming is locked in from already emitted carbon which has yet to increase temperatures. The arctic will likely be ice-free in the summer within the next decade and ice-free all the year round within 10 years after that. The resultant dark earth and water that will replace the reflective ice and snow will create an estimated additional half a degree of warming. These precise numbers are important, because death is not linear but binary. At a certain point you cross from life to death. So where is the line? Two degrees is the answer. As we pass this point, it is no longer possible to grow grains at scale in the centre of Russia and North America, where temperatures will increase twice as fast as the global average. Millions will starve, tens of millions of climate refugees will be heading in our direction, and the world economic system will collapse. We are hurtling towards this moment of truth.
This is a modal window.
We were told by scientists not so long ago that we should not go over 350 parts per million of C02 in the atmosphere. We are now on 403.3 parts per million. Only a few years ago it was increasing by 2ppm a year. Now it is 3ppm. The rate is increasing exponentially. Never before in its four billion-year history has the Earth experienced such a massive rate of increase. The level of 450ppm is the equivalent of a 2C increase in temperature. We are set to pass this in about 10 years’ time – a blink in geological time. Shortly afterwards we are set to pass 500ppm, after which, in the words of Professor Peter Ward, “all bets are off”. 
He can say that because the science is now done on the fundamentally unstable dynamics of the Earth’s geophysical system. CO2 release brings on rapid mass extinction. It has happened 15 times in the geological record. The gas warms the Earth and melts the ice caps. The resultant loss of temperature difference between the poles and the equator leads to loss of wind and ocean currents. The seas become stagnant. They stop producing oxygen and emit hydrogen sulphide instead. The latter is a poisonous gas, and kills all living creatures at 200ppm in the atmosphere. 
Scientists have been telling politicians this information for three decades. It is clearly laid out in thousands of peer-reviewed scientific papers. Continue to emit CO2 poison, and the world will become toxic. There is no planet B. 
In such circumstances have a right and indeed the duty to rebel
When the British public wake up to the fact that all that they cherish and love will soon be destroyed, they will turn on the politicians that allowed this to happen. In the meantime some of us have been working for some time on saving our society. We are preparing to rebel. The Heathrow vote demonstrates that our political system is in the grip of short-term commercial interest, even though it will lead to devastating results. It cannot be reformed from within. John Locke, our greatest political philosopher, laid down a clear response – in such circumstances citizens have a right and indeed the duty to rebel. We have done it before in our history and we are going to do it again.

… we can’t turn away from climate change. The Guardian’s environmental coverage reports the scientific facts, social consequences and political choices that are shaping the fate of our planet. As the world's leaders turn their backs on the environment, we are at a crisis point. Individual consumer choices are important, but we need collective action to achieve the systemic change that will really make a difference. Our pioneering and our fearless reporting on the environment can play a vital role in that. But we need our readers’ support.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute.

To get there I leave the beach behind and drive past Arky’s Live Bait &amp; Tackle, Deal and Discounts II, Rafiul Food Store, Royal Budget Inn, Family Dollar and Goodwill. As I continue north, the buildings all lose their mirrored glass and their extra floors, until most are single story and made from stucco.
It isn’t raining when I arrive in Shorecrest, and there isn’t a storm offshore; the day is as clear and as blue as the filigree on a porcelain plate. But the streets are still full of water. I watch as a woman wades ankle deep across Tenth Avenue. She has gathered her long russet-colored skirt in her right hand, and in her left she holds a pair of Jesus sandals. When she reaches the bus stop, she sits and puts her shoes on. 
“We get flooded with just about every high tide,” the woman tells me. “And if the moon is big it’s worse.”
All along the east coast, from Portland, Maine, to Key West, “sunny day flooding” is increasingly frequent. Many places in the Sunshine State are so low lying that high tide – when coupled with something as innocuous as a full moon – can cause the streets to brim with water. Sometimes the tide simply rises above the seawalls and starts to spill into the roadways; in other cases it enters the neighborhood through the storm-water infrastructure belowground. The very pipes designed to reduce flooding by ushering rain out instead give salt water a chance to work its way in.
In Shorecrest I spend a minute watching the bay burble up through the street grate and on to Northeast Little River Drive before whipping out my camera and snapping half a dozen photos. Just then a man walks up behind me, peers down, and says: “I’ve seen fish come swimming out.”
“No, you haven’t!”
“I have,” he says, pushing his sunglasses up. “I’ve been here 20 years. When I first moved we used to flood once a year, maybe twice. Now it’s constant.” His name is Robert Cisneros. He grew up in Cuba and moved to Florida in 1962, dropping the final “o” in Roberto. He thought the name change might help his fledgling boat repair company succeed.
Robert points to his house and his yard, which are catty-corner from the drain we stand by, and says: “I used to have a nice garden here, and now you see how it is. The water comes in and sits. And everything dies because of the salt. It’s not rain that floods this place. It’s the ocean. I just bought some stones to put here to try to keep the water out. But other than that, what can I do?”
I ask if the city is helping the neighborhood come up with short-term solutions. Robert gets upset. “I think they need to raise the street. They need to install pumps. But those kinds of things only happen on the beach. They’re not giving any of us here any relief.”
Like Miami Beach, Shorecrest was built atop a former wetland. On the strip, where billions of dollars in real estate investment are at risk, the government is using a mixture of property taxes and municipal bonds to invest in formal sea level rise adaptation. But in Shorecrest, Hialeah, and Sweetwater – low to middle-income neighborhoods where the majority of residents are people of color – residents are expected to remove their shoes and wade through the water.
Robert shakes his head in disbelief. “I wanted to leave this house to my kids, but soon it’s going to be worthless,” he says. On his stoop sit two pairs of rubber boots, ready for the flood that is already here.
****
The following Friday I return to the Cox Science Center at the University of Miami. In the parking lot I sit in my rental car as the past decade of storms goes thundering through my mind. I see large waves pulsing into New Orleans’ Lower Ninth Ward. Roiling chocolate milk ripping homes off their foundations in Oakwood Beach, Staten Island. Family cottages in the Rockaways in New York turned into aquariums during Sandy.
I remember walking through the Lower Ninth five years after Katrina. The storm’s eerie language was still clearly legible on one house’s laminate siding: a painted X, its upper quadrant marked to show one dead in the attic. On the next building, a lighter, more haunting X showed two dead on the ground level. Someone had attempted to scrub it away, to remove the memory of the killing wind, the way the water deformed the foundation and window frames, the lives it took.
I start descending the poorly lit staircase to the basement of Cox, where the geology department is – fittingly – located.
The atmosphere down in the office of the department’s chair Harold Wanless, or “Hal”, is more in keeping with my mood. Perhaps it’s also in keeping with Hal, whose decades of research on sea level rise have earned him a reputation for cataclysmic prediction. He is wearing the same taupe suit as the week before. The skin below his eyes is the color of charcoal, and the rest of his face sags, too. Still he manages a smile. Up close it is hard to imagine that the media has nicknamed this good-natured septuagenarian “Dr Doom”.
Hal pushes some of his scattered papers aside so I can set up my recording device. I have my question, just one, prepared: “What single event woke you up to the reality of sea level rise?”
“You know, 20 years ago I never thought I would end up seeing the rise because everything, all the projections at that time, really didn’t ramp up until well into the 21st century. But then I started going out to Cape Sable.” Cape Sable is the southernmost part of the mainland; it reaches into the Florida Bay like a swollen hook. “Out there the beaches were disappearing, mangroves were moving in, tiny channels turned into huge rivers in a matter of years. Even the roseate spoonbills started abandoning their nesting grounds. I had never, in my life of studying the geology of the coast of Florida, seen anything like it. That is when I knew in my gut that the early predictions were wrong and that sea level rise was unfolding a lot faster than any of us ever imagined.”
“What comes next?” I ask.
“We have to start relocating the things we value,” he says. “Like the Smithsonian Institution, which is sited on top of an old marsh. We have to make seed banks, a global archive for the future, and we have to move our power plants, in order to maintain a functioning society. We have to start lining the trash dumps that line our shores, we have to start preparing for inundation. Remember, the last time carbon dioxide levels were the same as they are today, the ocean was one hundred feet higher.”
The last time carbon dioxide levels were this high was during the Pliocene epoch, 2.6 to 5.3 million years ago, when megatoothed sharks prowled the oceans. The last time carbon dioxide levels were this high, the tectonic plates beneath India and Asia collided, forming the Himalayas. The last time carbon dioxide levels were this high, California’s Sierra Nevada rose up and tilted its granite face west. The Alps folded and thrust their splintered rock toward the sky. The last time carbon dioxide levels were this high, armadillos migrated north across a newly formed land bridge between today’s North and South America. Dogs headed in the opposite direction. But no one can remember these things, because humans didn’t exist.
I leave Hal’s office and drive back across the bay. That night the moon is big and full, making the ocean weightier. The salt water unspools in the streets and continues drowning, by degrees, the low-lying land that lines our shore. Soon, I think, if Hal is right, all of this will be underwater, not just temporarily, but for good.

Briefly, our population is gaining size exponentially. The revised projection for 2050 is 9.7bn. That is another 2.7 billion in around 40 years. If current trends continue, we are looking at 11.2bn in 2100.We already need the equivalent of one-and-a-half Earths just to stand still. Finite resources are running out. Therre is the same amount of water now as there was 3.5bn years ago, and the same percentage of fresh water at 3%. We are already overusing that and starting to tap into underwater reserves. There are the first signs of war in places like Africa where rivers are being diverted upstream, vast lakes are shrinking to nothing and the population in those very same areas are the same one predicted to grow the most.Of the 2.2bn increase by 2050, more than half of that will be in Africa. Where are they all going to go? They are already beyond salvation with droughts, famines and disease. Trillions of Dollars has been pumped into that continent and still they do nothing for themselves. Now we are seeing the beginnings of a mass migration movement from Africa into Europe, which will displace the indigenous populations. The word White Genocide is now being used in reference to unsustainable and illegal migration from Africa. Is it any wonder therefore, that the first victims will be wildlife? That will be the first to go, followed by natural forest, woodland and just about any greenery.

Ultimately, globalised capitalism with its emphasis on growth and resource overuse is hugely to blame. So are the vast agrochemical conglomerates such as Monstanto, which have stupefied farmers into complying with their noxious products. These are driving much of the damage. However, given that we humans number over 7 billion and don't all work in finance or pesticides manufacture, behaviour change on a gargantuan scale could help.
As consumers and as stewards, we need both to consume wisely and to rewild and wild our habitats locally. Support local farming initiatives that are sustainable. Grow your own - think of it as Victory Gardens for biodiversity. Create a wildlife garden full of nectar- and pollen-rich plants and guerrilla garden in your neighbourhood. Pay particular attention to soils to ensure that they're biologically viable - the soil microbiome is of the essence. Collect rainwater. 
Yes, numbers of species are down, but to some degree 'if you build it, they will come'. So build.
Yeats's Lapis Lazuli is a remarkable poem about tragedy, destruction, annihilation and what it takes to revivify and rebuild. He uses the word 'gay' in its old sense, of buoyancy and lightheartedness, hope and understanding of cycles:

It makes it safe to eat even if it is diseased or has gone off. The US has no laws to protect chickens - federal law does not define them as animals. Chicken farmers can treat them as badly as they wish, keep them in filthy conditions, and still produce food which can be legally sold. One of the reasons Americans have lower life expectancies than Europeans is that much of their food is of poor nutritional value. Of course, you can get excellent food in the US, you can find food produced with all attention to animal welfare, some states have animal welfare laws as good as anywhere on Earth. But we can already import those things if we wish. The things we cannot import are produced by the torture of animals, and by much lower paid workers than here, and are proven to be lacking in nutrients. 
You completely miss the point. Many people cannot afford to buy the best even now - but even the cheapest food is produced by people paid at least minimum wages, on farms where the welfare is supposed to be high - and even in the worse cases cannot be as bad as in parts of the US, as they would be legally unable to sell their products as they cannot disguise their deficiencies with chlorine - and has a higher nutrient density than the majority of US products. You are saying that their health is unimportant as long as those who can afford it can eat better food - which, in a country with a national health service, is a false economy as well as downright elitist.
Also, you may be quite happy to think of animals in other countries being tortured, their workers underpaid - it's their culture, after all. No, all cultures are not equal, and those which see no problem in harming animals or their fellow humans need to be encouraged to improve. Sadly, that includes the US. We may not be able to force improvement on anyone, but we should not allow anything into the UK which undermines the standards that we held long before we joined the EEC, as it was, and have improved since. We need to be looking to improve standards further, not to indulge in a race to the bottom, nor to use unnecessary energy moving anything round the planet which could be produced locally. 
Economically, we also need to decrease imports and increase exports. The world market in food will dry up, and within the lifetimes of most now alive. If we are not producing enough of what we can grow to feed our already excessive population, and their probably even more excessive children, what happens to them when we run out of international credit? You are unaware of the concept of food security?
Yes, it is up to us, and we do not need to add to the mistakes we see around us. You are trying to save one small area while the rest of the world becomes devastated - it cannot work. The globe is an interconnected system. We need to use the best possible practice to feed our people while keeping enough connected corridors of wildish areas for our other species to survive.

You have absolutely no understanding of the UK landscape. It has not been natural in millennia. There is nothing genuinely wild in the UK except the tops of the highest mountains. Monbiot is moaning about sheep - sheep created the landscapes of the Downs and the Cotswolds, the Peak and Lake Districts. Traditional farming worked very well with most of the wild species around; indeed, the hedges which kept farm animals from straying gave increasing numbers of habitats for any number of wild creatures; the habit of coppicing woodland rather than outright felling allowed fungi, lichens, insects, woodland flowers and so on to remain established for centuries; the close-cropped grasses of sheep farms allowed rare and delicate species of plants and insects to become locally common; flower-filled hay meadows encouraged pollinators to orchards full of fruit trees.
The world market produces cheaper food because many countries have few rules on animal welfare - and ignore those they do have - and are ploughing up the habitats of rare animals and plants to feed an excessive world population. If you think we should try to encourage that, you are seriously sick. Your mindset is that of the EU - encourage Indonesia to kill orangutans to give us environmentally friendly diesel. It is a mindset which is responsible for global ruination, all these dirty ships sailing round the world to save pennies, exporting our own environmental destruction.
In the UK, we have some of the world's best farming land, we have some of the toughest rules on animal welfare - which we could and should make tougher once out of the EU - we should be setting standards for other countries to follow if they want to sell to us. You are also saying it is absolutely fine for poorer people to eat food of low nutritional value, pumped full of assorted chemicals, as long as those who can afford it can still have access to the best stuff and great views. Live in Islington, do you?
Plus, if you think beyond the end of your own nose, what of the future? We are, and have been for centuries, a debtor nation. Moreover, we are one with a population more than twice a sustainable size, moving into a vastly overpopulated world where fresh water for irrigation will be a cause of war within a couple of decades, and climate change may destroy the ability of some of the world's largest farming areas to produce at anything like current rates. All countries will struggle to feed their people; world markets will be expensive and suffer from frequent shortages. Then what happens to the bulk of the UK population? We've let in people from hither, thither and yon, they have children, and will have grandchildren - even if we do all we can to feed our own population we cannot hope to do so. If we turn ourselves into a nature theme park with an organic farm for the privileged, millions will starve. 
We have to not only discourage as many people as possible from coming or remaining here, we have to combine producing much more of our own food with protecting what is left of our natural world. We can do better, and many farmers do; the dairy farm next door has wide margins of wild plants around all its fields, currently a picture of purple, white and yellow; mixed hedgerows scented with honeysuckle and roses, soon to be packed with blackberries and haws, grass and crops are both fertilised with slurry from the winter housing of the cattle and the milking sheds, new stands of trees - mainly hazel - in awkward corners are already full of bluebells, anemones and foxgloves. He's been farming like that all the 35 years we've been here, long before it was fashionable. And while there are far fewer butterflies and moths than there used to be, the cuckoos and the grey partridge have gone, and the kites have pushed out the kestrels which used to hover over every field, you will always see some butterflies whenever you walk through, the swifts are still chasing them, skylarks are still singing, and deer, foxes and stoats are frequently in evidence.

We have to save it | George Monbiot,article,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/29/natural-world-disappearing-save-it,7522,"It felt as disorienting as forgetting my pin number. I stared at the caterpillar, unable to attach a name to it. I don’t think my mental powers are fading: I still possess an eerie capacity to recall facts and figures and memorise long screeds of text. This is a specific loss. As a child and young adult, I delighted in being able to identify almost any wild plant or animal. And now it has gone. This ability has shrivelled from disuse: I can no longer identify them because I can no longer find them.
Perhaps this forgetfulness is protective. I have been averting my eyes. Because I cannot bear to see what we have done to nature, I no longer see nature itself; otherwise, the speed of loss would be unendurable. The collapse can be witnessed from one year to the next. The swift decline of the swift (down 25% in five years) is marked by the loss of the wild screams that, until very recently, filled the skies above my house. My ambition to see the seabird colonies of Shetland and St Kilda has been replaced by the intention never to visit those islands during the breeding season: I could not bear to see the empty cliffs, where populations have crashed by some 90% in the past two decades.
I have lived long enough to witness the vanishing of wild mammals, butterflies, mayflies, songbirds and fish that I once feared my grandchildren would not experience: it has all happened faster than even the pessimists predicted. Walking in the countryside or snorkelling in the sea is now as painful to me as an art lover would find visits to a gallery, if on every occasion another old master had been cut from its frame.
The cause of this acceleration is no mystery. The United Nations reports that our use of natural resources has tripled in 40 years. The great expansion of mining, logging, meat production and industrial fishing is cleansing the planet of its wild places and natural wonders. What economists proclaim as progress, ecologists recognise as ruin.
This is what has driven the quadrupling of oceanic dead zones since 1950; the “biological annihilation” represented by the astonishing collapse of vertebrate populations; the rush to carve up the last intact forests; the vanishing of coral reefs, glaciers and sea ice; the shrinkage of lakes, the drainage of wetlands. The living world is dying of consumption.
We have a fatal weakness: a failure to perceive incremental change. As natural systems shift from one state to another, we almost immediately forget what we have lost. I have to make a determined effort to remember what I saw in my youth. Could it really be true that every patch of nettles, at this time of year, was reamed with caterpillar holes? That flycatchers were so common I scarcely gave them a second glance? That the rivers, around the autumn equinox, were almost black with eels?
Others seem oblivious. When I have criticised current practice, farmers have sent me images of verdant monocultures of perennial ryegrass, with the message: “Look at this and try telling me we don’t look after nature.” It’s green, but it’s about as ecologically rich as an airport runway.
One reader, Michael Groves, records the shift he has seen in the field beside his house, where the grass that used to be cut for hay is now cut for silage. Watching the cutters being driven at great speed across the field, he realised that any remaining wildlife would be shredded. Soon afterwards, he saw a roe deer standing in the mown grass. She stayed throughout the day and the following night. When he went to investigate, he found her fawn, its legs amputated. “I felt sickened, angry and powerless … how long had it taken to die?” That “grass-fed meat” the magazines and restaurants fetishise? This is the reality.
When our memories are wiped as clean as the land, we fail to demand its restoration. Our forgetting is a gift to industrial lobby groups and the governments that serve them. Over the past few months I have been told repeatedly that the environment secretary, Michael Gove, gets it. I have said so myself: he genuinely seems to understand what the problems are and what needs to be done. Unfortunately, he doesn’t do it.
Gove cannot be blamed for all of the fiascos to which he has put his name. The 25-year plan for nature was, it seems, gutted by the prime minister’s office. The environmental watchdog he proposed was de-fanged by the Treasury (it has subsequently been lent some dentures by parliament). Other failures are all his own work. In response to lobbying from sheep farmers, Gove has allowed ravens, a highly intelligent and long-lived species just beginning to recover from centuries of persecution, to be killed once more in order to protect lambs. There are 23 million sheep in this country and 7,400 pairs of ravens. Why must all other species give way to the white plague?
Responding to complaints that most of our national parks are wildlife deserts, Gove set up a commission to review them. But governments choose their conclusions in advance, through the appointments they make. A more dismal, backward-looking and uninspiring panel would be hard to find: not one of its members, as far as I can tell, has expressed a desire for significant change in our national parks, and most of them, if their past statements are anything to go by, are determined to keep them in their sheep-wrecked and grouse-trashed state.
Now the lobbyists demand a New Zealand settlement for farming after Brexit: deregulated, upscaled, hostile to both wildlife and the human eye. If they get their way no landscape, however treasured, will be safe from broiler sheds and mega dairy units, no river protected from runoff and pollution, no songbird saved from local extinction. The merger between Bayer and Monsanto brings together the manufacturer of the world’s most lethal pesticides with the manufacturer of the world’s most lethal herbicides. Already the concentrated power of these behemoths is a hazard to democracy; together they threaten both political and ecological disaster. Labour’s environment team has scarcely a word to say about any of it. Similarly, the big conservation groups have gone missing in inaction.
We forget even our own histories. We fail to recall, for example, that the 1945 Dower report envisaged wilder national parks than we now possess, and that the conservation white paper the government issued in 1947 called for the kind of large-scale protection that is considered edgy and innovative today. Remembering is a radical act.
That caterpillar, by the way, was a six-spot burnet: the larva of a stunning iridescent black and pink moth that once populated my neighbourhood. I will not allow myself to forget again: I will work to recover the knowledge I have lost. For I now see that without the power of memory, we cannot hope to defend the world we love.
• George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist
… we can’t turn away from climate change. The Guardian’s environmental coverage reports the scientific facts, social consequences and political choices that are shaping the fate of our planet. As the world's leaders turn their backs on the environment, we are at a crisis point. Individual consumer choices are important, but we need collective action to achieve the systemic change that will really make a difference. Our pioneering and our fearless reporting on the environment can play a vital role in that. But we need our readers’ support.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute. Thank you.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/29/natural-world-disappearing-save-it

I'm not angry at all! You'll note that I was suggesting everyone should calm down with their apocalyptic views.
""On the one hand you brag about your tiny carbon footprint and low consumption of resources and production of pollution""
Let me guess - I was 'virtue-signalling'?
""on the other you argue that the catastrophic collapse on several bird species has nothing to do with global warming.""
Well, no, to be fair I said no such thing. In fact I've clearly said that it may well be related.
""You have me certainly confused me as to what you think is happening. To begin with I thought you had decided that nothing of significant is being reported in this article.""
Alas, again, I didn't say that. My comments were about the tone, not the message.
""I don't agree with you. Something serious is occurring. The causes may not be 100% clear but it is high probability that higher sea temperatures driven by global warming is causing fish species to move elsewhere in search of cooler water.""
I don't think the seas are warmer around Scotland. If the fish went south, so could the seabirds.
""Another factor could be overfishing but that is a problem the birds have had to cope with for at least half a century so why is the current dramatic decline in bird populations only apparent now.""
Salmon farming, would be my guess.
""Pollution of the oceans with plastics and other pollutants is another possible factor.""
A fair certainty, I'd say.
There is some evidence that would support the theory that we are approaching a critical point and that we could be on the verge of a collapse in the global environment.
They said that in the 80s. I changed my lifestyle and brought up my family accordingly - I don't see many other people doing the same thing, unfortunately.
""How many species can we afford to lose before the ecosystem collapses.Science is telling us that the rate of species decline even extinction is accelerating. Some scientists studying some specific ecosystems think that we are at the point where the loss is becoming exponential. Coral reefs and the high Arctic are two areas of very serious concern currently.""
I agree. I've been saying as much for decades. I did something about it, like I said. Also like I said, coming here and wringing your hands is not going to help. How many posters, complaining about it, have toned their Western-consumerist ways right down? No, they come here and blame population, blame the southern and eastern hemispheres; blame anything but themselves.
""Shed your anger doing some serious study may help. Do an MSc on ecology or something you will probably find it very interesting if a little frightening.""

I returned a couple of years ago. There is no coral reef next to Laimai beach all thats left is an expanse of bleached dead white rock.

On the one hand you brag about your tiny carbon footprint and low consumption of resources and production of pollution on the other you argue that the catastrophic collapse on several bird species has nothing to do with global warming. You have me certainly confused me as to what you think is happening. To begin with I thought you had decided that nothing of significant is being reported in this article.I don't agree with you. Something serious is occurring. The causes may not be 100% clear but it is high probability that higher sea temperatures driven by global warming is causing fish species to move elsewhere in search of cooler water. The prey that support the bird species in decline are now out of their hunting range.Another factor could be overfishing but that is a problem the birds have had to cope with for at least half a century so why is the current dramatic decline in bird populations only apparent now.Pollution of the oceans with plastics and other pollutants is another possible factor.
The environment locally and globally is coming under serious pressure. There is some evidence that would support the theory that we are approaching a critical point and that we could be on the verge of a collapse in the global environment.
Paul Ehrlich once used the analogy of being on an aircraft mid ocean. You look out of the window and watch one of many rivets holding the aircraft together parting company with the plane. No need to worry there are lots of other rivets the plane was definitely over engineered it has more than enough rivets to prevent the wings falling off and the aircraft plunging into the ocean. Then you notice another rivet ....and another rivet ...and how do you feel when you notice that the rate of rivet loss is accelerating? How do you feel when you begin to observe exponential loss of rivets?The aircraft is of course the ecosystem the rivets represent the individual species that help the system function. How many species can we afford to lose before the ecosystem collapses.Science is telling us that the rate of species decline even extinction is accelerating. Some scientists studying some specific ecosystems think that we are at the point where the loss is becoming exponential.

Both systems aim for ""more"". Of course capitalists won't agree because they delight in painting socialism as ""hair shirts and misery for all"" - not at all: socialism means ""the best possible standard of living for everyone"".That's why socialism can also lead to over-exploitation and environmental collapse.
As for capitalism: this says ""create wealth as a return on property, the best for the individual, within the rule of law and protection fo property in all its forms"". Conservatives usually go along with this which is why conservatives are often capitalists.Capitalism / most conservatives are therefore likely to over-exploit the environment too because the prime concern is the individual.
There is a difference between the two though:• Socialism is based on reason (whether reason is correct is another matter note), in that planning, legislation, and regulations are the tools to make things as best as possible for everyone. Cooperation, not competition. The Pyramids rather than the Forth Bridge.As a result, socialism is better at looking ahead.
To cut a long story short, both systems can, and have, destroyed ecosystems. But socialism is more likely to recover.
And let's not forget: we're used to hearing ""Berlin wall! Socialism is dead! The free market rules now forever!""This is quite wrong: Socialism is in fact three sorts:• Anarchism : everything decided in common without leadership.• Communism: autocratic socialism where ""experts decide all: the central committee. With an added twist: this is meant to be a temporary phase transforming society so that is is ready to become anarchist.• Democracic socialism / social democracy: The de-facto form of government around the planet, includin the good old USA (social support, controlled imports / exports: the market harnessed in the best interests of all).
Only Monaco, Andorra, Russia to some extent, China, alright a few others are not some approximation to democratic socialism. But many people, not least the right, like to pretend this is not the case.

This dramatic 100-metre-high rocky spur, crowned with a lighthouse built by Robert Louis Stevenson’s grandfather, has a reputation for being one of the biggest and most accessible seabird colonies in Britain.
Thousands of puffins, guillemots, razorbills, kittiwakes and fulmars gather there every spring to breed, covering almost every square inch of rock or grass with teeming, screeching birds and their young.
Or at least they used to – for this year Sumburgh Head is a quiet and largely deserted place. Where seabirds once swooped and cried in their thousands, only a handful of birds wheel round the cliffs. The silence is uncanny – the result of a crash in seabird numbers that has been in progress for several years but which has now reached an unprecedented, catastrophic low.
One of the nation’s most important conservation centres has been denuded of its wildlife, a victim – according to scientists – of climate change, which has disrupted food chains in the North Sea and North Atlantic and left many seabirds without a source of sustenance. The result has been an apocalyptic drop in numbers of Arctic terns, kittiwakes and many other birds.
“In the past, Sumburgh Head was brimming with birds, and the air was thick with the smell of guano. The place was covered with colonies of puffins, kittiwakes, fulmars, and guillemots,” said Helen Moncrieff, manager of RSPB Scotland’s office in Shetland.
“There were thousands and thousands of birds and visitors were guaranteed a sight of puffins. Today they have to be very patient. At the same time, guillemots have halved in numbers. It is utterly tragic.”
This grim description is backed by figures that reveal the staggering decreases in seabird numbers in Shetland, the most northerly part of the British Isles. In 2000, there were more than 33,000 puffins on the island in early spring. That figure dropped to 570 last year and there are no signs of any recovery this year, although it is still early in the season.
Similarly, Shetland’s kittiwake population plummeted from over 55,000 in 1981 to 5,000 in 2011, and observers believe those numbers have declined even further in the past few years. Only the lack of a properly funded census has prevented ornithologists from putting precise numbers on the devastation that is occurring.
“I went to check our sites at Dalsetter and Troswick last week to compare numbers of Arctic terns with those we counted during Seabird 2000, the last national seabird census carried out across Britain and Ireland,” added Moncrieff. “I found there were around 110 Arctic terns there last week compared with around 9,000 that were counted in the same area in 2000. That is the kind of loss we have sustained here.”
This point is backed by Euan Dunn, principal policy officer for the RSPB. “These are apocalyptic numbers,” he told the Observer. “We are seeing something very dramatic happening, something that has never occurred in the history of ornithology up there.”
The causes of these devastating declines are many, according to scientists – though most agree that the disappearance of food sources is the main reason. Seabirds rely heavily on sand eels for food, and this supply was severely depleted in northern waters by fishing – though this was eventually halted, allowing stocks to recover. However, these have now been disrupted again by global warming, triggered by rising carbon dioxide emissions from factories, cars and power plants that burn fossil fuels. Temperatures in the North Sea and North Atlantic have risen significantly as a result.
“This warming seems to be affecting the availability of plankton at the time when sand eels produce their larvae,” said Dunn. “There is less plankton and the larvae grow less well and survive less well.”
Not every coastal area of the UK is affected to the same degree, as has been highlighted in a recent project carried out by the RSPB. Groups of puffins, one of the seabirds worst affected by the current crisis, were tagged at two different locations: Shetland and the Shiant Islands, in the Inner Hebrides, where numbers have remained relatively stable in recent years. In the latter, the birds were found to travel on very short journeys of a few kilometres before they returned to their young with plenty of plump fish.
However in Shetland, the picture was found to be starkly different. One of its puffins was found to have to fly more than 400km (248 miles) to find food. “That is more than 10 times further than we thought they were flying,” added Dunn. “Journeys like that are hugely energy consuming and leave the birds very weakened. Not only that, they bring back fish that are much less nutritious than the ones they caught in the good old days when Shetland had plenty of puffins.”
A similar story is provided by trackers fitted to guillemots and razorbills from nearby Fair Isle, which has also suffered serious seabird population losses. They too are having to travel hundreds of kilometres to find food. “It explains clearly why our colonies have foundered,” said Dunn.
In addition to the sand eel crisis that affects coastal areas of Scotland, there is the problem of plastic which builds up on beaches and is ingested by seabirds, with fulmars being particularly badly affected.
“We believe there is plastic in the stomachs of every Shetland fulmar,” said Moncrieff. “If you scaled up what you find in a fulmar’s stomach, it is the equivalent of having a lunch box full of plastic inside your own stomach. There would be no room left for proper food.”
The catastrophe that has struck Shetland’s seabird population has been revealed just as similar crises are being reported from other islands round Britain. Puffin numbers have dropped dramatically on the Farne Islands, it was reported last month, while on St Kilda, one of the most significant seabird colonies in the North Atlantic, there has been a 99% reduction in kittiwake nests since 1990. Two years ago, in all the island’s monitored sites, only one pair bred –and that single chick died.
Yet as these crises have unfolded, the government has declined to fund a new national census, along the lines of those organised in 1970, 1985 and 2000, even though it is supposed to instigate one every 15 years. “Fortunately, it has now agreed to proceed with one, which we hope should be completed by the end of next year,” said Dunn. “Then we should have a better overall picture of what is happening and why these striking declines are happening in particular places.”
For Shetland, the catastrophic decline in many of its key seabird populations is an issue of real concern. The islands are famed for their bleak beauty and have become an important eco-tourism destination. The loss of many of its seabird colonies does not help that cause – though it still has many special attractions: its prehistoric houses and iron age towers, called brochs; a large population of otters (more than 10% of Britain’s otters live here); and increasing numbers of visits by killer whales.
As Moncrieff said: “There are still good reasons to come here, but equally the crisis that has hit so many of our seabirds is not something that we can continue to ignore.”
• Turtle doves used to arrive in large numbers in April to breed in the British Isles but have now disappeared from large areas of the countryside for a variety of reasons: lack of seed from arable plants; the parasite that carries trichomonosis; and hunting during their migration through southern Europe. As a result, the turtle dove has become the UK’s fastest declining bird and is now considered at risk of global extinction.
• Wader populations are declining worldwide thanks to the loss and degradation of habitats, increased predation, and a changing climate. In the UK, this has produced dramatic declines in curlew populations over recent decades – the species has been proposed as the UK’s most important bird conservation priority.
• Nightingales and pied flycatchers have declined in large numbers since monitoring of these woodland species began in 1994, leading to their appearance on the red list of endangered bird species in the UK. In total, there are now 16 woodland birds on the red list.
• One of five upland bird species that were moved on to the red list recently, the dotterel has declined severely in numbers since the 1980s. Causes for the drop include changes in grazing practices and atmospheric pollution, as well as the effect of climate change, to which mountain-dwelling species are especially vulnerable.

Public subsidy is public subsidy and it's a considerably smaller cost to the consumer than renewables once externalities are taken into account plus it doesn't cover the countryside with overhead power pylons.

let's try and break that down into points-
nuclear requires public subsidies- true, but the issue is the nature of the high capital costs up front. If we are going to have public subsidies then they will have to be fair to be legal.
Offshore wind require public subsidies- true, but the amount is falling year on year, the same for solar, the same for batteries and EVs.
If their is an unfair advantage for an industry- i.e. nuclear relying on the public purse, this will need to be justified not only to international trade rules such as those within the EU but to the public. And if one industry has an unfair advantage then other sectors can sue [as in the US] or complain.One way i foresee the renewable energy sector get fair treatment with the nuclear sector is for renewables to get subsidised storage- either as batteries or pumped storage.Public money deserves public representation- if the public feel the deal is unfavourable then huge payments to private corporations for little in return may meet opposition.

the displaced fuel will be gas.....
BQENDUltimately yes, I completely agree, average gas consumption (for electricity) will fall as it is displaced in aggregate.
My point is not only that the article carries an unhelpful and (in my view ill considered) anti-nuclear bias, but that as the gas/backup costs for an increasing degree of renewables rise (as you acknowledge) then they will plateau and shortfalls will be met more and more by gas which is considerably cheaper (and also the ultimate backup to) storage.
If we had 60% penetration of wind now, then we'd have been burning 55% gas for the last ten days and more to come.Solar helps of course but then the sun sets at the same time as peak demand hits.Without nuclear, then we would use considerably more gas than that. 
So we will still have a system dependent upon gas in winters and in Summer doldrums such as now when there is little or no wind.
Obviously the higher level of low carbon baseload, the less storage and gas will be required to fill in the (smaller) gaps.

Intermittent renewables have a critical role in the mix of low carbon technologies - but without low carbon baseload/dispatchable support they are , on average, de facto fossil fuel supplies.
BQEND
While I understand the point you make, I think it is also fair to represent this in a different way......
- We have a relatively stable amount of nuclear generation in the UK. Say 20% of capacity.- We aren't going to increase nuclear's share of UK capacity in a significant way under any of the UK plans, given the large amount of capacity to be retired by 2025 (same link)- The capacity above this started out as all fossil fuel. Lots of coal and gas, basically.- Over the last few years, we have added meaningful amounts of PV and wind generation to the mix, and coal has almost disappeared.- Gas generation has mostly stayed in the range 30-40% of the mix over the last decade.- As renewables reach higher penetrations, it becomes more expensive to back them up - There will be an effective plateau of annual generation from renewables unless we have more storage (hydro or equivalent, yet to be invented)- BUT the displaced fuel will be gas.....
So the way I would see it is that more renewables = less gas burned over a year, accepting that there may be periods when there is no alternative to gas. These periods may be quite lengthy. But 80% with renewables is possible according to this study. I know this generated a lot of comments earlier this year, but most people seemed to accept the 80% figure. With 20% or so nuclear, as well, that would also help.
In summary, more renewables would displace gas now, rather than coal, but without storage, we would still need to retain sufficient gas capacity to cover periods where demand exceeded capacity from nuclear + renewables.', u'recommendation_count': u'4', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1528723049000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'13126382', u'in_reply_to': u'116844045', u'id': u'116846785', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'DennisHorne', u'text': u'You seem to be the sort of person where the glass is always half broken.

I'm not sure what you can extrapolate PV prices to 2035. Module price falls seem to have levelled off.
BQENDActually module prices haven't levelled off, at all, no idea why you would suggest this. Prices per Wp are still falling, plus panel efficiencies are still rising which means more capacity for any given area, which also improves the economics.
You seem to disagree with my suggestion for £30/MWh PV generation by 2035, yet the US could see $15/MWh generation much, much, much sooner. Given that they can get twice as much generation as the UK, don't you think I was perhaps a little conservative when doubling the figure, converting $1 to £1 and going all the way to 2035? [Note - if you truly believe that PV modules aren't getting cheaper, then I wouldn't read the article.]
The path to US$0.015/kWh solar power, and lower
But all of that aside you may have missed the point, PV (even in the UK) and on-shore wind are already cheaper today than SMR's hope to be in 2035, so unless you are now claiming that RE prices will go up, then SMR's can never match them.
BQSTART
Plus the initial markets for SMRs are Canada and UK, where solar isn't a major option.
BQEND But wind is, and on-shore wind is already cheaper, and off-shore wind is almost at the 2035 SMR target price.
If you are suggesting the UK get in on SMR's early, then of course that means paying the much higher prices for them. What were the industry estimates, that 5-6GW of SMR's need to be sold to get down to HPC prices per MWH?

It has to be said that the UK is certainly not perfect and we have a long way to go, but on the global rankings we are only behind France (75% nuclear) and Sweden (35% nuclear) whereas Germany (of who's coal sector I suspect you're positively spinning) has fallen from 27th place to 29th place.

Experts criticise Germany’s current domestic negotiationson its long-term climate strategy, which is supposedto lay the foundation for the implementation of Germany’spart of the Paris goals. According to the experts, the negotiationshave been dominated and continuously delayed by theself-serving interests of the coal industry and some of theother energy-intensive industries. To climb up the rankingin the coming years, Germany will have to increase its ambitionon sectoral targets for emissions reduction and comeforward with an adequate plan to phase out coal.

The Euan Mearns analysis for 500GWh was for a large amount of gas on tap. http://euanmearns.com/uk-electricity-part-3-wind-and-solar/ Figure 7. 500 GWh of storage would allow gas to fall to 14%, so with solar and wind at 86%. The gas could be bio-gas, but that needs to be reserved for planes, ships and haulage.
BQEND
Ecotricity are looking at bio-gas production, or you can take the wind and PV spill figure Euan gives and get the bio-gas from that as P2G.
Of course the more sensible thing to do would be to add in more RE variety, such as tidal, hydro and perhaps wave (long term). Plus of course there are interconnectors, and the use of off-shore wind (not just on-shore) which I appreciate he suggests are just interchangeable, but of course that's not true, off-shore wind has a more consistent generation (aside from a greater capacity factor) so that would improve things over an on-shore only scenario. [BTW I checked this idea/thought through one of the energy analysts that publish UK generation profiles, for confirmation.]
So the large amount of gas you refer to actually just becomes part of the storage process. And as per this article, economics are now favourable:

Do you have anything in mind when you oppose supporting renewables/nuclear/CCS with a carbon tax?
For example, in the UK, an easier place to decarbonise, how would you balance the intermittency of RE and who would pay?
At $375/kwh for storage (BNEF from 2025) a bare minimum 500GWh would cost $187,500,000,000 plus grid, transmission and land costs.So well north of £200bn by 2025 and it's just one essential extra -it doesn't generate a single watt of electricity and requires massive gas backup.
That simple example is why load following nuclear with renewables (and existing storage) is a fraction of the cost (and carbon footprint) of renewables+ huge storage+gas.
100% RE is not the cheaper option. It is hugely more expensive.
As the late Prof. Mackay said, I'm not pro-nuclear, I'm pro-mathematics.

Lets start with intermittency- Southern Europe, the Southern States and a lot of the developing world has predictable intermittency- when it comes to solar, so storage just has to get people through the night or a few dull days. In other places like the Great Plains, the offshore resource particularly off Europe the wind is predictable- and supplying up to 30% in the UK, and that could and will be 50%.
BQENDYes knowing how intermittent something will be helps you to plan how much extra infrastructure and spending you need to compensate for it.
So if your household have to get into work every day and night and you know the train will only be on time 10.2% of the time (the average yearly capacity factor of solar in the UK) and won't work at night then how much extra do you plan to spend on travel.On top of your season ticket you can buy a bike - not ideal for all seasons but okay for short distances.Knowing how unreliable the trains are you can budget for taxis -they cost massively more (especially as you've paid for the train), tend to be slower and aren't good for the environment.
So yes, all the problems of an intermittent service can be planned for - for a price, both financial and in carbon.

By Rachel Morison7 June 2018, 14:00 GMT+10 ""Forecasters see wind output staying low for at least two weeks Wind generating 4.3% of U.K. electricity on Wednesday
Britain’s gone nine days with almost no wind generation, and forecasts show the calm conditions persisting for another two weeks.
The wind drought has pushed up day-ahead power prices to the highest level for the time of year for at least a decade. Apart from a surge expected around June 14, wind levels are forecast to stay low for the next fortnight, according to The Weather Company.
U.K. turbines can produce about as much power as 12 nuclear reactors when conditions are right. During the “Beast from the East” storm that hit Britain in March, they generated record levels of power and at times provided the biggest share of the nation’s electricity.""
Actually that's nothing exceptional. In the past there have been three-week intervals with virtually nil wind, and two months with low winds. 
On a more general level we now have just under 20GW of wind nameplate capacity, which is two thirds of the typical summer daytime consumption, and may even equal the night consumption sometimes. Yet in spite of this massive deployment, wind output is more typically in the 5GW region. So, even to achieve an average performance equal to fossil fuels, we'd need to deploy four times as much wind kit. Somebody has to pay for all that equipment! 
Then, we have the battery car promoters trying to ban diesels so as to promote sales of their products. Their argument is that battery cars can be recharged from wind energy. -Wait a mo, though, wind energy is struggling to meet normal electricity demand, and you want to add the whole of the UK's transport energy demand to that? Sir, you are not just a dreamer. You are without the capacity to reason.

I don't have any ideological difficulties with nuclear. But energy experts seem to be telling us renewable energy with storage is cheaper and available now.
BQENDI think you're overlooking the hidden costs of some supplies.
Solar is significantly cheaper than wind, but it would be a lot cheaper to have a predominantly wind based power supply than a solar one because solar is more intermittent and has a greater seasonal variation.Accounting for that costs money - and of course has its own carbon footprint.Nuclear is more expensive than wind - but has no intermittency problems at all and requires a much smaller grid.
This is why many countries are opting for nuclear in their low carbon mix.

BQENDIndeed :)

We have to act with what we have not and not get sidetracked by what are all too frequently half measures.
100% RE relies on cheap storage - but even a measly 500GWh of storage for the UK (which would still require massive gas backup - look at the last week of wind) at projected BNEF 2025 prices would cost north of £200bn - and it doesn't generate a single watt of electricity - 
100% RE is still an awful lot of gas - and hideously expensive infrastructure that we will, as you point out, obviously never go for even if we could afford it which we cannot.

This is the problem nuclear faces- it's only customer are national governments, it's a monopsony: unlike alternatives that can be purchased by individuals [like a farmer buying a turbine] through to large investors.Nation states did initially fund all the development of the industry as part of the arms race [and many of the private modular reactors in development are variations on those public funded prototypes].Globally there is one supposedly private new nuclear build-Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant VVER- to built by the Russian state Rosatom / Atomstroyexport [owned by the russian state via different holdings] and even then just 7% is coming from private [russian] money with the rest via state funding.The US being opposed to social investment [outside of military spending welfare for States] in recent decades instead offers less obvious support to both nuclear and coal [and more so in the past.]
The US is the most privatised civil nuclear industry- yet state funding is the main driver of research through the universities, and the only real requirement is to come up with the initial capital with state loan guarantees and tax credits and importantly insurance sweetening private investment.Yet investment in the US is low.

Of the 253 nuclear power reactors originally ordered in the United States from 1953 to 2008, 48 percent were cancelled, 11 percent were prematurely shut down, 14 percent experienced at least a one-year-or-more outage, and 27 percent are operating without having a year-plus outage. Thus, only about one fourth of those ordered, or about half of those completed, are still operating and have proved relatively reliable

So the latest off-shore wind contracts, the 2023 allocation are at £64/MWh in todays monies, whilst RR hope to get the cost of SMR's down to £60/MWh by 2035. They need to sell around 5-6GW of SMR's just to get down to HPC costs (about £100/MWh now).
They also estimate the worldwide market to be 65-85GW, so roughly equal to the generation of existing PV, an amount we could roll out every 3 yrs or so now.
So by 2035, when SMR's fail to deliver, and fail to deliver £60/MWh, expect PV to cost around £30/MWh in the UK, and half that (or less) in sunnier places.
BTW, if you are telling the truth about Tesla, then how come the share price is rising fast, and the shorts are starting to lose their shirts having to buy back shares at high prices.

RE is the future for the US
BQENDWEll it's certainly 'in' the future of the US.
The objective is taking coal and gas 'out' of the future of the US. Renewables are a very useful group of technologies - but they are not the only low carbon technologies - the only scientist saying that all that RE alone is needed had to rely on legal threats (comically withdrawn) against the National Academy of Sciences and all the scientists who pointed out that such as system wasn't viable.
Also, there's a world of difference between technically possible and feasible.None of Jacobsen's proposals would have worked without a federal carbon tax.
That's the point.RE requires a CTax just as much as nuclear and, of course, CCS.
Furthermore, renewables are simply a collective noun loosely describing a collection of generally low carbon technologies, each of which is of a different utility and each of which require a different amount of external technology to make it work coherently.They have their own external costs, weaknesses and strengths.
BQSTART
some utilities are already ignoring his position and buying RE instead of expensive coal/nuclear:-
BQENDTrumping Coal and Nuclear together! - What a biased grouping - it neatly make my point.

BQSTART

BQEND
The fact remains that renewables, nuclear and CCS cannot grow or even exist
 in the scale required solely on a commercial level without a comprehensive carbon tax.
This is also the position of climate scientists.
So the ideological, unscientific attacks on specific low carbon technologies are highly damaging. 
The objective is to cut emissions.
We will need all the technologies to do that.

The Great American Fracking Bubble
BQSTART
An Industry Built on Debt Roughly a decade after McClendon’s rise, the Wall Street Journal reported that “energy companies [since 2007] have spent $280 billion more than they generated from operations on shale investments, according to advisory firm Evercore ISI.” 
As a whole, the American fracking experiment has been a financial disaster for many of its investors, who have been plagued by the industry’s heavy borrowing, low returns, and bankruptcies, and the path to becoming profitable is lined with significant potential hurdles. Up to this point, the industry has been drilling the “sweet spots” in the country’s major shale formations, reaching the easiest and most valuable oil first.
But at the same time energy companies are borrowing more money to drill more wells, the sweet spots are drying up, creating a Catch-22 as more drilling drives more debt.
BQEND
Plus, of course, US frack gas is propped up by shale oil, but it will only take a small reduction in oil demand (from the rollout of EV's) to knock the crude price down slightly, and that will wipe out the industries with the highest abstraction costs first, putting US shale and Canadian oil sands right in the cross-hairs.

Main customer of Arizona coal plant goes green, ignoring Interior Department
BQSTART
The Trump administration has been waging a broad effort to keep aging coal and nuclear plants from retirement, arguing that their closure would constitute a threat to national energy security. 
On Friday, the board of the Central Arizona Project (CAP), a major electricity consumer that supplies water to a large swath of Arizona, voted to sign a 20-year agreement to buy power from a solar project and also agreed to a five-year power deal with utility Salt River Project for electricity from a variety of sources.
The vote came despite a plea from the head of Interior’s Bureau of Reclamation, who last Friday wrote to board members to say that a 1968 law gives Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke power to require the CAP to buy energy from the Navajo Generating Station, or NGS, a 2,250-MW coal-fired power plant that is scheduled to close in 2019.

America Should Invest In Distributed Renewable Energy Instead Of Natural Gas Plants, Finds RMI Report
BQSTART
Half of all existing conventional electricity generating plants in the US will need to be replaced by 2030 as they reach the end of their useful life. The question is, what should they be replaced with? The Rocky Mountain Institute has studied this question and concluded that investing in distributed renewable energy makes the most economic sense. 
RMI says, “US electricity generators may be committing their customers and investors to as much as $1 trillion in future investment and fuel costs through 2030 as they rush to build new gas-fired power plants. Yet advances in renewable energy and distributed energy resources (DERs) offer lower rates and emissions-free energy while delivering all the grid reliability services that new power plants can.”
If the proposed natural gas facilities get built, they will eat up $480 billion in fuel costs and pump 5 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the air through 2030. By 2050, total emissions will amount to 16 billion tons. Renewables, which have no fuel costs and no carbon emissions, should be a no-brainer. That they are not is an indication of how dysfunctional US energy policy is at the present time.

David MacKay had a great lead into this issue and too few seem to notice. (I am so pro-math too.)
BQEND
Lets start with intermittency- Southern Europe, the Southern States and a lot of the developing world has predictable intermittency- when it comes to solar, so storage just has to get people through the night or a few dull days.In other places like the Great Plains, the offshore resource particularly off Europe the wind is predictable- and supplying up to 30% in the UK, and that could and will be 50%.pretty well all studies have no problem with 50% or even 80% renewables- the last 20% is very tricky and something that will need to be dealt with after 2050.
Nuclear has its supply problems-- new nuclear can vary output reasonably fast to cope with the demand spike which can be twice as much as the off peak. Canada did a whole study on the subject- and eventually decided the best option was to change consumer habits so they evened out demand. But EVs could be the saviour.
In the UK with lower electricity consumption than the US the current off peak period if ran at capacity could supply 30% of transport without any new generation- that is 10 million vehicles. And a complete electrification of transport only increases demand by 40%. Switching from fossil fuels for heating to efficient heat pumps is just another 10% .
Nuclear could be a future with an electric economy.
By 2050 oil will certainly be in decline- perhaps sooner. why use 10 kWh of gas to move a car 10 miles or less when a similar EV will move 40 miles? Batteries don't have to have the same energy density as petrol or diesel- and when it comes to weight you can lose the engine, gear box, fuel and tank and 3/4 of the energy lost in heat.With 300 mile range cars now that can be charged in 20 min and just 10-20% heavier any improvement in battery density will just make cars cheaper. i.e. small city cars with 80 mile range.sometime after 2030 it will be difficult to find a ICv, and a problem finding a station to sell you gas. You can of course run a horse years after cars arrived but feeding them or looking after them especially in cities is expensive and specialist.
Trains, autos, heating, etc does not care where the electricity comes from - but the system will need to be robust and do more work than it has in the past. Of course the infrastructure of roads in the US was pretty rubbish and a huge investment in the interstate system was required. In the new industrial revolution grid infrastructure will also need upgrading, just as blacksmiths and livery stables had to change and build a new auto infrastructure.The challenge to replace fossil fuels is huge- and it would be huge if we chose nuclear or renewables. The advantage renewables have over nuclear is speed and price: you can produce millions of units in factories.China over 5 -7 years produced 150 GW of solar for domestic generation and 200 GW of wind. it also had plans for 54 GW of new nuclear. this is a country with no opposition movement, no problems with cash, and dedicated to being a global leader- yet it struggles to complete and get on line its new nuclear. 
It is quite difficult to comprehend the scale of mass production and consumption- 4 billion tonnes of coal is staggering, that is 11 million tonnes of a coal a day- the equivalent of digging out two Great pyramids of Giza a day, piling it into a furnace and then dumping the ash and starting again the next day.
In Europe offshore wind plans and developments are ambitious- and prices plummeting with the latest wave of projects coming in cheaper than fossil fuels. 8 MW, and the 12 MW and 16 MW giants to drive down cost- as well as cheaper methods to build and maintain them. The same advances that offshore oil went through and similar investment.

Solar is significantly cheaper than wind, but it would be a lot cheaper to have a predominantly wind based power supply than a solar one because solar is more intermittent and has a greater seasonal variation. Accounting for that costs money - and of course has its own carbon footprint. Nuclear is more expensive than wind - but has no intermittency problems at all and requires a much smaller grid. 
This is why many countries are opting for nuclear in their low carbon mix.

A long time ago in a land far far away, I was working for a large utility in the south of the US that fired gas essentially for all their MW. They had oil backup (#6 nasty oil) and zero coal plants. Back in the 70s, energy growth was enormous and electricity demand was increasing about 7% a year in a lot of markets including the one I was in. The oil companies at that time informed the utilities that they could not supply natural gas in sufficient quantities past the late 80s. (this was before LNG stuff and finding a bunch more natural gas off shore.) So, the word was out…build coal plants and nuclear. The utility I was working for even started coal conversion…replacing boilers on their gas fired plants. No utility would fire coal if natural gas is available because coal plants are much harder to maintain and just nasty overall. This is why coal took off in the US…and nuclear sort of--exploding costs were the real issue. When the oil shocks hit, the electricity growth went negative for a bit and then only increased slowly. No need for more plants and many nukes got cancelled..as did many coal plants. This was all before the TMI accident. The nuclear industry was on the way out for several years before TMI. Energy efficient A/C and many other home and office products have kept growth low.
The fossil fuel industry still holds sway over Washington with their lobbying…so, the Republicans may have given lip service to nuclear, but never really supported it in any fashion. Some local governments have put in support for nuke plants…and the natural gas industry has sued as a result. This is one symptom of the US energy plan…which is a plan to ensure there is never a plan and long-term means “next quarter.”

The completion date for those reactors is 2034 and the huge undertaking of the UK decarbonising is a programme through 2050.

BQENDYou are confused - perhaps you should stop getting your climate misinformation from the Daily Mail.
We have to have to increase efficiency and that means heat pumps and insulation.
We also have to cut the emissions from our supply chains and that means ending your precious LNG imports of fracced gas from the Americas and Qatar etc.
To do that then we need domestic gas until we can come off gas - biogas will help but even the most optimistic projections are only biogas can only be 30% of domestic which is 35% of demand so at best circa 10% overall.

US utilities are shutting reactors fast too, even those with years of their operating licences yet to run. In America’s deregulated energy markets, nuclear cannot compete. Last week President Trump called for the utilities to suspend closures, citing national energy security. He may resort to the law to get his way, but even Trump is not demanding new reactors.
BQENDEven Trump is not demanding new reactors?
is this the mantra of the fracced gas apologists.
The pressure placed on the commercial renewables and nuclear sector from the fracced gas industry is a reason to apply a carbon tax -.
In the UK we are coming off coal because we applied an additional carbon tax over and above the all too modest EU tax.It works.
We are making progress.
But instead of paying anything more than lip service on the need for a carbon tax to support all low carbon supplies, pundits like Pearce, Nuccitelli and Vaughan use a lack of it to attack some of the best low carbon energy technologies we have purely out of ideology.It is perverse - It's almost like AGW is the lesser consideration.

Instead of battery driven cars, I would prefer a hydrogen powered car or if feasible, fuel cell cars. Long term it would be much better than silly batteries. That last one is tough, but would be nice if costs could be brought down. In the US, we should have put in lots of electric rail systems...but stupidity has been the prime driver of energy and transportation policy essentially forever.
BQENDI like the idea of a hydrogen infrastructure- it has a lot going for it, but I think the EV has the edge.
Most (95%) of our hydrogen comes from natural gas and whilst biogas and electrolysers can help they won't really do the job at a scale that could dominate the market unless we start building VHT nuclear reactors to produce hydrogen by cracking water.
It's entirely feasible and of course the side effect is electricity production rather then electrolyser consumption but that would take decades to come to scale.
Batteries are easier.

The first salvo came via a Forbes article written by Michael Shellenberger, who’s running a doomed campaign for California governor and really loves nuclear power. Shellenberger’s critique focused on the problem of potential waste at the end of a solar panel lifespan when the modules must be disposed or recycled. It’s a somewhat ironic concern from a proponent of nuclear power, which has a rather bigger toxic waste problem.
About 80% of a solar panel module can be recycled, but some portions cannot, and create potentially hazardous waste due to the presence of metals like cadmium and lead. The Electric Power Research Institute notes that long-term storage of used panels until recycling technologies become available may be the best option for dealing with this waste stream. Ultimately, it’s an issue that will need to be addressed as solar panels become more widespread and reach the end of their 25-plus year lifespan, much like the issue of nuclear waste. But it’s an issue that we should be able to resolve with smart policies and technologies.
It’s also not a big near-term concern, unlike the urgent need to deploy low-carbon energy, or an immediate pollution problem like for example the environmental crises that result when oil rigs fail or coal barges sink into rivers.
#BREAKING VIDEO: Sinking barge spilling coal into the Monongahela River in PennsylvaniaVideo via WTAE-TV pic.twitter.com/zzeI0RZWeL
Shellenberger also raised concerns about the possibility “that cadmium can be washed out of solar modules by rainwater.” But that’s only a problem for broken panels, which are relatively rare except perhaps in the wake a natural disaster like a hurricane or earthquake. In a disaster area, leaching of metals from some broken solar panels is the least of a city’s problems.
In short, it’s valid to note that end-of-life solar panel recycling and disposal is an issue that we’ll have to address smartly, but unlike climate change, it’s not a big or urgent concern. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is planning to order grid operators to buy electricity from struggling coal power plants to extend their lives. This is the latest in the administration’s misguided campaign to save the dying coal industry, which can no longer compete in the free market against cheaper, cleaner alternatives. As a result, coal power plants have continued to shut down at a rapid rate. Those coal plants pose a much greater threat of pollution, including from heavy metals.
I eagerly await the administration’s regulations protecting pagers, fax machines, and Blockbuster. https://t.co/ykLJHT4OvK
In the New York Times, conservative opinion columnist Bret Stephens devoted an editorial last week to attacking Tesla specifically, and electric cars in general. There are valid reasons to criticize Tesla – the company regularly falls short of its ambitious production goals – but Stephens’ piece went far beyond what’s fair. For example, it called the Tesla Model 3 “a lemon” because Consumer Reports initially did not recommend the vehicle due primarily to issues with braking distance during its tests. Within about a week, Tesla issued a software update to correct the braking problem, and the Model 3 earned its Consumer Reports recommendation. Worse yet, Stephens declared that gasoline is the fuel of the future:
The terrible idea is that electric cars are the wave of the future, at least for the mass market. Gasoline has advantages in energy density, cost, infrastructure and transportability that electricity doesn’t and won’t for decades.
That’s equivalentt to saying in 1910 that horses have advantages over automobiles, and will continue to dominate the transportation market. The experts disagree. The International Energy Agency estimated that global electric vehicle ownership increased 54% from 2016 to 2017, to 3.1 million EVs, and projects that number will increase 40-fold to 125 million by 2030. Virtually every major automaker is developing electric cars. GM plans to launch 20 new all-electric models by 2023 and the company “believes in an all-electric future.” Nissan plans to launch 8 new all-electric models by 2020 and hopes to sell 1 million EVs per year by that date.
As for the infrastructure disadvantage, California, New York, and New Jersey are spending a combined $1.3bn on EV charging to address that problem. But more than 80% of EV charging happens at home. The Nissan Leaf and Chevrolet Bolt have 150- and 200-mile ranges, respectively, and the average American only drives 30 miles per day. An MIT study in 2016 found that EVs with a 74-mile range could meet 87% of American car owners’ needs with only overnight charging at home; Nissan and GM have doubled and nearly tripled that range. Infrastructure is no longer a big obstacle to EV adoption for many people.
Costs are difficult to compare; while electric cars receive federal and state rebates, fossil fuels receive tremendous subsidies, particularly in the form of deferred climate change costs. Recent research suggests that the ‘social cost of carbon’ is around $200 per ton, which equates to an effective subsidy of close to $2 per gallon of gasoline. Doing an apples-to-apples comparison by either accounting for current fuel prices and federal tax EV credits, or excluding tax credits but adding $2 per gallon to fuel costs, electric vehicles already have similar lifetime costs to comparable gasoline-powered sedans. And due to improving battery technology, the price per mile of EV range is falling rapidly.
The Trump administration is working on behalf of the fossil fuel industry to stall the transition to electric cars, advancing regulations that will freeze fuel efficiency requirements. However, California will be taking the Trump and Pruitt EPA to court in order to preserve the state’s ability to set its own vehicle pollution standards.
In a world where leaders in every country outside America accept the reality of dangerous human-caused climate change, these clean technologies are the future.

The test uses a beam of light to analyse the exhaust plume of a car as it passes and automatic number plate recognition to link the measurement to a specific model. More than 370,000 such measurements taken in the UK, France and other countries have been compiled into new rating system called The Real Urban Emissions Initiative (True) and made available to the public on Wednesday.
Volkswagen was exposed as cheating emissions tests in September 2015. But, without breaking the letter of the law, almost all car manufacturers were producing diesels that emitted far more in real-world driving conditions than in official lab-based tests. This was done by optimising vehicles to pass standardised tests, but the beam test is conducted as cars pass and so cannot be manipulated.
The True analysis shows that new diesel models released in 2016 were still on average five over times above the EU’s official baseline limit of 0.08mg of nitrogen oxides (NOx) per kilometre. The 2017 models were a little cleaner, but still nearly four times over. 
NOx pollution is at illegally high levels in numerous EU nations. It is estimated to cause 23,500 early deaths a year in the UK, where government plans to cut pollution have been repeatedly ruled so inadequate as to be illegal. Separate research published on Wednesday calculates that diesel cars and vans, which make up less than half the UK’s fleet, cause 88% of the health damage from light vehicles. 
The beam tests are continuing and will be able to single out highly polluting models in future. “I see this remote sensing mostly as a screening tool, to see which vehicle models behave suspiciously,” said Peter Mock, at the International Council on Clean Transportation which produced the True rating in partnership with the FIA Foundation and other groups. 
Those models highlighted as highly polluting could then be tested by putting a portable emissions measuring system (Pems) on a car, which is more accurate but also much more expensive. Diesel cars shown by the True data to emit far more NOx than the official baseline when on the road included two-litre Fiat Chrysler models – 18 times more – and 1.6-litre Renault Nissan models – 14 times more – though the cars passed legally required tests.
“If I was a customer, I would look at these figures at the moment and have to conclude I should not buy a diesel car,” Mock said, noting that the petrol versions are far cleaner. “Even Euro 6 [the most recent standard] diesel vehicles are not performing well at the moment so pretty much all of them should not have access to city centres.”
Greg Archer, at campaign group Transport &amp; Environment, which is part of the True initiative, said: “The True rating exposes the legacy of dieselgate – tens of millions of dirty diesels that are still on the roads producing the toxic smog we daily breathe. It identifies the worst performing models and regulators must act to require carmakers to clean these up.”
The True rating is a “brilliant” screening tool and also good at monitoring pollution from cars as they get older and enter the used car market, said Nick Molden, chief executive of Emissions Analytics, which performs 300-400 Pems tests every year on new car models and publishes another rating system called the Equa index.
But Molden cautioned that the True rating system, which averages the same models across several years, will not show when the latest model has radically cut its pollution. He cites the example of a Mercedes model that improved significantly between 2014 and 2017: “It went from quite dirty to really quite clean.”
Since September 2017, new cars have had to pass a road-based test, but an EU compromise with the industry means emissions can still legally be double the baseline limit. Molden said car manufacturers are now very wary of being caught launching cars that fail emissions tests and some new diesel models are very clean, sometimes 50% below the baseline.
Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers &amp; Traders, said: “Thanks to massive investment, each generation of vehicle is more advanced than the last, with significantly lower pollutant emissions. This is acknowledged by the [True] report, and consumers can be assured that new cars on sale today are the cleanest ever and fully compliant with EU emissions standards.”
The new analysis of the health impact of diesel in the UK was conducted by experts at the University of Oxford and University of Bath in advance of Clean Air day 2018 on 21 June. They used data on the number of vehicles and mileage, along with government estimates of the harm caused by pollution.
The researchers found the health damage from diesel vehicle emissions are about 20 times greater than from electric vehicles and five times more than petrol vehicles. Christian Brand, at the University of Oxford, said: “Cars and vans are responsible for 10,000 early deaths each year, and diesel vehicles are the main problem unfortunately.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/06/impossible-to-cheat-emissions-tests-show-almost-all-new-diesels-still-dirty

Farmer and former Nationals leader John Anderson said this week that while the drought was the worst he had experienced, it was not unprecedented.
He told the Financial Review farming records for his property, which had been in his family for more than a century, showed droughts of equal severity between 1902 and 1904 and again in 1940.
“I’m not a climate change denier but I would be very wary about using this as a political device,” he said. 
The deputy prime minister and Nationals leader, Michael McCormack, also said: “I’m a believer that the climate is always changing and it’s been changing since Moses was a boy.”
Verity Morgan-Schmidt is from a multigeneration farming family in Western Australia and is CEO of Farmers for Climate Action.
She said the comments were “a disservice to many of our farmers who are already facing the reality of climate change”.
“My family has been on properties out in Western Australia for over 100 years. We can say this has well and truly moved beyond natural cyclical patterns,” she said.
“The idea that we could be accused of playing politics by accepting reality is a bitter pill to swallow. The science is clear. Climate change is increasing the severity of extreme weather events that include drought.
“The vast majority of farmers and National party voters that we speak to are growing increasingly frustrated at the lack of action on climate change at a federal level.”
The south-east of Australia has experienced record high temperatures this year during an unseasonably dry and hot autumn, prompting fire bans and warnings from authorities.
In its latest winter outlook, the Bureau of Meteorology is forecasting warmer and drier than average conditions across large parts of the country.
Richie Merzian, the Australia Institute’s climate and energy program director, said: “There is a well-established link between climate change and the frequency and harshness of droughts in Australia.”
In its latest drought statement, the Bureau of Meteorology listed May 2018 as the third-driest May on record.
The Climate Council has identified an 11% decline in the growing-season rainfall (April–October) in south-east Australia since the mid-90s, the period including the millennium drought. 
It has highlighted “particularly strong drying trends” in south and southwestern Australia in the months of May and July and says it is likely climate change is making drought worse in both south-east and south-west Australia, some of the most productive farmland in the country.
“The bottom line is climate change is making weather patterns more extreme and unpredictable and that has serious consequences for Australia’s agriculture production,” the Climate Council’s research director and acting CEO, Martin Rice, said.
“In southern Australia we are seeing the influence of climate change and drought. We’re seeing less cool season rainfall and that’s having an impact on agriculture.
Rice said hotter than average conditions and heatwave conditions in northern parts of New South Wales were leading to drier conditions and there had been an “abject failure” in climate policy at a federal level. 
“Hot temperatures bring dry conditions and we can expect to see an increase in drought if we don’t reduce emissions,” he said.
“Farmers generally are on the frontline of climate change and they are experiencing worsening extreme weather events, particularly heat-related events and that has an impact on their business.” 
The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, who is touring drought-affected regions, and the agriculture minister, David Littleproud, have acknowledged climate change is a factor.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/06/national-party-comments-on-drought-and-climate-a-disservice-to-farmers

The above is completely wrong. The range of sea level rise projected for this century is about 0.2 meters to 2.0 meters (0.66 to 6.6 feet) from multiple sources. Cherry picking the low values is just anti-science.
 Sea level increases predominantly due to land ice melting and thermal expansion. There has to be a forcing to cause sea level rise and there is no natural forcing that cause sea level to rise 8 inches all the time. Sea levels were dropping from the Medieval warm period until circa 1880 and have risen due to WMGHGs. Since the sun has been cooling for decades, there is no natural forcing to cause the sea level increases. (if you really think there is a ""natural"" rise in sea levels...pony up the forcing. 
Two years of data? Take a statistics course. Minimum data set for climate change and sea level changes are much longer. Ocean oscillations exchange heat with the atmosphere causing short term variation...the long-term trend. And sea level has not stopped for the last two years anyhow. 
Sea level rise just happens to be direct indication of the planet warming. Until it stops rising, the heat is on.

""Jakobshavn is one of the fastest moving glaciers, flowing at its terminus at speeds that used to be around 20 metres (66 ft) per day[11] but are currently over 45 metres (150 ft) per day when averaged annually, with summer speeds even higher.[12] The speed of Jakobshavn Glacier varied between 5,700 and 12,600 metres (18,700 and 41,300 ft) per year between 1992 and 2003.[1] The ice stream's speed-up and near-doubling of ice flow from land into the ocean has increased the rate of sea level rise by about 0.06 millimetres (0.0024 in) per year, or roughly 4 percent of the 20th century rate of sea level rise.[13] Jakobshavn Isbrae, retreated 30 km (19 mi) from 1850–1964, followed by a stationary front for 35 years. Jakobshavn has the highest mass flux of any glacier draining the Greenland Ice Sheet. The glacier terminus region also had a consistent velocity of 20 metres (66 ft) per day (maximum of 26 metres (85 ft) per day in the glacier center), from season to season and year to year, the glacier seemed to be in balance from 1955-1985.[14] After 1997 the glacier began to accelerate and thin rapidly, reaching an average velocity of 34 metres (112 ft) per day in the terminus region. It also thinned at a rate of up to 15 metres (49 ft) per year and retreated 5 km (3.1 mi) in six years. Jakobshavn has afterwards slowed to near its pre-1997 speed, with the terminus retreat still occurring. On Jakobshavn the acceleration began at the calving front and spread up-glacier 20 km (12 mi) in 1997 and up to 55 km (34 mi) inland by 2003.[1][15] The position of this calving front, or terminus, fluctuated by 2.5 km (1.6 mi) around its annual mean position between 1950 and 1996.[16] "" [Wiki, with footnotes referring to APRS, Annals of Glaciology, Science and NASA]', u'recommendation_count': u'2', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1528545333000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'3684556', u'in_reply_to': u'116752299', u'id': u'116777560', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'chrisbrown', u'text': u'600 meters in a year.

The glacier at Jakobshavn has been calving at its front since at least the turn of the 19th 20th century and worrying as this may be it is not a world wide problem. Other places you mentioned (particularly Antarctica) are more of a threat than ice loss from Greenland. 
What is becoming irreversible is the changes to weather patterns world wide. Increased meltwater from outlet glaciers seems to be affecting the ocean currents around Greenland, in particular the Labrador Current and the Gulf Stream. Shifting water currents work together with upper air currents and reinforce each other. This seems to be having knock-on effects in places as far inland as the Czech Republic. They are apparently suffering from a severe drought this year. This can only be explained by the combination of low precipitation and warm weather in the last winter and the current dry spring. How much such weather ""events"" are the result of shifts in upper air patterns, and ultimately, ice loss in the Arctic, is hard to determine. More and more climatologists are finding the ""fingerprint"" of global warming on local weather extremes.

While generally all oceans are rising we may be thinking a reduction in ocean level in one particular area says all is normal. But stream flow disruption can have effects which do produce a observed decrease in ocean level at shore at times., As well as a inordinate or beyond the norm increase in a local area.
The actual flows of deep water stream in the ocean are affected by things like salinity water temperature contrast and some other specifics. A increase and/or decrease may affect local weather and as well shore line increase or decrease. But these are local affects not speaking of a global trend.The deniers amongst us will almost certain point to this fact as a proof of lack of global warming. AS they point to a decrease in winter temperatures in areas like the Northeastern US as being that as well.Both can be a result of stream disruption and produce local affects which are not the norm.
This bares stating, as always those who deny will point to statistical data of a selective sorts pointing to this or that area, not seeing a increase in ocean level.

You are wrong on what Hansen projected in 1988 paper. The were no scenarios that projected 0.5c/decade surface air temp increases.
Scenario A assumed 1.5%/year increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration based on the keeling curve…not 1.5% increase in carbon emissions. 
Since the planet has warmed about 0.2 to 0.25C per decade, Hansen essentially nailed it within the error bars.And the graphs in this link are accurate:
http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/climate-model-projections-compared-to-observations 
The sea level rise has been on the high end of projections…as seen here: 
https://www.skepticalscience.com/sea-level-rise-predictions-intermediate.htm
And you arel not putting up what the forcing is causing the SATs to increase, ocean levels to increase, ocean temperatures to increase when the sun has been cooling for decades—the planet should not be warming at all since the modern max. the WMGHG forcing is +2.9W/m^2.

Sharply rising temperatures, for one. Accelerated sea-level rise, for another. Increased extreme weather, for a third.
The raison d'être of the IPCC was the supposed threat of rapid, drastic, damaging, ""greenhouse"" warming. Hansen et al 1988 (published just before the IPCC was created) predicted that if GHG emissions rose 1.5%/year temperatures would rise 0.5°C/decade. (That was their ""Scenario A."") Instead CO2 emissions rose nearly 2%/year, yet we only got about 1/4 as much warming as they predicted (at most 1/3, depending on whose numbers you use).
Sea-level vs. CO2 -- do you understand graphs?1. At two especially high-quality measurement sites, and2. Everywhere elseAs you can see, sea-level rise hasn't measurably accelerated in nine decades.
Extreme weather -- do you understand graphs?1. Hurricanes & tropical cyclones2. TornadoesAs you can see, hurricanes & tropical cyclones have no clear trend, and strong tornadoes have noticeably decreased.

The academic literature is not immune, either. For example, do you remember the huge media splash about Sallenger's 2012 Nature paper, about a ""hotspot"" of accelerated sea-level rise along the U.S. Atlantic Coast, from Beaufort, NC north, especially at New York City?
It turns out that there was no sustained acceleration in rate of sea-level rise, only multidecadal fluctuations. The oceans are full of water, and they slowly SLOSH. So it's not surprising that if you pick short enough intervals and small enough regions you can find temporary localized increases and decreases. That's all Sallenger did.
Here's what sea-level has done at NYC since then:
http://sealevel.info/8518750_The_Battery_2010-2016.png
Some ""hot spot,"" eh? ��
However, Guy, you are mistaken in your belief that ""sea level rises were much faster 150 years ago before AGW."" We have actual measurement records extending that far back (including New York City), and they do not show that. Some of them show a linear trend, and some show a very slight acceleration, but none that I am aware of show sea-level rise greatly decelerating.
The largest acceleration seen in a long, high quality measurement record is from Brest, France (PSMSL gauge #1), but it does not support the notion that CO2 drives sea-level rise.
Between 1850 and 1930 CO2 levels rose less than 8%. That was accompanied by a slight but measurable acceleration in sea-level rise, in some places. The acceleration was most apparent at Brest, where sea-level rose at 0 (zero) mm/yr in the 1800s, but 1.5 mm/yr (6""/century) since then.
Since 1930 CO2 levels have risen another 32%. That 4× greater increase in CO2 forcing was accompanied by no measurable acceleration in sea-level rise.

It is affected by many factors, but we know with certainty that CO2 is not one of them, or at least that it is not an important one. We know that fact because, globally, sea-level is rising no faster now, with CO2 levels above 400 ppmv, than it was nine decades or more ago, with CO2 levels below 310 ppmv.
Here are a couple of particularly long, high quality, measurement records, from tectonically stable sites, with very little vertical land motion, and very typical trends, on opposite sides of the globe, showing sea-level juxtaposed with CO2 level:
http://sealevel.info/120-022_Wismar_and_1612340_Honolulu_vs_CO2_annot1.png
As you can see, the large increase in CO2 level caused no noticeable acceleration in sea-level rise. (BTW, if you don't know how to recognize ""acceleration"" (or its lack!) in a graph, this little primer should help.)
Every long, high-quality sea-level measurement record shows the same lack of acceleration since 1920s or before. Here are many more graphs (click on the thumbnails to see big versions & details about each site):

Sea level is rising in some places, and falling in others, because the global trend is so slow that in many places it is outpaced by vertical land motion.

The truth is that the various studies cannot even agree about whether Antarctica is gaining or losing ice.
Based on CryoSat, McMillan (2014) found Antarctica is losing 79 to 241 Gt/yr of ice, though that was based on only 3 years of data.
Based on GRACE, Shepherd (2012) concluded that Antarctica ice mass change since 1992 has averaged -71 ±83 Gt/yr, which means they couldn't tell whether it's actually gaining or losing ice mass.
Based on ICESat and ERS, Zwally et al (2015) found that Antarctica is GAINING ice (albeit at a glacially show rate).
Here's an earlier (2012) video of NASA's Jay Zwally discussing ERS & ICESat measurements:
https://vimeo.com/46429608
What's more, 130 Gt of ice loss per year is completely negligible.
That amount of ice loss would cause only 1.4 inches of sea-level rise per CENTURY.
What's more, describing apparent fluctuations in ice mass flux as a constant acceleration (""44Gt/y2"") is nonsense. The reality is that GHG forcings have been increasing substantially for 2/3 of a century, and at nearly the current rate for about forty years, but if all that CO2 and those other GHGs have had any effect on ice sheet mass flux the effect has been too tiny to detect in sea-level trends, because sea-level rise hasn't measurably accelerated in nine decades.
Sea-level is rising no faster now than it was when CO2 levels were 100 ppmv lower. Every long, high-quality sea-level measurement record shows same lack of acceleration since 1920s or before. Here are some graphs (click on the thumbnails to see big versions & details about each site):

What's more, GRACE (may it Rest In Peace) didn't even actually measure ice. It measured only gravity. When magma shifts as the Earth's crust rises or sinks, perhaps due to changes in the loads upon it, if affects the Earth's gravity field just like ice accumulating or diminishing does. GRACE can't tell the difference. 
So the GRACE-based studies must adjust their gravity measurements to account for GIA. Unfortunately, GIA/PGR is not reliably measurable, especially beneath ice sheets. So they use model-derived estimates of what they think GIA probably should be.
Of course, the altimetry-based studies are also affected by GIA, but much less so than GRACE, because rock is nearly 3x as dense as ice. So vertical land motion affects gravity readings much more than it affects altimetry readings, and errors estimating GIA corrupt GRACE-based studies 3x as much as they corrupt altimetry-based studies. (OTOH, the altimeters also have challenges due to varying snow and ice densities, which don't affect GRACE.)
And, guess what? It is my understanding that GRACE did not actually measure a declining Antarctic gravity field, from diminishing ice mass. It actually measured a (slightly) increasing gravity field, so all of the ice mass loss ""measured"" by GRACE was actually due to the calculated GIA adjustments.

They aren't ""satellite data,"" and they're not ""cherry-picked.""
They aren't from an ""unqualified denial blogger,"" either. The graphs are from NOAA & PSMSL data, using tools on my sealevel.info site. The tools & data are all free and publicly available, for anyone to use.
As for Nerem et al, 2018, it sounds like you haven't read it. They claimed to have found ""acceleration"" in the satellite altimetry SL data. But the ""acceleration"" wasn't an increase in the rate of sea-level rise (SLR). Instead, it was created by slowing the rate of SLR ""measured"" by Topex-Poseidon in the distant past (pre-2003), thereby creating appearance of acceleration when early Topex data is compared to newer data (though the new Jason-3 measurements show little SLR, so far).
(That drastic revision of Topex measurements also lowered the average rate from the previously reported 3.4 mm/yr to 3.1 mm/yr.) 
What such revisions prove is how malleable and unreliable satellite altimetry ""measurements"" of SL are, compared to coastal data. Trustworthy measurements don't require revision and correction long after they've been collected!
Satellite altimetry data has many problems. Most obviously, satellites measure SL in the wrong place. They can't measure SL at the coasts, where it matters.
Also, satellite measurement records are very short. Their longest single-instrument record is only about a decade. Some coastal measurement records are over 1.5 centuries long!
One of the major groups working with satellite altimetry is at the University of Colorado. Look how changes in how they process and adjust the data increased the rate of SLR they report (h/t Steve Case):
http://sealevel.info/U_CO_SLR_rel2_vs_rel1p2_SteveCase.png
That's 2 dramatically different interpretations of the same measurement data by the same U.S. group from the same satellite radar altimeters! If it doesn't smell fishy to you, you need to have your nose examined.
Here's an even more dramatic example, from Europe. Envisat measured sea-level by satellite altimetry for ten years. Here are 2 different interpretations of the same measurement data by the same European group from the same satellite:
http://sealevel.info/2061wtl.jpg
The small graph is the original version, showing 0.76 mm/yr (and it would have been even less if they hadn't omitted the 1st 18 months of data).
The large one is the ""corrected"" version, showing 2.33 mm/yr SLR.
After 10 years of collecting and reporting data they discovered a problem, the correction of which approximately tripled ""measured"" rate of SLR!
So why is satellite altimetry data so poor?
There are many issues, but a major one is difficulty determining exactly where the satellites are, and how their orbits change, with sufficient accuracy. Unlike tide gauges, satellites aren't referenced to geodetic markers.
In 2011 NASA proposed a new satellite mission called the Geodetic Reference Antenna in SPace (GRASP), to address that problem. The proposal and implications for measuring sea-level were discussed here. The Europeans are apparently considering a similar mission (E-GRASP). But none of those proposed missions have flown.
Here is a discussion of the challenges of measuring sea-level via satellite altimetry:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gmW9GEUYvA#t=17m37s
So, given the high quality and long duration of coastal measurements, and the low quality and short duration of the satellite measurements, why would anyone ignore the former in favor of the latter? That's not just cherry-picking, it's picking the rotten, wormy cherries!
When people do that it's a sign of bias: picking studies which confirm their prejudices, and ignoring contrary evidence. You see the same sort of behavior when people cite GRACE studies and ignore ICESat & ERS, w/r/t Antarctica ice mass balance.

A paper worth looking at is -
""A human-induced hothouse climate?"" - Kidder & Worsley, 2011
Here's a key quote from the Conclusions:
""The likely cool greenhouse in which about half of Antarctica is still ice-covered means devastation from the tens of meters sea level is likely to rise (e.g., Ward, 2010), and poleward shifting of warm climate belts.""
So the appropriate term for what's likely to happen is a 'cool greenhouse', which sounds harmless, but is not.
It's a very interesting paper.
How quickly?
Another quote:
""a cool greenhouse seems imminent within perhaps a century or two.""
However, although those conditions could set in within that time, the process of melting half of the ice on Antarctica would take around 1000 years.
Meanwhile the
""poleward shifting of warm climate belts.""
means that the equatorial regions will become increasingly inhospitable - but over time, not in a couple of years.
A possible comparison is the PETM, around 56 million years

We live on ""planet water"" to the extent that fucking with CO2 (not a very strong climate gass) makes ""planet water"" to double the sensitivity just by the little water we have inside the atmosphere. And after that we notice that water in white form react too - and lower the albedo.

People are always talking about fears of the Gulfstream shutting down and making us cold. Here is something to ponder - if the water cooling system of the planet breaks down and the tropics contain all the heat down where it is collected facing the heat source (the sun) - that is a problem too - called overheating. 
This is before we ponder the energy exchanged in a typical storm just from the latent heat exchange involved, from the fact that we sustain water both as gas, liquid and solid state on this water planet.

Now - a standard deviation being wider than the mean estimate does imply a probability for I. E. Antarctica adding mass - but that is really low. 
If you look at current sea-level calculations - it is thermal expansion that is the culprit. 
All measurements and estimates comes with an estimation of prcission. Even high-precision laser altemitry has its problems - because one does not a priori know the density surface it bounces back from (In a perfect world it should be tuned to bounce off the one year firn layer to make it easier to ponder) 
You are also right in Grace measuring gravity - but you will get into some trouble explaining the seasonal mass-balance signal on ""seasonal mantle-fluxes"" as you imply - because in that case Grace would see similar seasonal mantle-movement also outside of glaciated areas, do you not agree? 
You are right - all measurements are modeled all the way down - exactly because of all the things you mention. 
(And I think we agree - this is why the deniers wanting ""raw-data"" are bonkers. Because we know that if they got access to the raw data of the satellite temperature observations - they would quickly drown in raw data and come up with some very strange results (like forgetting to compensate for orbital drift - long after they are feeling sad for the raw numbers the satellite send back actually is not temperature measurements at all) 
Finally ponder this - observed sea-level is a finite volume. 
If you say that Antarctica currently is gaining mass (this is what we expected in the early 90s) - you are left with a substantial residual. So you conclude that Antarctica has not yet ""discovered"" AGW in any substantial way (or it is discovering it - but it is compensated for by higher moisture capacity of the warmer atmosphere). This is fine. 
But now you have to close the risidual. Is the water not coming from Antarctica coming from ground-water? That would be a worrying conclusion. Is it coming from a much more sensitive Greenland (that is also a worrying conclusion) - or are the (still) less than perfect Argo-float network of ocean heat content drastically wrong - so that global warming is way worse than we thought - because the thermal factor is much bigger than we think?

So if, for example, there's a warm area in the middle of the Indian Ocean, it will cause the water there to ""bulge up"" in place, affecting satellite altimetry measurements of sea-level. But the water in that ""bump"" doesn't ""run downhill"" and affect sea-level elsewhere.
Well, more precisely, the water at the surface which ""runs downhill"" is exactly balanced by water at depth which flows in the opposite direction, to keep the masses equal. So there's no net lateral flow, and no effect on sea-level at distant shores. Only where the water temperature actually rises is its depth affected.
Such ""thermosteric sea-level rise"" affects satellite altimeters, because they measure sea-level in the open ocean.

Some of those parts are related to the ocean. Because we know that we’ve already put a lot of heat content into the ocean. 
In the case of the Antarctic Ice Sheet, regarding the marine-based ice which is very sensitive to ocean temperatures—West Antarctica 3.3m, East Antarctica 19m—we are likely to end up being committed to some response of the ice sheet to the heat that has already gone into the ocean. And Greenland has around 3m of sea level rise equivalent of marine-based ice as well.
This marine-based ice has its feet in a warming ocean and ocean temperature likely controls Antarctic Ice Sheet mass, according to the glaciologist Richard Alley (57m sea level rise equivalent of ice).
It's -50 degrees C on parts of Antarctica, warm it up to -45 and who cares? But it is at the melting point at the coast where the floating and thinning ice shelves provide less and less friction constraining ice sheet flow.
An increase of just 1 degree C destroyed the ice shelf constraining the flow of the Jakobshavn Isbræ Glacier on Greenland and such an increase is a big insult to an ice shelf almost anywhere on the planet.
The Antarctic Peninsula has lost 8-10 ice shelves over the last 25-30 years. When the Larsen B ice shelf broke up there over a 5 week period in 2002 the glaciers behind sped up by a factor of 6 to 8 and are still flowing at that accelerated rate today because the cork was removed.
If we sped up all of Antarctica’s glaciers by a factor of 6.5 we’d have 4m per century sea level rise, roughly what occurred for four centuries 14,600 years ago.

For the six thousand years leading up to the Industrial Revolution the pattern was slow cooling at an average rate of about 0.2 degrees C per millennium. There were ups and downs due to changes in ocean currents and solar output, but at most those changes were around 0.1 degree C per century and after five or six hundred years the average global temps returned to the cooling trend. (Graph of the last 20,000 years of global temperature) 
In the last hundred years we have seen global temperatures climb just over a full degree C with the majority of that increase in the last forty years. Solar out put has actually been declining slightly during those last forty years. 
""Sea levels have risen slowly for quite a while also""
Looking at this graph of post glacial sea level rise we can see that sea levels have been remarkably stable for the last 6000 years, which is why we still have London although it was founded 2000 years ago.
But the most important line in the world, the shoreline, is starting to change noticeably for the first time in recorded human history.
In 2014 two independent teams of scientists reported that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is likely retreating irreversibly. 1
That’s 3.3m of sea level rise equivalent of ice (over 4m in the North which has a more heavily populated coast).
The rate of acceleration of ice sheet mass loss is around 44Gt/y2 now. If it continued at that rate we’d get 78cm from that source by 2100. Throw in mountain glaciers and thermal expansion, 20-30cm, and you get around a meter.
But with a warming world will that rate remain the same? Glaciologists are worried that it could increase substantially when the West Antarctic starts to let go.

“Several areas of earth science require knowledge of the fluctuations in sea level and ice volume through glacial cycles. These include understanding past ice sheets and providing boundary conditions for paleoclimate models, calibrating marine-sediment isotopic records, and providing the background signal for evaluating anthropogenic contributions to sea level. From ∼1,000 observations of sea level, allowing for isostatic and tectonic contributions, we have quantified the rise and fall in global ocean and ice volumes for the past 35,000 years. Of particular note is that during the ∼6,000 y up to the start of the recent rise ∼100−150 y ago, there is no evidence for global oscillations in sea level on time scales exceeding ∼200 y duration or 15−20 cm amplitude.”
The key is the forcing…which you have avoided. Why would sea level rise at all when the sun has been cooling for decades. The modern max was back in the 50s.

Some sources quote much higher rates, sometimes as high as 3.4 mm/yr (13 inches per century), based on satellite altimetry measurements of sea-level. But using satellite altimetry to estimate global average sea-level change, rather than using coastal sea-level measurements from tide gauges, is a mistake. 
Most fundamentally, click for larger version satellite altimeters measure the wrong thing. Their measurements are distorted by ""sea-level rise"" caused by thermal expansion when the upper layer of the ocean warms. But that is a strictly local effect, which doesn't affect the quantity of water in the oceans, and doesn't affect sea-level elsewhere (e.g., at the coasts).

Louisiana's high local rates of sea-level rise are due to subsidence, not global sea-level rise. It is mostly a consequence of taming the Mighty Mississippi.
For many millennia Old Man River had been dumping silt into the Delta, mostly during floods, and the Earth's crust is sinking under the burden of that silt. Now, thanks to the flood control dams, the river no longer deposits much silt in the Delta, but the Earth is continuing to sink. The result is very high rates of local sea-level rise. It is anthropogenic, but it isn't climate-related, and CO2 has nothing at all to do with it, and curbing CO2 emissions would do Louisiana no good at all..
Sea level is rising in some places, and falling in others, because the global trend is so slow that in many places it is outpaced by vertical land motion.

""Serious global climate change concerns"" have nothing to do with it. That's a red herring. Sea-level is rising no faster now than it was nine decades ago, when CO2 levels were 100 ppmv lower, and flood-triggering storms are not detectably correlated with rising CO2 levels, either.
All that CO2 has not detectably affected sea-level trends. Every long, high-quality sea-level measurement record shows same lack of acceleration since 1920s or before:

Last year there was an average of six flooding days per area across 98 coastal areas monitored by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) – an all-time record. More than a quarter of these locations tied or broke their records for high tide flood days, the federal agency states in a new report.
Known as “sunny day flooding”, these events swamp streets and homes with water simply from the incoming tide, without the aid of a storm. Noaa said that in 2017 areas across the US north-east and Gulf of Mexico were worst hit, with Boston, Massachusetts, and Atlantic City, New Jersey, both experiencing 22 days of flooding, while Galveston, in Texas, was soaked on 18 different days.
Noaa warned that cyclical climatic conditions during 2018 and 2019 “may result in higher than expected flood frequencies” in around half of the coastal sites it measures. 
The longer-term trend is even more certain, Noaa said, with melting glaciers, thermal expansion of sea water and altered ocean currents pushing the sea level steadily higher and causing further floods. 
“Breaking of annual flood records is to be expected next year and for decades to come as sea levels rise, and likely at an accelerated rate,” the report states. “Though year-to-year and regional variability exists, the underlying trend is quite clear: due to sea level rise, the national average frequency of high tide flooding is double what it was 30 years ago.”
The Noaa report is “comprehensive” and “clearly illustrates the increasing problems along our coastlines”, said Ben Horton, a sea level rise expert at Rutgers University. “There is flooding on all our coastlines, places where people live and work. There needs to be a national response to that.” 
Last year was marked by three high-profile hurricanes that pummelled the US, triggering flooding that resulted in dozens of deaths and billions of dollars in damage. Scientists have found that warming temperatures, driven by human activity, is making hurricanes stronger, but it is also exacerbating more chronic nuisance flooding events by pushing up the level of the ocean.
“There’s a clear upwards trend of this type of flooding,” said Andrea Dutton, a geologist at the University of Florida. “Extreme events like hurricanes may be the breaking point but this sort of frequent flooding is the taste of what is coming in the future on a permanent basis. We need to rethink our relationship with the coastline because it’s going to be retreating for the foreseeable future.”
Dutton said that south Florida, where weather forecasts in some places now come with tidal warnings, and fish are a regular sight on flooded roads, is particularly vulnerable. The low-lying region sits on porous limestone, which pushes up floodwater from underground, and many communities are unable to easily retreat because they back on to the Everglades wetlands.
“They used to get just one day a year of tidal flooding, now it’s two months of it in the fall,” she said. “Engineering can help delay things but ultimately the oceans will win. We are going to have to live with the water.”
Globally, the seas have risen by an average of nearly three inches since 1992. Parts of the US coastline are unusually prone, with Noaa forecasting last year that the oceans could swell by more than eight feet by 2100. 
Despite the risk posed to the US by sea level rise and flooding events, there is no national plan to deal with the issue, with much of the adaption work left to states and counties. The Trump administration has rescinded previous rules to build federally funded infrastructure with climate change in mind and has sought to reverse various measures aimed at taming global warming.
“We need to take this report as a warning to prepare ourselves, or we will just sit around and wait for disaster to happen,” Dutton said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/06/flooding-from-high-tides-has-doubled-in-the-us-in-just-30-years

In an interview with Guardian Australia, the Queensland National said the climate had been changing “since we first tilled the soil in Australia” and he does not care whether the change is due to human activity or not.
While some colleagues in the National party have long queried whether humans are contributing to global warming, and have been openly hostile to the advance of renewable energy, Littleproud said: “I’m not losing any sleep on that, whether you want to prove it is manmade or not – I want to be pragmatic.
• Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon
“The climate has been changing since we first tilled the soil in Australia and the reality is farmers have been adapting to it,” the agriculture minister said. “Farmers are always at the cutting edge of science and technology, and they’ve been adapting since we first tilled the soil here.
“I believe the climate is changing. Whether it is manmade or not, I don’t really care. The reality is we are seeing disruption, particularly with renewables, and we are going to see cleaner air. I try not to live in cities, you do feel the effects ... so it’s a good thing that renewables are coming on.
“In fact, in my own electorate [of Maranoa in south-west Queensland] I’ve got all of the above. I’m about to have one of the largest solar farms in the southern hemisphere, one of the biggest wind farms in the southern hemisphere. I’ve got geothermal and I’ve got four coal-fired power stations. Two of those are super critical.
“The disruption that’s happening with the technology, moving towards renewable energy, particularly in storage for base load, is exciting. I think it is a good thing.”
While some government colleagues have championed prolonging the life of coal-fired power plants, Littleproud said economics rather than a culture war would ultimately determine Australia’s future energy mix. “Economics will win out in the end and if base load power can be stored in particular, that’s an exciting thing for the environment and everyone’s hip pocket.”
Littleproud has been on the road for much of the week with the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, visiting drought-affected regions of New South Wales and Queensland.
The south-east of Australia this year has experienced record high temperatures during an unseasonably dry and hot autumn, prompting fire bans and warnings from authorities.
In its latest winter outlook, the Bureau of Meteorology is forecasting warmer and drier-than-average conditions across large parts of the country. It suggests winter rainfall is likely to be below average for NSW, South Australia, northern Victoria and western parts of Western Australia.
Turnbull this week said there was “no doubt that our climate is getting warmer”. He said the farming community needed to concentrate on becoming more resilient and focus on adaptation to a climate that was getting warmer and drier.
Littleproud said there was a place for both mitigation strategies to try and reduce the most damaging impacts of climate change, and also for adaptation. 
“No matter whether you mitigate or adapt, the climate is going to change and we’ve got to move with it,” he said. “You have to use the best science available at the time – you mitigate as best you can ... listen to the scientific evidence, because this should be predicated on science not emotion. 
“If there are mitigation efforts to lessen the impact, then we should explore those, but we have to continue to adapt as we have since we first inhabited Australia.”
He said he was currently working with state counterparts in the agriculture portfolio to develop “a national strategy around climate change adaptation”, which would include better collaboration across state borders, more research and development, including developing more drought-resistant grains and fibres, and looking at the genetics of livestock, and “understanding the weather better”.
Asked whether some Australian farmers were hanging on in areas made unviable for agricultural production because of the impact of climate change, Littleproud said: “I think ultimately the market and economics determine that.
“I honestly believe, having been a bank manager that sat around farmers’ kitchen tables, the greatest custodians of the land are farmers because their profit and loss is intrinsically tied to the health of their land. They don’t make a quid unless their environment and their farming is at its best.”
He said farmers in drier areas were deploying active strategies, like reducing their stocking densities, and some farmers he had met in regional Queensland this week were also engaged with traditional owners about land management. 
“They’ve learned how to manage that land, in some ways learning from how Indigenous Australians manage the land and techniques they’ve used,” he said.
Asked whether he accepted that agriculture and transport industries had to reduce their emissions to ensure Australia met its commitments under the Paris agreement, Littleproud said emissions reduction had to be “responsible”.
I think we are already reducing emissions
The latest official emissions data shows pollution increased by 1.5% in the year to December 2017. Australia’s emissions levels are now higher than they were in 2012 and have climbed by 3.6% since the carbon price was repealed in 2014.
Emissions are increasing in most sectors of the economy – in waste, agriculture and transport. Only one sector of the economy has recorded a decrease – the electricity sector – because ageing coal-fired power plants have exited the system, and new renewables projects are coming on stream.
“We’ve still got to be able to reduce the bills,” Littleproud said. “We’ve got to make sure the transition is done with people being able to turn their heaters on, and farmers turning their pumps on.
“I think we are already reducing emissions. We’ve made a commitment under the Paris agreement and we are moving towards that in a sensible and methodical way.
“As disruption happens in the technology space, [emissions reduction] will increase. In my own electorate, people are self-sustaining through solar.

why do we need to go to the trouble of creating and controlling a nuclear fission reaction just to heat water?
BQEND
Because it is often the cheapest way to heat the water (p4-5); and it is definitely the cleanest way (look at the data).
The fact is that in a decarbonisation solution, nuclear power results in lower environmental impacts compared to a solution using renewables alone:
* Nuclear power in low-carbon scenarios decreases costs and environmental impacts.
Note the analysis shows that nuclear is low carbon; but furthermore it shows it has lower environmental impacts than solar and wind for other aspects such as marine ecotoxicity and ozone layer depletion. It is simply the best environmental solution in a low-carbon scenario.
The whole point of about storing the waste is that is what makes nuclear power cleaner than other options. Only the nuclear industry stores its waste, with no intention that it will ever pollute the environment. Only the nuclear industry can do this, because only nuclear power has such a small waste stream. Other industries, including solar, discharge more waste and cause more harm. Characterising waste storage as a ""problem"" is churlish. It is the solution.

Besides, with the government's intransigence on this issue, you've got nothing to worry about! So no real need to do the rounds on fora such as these and try and shout the likes of me down, backed up by some lovely complex-looking statistics. 
Even more reason not to bother when you consider the following points:- *For 40 years of electricity generation (50 at the very most) a nuclear power station now takes a minimum of 10 years to construct and bring online, best case scenario (let's not even go there with Olkiluoto and Flamanville), then another roughly 100 years to completely decommission.- It should always be remembered that Nuclear power is basically just about heating some water to generate steam which then turns some turbines ; why do we need to go to the trouble of creating and controlling a nuclear fission reaction just to heat water? Given the by-products this generates, and the amount of investment and time required to construct vessels capable of containing the reaction, and the amount of earthwork required for a power station site, this seems like an awful lot of trouble.- Nuclear power plant contruction equals guaranteed cost overruns and delays. It seems that Hinkley Point has been smart about announcing these as early as possible to head off later controversy, but I'll be surprised if there isn't at least a significant delay announced in the next few years. I think they're currently announcing 2027 for the start of electricity generation. - Ditto for site decommissioning - cost overruns and underestimation of the time required are guaranteed.- There is still no confirmed long term solution in sight for the storage of the radioactive waste generated. This only serves to underline one of the major problems surrounding nuclear energy - the whole concept has been underlined by a headlong rush to get it up and running as soon as possible, without worrying about the future. It basically embodies our species' inability to look beyond our own little, finite lives (which to an extent I can of course sympathise with ;-) ) and, less forgiveably, think about the consequences for our future generations.- I'd also love to see some real studies conducted on the real, overall carbon footprint of nuclear power, including the amount of CO2 generated by the contruction of a site (right down to how much CO2 was produced in the manufacture of the materials required for the site contruction, in the site supply chain etc etc), and the the dismantling and decommissing processes, and on the amount of electricity a nuclear site consumes annually. Perhaps this has already been done, in which case I suspect you might take the opportunity to correct me...
Nevertheless don't get me wrong ; overall I can accept the arguments for UK constructing a couple of new nuclear power stations to take us through a period of transition, especially given our over reliance on gas for electricity generation, but the current number planned is too high and investment, subsidies etc should be redirected towards expanding and improving on all forms of renewable energy.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1528712461000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'11530026', u'id': u'116837644', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Joff', u'text': u'Nuclear spent fuel is really not a significant technical problem, despite the years of anti-nuclear attempts to make it so.

They developed a lot of renewables but they also massively reopened thermal and coal. They worsened their CO2 footprint, it wasn’t good for the planet. So, I won’t do that. Nuclear is not bad for carbon emissions, it’s even the most carbon-free way to produce electricity with renewables.” 
2. China has announced the resumption of new reactor approvals, aiming at least 6-8 new construction starts each year, while still on track to be come the second largest nuclear generator by 2022, and the largest by 2030.
3. Japan has reconfirmed plans to build nuclear generation back up to 20-22% of their generation mix, two reactors under construction are now back in process be completed.
4. As hydro is limited to only some countries with the right geography, and much of the best sites have already been taken, Pearce's answer to ""fickle renewables"" would be gas - hardly a low carbon solution.

Well, if we have on-shore wind instead at £50/MWh, (or PV at a similar price) how much monies would that give us for storage investment, just against this one nuclear plant. Well, assuming a future wholesale price of £45-£55/MWh (please see page 39), then the wind subsidy is £0-5/MWh, and the Wylfa subsidy £22-£32/MWh.
BQEND
You are astutely avoiding quantifying how much storage that would get you.
Storage via batteries produces electricity at around $200/MWh-$300/MWh. It would need to be subsidised at around $120/MWh to $220/MWh to bring it down to market price. Whereas you have demonstrated Wylfa's subsidy is a fraction of that.
So you might begin to have a point if we only needed to store 10% of the electricity, and could reliably cycle it, fully, every day. But that is not the case if you want a complete solution. It is only viable for a small part of the solution (the expensive peaking part).
The point is that wylfa is good at providing continuous baseload. Storage is good at providing sporadic peaks, but is really very, very expensive for providing continuous baseload. They simply don't compete in the same space. We need both.
Storage will replace gas peakers, not nuclear baseload in the UK.

Firstly, wind and solar in the US are cheaper than the UK.
Secondly, they are very generously subsidised as well as being cheaper, so the contract prices are artificially low.
Thirdly, the amount of storage in those projects is relatively small - not enough to provide year-round baseload. They would need much more storage (and hence much more cost) to provide year-round baseload in the UK.
Fourthly, the UK has much higher seasonal variation between summer and winter, so it would need 5-10 times as much storage to cover the winter. And also the UK's wind production varies by 50% from year to year - so that would need long-term storage of months/years rather than hours to provide consistent baseload.
If you pick apart the details, and look simply at the unsubsidised cost of battery storage, it turns out that the electricity via batteries costs $200-$300/MWh. Compared to around $100/MWh for Wylfa's nuclear price. And those storage prices assume the storage in neatly cycled, fully, every day or so. But UK solar/wind production is not nearly that consistent.
In order to get continuous baseload, even if we assume an ideal site at the equator where the solar output is exactly the same every day, two-thirds of the electricity would need to go through batteries, and one-third direct. So even that would have a hard time competing with Wylfa (which is a relatively expensive first-of-a-generation nuclear project).
Once you factor-in the seasonal and annual variation from solar & wind, it would need a order of magnitude more storage.
So unless storage gets 10 times cheaper; and nuclear fails to get any cheaper than the most expensive first-of-generation plants; storage will never compete for baseload in the UK. It will be used for peaker-replacement on top of nuclear baseload. That is why there is backing for nuclear, even when renewables (without storage) can be cheaper. There is no prospect of large-scale storage being sufficiently cheap to compete for baseload in the UK.

Very slowly. When is Germany going to install enough storage to enable the shutdown of coal power?

The nuclear energy still in it is 19 times what has been used.Weinberg recognised this and two other weaknesses, which are slight compared with ANY other energy source, and do not include a usefulness for bomb-making.The only civilian reactor that has killed anybody, at Chernobyl, was the far riskier RBMK design, and it was disgracefully handled, not by the operators, but by their upper management.The Molten Salt Reactor Experiment, designed and managed by Weinberg at ORNL, successfully addressed all three weaknesses, which are:1/ Ceramic solid fuel pellets;2/ The need for a coolant (water) at 150 times atmospheric pressure;3/ The fact that the fissile inventory is reduced as it is consumed.Wait a minute, Albert, how can (3) not be inevitable? Simple, you synthesise as much fissile as you consume,. The more obvious way is to create U-233 by neutron capture activating thorium 232. It is the ultimate in Renewable Technologies.
One more thing: If the reactor for any reason gets too hot, the fact that the fuel is in and part of a molten salt that solidifies at far higher temperatures than ""boiling water"", means that a solid plug of it at the lowest point of the circuit is kept so with a fan powered the same way as the fuel circulation pump. If that power fails, the pug melts and dumps the entire fuel-salt contents of the reactor, safely into a basin where it solidifies -- the diametrical opposite of a ""meltdown"" caused by the evaporation of a water coolant.But this technology was sufficiently difficult even to adapt to bomb making that when Richard Nixon cut the funding for the Atomic Energy Commission, further development was abandoned.There are at least half a dozen companies now developing versions of molten salt reactor (MSR) design, at least one of which calls itself the People's Republic of China -- in its own language.', u'recommendation_count': u'2', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1528640340000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'the evaporation of a water coolant', u'effect': u'the diametrical opposite of a meltdown'}], u'author_id': u'16013454', u'id': u'116813728', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'rootmeansquare', u'text': u'"" And with the huge offshore wind potential of UK there is absolutely no issue to provide enough electricity for a 100% RE scenario.

""While several of the issues raised by the Heard paper are important, you have to realise that there are technical solutions to all the points they raised using today's technology,"" says the lead author Dr. Tom Brown of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. 
""Furthermore, these solutions are absolutely affordable, especially given the sinking costs of wind and solar power,"" says Professor Christian Breyer of Lappeenranta University of Technology, who co-authored the response.
Brown cites the worst-case solution of hydrogen or synthetic gas produced with renewable electricity for times when imports, hydroelectricity, batteries, and other storage solutions fail to bridge the gap during low wind and solar periods during the winter. For maintaining stability, there is a series of technical solutions, from rotating grid stabilisers to newer electronics-based solutions. The scientists have collected examples of best practice by grid operators from across the world, from Denmark to Tasmania.
""There are some persistent myths that 100 percent renewable systems are not possible,"" says Professor Brian Vad Mathiesen of Aalborg University, who is a co-author of the response.

And please don't get upset about the cost of building out storage, as it will be done slowly and steadily alongside the expansion of RE. The monies could be made available by simply changing government policy. Look at this Guardian article, that displays £5bn of government investment to get the nuclear CfD down to £77/MWh.
Well, if we have on-shore wind instead at £50/MWh, (or PV at a similar price) how much monies would that give us for storage investment, just against this one nuclear plant. Well, assuming a future wholesale price of £45-£55/MWh (please see page 39), then the wind subsidy is £0-5/MWh, and the Wylfa subsidy £22-£32/MWh.
Annually, that's wind at £0 to £131m, and Wylfa at £578m to £841m.

You present a false dichotomy, It goes both ways, the grids are interdependent.
In general France exports at night when it has a surplus due to overgeneration.
It relies upon the greater flexibility of its fossil powered neighbours to absorb this excess.
However, during the day France cannot necessarily guarantee to meet its own peak demand and imports from its neighbours to cover the shortfall.
This is especially so when several French nuclear plants have a safety shutdown.

This week the business secretary, Greg Clark, announced plans to pump £5bn into a new nuclear power station at Wylfa in north Wales. It was a reversal of a longstanding Conservative policy not to underwrite nuclear construction. So why the sudden enthusiasm? And what does Clark know that the rest of the world does not?
For almost everywhere else, governments and corporations are pulling the plug on nuclear. Even in a world fearful of climate change, in which nations have promised to wean themselves off fossil fuels by the mid-century, almost no one wants to touch nuclear.
Germany will be nuclear-free by 2022. France – once Europe’s great nuclear advocates – is backtracking. President Macron is committed to cutting nuclear’s contribution to grid power from the 75% to 50%. Seven years after the Fukushima accident, all but a handful of Japan’s 54 nuclear power plants remain closed.
US utilities are shutting reactors fast too, even those with years of their operating licences yet to run. In America’s deregulated energy markets, nuclear cannot compete. Last week President Trump called for the utilities to suspend closures, citing national energy security. He may resort to the law to get his way, but even Trump is not demanding new reactors.
Meanwhile, the state-sponsored nuclear enthusiasm of China, recently the world’s premier builder, has dimmed. Beijing has issued no new construction approvals for over two years. Only Russia keeps up the momentum – which puts Britain in an embarrassing club.
Britain hasn’t completed a new nuclear power station for 23 years. The government’s professed reason for its newfound enthusiasm is fighting climate change, and in particular the need to find replacements on the grid for the remaining coal-fired power plants that it has pledged to shut by 2025. But while the cause is correct, the solution is increasingly at odds with the rest of the world.
Yes, nuclear is a proven large-scale source of low-carbon electricity. But renewable sources like solar and wind are both now cheaper, and are becoming cheaper still, while nuclear costs only rise.
Some who call themselves “eco-modernists” argue that nuclear and renewables would make a great mix: nuclear could fill in when the sun goes down and the winds drop. But there is a problem. Any effective stand-in for fickle renewables needs to be available at the flick of a switch. Hydropower or natural gas can do the job, but not nuclear. Its forte is to deliver constant baseload power.
If nuclear ticked enough other boxes, it might still have a role to play in keeping the lights on. But it has always been a bad neighbour and troublesome citizen. Some of our fears about radiation may be exaggerated, but they are real fears nonetheless. And nuclear power’s links to nuclear weapons are not just about shared technology – at least not while Britain remains home to the world’s largest stockpile of plutonium.
We are sitting on 130 tonnes of a human-made element that lies at the heart of most nuclear weapons. The stockpile is at a warehouse at Sellafield in Cumbria, in defiance of warnings from scientists at the Royal Society a decade ago that in its present form it poses a major security risk, whether diverted for weapons or breached by terrorists.
The plutonium was manufactured over decades from used power-station reactor fuel. Britain wanted to be at the forefront of a new global industry using plutonium to fuel new designs of reactors. But production continues even though there is no sign of a world market for plutonium. And neither the new Hinkley Point reactor under construction in Somerset, nor the proposed plant at Wylfa, will burn the stuff.
The government seems determined to pursue a nuclear dream, even though it has palpably failed to come to terms with the toxic legacy of the country’s nuclear past.
Next to the site of the planned Wylfa plant sits the shell of an old nuclear power station. It was shut in 2015, but is not scheduled for demolition for almost another century, in 2105. It is one of 11 former plants that sit abandoned around our coastlines, from Dungeness in Kent to Trawsfynydd in Snowdonia, and Sizewell in Suffolk to Hunterston in south-west Scotland.
They are currently being put into what the industry terms “care and maintenance” – mothballed while their radioactivity decays, and until the government’s Nuclear Decommissioning Authority can find somewhere to put their remains.
On present form, that day may never come. Britain is today no nearer agreeing a final resting place for its most dangerous and long-lasting radioactive wastes than it was back in 1976, when the royal commission on environmental pollution said we should build no more nuclear power plants until that problem was resolved. Absurdly, the most recent plan has been to bury the waste in tunnels to be dug beneath the Lake District national park.
Nuclear power today is a largely friendless industry: uneconomic without heavy government support, uninsurable, stuck with a military heritage from hell, overtaken by cleaner competitors, beset by waste problems that no one has resolved, and always vulnerable to public panic after the Chernobyl or Fukushima accidents.
Some believe it may have a future when the waste problems are resolved and if radical new reactor designs emerge. That may be so. But the truth is that in the 60 years since the bomb-makers first promised us “atoms for peace”, nuclear power has gone from a sunrise to a sunset industry.

… we can’t turn away from climate change. For The Guardian, reporting on the environment is a  priority.  We give climate, nature and pollution stories the prominence they deserve, stories which often go unreported by others in the mainstream media. At this critical time for our species and our planet, we are determined to inform readers about threats, consequences and solutions based on scientific facts, not political prejudice or business interests. But we need your support to grow our coverage, to travel to the remote frontlines of change and to cover vital conferences that affect us all.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute.

“Civilisation requires energy, but energy use must not destroy civilisation,” he said at the end of a two-day conference at the Vatican.
The pontiff said climate change was a challenge of epochal proportions, and that the world needed to come up with an energy mix that combatted pollution, eliminated poverty and promoted social justice.
The unprecedented conference, held behind closed doors at the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, brought together oil executives, investors and Vatican experts. Like the pope, they back scientific opinion that climate change is caused by human activity and that global warming must be curbed.
“We know that the challenges facing us are interconnected. If we are to eliminate poverty and hunger ... the more than 1 billion people without electricity today need to gain access to it,” Francis told them.
“But that energy should also be clean, by a reduction in the systematic use of fossil fuels. Our desire to ensure energy for all must not lead to the undesired effect of a spiral of extreme climate changes due to a catastrophic rise in global temperatures, harsher environments and increased levels of poverty,” he said. 
… we can’t turn away from climate change. The Guardian’s environmental coverage reports the scientific facts, social consequences and political choices that are shaping the fate of our planet. As the world's leaders turn their backs on the environment, we are at a crisis point. Individual consumer choices are important, but we need collective action to achieve the systemic change that will really make a difference. Our pioneering and our fearless reporting on the environment can play a vital role in that. But we need our readers’ support.

2014 will become the old consensus position, 2022 the new. So, are the scientists who may be closer to the likely 2022 wrong now but will become right in 2022?

From what I've read above I understand that your definition of a ""lukewarmer"" is different from that of everybody else in that it doesn't include the usual definition of those who cherrypick the lowest range of estimated equilibrium climate sensitivities but does include those who consider there is no evidence that tropical cyclones are getting more intense, that famines are not increasing and that human struggles are not attributable to anthropogenic global warming.
However, Webster et al (2005) in the abstract of ""Changes in Tropical Cyclone Number, Duration, and Intensity in a warming environment"" Science Volume 309 Issue 5742 pp 1844-1846 report as follows.
""We examined the number of tropical cyclones as well as tropical cyclone days as well as tropical cyclone intensity over the past 35 years, in an environment of increasing sea surface temperature. A large increase was seen in the number and proportion of hurricanes reaching categories 4 and 5. The largest increase occurred in the North Pacific, Indian and Southwest Pacific Oceans, and the smallest percentage increase occurred in the North Atlantic Ocean. These increases have taken place while the number of cyclones and cyclone days has decreased in all basins except the North Atlantic during the past decade.""
Climate scientists don't talk about famines increasing but they do talk about global warming increasing the rate of onset of drought, increasing the frequency of severe El Nino events which cause widespread drought, and moving west coast rainfall patterns poleward which also causes drought. In the absence of good governance droughts can lead to famine but countries with subsistence farmers at risk of famine have improved their governance in recent decades.
While all human struggles are not due to global warming, drought affected subsistence farmers are struggling and even more so in regions without good governance. Even in regions with good governance farmers can struggle financially with their farming business in times of drought and an increase in the rate of onset of drought and the frequency of severe droughts can lead to a farming operation becoming a struggle. In farming regions affected economically by such an increase in droughts people move out and seek work in the cities. If work is not available in the cities the resulting concentration of urban unemployed people can result in struggle.', u'recommendation_count': u'3', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1529233321000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'which', u'effect': u'widespread drought'}, {u'cause': u'which', u'effect': u'drought'}, {u'cause': None, u'effect': u'famine but countries with subsistence farmers'}, {u'cause': u'global warming', u'effect': u'while all human struggles are not'}, {u'cause': None, u'effect': u'a farming operation becoming a struggle'}, {u'cause': u'the resulting concentration of urban unemployed people', u'effect': u'struggle'}], u'author_id': u'12483673', u'in_reply_to': u'116945119', u'id': u'117088176', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'kent31', u'text': u'BQSTART

Couple things. So a PHD is automatically discredited because the PHD earns part of his income from a think tank? UCLA doesn't think so.

Second thing. I'm not sure what this politician said, but my read of the data is that he didn't say it was cooling for the past 10 years, he just said that it hadn't warmed as much as the IPCC had predicted. Much of the warm spikes were in El Nino years, and other years were more closely in line with a 30 year avg.

BQENDWell they undoubtedly shed snow better, but if they overproduce in the summer then they're very badly designed.
I have a friend in Saskatchewan, Canada who lives on the edge of a huge lake - he experimented hanging his panels at 80 degrees to catch the sunset reflecting over water- he had no numbers but anecdotally it worked surprisingly well after he also oversized the system and split it for day/evening.

This looks like nonsense. Lukewarmers often use the term to describe themselves. There's even a pro lukewarmer blog that uses the term in its name. The term alarmist is used by those who don't accept the scientific evidence that suggests we should reduce our CO2 emissions. It's meant to suggest that those they disagree with are exaggerating. You wouldn't use it for instance to describe somebody who said that smoking could be damaging to our health.

We are talking about what is best overall
BQENDYep, thanks for finally coming round to my way of thinking.
And what is best overall, a supply and demand pattern that best match each other.
So do you want to export leccy at minimal value in the summer, or avoid expensive leccy import in the winter.
Therefore choosing a steep pitch (when possible) gives a better year round match of supply and demand, than a shallower pitch.
Is such a decision wise at a cost of 1-1.5% of annual generation, I certainly believe so, and obviously so do the off-gridders.
And also of importance, it would reduce peak generation in the summer months which would help to allow more PV capacity to be rolled out and reduce DNO issues. So part of the 'big picture'.
But back to the crucial question, does an annual reduction of 1-1.5% of generation make such a set up unsuitable for the UK ........... only in your world, only in your world.

a fixed panel would be most productive on an annual basis nearer to the summer pitch i.e the 39°
BQENDYep, 'most productive on an annual basis.
But sadly you've fallen for CP's spin and followed him down the rabbit hole.
Please see my comments, stretching back 2yrs, which have never changed, nor needed revision. I have always stated that the 'cost' of 50d PV is an annual loss of about 1.5%, so despite yours, or CP's attempts to revise the original discussion (when he realised his mistake of claiming that 45d was only suitable in the Arctic), my claim still stands.
V's 30d pitch - You lose about 1-1.5% annual generation, reduce summer gen (when you have too much anyway) by about 10%, and boost winter gen (when you need every last kWh) by about 20%.
So, not only is 50d pitch PV suitable for the UK, but it is almost certainly more suitable than 30d, or 39d pitch, when attempting to maximise supply and demand.
The issue here is extremely simple, it has only become less clear due to all the smoke and mirrors that CP has used to try to dig his way out of that original hole:

Over the past several weeks, the WSJ’s attacks on climate science have gone into overdrive. On May 15th, the Opinion page published a self-contradictory editorial from the lifelong contrarian and fossil fuel-funded Fred Singer that so badly rejected basic physics, it prompted one researcher to remark, “If this were an essay in one of my undergraduate classes, he would fail.”
The WSJ did publish a letter to the editor (LTE) from real climate scientists Andrea Dutton and Michael Mann rebutting Singer’s editorial. However, it gave the last word to science deniers in an LTE response rejecting the well-established facts that sea level rise is accelerating and Antarctic is loss is contributing to it.
A few days later, the WSJ opinion page was at it again, publishing an editorial by Stephen F. Hayward, who describes himself as having “spent most of my adult life in conservative think tanks in Washington, D.C.,” and it shows. Hayward has a long history as a climate naysayer, spanning over a decade back to his days with the fossil fuel-funded American Enterprise Institute.
Hayward’s arguments of course deserve to be judged on their own merits. I devoted my first-ever Tweetstorm to doing just that:
Ok, let's do a Whack-a-Mole Twitter thread debunking all the nonsense in @stevenfhayward's @WSJ editorial (1/n)
Hayward falls into the category some describe as “Lukewarmers.” This group consists of people who think that – contrary to the body of available evidence – global warming will be slow and we don’t have to worry much about it. I prefer the term “Luckwarmer,” since they’re betting that Earth’s climate sensitivity is at the very low end or lower than the range of values supported by scientific evidence. In that sense, they’re gambling we’ll be very lucky that the climate dice will come up snake eyes.
Throughout his career, Hayward has spilled a lot of ink trolling those who are concerned about climate change. In this latest opinion piece, he argues that “climate change has run its course” because nobody is doing anything serious to solve it, and nobody cares about climate change anymore. 
Hayward’s evidence to support this thesis is flimsy, to put it charitably. For example, when pressed on the fact that every country save America has agreed to implement policies to curb climate change, Hayward cited Japan as a counter-example that’s building more coal power plants since the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster. Indeed, Japan’s climate policies are highly insufficient to meet the Paris goals. But Japan has nevertheless signed onto the Paris agreement, whose framework allows signatory countries to periodically strengthen their policies and commitments and thus eventually meet the targets. And Japan’s per person carbon pollution is already about 40% lower than America’s.
Hayward also cites polling data that shows Americans consider climate change a low priority, but neglects to mention that the vast majority (including Trump voters) support climate policies like taxing and/or regulating carbon pollution. He compares the issue to a car alarm whose blaring noise everybody soon tunes out. However, unlike a triggered car alarm, climate change poses ever-increasing risks. It won’t just go away if we ignore it. It’s much more like a fire alarm sounding off in a building whose occupants have been locked in.
Worst of all, Hayward claims that “the left politicized the issue,” which is beyond absurd. Those on the American ‘left’ generally accept the consensus of 97% of climate science experts and have proposed bipartisan solutions to this existential problem that, with a few exceptions, have been almost universally rejected by those on the American right for purely political reasons.
The WSJ is of course far from the only media outlet guilty of peddling fossil fuel industry propaganda. Last Friday, The Hill published a very similar editorial by Fred Singer, whose second sentence included two very easily fact-checked falsehoods: “sea level has been rising at a steady rate, between 1 and 2 millimeters per year.” In reality, sea level rise has been accelerating, now up to about 3.3 millimeters per year.
Some people are of the opinion that the Earth is flat, but the WSJ and The Hill probably wouldn’t publish Flat Earthers’ editorials. Of course, the Flat Earth Society doesn’t have the financial and political clout of the fossil fuel industry.
… we have a small favour to ask. More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism.

The more I hear of ""rewilding"", or at least some of the notions being spread both in Guardian comments and a couple of silly articles, the less I'm coming to like it. Any ""rewilding"" should be informed by conservation science not the current fad for just letting a bunch of weeds pop up.
Mining companies in Australia would love this notion of ""rewilding"" - fill in the holes, level the site and then bye. Thankfully their legal obligations extend further to rehabilitation - planting the site with locally native species with a suitable mix to provide some resemblance to what was there before. Do that and in a relatively short time the vertebrate and invertebrate animal life will follow.

Presenting the problem as something that can be cured with a free cash hand-out and a programme of tree-planting is extremely misleading.What is needed, in addition to continuing efforts to shift to low-energy technologies and renewable sources of power, is a rejection of expectations of constantly rising living standards in the wealthy West, and willingness to embrace a far more austere lifestyle, and abandonment of the ambition to achieve Western levels of material prosperity in the third world.

""Decarbonized hydrogen is the energy transition accelerator."" It was in using these words that Pascal Mauberger, by invitation from Nicolas Hulot, began his talk. He then continued, ""the hydrogen revolution has begun."" 
-Industry: augmented electrolyzers for a new low carbon era in the sectors of chemicals, refinery, steel. -Mobility: stations having the capacity to fuel a variety of hydrogen vehicles, from utility to buses and trucks, including cars and hydrogen trains.-Energy: long term storage solutions for very large volumes. Reinforcing the competitiveness of water electrolysis is essential for the deployment plan of decarbonized hydrogen
Water electrolysis technology, producing on-site and on demand from renewable resources, clearly appears to be the cornerstone for the large-scale deployment of decarbonized hydrogen for industry, mobility and energy.""

However I will focus on the major problem- 
We have one problem and as the authors point out, it is not population although this is a contributary factor. It is fossil fuels. I will also point out that at this point it will not do much good to argue too much about population unless you are trying to provoke a war (fairly unpleasant idea); and even that would not get us anywhere - all ideas of trying to stick to difficult emission mitigation strategies would be well and truly out the window. Every nation on Earth would ramp up fossil fuel production and consumption, and budgets on environmentally friendly policies would evaporate instantly. 
Realistically, we should use the global pool of talent and productivity we have available to speed up deployment and realisation of the technologies that have any hope of getting us out of this mess. This is what is already happening; the only problem with the kind of renewable energy investment that is really needed is that we already have so much infrastructure based around oil, gas and coal. It cannot be overstated that the energy landscape is in the midst of profound change.
However there is one piece of the puzzle that has still not been fully grasped by many. We need something that fills all the gaps oil, gas and coal leave behind: dispatchable power, months of winter heating, many hours of driving or traversing the skies and oceans, and very large quantities of high temperature heat for all the materials we require to make things. 
This energy needs to be produced by cheap renewable power and easily stored and transported in a very similar way to what is being phased out. And we are going to all need to keep the economy going in order to fund its initial development - if only to replace the enormous fossil fuel subsidies that we continue to destroy ourselves with. This energy is hydrogen; produced either from electricity or from biomass - or from fossil fuels with CCS. There is absolutely no alternative to the vast amounts of liquid and gaseous fuel the world consumes annually, and all the ways we transport and consume these fuels. And finally; it is cheaper than gasoline in a car or truck. In a few years it will be cheaper than natural gas. The energy transition is a sinister joke without hydrogen, and we all better become aware of this fact.
Just as a further point to note - most poorer countries use very little if any heating. They certainly use far less gas; and the energy they do use they will need for airconditioning when its hot, and then for a few hours in the night. Most of this will be adequately supplied by solar and some backup; and here again we will probably be waiting for the cost of electrolysis & renewables to further drop; but that won't take long. Driving I think is going to edge towards hydrogen; if only because of grid-reliability/grid storage issues and more technical details involved with storing energy.

Enough plastic has been manufactured to clingfilm it as well. We produce 4.8bn tonnes of our top five crops, plus 4.8 billion head of livestock, annually. There are 1.2bn motor vehicles, 2bn personal computers, and more mobile phones than the 7.5 billion people on Earth.
The result of all this production and consumption is a chronic, escalating, many-sided environmental crisis. From rapid climate change to species extinctions to microplastics in every ocean, these impacts are now so large that many scientists have concluded that we have entered a new human-dominated geological period called the Anthropocene. 
This dangerous new epoch ends the unusually stable planetary conditions over the past 10,000 years that allowed farming and complex civilisations to emerge. With the spectre of rapid environmental change leading to societal collapse looming, what is to be done?
Using modern science to reanalyse human history can help us understand future problems in more fundamental ways. Our analysis shows that just five successive types of human society have spread worldwide: hunter-gatherer, agriculturalist, mercantile capitalist, industrial capitalist and, following the second world war, today’s consumer capitalist society. 
Each subsequent stage relies on greater energy use and greater generation and flows of information and knowledge. These result in a much larger population, rising per capita productivity and greater collective agency. Seen in this light, a new sixth type of society will require both greater energy provision and improved systems to communicate knowledge and manage information. 
To usher in a new way of living, the core dynamic of ever-greater production and consumption of goods and resources must be broken, coupled with a societal focus on environmental repair. Two increasingly discussed ideas do just this. 
Universal Basic Income (UBI) is a policy whereby a financial payment is made to every citizen, unconditionally, without any obligation to work, at a level above their subsistence needs. Small-scale trials of UBI show most people would still work, but UBI could break the link between work and consumption. We all do it, saying: “I work so hard, I deserve that fancy meal, new gadget, or long-haul flight.” Consumption is the payback for being ever-more productive at work. Indeed, it makes little sense to curb consumption when we know we will have to be ever-more productive at work regardless of our choices. 
UBI reduces dependency, giving people the agency to say no to undesirable work, and yes to opportunities that often lie out of reach. With UBI we could all think long-term, well beyond the next payday. We could care for ourselves, others, and the wider world, as living in the Anthropocene demands.
Another idea is Half-Earth – the simple but profound idea that environmental repair could come fromallocating half the Earth’s surface primarily for the benefit of other species. Half-Earth is less utopian than it first appears, as we have become an urban species. Mass-scale forest restoration is already underway, with commitments across 43 countries to restore 292m hectares of degraded land to forest, 10 times the area of the UK. 
And at a deeper level, our views on nature are forged by the society we live in. Acknowledging the Anthropocene re-establishes that humans are part of nature, and so rewilding projects, where large areas are managed to allow natural processes to run, are increasingly popular. Slowly, a new nature aesthetic is being born. 
But can we really escape booming production and consumption? The fate of species encountering vast new resources is exponential growth and then collapse, epitomised by the rapid expansion and eventual death of bacteria growing in a Petri dish. While rarely recognised, we humans have recently become the exception to this rule: birth rates on all continents are declining and the global population is on track to stabilise. More information, in the form of girls’ education, has done something truly extraordinary in the context of 4bn years of life. 
UBI would give people the right to choose when it comes to fulfilling their own basic needs, and rewilding Earth does the same of other species’ needs. This would be a legacy of a new chapter in Earth’s history that we could be proud of. 
… we can’t turn away from climate change. For The Guardian, reporting on the environment is a  priority.  We give climate, nature and pollution stories the prominence they deserve, stories which often go unreported by others in the mainstream media. At this critical time for humanity and our planet, we are determined to inform readers about threats, consequences and solutions based on scientific facts, not political prejudice or business interests. But we need your support to grow our coverage, to travel to the remote frontlines of change and to cover vital conferences that affect us all.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute. Thank you.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/12/universal-basic-income-and-rewilding-can-meet-anthropocene-demands

Emissions rose 1.6% in 2017 after flatlining for the previous three years, which the British oil firm said was a reminder the world was not on track to hit the goals of the Paris climate deal.
Renewable power generation grew by 17% last year, led by wind and followed by what BP called “stunning” growth in solar. 
But strong economic growth led to above-average energy demand, coal use bounced back in China and efficiency gains slowed down, causing emissions to jump, the company’s annual statistical review of world energy found.
Spencer Dale, the group’s chief economist, said: “At first blush, from an energy transition perspective, these numbers potentially look a bit disappointing.”
The emissions rise was “slightly worrying” and a “pretty big backward step”, he said. “It suggests to me we are not on a path to the Paris climate goals.”
However, the economist said there was an inevitability to the backsliding, because 2014-16 had seen an exceptionally fast shift to greener power sources, led by short-term targets in China.
“I am more worried by the lack of progress in the power sector over the past 20 years, than by the pickup in carbon emissions last year,” he said. 
Dale said the power sector, in which BP has a limited presence, should do most of the heavy-lifting when it comes to future emissions cuts.
“It’s frustrating that so much energy is devoted to other bits of the [energy] sector where you get relatively little bang for your buck,” he said, in reference to emissions savings from switching from oil-burning cars to electric ones.
BP said the world’s appetite for oil remained strong, as it grew 1.8% last year. 
Production cuts by Opec and Russia had achieved their aim of bringing oil supply and demand back into balance, Dale said.
But he cautioned that oil prices – which recently hit $80 (£60) per barrel but have since fallen back to about $76 – were now so high they were beginning to curb oil demand.
“If we saw oil prices maintain at these levels, that would eat into oil demand,” he said. 
BP reported profits up 71% for the first three months of the year, off the back of the resurgent oil price.

They are often tiny, frequently brown and always challenging to identify but an average of one new species of pyralid moth each year is turning up in Britain, according to experts.
Almost 30 new species of this large family of “micro-moths” have been recorded over the last 30 years – either flying in themselves or being transported via the horticultural trade.
While the abundance of moths is in decline, more than 125 new species of moth have been spotted in Britain this century alone, with 27 species establishing themselves as breeding species.
People are being urged to spot and help document these new arrivals as part of this year’s Moth Night, an annual three-night event to record and celebrate moths, organised by Butterfly Conservation, the Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology and wildlife publisher Atropos.
“Just because something is called a micro-moth, don’t assume it’s tiny and brown and dull and impossible to identify because some of these aren’t,” said Richard Fox of Butterfly Conservation. “Moths in general are a fantastic, interesting group of wildlife that’s still relatively diverse – there are hundreds of species in your back garden. Anyone who is interested in wildlife will find that exciting and inspiring.”
Newly arrived micro-moths include Musotima nitidalis, originally from Australia and New Zealand, which reached Britain in 2009 via the horticultural trade. The moth is now found in several locations in southern England, where its caterpillars feed on ferns such as bracken.
Many of the recent pyralid colonists have arrived naturally, probably assisted by climate change, including the beautifully coloured Evergestis limbata, which has settled along the south coast of England.
According to Fox, most of the new arrivals are entirely benign although one, the box tree moth, will be unpopular with gardeners for its caterpillars’ habit of devouring the leaves of box hedges.
Easy to see native pyralids include the day-flying mint moth, which can be found among garden herbs and the small magpie – a surprisingly large black and white moth. Common migrants include the rush veneer and rusty-dot pearl.
The caterpillars of another group of pyralid moth, the china-marks, live in an air-filled bubble of spun leaves, sometimes below the surface of ponds or at the edge of streams.
As well as apps and online guides, there is a new guidebook on pyralid moths to help spotters. Mark Tunmore of publisher Atropos said: “New species are being added to the British list with regularity and we want to make sure that people are well equipped to identify these. We expect Moth Night 2018 to add to our knowledge of this group of moths.”

Plenty of people understand the term 'spiritual but not religious'.
BQEND
Plenty people use the the phrase 'spirtual but not religious' - whether they understand it to mean very much, or anything specific, or the same thing that someone else mean by it, is a different question.
Some of these people are atheists who may not realise they are atheists, or can't quite admit it to themselves, or know very well that they are atheists but don't want to say the word out loud for fear of being judged too harshly. Others are committed theists invested in specific theological traditions/doctrines, but no longer associate with organised religion so consider that they are ""not religious"". Others may be pantheists or adherents of some other fringe theology which has no ""religion"" to speak of, so they are ""not religious"". Others may be Buddhist, and don't consider that their beliefs are, technically, ""religious"" because they involve no deities. Others may have given it very little thought at all, but just like the phrase because it has a nice ring to it and makes them sound interesting and deep, or because it distances them from religious people they object to, or because someone they admire used it about themselves so they've adopted it too. 
""Spiritual but not religious"" is as fluffy and malleable a phrase as you could come up with.

""So why do disproven or unrealised theories that began with people like Schneider and Hansen keep persisting?""
BQEND
Because the fossil fuel industry (for their own benefit $$$) and GWD's keep promoting outdated, disproven, or often simply flat-out non-scientific nonsense somebody just made up, and fraudulently portraying it as valid science.
And it was NEVER Hansen's theory - that's an example of the lies the GWD's keep spreading. He simply had a software tool he had developed at NASA, which he let them borrow in their research. Stop falsely disparaging the man, and read -
https://www.skepticalscience.com/They-predicted-an-ice-age-in-the-70s.html

The idea that because a wacky idea persists it must therefore have merit is also faulty logic. The idea that the Earth is flat still persists among some people, like this guy -
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/03/25/flat-earther-blasts-california-sky-homemade-steam-powered-rocket/
Does that idea still persisting mean we should all doubt that the Earth is round?
BQSTART
""Why is their credibility in question"" 
BQEND
Hansen's wasn't - other than GWD's falsely attributing the theory to him, in order to try to discredit his legitimate research.
The 1971 paper you quoted was considered outlandish when it was written half a century ago, and was disavowed by Schneider shortly thereafter.
BQSTART
""How did their dodgy science get disproven? Was it by 'denialists'?""
BQEND
It was disproven by Schneider himself, when he realized the errors he had made, and published a RETRACTION of his earlier findings in 1974.
The fatally flawed and discredited-by-its-own-author study also said that increasing air pollution would cause the world to COOL over the next 50 years, and that we would be entering an ICE AGE right about now.

As I've pointed out to you before, ""pause"" is a completely inappropriate term (coined by contrarians who desperately wanted it to be so) for what was in truth merely a short-term slowdown. 
And when you consider that post-2000 warming has been at least as great - if not greater - than previously, it is obvious that the slowdown has been wiped out out by a corresponding speed-up. Why make a great song and dance about one, and remain silent on the other? That makes no sense at all.

attributing it to natural variation
BQEND
As I've also pointed out to you before, the IPCC told us nearly 30 years ago that there would be short-term deviations from the long-term warming trend, due to natural factors.

The Pope delivered | Bill McKibben,article,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/14/big-oil-ceo-climate-change-reality-check-pope,888,"You kind of expect popes to talk about spiritual stuff, kind of the way you expect chefs to discuss spices or tree surgeons to make small talk about overhanging limbs.
Which is why it was so interesting this week to hear Pope Francis break down the climate debate in very practical and very canny terms, displaying far more mathematical insight than your average world leader and far more strategic canniness than your average journalist. In fact, with a few deft sentences, he laid bare the hypocrisy that dominates much of the climate debate.
The occasion was the gathering of fossil fuel executives at the Vatican, one of a series of meetings to mark the third anniversary of Laudato Si, his majestic encyclical on global warming. The meetings were closed, but by all accounts big oil put forward its usual anodyne arguments: any energy transition must be slow, moving too fast to renewable energy would hurt the poor by raising prices, and so forth.
In response, Francis graciously thanked the oil executives for attending, and for “developing more careful approaches to the assessment of climate risk”. But then he got down to business. “Is it enough?” he asked. “Will we turn the corner in time? No one can answer that with certainty, but with each month that passes, the challenge of energy transition becomes more pressing.” Two and a half years after the Paris climate talks, he pointed out, “carbon dioxide emissions and atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases remain very high. This is disturbing and a cause for real concern.” Indeed.
It’s odd to have the pope schooling energy executives on the math of carbon
What’s really “worrying”, though, “is the continued search for new fossil fuel reserves, whereas the Paris agreement clearly urged keeping most fossil fuels underground”. And in that small sentence he calls the bluff on most of what passes for climate action among nations and among fossil fuel companies. Yes, Donald Trump notwithstanding, most countries have begun to take some steps to reduce demand for energy over time. Yes, oil companies have begun to grudgingly issue “climate risk reports” and divert minuscule percentages of their research budgets to renewables.
But no one has been willing to face the fact that we have to leave more than 80% of known fossil fuel reserves underground if we have any chance of meeting the Paris targets. No company has been willing to commit to leaving the coal and oil and gas in the earth, and almost no nation has been willing to make them do so. Instead, the big fossil fuel countries continue to aid and abet the big fossil fuel companies in the push for more mining and drilling. In Australia, the Turnbull government backs a massive new coalmine; in Canada, the Trudeau government literally buys a pipeline to keep the tar sands expanding; in the US, the federal government might as well be a wholly owned subsidiary of the fossil fuel companies.
In fact, as Francis points out, it’s not just that these companies and countries are committed to digging up the reserves they currently have. Even more insanely, they’re out there exploring for more. Companies like Exxon devote billions and billions of dollars to finding new oil fields, even though we have far more oil than we could ever safely burn.
All of this is morally wrong, as Francis points out. “Decisive progress cannot be made without an increased awareness that all of us are part of one human family, united by bonds of fraternity and solidarity. Only by thinking and acting with constant concern for this underlying unity that overrides all differences, only by cultivating a sense of universal intergenerational solidarity, can we set out really and resolutely on the road ahead,” he says.
Which is great – it’s the job of religious leaders to remind us to think beyond our own self-interest.
But Francis also understands that our current approach makes no mathematical sense. We can’t have a nice, slow, easy transition because we can’t put barely any more carbon in the atmosphere. We must solve the problem of energy access for the poor by using renewables, not fossil fuel, because “our desire to ensure energy for all must not lead to the undesired effect of a spiral of extreme climate changes due to a catastrophic rise in global temperatures, harsher environments and increased levels of poverty”. Above all, we’ve got to pay as much attention to actual reality as we do to political reality: “Civilization requires energy, but energy use must not destroy civilization!”
It’s odd to have the pope schooling energy executives on the math of carbon. But actually, no odder than NFL quarterbacks schooling politicians on racial injustice, or high school kids schooling a nation on the danger of guns. Amid the unprecedented wave of nonsense coming from DC, it’s good to remember that there are still people of all kinds able to pierce through the static and the shouting. Good common sense speaks even more loudly when it comes from unexpected corners.
… we can’t turn away from climate change. The Guardian’s environmental coverage reports the scientific facts, social consequences and political choices that are shaping the fate of our planet. As the world's leaders turn their backs on the environment, we are at a crisis point. Individual consumer choices are important, but we need collective action to achieve the systemic change that will really make a difference. Our pioneering and our fearless reporting on the environment can play a vital role in that. But we need our readers’ support.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute. Thank you.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/14/big-oil-ceo-climate-change-reality-check-pope

From a 3/2016 study:
BQSTART
In combination with previous findings, results suggest the permafrost region will become a carbon source to the atmosphere by 2100 regardless of warming scenario. 1
BQEND
And from the NSIDC
BQSTART
But if the Earth continues to warm, and a lot of permafrost thaws out, the Arctic could become an overall source of carbon to the atmosphere, instead of a sink. 
This is what scientists refer to as a ""tipping point."" We say that something has reached a tipping point when it switches from a relatively stable state to an unstoppable cycle. 
In this case, the Arctic would change from a carbon sink to a carbon source. If the Arctic permafrost releases more carbon than it absorbs, it would start a cycle where the extra carbon in the atmosphere leads to increased warming. 
The increased warming means more permafrost thawing and methane release. 2
BQEND
Yet the study I linked to went on the say “that 65%–85% of permafrost carbon release can still be avoided if human emissions are actively reduced.”
That would seem to disagree with the NSIDC, which indicated the process is unstoppable when the permafrost region becomes a net carbon emitter. 
This is an important question as there’s more than twice the carbon presently in the atmosphere locked up there.

The reason I'd be interested in hearing about this ""scientist"" you mention is because there's a pretty solid body of work to say that stratospheric sulfate injection is among the most stupid ideas possible. There's a pdf of a presentation given by Rutgers U climatologist Alan Robock that explains just how moronic it is at https://www.aps.org/units/fps/meetings/april2009/upload/geoengineering-robock09.PDF, which goes into detail about how partial reflection of incoming sunlight back to space will cause rapid localised cooling and weakening of the water cycle (less evaporation means less rain means droughts), plus destruction of stratospheric ozone (up in the sky, ozone protects us from solar UV) and generation of surface level ozone (ozone here at the surface is toxic, and a carcinogen; much better to have ozone up in the sky where it blocks UV and we don't breathe it).
Better ""geoengineering"" ideas would be to stop disrupting natural CO2 drawdown processes, such as terrestrial and marine primary productivity (trees and algae respectively). This would be done by encouraging reforestation, and stop whale-hunting (https://www.esa.org/esablog/research/poo-pump-whales-as-ecosystem-engineers/). 
Given that rapid warming of ocean surfaces is also disrupting marine overturning (further disrupting nutrient recycling by upwelling) I'd also suggest that Lovelock & Rapley's ""ocean pipes"" idea be revisited.

The final draft report from the UN’s intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) was due for publication in October. It is the guiding scientific document for what countries must do to combat climate change.
Human-induced warming would exceed 1.5C by about 2040 if emissions continued at their present rate, the report found, but countries could keep warming below that level if they made “rapid and far-reaching” changes.

Under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, almost 200 countries signed up to limit global temperature rises to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C.
Climate scientist and Climate Analytics director Bill Hare said the draft report showed with greater clarity how much faster countries needed to move towards decarbonisation under various temperature situations and that the impacts of climate change greatly increased between 1.5C and 2C of warming.
Necessary actions include making the transition to renewable energy, powering the transport sector with zero carbon electricity, improving agricultural management and stopping deforestation. 
“This IPCC report shows anyone drawing from published papers that there are big differences between 1.5 and 2 degrees warming in both natural and human systems,” Hare said. “Two degrees warming and the tropical reefs have basically no chance – 1.5 degrees, they have a small to modest chance of survival.
“There’s a range of commentary that comes out of the report that provides a stronger narrative for us to act than ever before.”
He said it showed that if emissions continued on their present pathway, there was no chance of limiting global temperature rises even to 3C.
Economic modelling in the draft report showed that the dangers for economic growth, particularly in developing countries, were significantly greater at 2C than 1.5C.
The Greenpeace International executive director, Jennifer Morgan, said the moment of truth had come for leaders and the feasibility of achieving the Paris goals was a political choice.
“This choice must be driven by a moral obligation that binds us together. Through international cooperation, real ambition and working with communities, our leaders still have the time to do what they must,” she said.
“That means saying no to fossil fuels and standing up for forest and ocean protection with decisions that prove they understand the urgency. It means cutting down on meat and dairy consumption, and changing the way we produce our food.”
… we can’t turn away from climate change. The Guardian’s environmental coverage reports the scientific facts, social consequences and political choices that are shaping the fate of our planet. As the world's leaders turn their backs on the environment, we are at a crisis point. Individual consumer choices are important, but we need collective action to achieve the systemic change that will really make a difference. Our pioneering and our fearless reporting on the environment can play a vital role in that. But we need our readers’ support.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute.

Over 30 years of political limpness, expressing nothing but inaction on climate change - denial. And it's not just restricted to climate change - over 60 years since we were warned about there unrestrained use of pesticides. Ditto for other polluting chemicals, even those that enter food chains - including ours. We’ve been truly shafted by corporate-driven ‘governments’ who couldn’t give a toss about the environment therefore couldn’t give a toss about society. The chilling reality of what they’ve become.

Don't be ridiculous. That's the kneejerk reaction that politicians fear when they try to have a sensible debate.
The 'replacement rate' for the UK is around 2.05, ie the average births per woman (fertility rate) that would result in a stable population. The actual fertility rate of UK people is less than 2.0. Which means that the current population growth is due entirely to net immigration. Therefore if a policy of zero net immigration were introduced, the long-term effect on population would be a slide downwards. Managing the change slowly over a long term is the right way to go, because we know from Japan's situation that rapid changes create their own difficulties.
So, no need for any of the draconian measures you mention. Just a proper reaction to the current situation. The exploding populations in many parts of the world each need different solutions. But fundamentally those countries need solution to be implemented at source. The 'west' simply cannot absorb the billions seeking a better life. But we can help them have it at home.

Look at fish farmed salmon, or rather don't if you don't want nightmares. Poring pesticides into the water to kill parasites & ethoxyquine as antioxidant in fish food to produce . Salmon the worlds most toxic food. 
Then there's Glyphosate poisoning our soils There is evidence to show that glyphosate in the food chain is having serious adverse effects on our health.
Unless you have access to previously untouched/uncultivated land, I don't think our food supply is safe. You can't get away from chemical residues anywhere.

He recalls his early morning walks through its lanes, past the porches of houses on his round. At virtually every home, he saw the same picture: windows plastered with tiger moths that had been attracted by lights the previous night and were still clinging to the glass. “It was quite a sight,” says Leather, who is now a professor of entomology at Harper Adams University in Shropshire.
But it is not a vision that he has experienced in recent years. Those tiger moths have almost disappeared. “You hardly see any, although there used to be thousands in summer and that was just a couple of villages.”

The start of summer is the time of year when the nation’s insects should make their presence known by coating countryside windows with their fluttering presence, and splattering themselves on car windscreens. But they are spectacularly failing to do so. Instead they are making themselves newsworthy through their absence. Britain’s insects, it seems, are disappearing.
This point was underlined last week when tweets from the naturalist and TV presenter Chris Packham went viral after he commented on the absence of insects during a weekend at his home in the New Forest. Packham said he had not seen a single butterfly in his garden, and added that he sleeps with his windows open but rarely finds craneflies or moths in his room in the morning. By contrast, they were commonplace when he was a boy. “Our generation is presiding over an ecological apocalypse and we’ve somehow or other normalised it,” he later said.
Certainly, the statistics are grim. Native ladybird populations are crashing; three quarters of butterfly species – such as the painted lady and the Glanville fritillary – have dropped significantly in numbers; while bees, of which there are more than 250 species in the UK, are also suffering major plunges in populations, with great yellow bumblebees, solitary potter flower bees and other species declining steeply in recent years. Other threatened insects include the New Forest cicada, the tansy beetle and the oil beetle.
As for moths, some of the most beautiful visitors to our homes and gardens, the picture is particularly alarming. Apart from the tiger moth, which was once widespread in the UK, the V-moth (Marcaria wauaria) recorded a 99% fall in numbers between 1968 and 2007 and is now threatened with extinction, a fate that has already befallen the orange upperwing, the bordered gothic and the Brighton wainscot in recent years.
An insect Armageddon is under way, say many entomologists, the result of a multiple whammy of environmental impacts: pollution, habitat changes, overuse of pesticides, and global warming. And it is a decline that could have crucial consequences. Our creepy crawlies may have unsettling looks but they lie at the foot of a wildlife food chain that makes them vitally important to the makeup and nature of the countryside. They are “the little things that run the world” according to the distinguished Harvard biologist Edward O Wilson, who once observed: “If all humankind were to disappear, the world would regenerate back to the rich state of equilibrium that existed 10,000 years ago. If insects were to vanish, the environment would collapse into chaos.”
The best illustration of the ecological importance of insects is provided by our birdlife. Without insects, hundred of species face starvation and some ornithologists believe this lack of food is already causing serious declines in bird numbers, a point stressed by the naturalist and wildlife author Michael McCarthy. “Britain’s farmland birds have more than halved in number since 1970,” he points out. “Some declines have been catastrophic: the spotted flycatcher, a specialist predator of aerial insects, has both declined by more than 95%, while the red-backed shrike, which feeds on big beetles, became extinct in Britain in the 1990s.”
Further confirmation of the link between insect and bird numbers was provided last week with the publication of a study by Aberdeen University researchers which showed that the plunge in numbers of cuckoos in some areas of England was closely linked to declines in tiger moth caterpillars on which cuckoos feed.
“There is now a lot of correlational evidence to show that when certain insects do badly, very often the birds that feed on them get into trouble as well,” said David Gibbon, of the RSPB.
However, insects also play invaluable roles in other parts of the environment – for example as pollinators of our orchards and fruit fields. And again, scientists are worried. “People think that it is just bees that pollinate orchards, but there are huge numbers of flies that also pollinate – and they are all also threatened,” said Leather.
In addition, flies, beetles and wasps are predators and decomposers who control pests and who generally clean up the countryside. “Just think of the work of the dung beetle,” added Leather. “If they go, the land would be covered with the excrement of cows, sheep and other animals.
But perhaps the most alarming indication of the ecological apocalypse we face was provided a few months ago by researchers who published a startling paper in the journal Plos One. Their work was based on the efforts of dozens of amateur entomologists in Germany who began employing strictly standardised ways of collecting insects in 1989. They used special tents called malaise traps to capture thousands of samples of insects in flight over dozens of different nature reserves.
Then the weight of the insects caught in each sample was measured and analysed – revealing a remarkable pattern. The annual average weight of insects found in the traps fell by 76% over the 27-year period of their research. Most alarming, however, was the discovery that the decrease was even higher – 82% – in summer, a time when insect numbers should reach their peak.
Such figures give strong numerical support to the veracity of anecdotes about splattered car windscreens and moth-plastered patio windows becoming a thing of the past. Equally stark is the fact that although meteorological patterns fluctuated to some degree during the years of the study, it was clear that weather was not the cause of the declines.
But perhaps the most alarming aspect of the research was the realisation that these grim drops in insect numbers were occurring in nature reserves – in other words, in areas where the landscape was highly protected and should be the most friendly of habitats for insects. Conditions elsewhere were likely to be a lot worse, the scientists warned.
“Insects make up about two-thirds of all life on Earth [but] there has been some kind of horrific decline,” Professor Dave Goulson of Sussex University, said at the time. “We appear to be making vast tracts of land inhospitable to most forms of life, and are currently on course for ecological armageddon. If we lose the insects, then everything is going to collapse.”
The fact that insect biomass has been declining at a steady rate for almost three decades strongly suggests some profound influences must be at work. Most entomologists believe habitat change lies at the heart of the problem. “There have been massive alterations to the way we use the land and it is hard not to believe these are closely involved in what we are seeing,” said Leather.
As he points out, intensively farmed wheat and cornfields support virtually no insect life, and this means that as intensive agriculture spreads there are fewer and fewer islands of natural habitat left to support them.
And then there is the issue of urban spread. Housing schemes continue to encroach on our woods and heaths so that streets and buildings generate light pollution that leads nocturnal insects astray and interrupts their mating. “That is the reason we see most changes to insect life in south-east England, for that is where we see the greatest spread of cities and towns,” said Leather.
In addition to habitat changes, there are the dangers posed by pesticides, in particular neonicotinoid pesticides, which have already been blamed for recent crashes in bee populations. These chemicals are water soluble and so leach out of fields after they are applied to crops.
According to research quoted in the journal Science last year, these pesticides have since been found in high concentrations in nectar and pollen in wildflowers near treated fields. Though still not at levels sufficiently high to kill insects directly, they do affect their abilities to navigate and communicate.
In the face of this mixture of ecological woes, it is perhaps not surprising that insects in Britain are faring so badly. Whether or not they face an ecological apocalypse is a different matter, for not every expert shares a sense of doom. Professor Helen Roy of the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, for example, sees cause for hope. She told the Observer that there were too many success stories – tales of insects that were recovering in numbers and thriving – to feel a sense of despair. “Obviously, many species are suffering, but I am an optimist and I just don’t think it is right to call this an apocalypse,” she said.
Roy pointed to explosions in the number of ladybirds and painted lady butterflies that have occurred in the past as evidence. “There are huge variations in numbers of a particular insect species in a year and huge variation in the places you see them.” She also pointed to one study of pollinators that showed while 32% became less widespread between 1980 and 2014, 16% became more widespread. “It is not all doom and gloom,” Roy added.
This view was supported by David Gibbons of the RSPB who agreed that not every investigation about insect numbers revealed a tale of irrevocable decline – though he added that he still believed the overall picture was worrying. “It is hard not to see a link between some of the bird number declines and drops in insect populations we are experiencing. There are very close correlations in many cases. But proving there is a causative link – in establishing the one effect is leading to the other – is much more difficult.”
We appear to be making tracts of land inhospitable to most forms of life. If we lose insects, it all collapses
An illustration of the problem is provided by one of the few cases where a causative link between insect loss and bird-number declines has been established: the grey partridge, Gibbons said. “During the 70s and 80s, pesticides were killing off plants on which sawflies and other insects fed. Grey partridge chicks feed on these insects and so this process led to a decline in their numbers – and that has since become dramatic.” In fact, the grey partridge’s drop in numbers has brought its population to less than 5% of its figure last century.
The crucial point is that researchers were able to show that these twin declines were connnected by manipulating herbicide levels in places where chicks were being reared. When herbicide levels went up, insect levels went down and so did bird numbers. “That manipulation provided the causative link,” said Gibbons. “It was possible to change insect numbers and so see the impact. However, such research is difficult to carry out and is very rare.”
And of course, threats to our birdlife are only one aspect of the dangers posed by losses of insects in the UK. As entomologists point out, they also keep our soil fertile, degrade waste, pollinate our orchards and control pests such as the aphid.
“We cannot afford to lose them and that’s what makes this issue so urgent and so important,” Leather concluded. “That’s worth keeping in mind as the summer evenings begin – and we see hardly any insects.”
Many of Britain’s native species of ladybirds are suffering serious declines in numbers, thanks to the arrival of the harlequin ladybird. It has been declared the UK’s fastest invading species, after reaching almost every corner of the country in just a decade. It preys on native ladybirds and is believed to have caused the decline of at least seven species, including the popular two-spot ladybird, which – when last assessed in 2012 – had slumped by 44% in numbers.
More than 2,500 moth species have been recorded in Great Britain, of which around 900 are called larger moths. In the report The State of Britain’s Larger Moths 2013, it was revealed that larger moths had declined by 28% between 1968 and 2007. This was most noticeable in southern Britain where there was a 40% decline. By contrast, numbers showed no significant change in northern Britain, where disappearing species are balanced by moths spreading north because of climate change.
Seventy of the 100 crop species that provide 90% of food worldwide are pollinated by bees. In the UK, there are more than 250 species of bee: 25 species of bumble bee, 224 species of solitary bee and one honey bee species. According to a government report in 2014, figures there has been an overall decline in wild and honey bees over the past 50 years. The figures also revealed evidence that there has been parallel declines in the plants that rely on them for pollination.
The State of the UK’s Butterflies report – produced in 2015 by Butterfly Conservation – provided further evidence of “the serious, long-term and ongoing decline of UK butterflies”. Overall, 76% of the UK’s resident and regular migrant butterfly species had declined in either abundance or occurrence (or both) over the past four decades, it was found. “This is of great concern not just for butterflies but for other wildlife species and the overall state of the environment,” the report noted.
These insects eat large volumes of slugs and aphids and large numbers of weed seeds, thus helping to stop fields being overrun by unwanted plants and pests. However, a study, published in the Journal of Applied Ecology in 2012 - which looked at 68 beetle species at 11 locations around the British Isles over 15 years - found that three-quarters of those examined had declined in number over the periodOf these, half had fallen at rate equivalent to 30% per decade.

The swelling oceans are forecast repeatedly to soak coastal residences collectively worth $120bn by 2045 if greenhouse gas emissions are not severely curtailed, experts warn. This will potentially inflict a huge financial and emotional toll on the half a million Americans who live in the properties at risk of having their basements, backyards, garages or living rooms inundated every other week.
“The impact could well be staggering,” said Kristina Dahl, a senior climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). “This level of flooding would be a tipping point where people in these communities would think it’s unsustainable.
“Even homes along the Gulf coast that are elevated would be affected, as they’d have to drive through salt water to get to work or face their kids’ school being cut off. You can imagine people walking away from mortgages, away from their homes.”
This is a modal window.
The UCS used federal data from a high sea level rise scenario projected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and combined it with property data from the online real estate company Zillow to quantify the level of risk across the lower 48 states.
Under this scenario, where planet-warming emissions are barely constrained and the seas rise by about 6.5ft globally by the end of the century, 311,000 homes along the US coastline would face flooding on average 26 times a year within the next 30 years – a typical lifespan for a new mortgage.
The losses would multiply by the end of the century, with the research warning that as many as 2.4m homes, worth around a trillion dollars, could be put at risk. Low-lying states would be particularly prone, with a million homes in Florida, 250,000 homes in New Jersey and 143,000 homes in New York at risk of chronic flooding by 2100.
Unfortunately, many coastal communities will face declining property values as risk perceptions catch up with reality
This persistent flooding is likely to rattle the housing market by lowering property prices and making mortgages untenable in certain areas. Flood insurance premiums could rise sharply, with people faced with the choice of increasing clean-up costs or retreating to higher ground inland.
“Unfortunately, in the years ahead many coastal communities will face declining property values as risk perceptions catch up with reality,” said Rachel Cleetus, an economist and climate policy director at UCS. “In contrast with previous housing market crashes, values of properties chronically inundated due to sea level rise are unlikely to recover and will only continue to go further underwater, literally and figuratively.”
The report does not factor in future technological advances that could ameliorate the impact of rising seas, although the US would be starting from a relatively low base compared with some countries given that it does not have a national sea level rise plan. And the current Trump administration has moved to erase the looming issue from consideration for federally funded infrastructure.
The oceans are rising by about 3mm a year due to the thermal expansion of seawater that’s warming because of the burning of fossil fuels by humans. The melting of massive glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica is also pushing up the seas – Nasa announced last week that the amount of ice lost annually from Antarctica has tripled since 2012 to an enormous 241bn tons a year.
This slowly unfolding scenario is set to pose wrenching choices for many in the US. Previous research has suggested that about 13 million Americans may have to move due to sea level rise by the end of the century, with landlocked states such as Arizona and Wyoming set for a population surge.
“My flood insurance bill just went up by $100 this year, it went up $100 the year before,” said Philip Stoddard, the mayor of South Miami. “People on the waterfront won’t be able to stay unless they are very wealthy. This isn’t a risk, it’s inevitable.
“Miami is a beautiful and interesting place to live – I’m looking at a lizard on my windowsill right now. But people will face a cost to live here that will creep up and up. At some point they will have to make a rational economic decision and they may relocate. Some people will make the trade-off to live here. Some won’t.”

global warming predictions have stood up. They conclude that they haven’t stood up very well. Drawing this conclusions, however, requires making some rather odd claims. For example 
Global surface temperature has not increased significantly since 2000, discounting the larger-than-usual El Niño of 2015-16.Well, if you leave out some data you can draw all sorts of conclusions. However, why was the 2015/2016 El Niño warmer than the 1997/1998 El Niño? Why are La Niñ’a’s today warmer than El Niño’s of the past? It’s because there’s an underlying warming trend and, as the figure on the right shows, there is little indication that the rate of warming has slowed.

Someone often responds to things Hansen says by saying he is not a good scientist, or he’s an activist or an alarmist, so for those people, I’ll note that he is one of the planet's most accomplished climate scientists with a long track record of accurate projections.
BQEND
I would suggest the proof of James Hansen`s abilities are in the accuracy of his predictions and to quote the WSJ recently:
BQSTART
Thirty years of data have been collected since Mr. Hansen outlined his scenarios—enough to determine which was closest to reality. And the winner is Scenario C. Global surface temperature has not increased significantly since 2000, discounting the larger-than-usual El Niño of 2015-16. Assessed by Mr. Hansen’s model, surface temperatures are behaving as if we had capped 18 years ago the carbon-dioxide emissions responsible for the enhanced greenhouse effect. But we didn’t. And it isn’t just Mr. Hansen who got it wrong. Models devised by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have, on average, predicted about twice as much warming as has been observed since global satellite temperature monitoring began 40 years ago.

From early on, the significance of Hansen’s insights was recognized by the scientific community. “The work that he did in the seventies, eighties, and nineties was absolutely groundbreaking,” Spencer Weart, a physicist turned historian who has studied the efforts to understand climate change, told me.

 As with all of the coastal Magnox Sites an ongoing issue for Hinkley Point A during the C&M phase is the vulnerability of the site to flooding due to raised sea level and more frequent storm surges brought about by the anticipated effects of climate change in the coming decades. The site is situated on low-lying land at sea level on the coast of the Bristol Channel which is highly tidal at that location and historic instances of storm surge flooding (e.g. Bristol Channel Flood 1607) means that the site is potentially vulnerable. The C&M phase at the site, during which the reactors will be in Safestore, is scheduled to last until 2081, by which approximate time (2090-99) the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has projected that the worst case scenario (emission scenario A1FI) of sea level rise is in the range 0.26 – 0.59m (relative to 1980-99 levels).1 The site is situated at an elevation of 11m above Ordnance Datum (mAOD), and is protected from flooding and erosion by a concrete sea wall founded on the shoreline rock platform (crest height 8.5m) and a secondary gabion wall (crest 12m) behind the main sea wall. 1

Among them was Hinkley Point in Somerset, one of the eight proposed sites for new nuclear power stations around the coasts.
That was before the increasing volume of melting of the Greenland ice cap was properly understood and when most experts thought there was no net melting in the Antarctic. 
Satellite measurements released earlier this month and other recent observations of how warmer seas are eroding ice shelves and glaciers have removed uncertainty.
Estimates of sea level rise in the next 50 years have gone up from less than 30cm to more than a metre, well within the lifespan of the nuclear stations the UK government has planned. 
The extra coastal erosion and threat of storm surges that this increase in sea level will bring to our shores might make sensible people think twice about siting any buildings in vulnerable places, let alone nuclear power stations. 
So far, however, the government has yet to respond and is pressing ahead with its plans. 
… in the fight to protect the environment. By keeping the Guardian’s environmental coverage open and accessible, we can report on the changes needed to avoid climate and natural catastrophe. The choices made by individuals are important, but we need to work together for the systemic transformation that will make a real difference. As well as reporting the facts about what is happening now, we investigate the causes and talk to the people trying to make the future better. But we need our readers’ support.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute.

old nuclear powerstations built in the 70/80s with their initial capital paid off years ago and fuel at an all time low cost and often 20 year extensions to their operations cannot compete with new renewables and new gas plants why?
BQENDOkay, well commercial nuclear power is traded like other capacity sources (per kWh) such as gas at a forward (futures) price.
So where there is a surplus of electrical supply then the market has a choice - and providers have to tender at the lowest price.
If gas suppliers say that they can sell electricity on the c/market for less than nuclear can then they've undercut nuclear and nuclear loses that income and thus becomes uneconomic to operate.

(Reuters) - The capacity auction in the PJM power grid is not expected to change plans to retire several nuclear reactors in Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey over the next few years, analysts said on Tuesday. 
PJM, which operates the grid in all or parts of 13 U.S. Mid Atlantic and Midwest states, will release the results of its capacity auction Wednesday afternoon. Last year’s auction was worth about $7 billion.
FirstEnergy Corp and Exelon Corp plan to retire six reactors in PJM before 2022 as cheap natural gas from shale fields has depressed power prices over the past several years, making it uneconomic for generators to keep operating some nuclear plants.
“Our forecast of the auction results is slightly better than last year, but it won’t be enough to change plans to close reactors,” said Michael Weinstein, energy analyst at Credit Suisse.
PJM uses the capacity auction to make sure the grid has enough resources in the future. In the latest auction, PJM sought about 166,000 megawatts of capacity for the June 2021-May 2022 delivery year.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pjm-auction-nuclear/pjm-auction-will-not-stop-nuclear-units-from-retiring-analysts-idUSKCN1IN2ZD>Solar quadruples in big US capacity auction as electricity price soarsUnit cost of power is set to almost double for around a fifth of the US population in three years’ time as abandonment of all-of-the-above Obama strategy sees fewer generators participate in PJM capacity auctionhttps://www.pv-magazine.com/2018/05/24/solar-quadruples-in-big-us-capacity-auction-as-electricity-price-soars/
BQENDSo now that gas has forced a lot of clean capacity ff the market, the prices rise supporting coal, gas,

But investing in nuclear is part of the mix - that's what Hansen says and it's in completely line of the DDPP. Nobody is saying nuclear instead of renewables.

As quoted above, Hansen seems to be saying more than this, which is what Oreskes was critical of.

BQENDWell the quote above is
Hansen: ""Nuclear, especially next-generation nuclear, has tremendous potential to be part of the solution to climate change,"" Hansen said during a panel discussion yesterday. ""The dangers of fossil fuels are staring us in the face. So for us to say we won't use all the tools [such as nuclear energy] to solve the problem is crazy.""

The best thing for the planet would have been if Germany had left nuclear alone. Do you agree? 
BQSTART
No. Or at least I don't agree that we can know this with any confidence now. 
BQEND
BQENDBut we know that Germany has installed huge amounts of renewable energy yet its emissions have not fallen in proportion so they are missing their climate targets. They've already abandoned their 2020 target as unattainable.
Surely the closure of nuclear plants and commissioning new coal plants has to viewed in that context and we are confident that we understand the carbon ramifications of both.
BQSTART
 
BQSTART
Germany's emissions alone is not a way to fully judge the success of the strategy.
BQEND
BQENDWhen Japan closed nuclear plants for safety checks and switched to coal their emissions shot up. The same with France.
The UK bought in a carbon tax specifically targeted at coal and built lot of offshore wind and our emissions have come down and all observers agree that the UK plan for a mix of renewables+nuclear and the abandonment of coal means that we are very well placed.
Despite the massive renewables roll out, Germany is down rated and has actually slipped down the ranks.
 Climate Change Performance Index 2017Germany was: 27th place Now 29th place""Germany continued its downward trend in this year’s CCPI.Although the country remains in the group of relatively goodperformers with respect to renewable energies (rank 18),Germany is not on track to reach its 2020 emissions reductiontargets. Experts criticise Germany’s current domestic negotiationson its long-term climate strategy, which is supposedto lay the foundation for the implementation of Germany’spart of the Paris goals. According to the experts, the negotiationshave been dominated and continuously delayed by theself-serving interests of the coal industry and some of theother energy-intensive industries. To climb up the rankingin the coming years, Germany will have to increase its ambitionon sectoral targets for emissions reduction and comeforward with an adequate plan to phase out coal.

James Hansen had something relevant to say in a recent mailing regarding 2017 global surface temperature.
BQSTART
the 2017 global temperature remains stubbornly high, well above the trend line (Fig. 1), despite cooler than average temperature in the tropical Pacific Niño 3.4 region (Fig. 5), which usually provides an indication of the tropical Pacific effect on global temperature7. 
Conceivably this continued temperature excursion above the trend line is not a statistical fluke, but rather is associated with climate forcings and/or feedbacks. The growth rate of greenhouse gas climate forcing has accelerated in the past decade.3 There is also concern that polar climate feedbacks may accelerate.8
Therefore, temperature change during even the next few years is of interest, to determine whether a significant excursion above the trend line is underway.

OPatrick - Germany's strategy (though strategy may be too generous a word), is a long-term one and the long-term impacts are what it needs to be judged on.

No, that's nonsense. The ""long term"" is too late.To meet its Paris obligations, the EU must shut all its coal by 2030, (and nearly three quarters of it by 2025):
BQSTART
A STRESS TEST FOR COAL IN EUROPE UNDER THE PARIS AGREEMENT SCIENTIFIC GOALPOSTS FOR A COORDINATED PHASE-OUT AND DIVESTMENT Climate Analytics, February 2017 
Executive Summary
The long-term temperature goal adopted under the Paris Agreement of holding temperature increase to “well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels” requires a rapid decarbonisation of the global power sector and the phase-out of the last unabated coal-fired power plant in the EU by around 2030.
To stay within the Paris Agreement temperature limit, a quarter of the coal-fired power plants already operating in the EU would need to be switched off before 2020; a further 47% should go offline by 2025....In Germany alone new capacity commissioned in the last decade is comparable with the total capacity of Spain or Italy. Unless these plants are retired before the end of their lifetime, emissions will be locked into the system longer than what would be consistent with the EU’s GHG emissions reduction targets.
BQEND
Every year of delay, every year of missed targets, means that subsequent reductions must be faster and deeper. Germany has already said it'll only cut half its coal by 2030, which
automatically causes it to miss its Paris commitments.

But investing in nuclear is part of the mix - that's what Hansen says and it's in completely line of the DDPP. Nobody is saying nuclear instead of renewables.
BQENDAs quoted above, Hansen seems to be saying more than this, which is what Oreskes was critical of. He, and the others, appear to be saying that renewables cannot cut emissions sufficiently without nuclear and that it is
essential we have a major expansion of nuclear power. The DDPP provide several pathways, including ones that do not rely heavily on nuclear and would see little if any further investment in it.
BQSTART
The best thing for the planet would have been if Germany had left nuclear alone. Do you agree?
BQENDNo. Or at least I don't agree that we can know this with any confidence now. Germany's strategy (though strategy may be too generous a word), is a long-term one and the long-term impacts are what it needs to be judged on. As I have said several times, an important part of that is the stimulus it has potentially given to development of renewables technology, which has global benefits, so focusing on Germany's emissions alone is not a way to fully judge the success of the strategy. And although I agree that earlier emissions cuts have more significance due to the cumulative nature of emissions, if their strategy leads to a rapid reduction in emissions over the next couple of decades, as there is some evidence it might, then over all this could mean that they were successful even when just considering the narrow case of their own emissions.', u'recommendation_count': u'2', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1530102369000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'4214448', u'in_reply_to': u'117506762', u'id': u'117517083', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'onthefence', u'text': u'BQSTART

That should be a red flag.
According to the elliptical variations in the Earth’s orbit (a set of cycles with overall cycle times of hundreds of thousands of years) the Earth should be in a slow cooling pattern. According to the other two Milankovitch Cycles (Axial Tilt and Precession, with cycle times of 41,000 and 22,000 years) the Earth should also be slowly cooling because we were heading into the next glaciation, and until about a hundred years ago this was the prevailing pattern.
For the six thousand years leading up to the Industrial Revolution the pattern was slow cooling at an average rate of about 0.2 degrees C per millennium. There were ups and downs due to changes in ocean currents and solar output, but at most those changes were around 0.1 degree C per century and after five or six hundred years the average global temps returned to the cooling trend. (Graph of the last 20,000 years of global temperature) 
In the last hundred years we have seen global temperatures climb just over a full degree C with the majority of that increase in the last forty years. Solar out put has actually been declining slightly during those last forty years. 
So what was that alternative theory that explained the observed facts supporting AGW again?
Further evidence the planet is warming very rapidly? Ice is melting all over the planet, because the world is above average in temperature. The N hemisphere is above average, the S hemisphere is above average, the Arctic is way above average, the tropics are above average, the Antarctic is above average.
We have thermometers analyzed by NASA, NOAA, the British Met Office, the Japanese, the Berkeley group.
If you throw away every thermometer in the city, temperatures in the country show warming.
Thermometers in the ground show warming, thermometers in the ocean show the ocean is warming, thermometers in balloons show warming, looking down from satellites they show warming.
Warmer air contains more moisture, so some areas are seeing storms with heavier than usual snowfall, such as Boston in some of the last few years.
But if you look at the snow and ice that care about temperature the most, we have less river ice than we used to, less lake ice, less seasonal snow cover, less seasonally frozen ground, less perennially frozen ground, we have smaller glaciers, we have shrinking ice sheets, we have loss of sea ice.

If we continue reading the same article, we find these 3 paragraphs:

Most of these shuttered projects have been doomed by one factor: cost. Given cheap natural gas and the continued fall in solar photovoltaic prices, concentrated solar has been priced out of the market. Concentrated solar plants use thousands of mirrors to focus the sun’s rays on a tower, where they heat a liquid to make steam. The mirrors, known as heliostats, are motorized so as to track the sun’s path over the course of the day. The process has certain advantages over solar photovoltaic technology, including higher efficiencies in terms of the amount of solar energy converted to electricity, but in today’s low-cost environment it’s simply too expensive. 
At least that’s true in the United States. Executives at BrightSource and rival SolarReserve point out that a number of projects are moving forward in other countries that lack low-cost supplies of natural gas, particularly in the Middle East and Africa. China, which is plowing billions of yuan into clean energy schemes in order to reduce its dependency on coal, plans to build at least a gigawatt of concentrated solar capacity in the coming years, and could expand that to 10 gigawatts. Going forward, both companies also plan to add energy storage capacity, in the form of molten salt, that can enable new plants to continue producing electricity for as much as 10 hours when the sun's not shining.
For now, says SolarReserve CEO Kevin Smith, market conditions in the U.S. “have forced us overseas.” SolarReserve is developing a 100-megawatt in South Africa, known as Redstone. And BrightSource is building a 121-megawatt facility, featuring the world’s tallest solar tower collector, at Ashalim in Israel. “You need to look beneath the surface and beyond the U.S.,” says Joe Desmond, senior vice president of marketing at BrightSource.

So I'm not overly perturbed about solar thermal's future, except that solar PV or wind or some other renewable technology I've not listed in the tedious argy-bargy that has been this exchange - and some other storage technology - may turn out to be even cheaper.

So it appears that much of the pre-1960 data were related to incendiary forest fires (per http://www.interfire.org/features/wildfires.asp, an incendiary fire is one that is set intentionally) and not to true wildfires. The post-1960 dataset that I analyzed only contained data for wildfires; the National Interagency Fire Center explicitly separates the wildfire data from the prescribed fire data. Hence, comparisons to earlier data may indeed be akin to comparing apples to oranges, as Magma cautioned earlier in their comment.

In his testimony, Hansen showed the results of his 1988 study using a climate model to project future global warming under three possible scenarios, ranging from ‘business as usual’ heavy pollution in his Scenario A to ‘draconian emissions cuts’ in Scenario C, with a moderate Scenario B in between.
Changes in the human effects that influence Earth’s global energy imbalance (a.k.a. ‘anthropogenic radiative forcings’) have in reality been closest to Hansen’s Scenario B, but about 20–30% weaker thanks to the success of the Montreal Protocol in phasing out chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Hansen’s climate model projected that under Scenario B, global surface air temperatures would warm about 0.84°C between 1988 and 2017. But with a global energy imbalance 20–30% lower, it would have predicted a global surface warming closer to 0.6–0.7°C by this year.
The actual 1988–2017 temperature increase was about 0.6°C. Hansen’s 1988 global climate model was almost spot-on.
The incredible accuracy of Hansen’s climate model predictions debunks a number of climate denier myths. It shows that climate models are accurate and reliable, that global warming is proceeding as climate scientists predicted, and thus that we should probably start listening to them and take action to address the existential threat it poses.
Hansen’s predictions have thus become a target of climate denier misinformation. It began way back in 1998, when the Cato Institute’s Patrick Michaels – who has admitted that something like 40% of his salary comes from the fossil fuel industry – arguably committed perjury in testimony to Congress. Invited by Republicans to testify as the Kyoto Protocol climate agreement was in the works, Michaels was asked to evaluate how Hansen’s predictions were faring 10 years later. 
In his presentation, Michaels deleted Hansen’s Scenarios B and C – the ones closest to reality – and only showed Scenario A to make it seem as though Hansen had drastically over-predicted global warming. Deleting inconvenient data in order to fool his audience became a habit for Patrick Michaels, who quickly earned a reputation of dishonesty in the climate science world, but has nevertheless remained a favorite of oil industry and conservative media.
Last week in the Wall Street Journal, Michaels was joined by Ryan Maue in an op-ed that again grossly distorted Hansen’s 1988 paper. Maue is a young scientist with a contrarian streak who’s published some serious research on hurricanes, but since joining the Cato Institute last year, seems to have sold off his remaining credibility to the fossil fuel industry.
In their WSJ opinion piece, Michaels and Maue claimed:
Global surface temperature has not increased significantly since 2000, discounting the larger-than-usual El Niño of 2015-16. Assessed by Mr. Hansen’s model, surface temperatures are behaving as if we had capped 18 years ago the carbon-dioxide emissions responsible for the enhanced greenhouse effect.
They provided no evidence to support this claim (evidence and facts seem not to be allowed on the WSJ Opinion page), and it takes just 30 seconds to fact check. In reality, global surface temperatures have increased by about 0.35°C since 2000 – precisely in line with Hansen’s 1988 model projections, as shown above. And it’s unscientific to simply “discount” the El Niño of 2015-16, because between the years 1999 and 2014, seven were cooled by La Niña events while just four experienced an El Niño warming. Yet despite the preponderance of La Niña events, global surface temperatures still warmed 0.15°C during that time. There’s simply not an ounce of truth to Michaels’ and Maue’s central WSJ claim.
Dumbest sentence in WSJ oped: ""Global surface temperature has not increased significantly since 2000, discounting the larger-than-usual El Niño of 2015-16."" Translation: ""Temperature has not increased if you omit the data showing it has increased.""
It’s also worth noting that Hansen’s 1988 paper accurately predicted the geographic pattern of global warming, with the Arctic region warming fastest and more warming over land masses than the oceans. And climate deniers in the 1980s like Richard Lindzen were predicting “that the likelihood over the next century of greenhouse warming reaching magnitudes comparable to natural variability seems small.” If anyone deserves criticism for inaccurate climate predictions, it’s deniers like Lindzen who thought there wouldn’t be any significant warming, when in reality we’ve seen the dramatic global warming that James Hansen predicted.
Michaels’ and Maue’s misinformation didn’t stop there:
And it isn’t just Mr. Hansen who got it wrong. Models devised by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have, on average, predicted about twice as much warming as has been observed since global satellite temperature monitoring began 40 years ago.
Once again, this unsupported assertion is completely wrong. I evaluated the IPCC’s global warming projections in my book, and showed in detail that theirs have been among the most accurate predictions. The climate model temperature projections in the 1990, 1995, 2001, and 2007 IPCC reports were all remarkably accurate; the IPCC predicted global warming almost exactly right. 
We don’t even have to guess at the motivation behind Michaels’ and Maue’s misinformation; they give it away toward the end of their opinion piece, asking:
Why should people world-wide pay drastic costs to cut emissions when the global temperature is acting as if those cuts have already been made?
Michaels and Maue don’t want us to cut carbon pollution, and it’s easy to understand why. They work for the Cato Institute, which was co-founded by and is heavily controlled by the Koch brothers, who have donated more than $30 million to Cato. As Michaels admitted, they’re basically fossil fuel industry employees.
But the answers to their question are simple. As climate scientists have predicted for decades, global temperatures are rising dangerously rapidly. Moreover, research has shown that the economic benefits of cutting carbon pollution far outweigh the costs.
Michaels and Maue want us to bet the future of all life on Earth. They want us to put all our chips on black – a bet that burning billions of barrels of oil and billions of tons of coal every year won’t cause dangerous climate change. They want us to make that bet even though their arguments are based on unsupported lies, whilst they cash paychecks from the Koch brothers.
We would have to be incredible suckers to take their bet.

Although aviation only contributes about 2% of global emissions of carbon dioxide, it accounts for over 6% of global warming due the effects of other greenhouse gases and vapour trails. The upcoming report by the UK Committee on Climate Change shows that a third runway will increase CO2 emissions from air travel from 37 to 43 million tonnes per annum. But since our overall carbon budget will have fallen by 2030 to 344 million tonnes, the contribution from aviation will have jumped from 6.5% to 12.5% of the UK’s carbon emissions. In other words, a third runway is incompatible with the UK’s climate commitments, and things will only get worse post-Brexit.Dr Robin Russell-JonesMarlow, Buckinghamshire 
• Len McCluskey may well think that supporting plans for a third runway at Heathrow will provide “good jobs” – especially important at a time when so much employment is insecure and poorly paid (Unite boss urges Labour MPs to support Heathrow expansion, 25 June). But this is shortsighted and ignores the enormous impact on the quality of life of people living under the flight path and the health of even more people affected by heavier traffic during and after the construction phase. I’d prefer Len to demonstrate that unions think about the quality of people’s lives rather than just the availability of work. Les BrightExeter
• What would Len McCluskey not want jobs for his members in? Arms for Saudi Arabia? Prison surveillance equipment for Palestinians in Israeli jails? As a socialist he must be aware of concepts like internationalism and global justice. He already supports the replacement of Trident, which contradicts the fought-for nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Now he urges the commissioning of the third runway at Heathrow. He must know the world is at tipping point in terms of climate change.

Wood Buffalo national park, which straddles Alberta and the Northwest Territories, is at risk of being placed on Unesco’s endangered list following a 2017 report, whereby Canadian authorities were given a year to develop a solution to stem the rapid deterioration of the park. 
The UN body warned that inaction would “constitute a case for recommending inscription of Wood Buffalo national park on the List of World Heritage in Danger”.
But before of a Unesco meeting in Bahrain this week, the federal government’s report has confirmed problems are only getting worse: “Desired outcomes for the world heritage values are not being met,” said the report. 
The sprawling 4.5m hectare park has long been a home to the Cree and Dene indigenous peoples. 
It is also critical habitat for the largest free-roaming buffalo population in the world, who walk its forests, and its watershed is the only untouched breeding ground for endangered whooping cranes. 
Wood Buffalo – which became a world heritage site in 1983 – includes part of the world’s largest boreal river delta, formed by the Peace and the Athabasca rivers, which both run through the park and create the conditions for an extremely diverse ecosystem. 
But in 2014, the Miskew Cree First Nation contacted Unesco over fears the ecosystem was rapidly deteriorating. 
Community members no longer drink the fresh water from lakes or streams over fears of contamination and have reported that wild fish and game have developed abnormal flavours and deformities, said Melody Lepine, director of government and industry relations for the Mikisew Cree First Nation. 
“The community has been seeing first hand the the way the Peace Athabasca Delta has been deteriorating,” said Lepine from Bahrain, where she is representing the First Nation as Canada delivers its report.
While there is no clear explanation of what has caused problems in the food sources, the Canadian government’s environmental assessment report says high levels of mercury have been found in fish and bird eggs. 
A 2016 study by Unesco researchers warned that the pace and complexity of industrial development around the park was “exceptional” and found the proper mechanisms to adequately study its impacts were absent. 
The report also found that “the long-term future of the property’s two most iconic species, wood bison and whooping crane, remains uncertain and requires permanent attention”. 
A 2017 report by Unesco and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature determined the problems facing Wood Buffalo were “far more complex and severe than previously thought”.
The park’s diversity makes it particularly sensitive to upstream development projects. Two dams already cut across the Peace river and a new multibillion dollar hydroelectric project – known as Site C – has prompted warning from First Nations and environmental groups that river flows will continue to be weak in the delta. 
Further complicating the situation, oil and gas operations in the northern reaches of Alberta continue to draw large amounts of water to sustain their operations. “Seasonal flows in the Athabasca river have declined over the past 50 years due to a combination of increased water withdrawals and (past) climate change,” said the Canadian government’s report.
Experts on the UN committee also fear increased development in the region –including recently approved mining permits – creates near-unavoidable risks of chemical spills into the water system. 
“Canada is responding to the 2017 request of the World Heritage Committee to develop an action plan for the site, and is taking concrete steps to address the recommendations of the recent reactive monitoring mission to Wood Buffalo national park,” said Parks Canada in an emailed statement, adding that the “work is well underway”.
“Nothing Canada’s doing today is demonstrating they are really taking this seriously,” said Lepine. “Our health, our way of life and our culture depend on Wood Buffalo. We have the spiritual ties to that area go far deeper than Canada’s commitment to it.”
… we can’t turn away from climate change. The Guardian’s environmental coverage reports the scientific facts, social consequences and political choices that are shaping the fate of our planet. As the world's leaders turn their backs on the environment, we are at a crisis point. Individual consumer choices are important, but we need collective action to achieve the systemic change that will really make a difference. Our pioneering and our fearless reporting on the environment can play a vital role in that. But we need our readers’ support.

The government’s plan to expand Heathrow won overwhelming backing in the Commons on Monday – with more than 100 Labour MPs joining the majority of Tory politicians to back the plan – despite grave concerns about its impact on air pollution and the UK’s carbon emissions. 
On the same day, the government rejected plans for a £1.3bn tidal lagoon in Swansea Bay, dashing industry hopes of Britain leading development of a new source of renewable energy.
Caroline Lucas, co-leader of the Green party said it had been a day “of government-induced environmental disaster”.
“First they plough ahead with Heathrow expansion, and now they put a nail in the coffin of the tidal lagoon. They really have taken a wrecking ball to the UK’s climate policies.”
The growing concern around the government’s environmental strategy was highlighted by two new developments on Tuesday. Firstly, a coalition of clean air campaigners, green transport groups and environmentalists – including WWF and Greenpeace – has warned that “repeated delays” in the publication of the government’s strategy for sustainable road transport risks undermining the UK’s electric car industry and entrenching dangerous levels of air pollution for decades to come.
In a letter to the prime minister, Theresa May, they said reports the government was planning to water down a ban on petrol and diesel vehicles by 2040 would “seriously weaken the UK’s hopes of leading the race towards cleaner transport”. And it urged May to bring forward the 2040 ban on new diesel and petrol car sales by 2030.
John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said May’s environment policies were “in tatters” after Heathrow and Swansea and warned further backtracking on its flagship transport strategy would “cement her government’s failure to fulfil its pledge to be a global leader on climate action”.
Separately, campaigners have condemned what they say is a watering down of a key element of the government’s climate change strategy, which will mean councils no longer have to assess planning proposals “in line with the objectives and provisions of the Climate Change Act 2008” but will instead only have to have reference to the “context” of the act. Legal advice sought by Friends of the Earth concludes this change “weakens the emphasis to be placed on climate change”.
Dave Timms, Friends of the Earth campaigner, said it sent a negative signal to councils about the importance of climate change in the decision-making process.
“The devil’s always in the detail, and by weakening the importance of the Climate Change Act in council decision-making, the government is hiding bad news in the fine print.”
The government says the new planning proposals are a draft and still being consulted on, and a spokesman rejected claims its environmental policies were in disarray.
“Our 25-year environment plan sets out our commitment to leave the environment in a better state than we found it. This includes ambitious plans to replenish depleted soils, rid the seas and oceans of plastic waste, cut greenhouse gas emissions, end the sale of new conventional diesel and petrol cars and vans by 2040, cleanse our air of toxic pollutants and develop cleaner, more sustainable energy sources.”
The government’s plans to build a new runway at Heathrow passed through the Commons by 415 votes to 119 – a majority of 296 – on Monday night. It won the backing of the overwhelming number of Tory MPs as well as more than 100 Labour politicians.
Environmentalists expressed anger and dismay at what they said was the overwhelming lack of engagement with the scale of the looming climate crisis by most Westminster politicians.
A spokesman for the No Heathrow Group, which staged a series of direct action campaigns and organised a hunger strike in opposition to the proposals, said the politicians had failed on the “defining existential issue of our time”.
It said a third runway was “a declaration that the lives of those ‘others’ around the world already suffering from the worst impacts of climate change, and the thousands displaced to build the runway, are worth less than the luxuries of the minority of wealthy frequent flyers who stand to benefit most from a third runway.”
There is already a legal challenge to the Heathrow plans being prepared by several councils and supported by the mayor of London. Campaigners vowed to continue their fight. 
A spokesperson for No To Heathrow said: “We are going nowhere, the third runway will never be built, we will use all the disruptive, creative, and peaceful tactics at our disposal to prevent the construction of this extreme and devastating megaproject: Heathrow, expect us.”

Whether they will click on your headline, read any part of your article, keep the channel tuned to your station, or just tune out and turn off.

Good point. Let's look at a concrete example, the reporting about projected Arctic sea-ice loss in the Guardian.
From this article just under 10 years ago, the sub-header reads :
BQSTART
Scientists warn that the North Pole could be free of ice in just five years' time instead of 60
BQEND
and includes the following ""projections"" :
BQSTART
... said Professor Peter Wadhams of Cambridge University. '... Now the most detailed computer models suggest the Arctic's summer ice is going to last for only a few more years ...'. 
... [Professor Wieslaw] Maslowski said. '... you get a very clear indication that the Arctic is going to be ice-free in summer in five years'.
BQEND
Then you got this article just under 6 years ago headlined ""Arctic expert predicts final collapse of sea ice within four years"", starting with :
BQSTART
One of the world's leading ice experts [Prof Peter Wadhams of Cambridge University] has predicted the final collapse of Arctic sea ice in summer months within four years.
BQEND
And finally you have this article from less than 2 years ago with the headline and sub-header of :
BQSTART
‘ Next year or the year after, the Arctic will be free of ice’ 
Scientist Peter Wadhams believes the summer ice cover at the north pole is about to disappear, triggering even more rapid global warming
BQEND

It turns out that you are partially correct, in that the "" ... if ECS > 4°C ..."" part of my post(s) was indeed incorrect.

Economic models significantly underestimate climate change risksSource:London School of EconomicsSummary:Policymakers are being misinformed by the results of economic models that underestimate the future risks of climate change impacts, according to a new journal paper by authors in the United States and the United Kingdom, which is published today (4 June 2018).
The paper in the Review of Environmental Economics and Policy calls for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to improve how it analyses the results of economic modelling as it prepares its Sixth Assessment Report, due to be published in 2021 and 2022.
The paper's authors, Thomas Stoerk of the Environmental Defense Fund, Gernot Wagner of the Harvard University Center for the Environment and Bob Ward of the ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy at the London School of Economics and Political Science, draw attention to ""mounting evidence that current economic models of the aggregate global impacts of climate change are inadequate in their treatment of uncertainty and grossly underestimate potential future risks.""
They warn that the ""integrated assessment models"" used by economists ""largely ignore the potential for 'tipping points' beyond which impacts accelerate, become unstoppable, or become irreversible."" As a result ""they inadequately account for the potential damages from climate change, especially at moderate to high levels of warming,"" due to rises in global mean temperature of more than 2 Celsius degrees.

True, he has turned the United States into a pariah nation, one reviled for ripping immigrant children from their parents and from withdrawing from our only real chance at stabilizing the climate, the Paris Accord. 
But Trump’s success at creating and maintaining a political base is not because of his incoherent policies. It is solely because he is able to communicate with people in ways that that evoke emotion, go viral, and make people think he understands them. 
The way super-communicators like Jesus, Shakespeare, Oprah, or even Trump work their magic was unpacked by Dr. Joe Romm in a must-read book, How To Go Viral and Reach Millions.
The job for scientists, for all of us, is to learn the techniques that make our messages clicky and sticky, but use the techniques in a way that keeps the science true and the facts straight. Be a Jedi, not a Sith Lord.
Yet it’s more than just that. Many of us – scientists included – downplay the importance of catchy writing, memorable phrases, and captivating metaphors. Using purposefully compelling language is somehow ‘dirty.’ I am a scientist for crying out loud. Can’t I just stick to facts, show my graphs, and let the data speak?
No, you can’t; not if you want anyone to hear you or listen to you.
And if no one is listening to you, why are you here? 
Let me be clear to my colleagues, all so-called pointed-headed, ivory-tower intellectuals who think they have something important to say. Listen up. Are you listening?
There is nothing special about you and your message. 
Audiences are fire-hosed with information from all sides. We have very little time to really dig deeply into issues. Communicators are competing with many other voices, and most more interesting than you. So, if you are not going to learn techniques to communicate quickly and compellingly, you might as well just stay home.
So how does Dr. Romm’s book teach effective communication? I won’t spoil it too much – you need to read the book. But I will tell you that he has five basic rules that he leads with. I will also tell you that he teaches everything from word choice to how to recast your scientific stories in ways that connect with people emotionally. He tells the importance of long-successful tools such as repetition, use of irony, metaphor, and foreshadowing.
But perhaps the most important chapter is the one devoted headlines. How the first few words a reader sees or hears are all-important in determining whether they will devote any mental energy to your message. Whether they will click on your headline, read any part of your article, keep the channel tuned to your station, or just tune out and turn off. 
Throughout the book, Dr. Romm weaves in evolutionary biology, art, and history to reinforce his message. He discusses how the human brain evolved to be able to process huge amounts of data. The processing amounts to quickly assessing whether a situation warrants our attention; think of these as “mental shortcuts” that we use, subconsciously, to determine whether and how we digest a message. He shows how the world’s greatest artists and communicators have used the very same strategies throughout history to go viral, to get their message to spread and endure.
In a nutshell, Dr. Romm teaches techniques to become a force of good in this world using time-tested techniques. We can be Luke Skywalker, not Darth Vader.
I asked Dr. Romm why he wrote this book and he told me:
I wrote this book because I have met so many frustrated scientists and environmentalists who want to get their message out, but don’t know how to be heard above the Niagara Falls of noise gushing from the internet and cable news. As an MIT-trained physicist who has been blogging for 12 years, I’ve learned a lot of the secrets of viral storytelling and messaging. But I’ve also had to unlearn a lot of things I was taught on the road to my Ph.D. So, I wrote this handbook for anyone who wants to learn the lessons from the world’s greatest viral communicators.
The main message is that if you want to grab and keep people’s attention – if you want to be as clicky and sticky as possible – you need to create an emotionally compelling and memorable message using a few basic rules. And rule number one is to tell a story with the simple And-But-Therefore formula used by Hollywood screenwriters and viral superstars like Oprah. 
And he is so right. I cannot tell you how many times I’ve listened to colleagues on radio, television, or in print media get into loooooonnnnnngggggg and boring descriptions about all the caveats and nuances of their studies. Even I get bored, and I am a nerd. Nothing makes me sleepier than a scientist launching into their science-speak descriptions of their work. 
Get to the point already! Tell me why it matters, why do I care? Only then tell me about all your nuances and caveats.
Joe Romm has solidified his place among master communicators. He is a teacher, a scholar, a storyteller; just damn good at what he is doing. If you want to become more like him, then read the book. And if you don’t care about being compelling, or you don’t think it is important, then sit down and shut up. Because your message doesn’t matter anyway.
Other scientists agree with me. Dr. Michael Mann told me: 
Climate change represents perhaps the greatest challenge we have ever faced as a civilization. But those seeking to communicate the scientific evidence have found themselves subject to concerted attacks by fossil fuel interests who find the implications of the science to be a threat to their bottom line. 
Few have had both the courage to do battle with the forces of denial and the skill to communicate the science and its implications with clarity and vision. My friend Joe Romm is such an individual.
Hear, hear, Mike Mann. I wholeheartedly agree.
… in the fight to protect the environment. By keeping the Guardian’s environmental coverage open and accessible, we can report on the changes needed to avoid climate and natural catastrophe. The choices made by individuals are important, but we need to work together for the systemic transformation that will make a real difference. As well as reporting the facts about what is happening now, we investigate the causes and talk to the people trying to make the future better. But we need our readers’ support.

Lord Deben, chair of the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), said housebuilders were “cheating” buyers with energy-inefficient homes and that motor companies were holding back the rollout of clean cars.
The CCC’s annual report, published on Thursday, found the UK is on track to miss its legally binding carbon budgets in 2025 and 2030, due to lack of progress in cutting emissions from buildings and transport. It also said ministers were spurning low-cost options, such as onshore windfarms, home insulation and tree-planting, meaning people would end up paying more than needed to fight climate change. 
Home insulation installations are among the cheapest carbon cutting measures but the cancellation of government incentives has caused a 95% drop since 2012, the CCC said. “It is really shocking,” said Chris Stark, CCC chief executive, who noted that such measures cut energy bills by £100 a year on average.
The government, which also cancelled plans to make new homes zero-carbon, must produce new policies and stick to them, said Stark. The big emissions cuts seen in electricity production, as renewables replace coal, shows action can be taken, he said: “We have seen what happens when the government takes an enlightened view and steps in.”
Deben severely criticised the homebuilding industry: “The industry should be ashamed of itself that it is still producing homes that are cheating the people they sell to. If you don’t produce a properly insulated home, you put a burden on the purchaser and the next purchaser for the rest of time in terms of their energy bills.”
“It is ridiculous,” he said. “You can provide the homes people need – well-insulated, low-energy cost homes – at a price which is very little different from the price today.”
Deben also attacked carmakers: “The car industry should be ashamed of itself too but I make a distinction because they have [at least] claimed they are repenting. Frankly, I don’t see any reason to be very hopeful that it is going to behave from the highest motives, given the history that we’ve had with Volkswagen and the rest.”
The CCC said the government must set tough new CO2 reduction targets for cars and vans. Furthermore, Deben said: “The government has got to make sure the car industry doesn’t try to avoid new regulations in the way that it has the old regulations. It is necessary to ensure the cleaner cars come forward more quickly, instead of being held back while dirtier cars are sold by the industry.”
The government’s pledge to end the sales of pure petrol and diesel cars by 2040, which is reportedly being watered down, is far too unambitious, Lord Deben said. “We think that to move much closer to 2030 is essential, because the figures don’t add up otherwise.” Other countries, including the Netherlands and Norway have already set such a date.
A spokesman for the Home Builders Federation said: “Lord Deben’s comments are ill-judged and are not borne out by the facts. House builders have met every government environmental target such that new homes are considerably more energy efficient than existing homes.”
Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said the industry had delivered on challenging carbon reduction targets but recognised more needs to be done. “We need a strategy with realistic ambition levels that supports industry’s efforts, allows manufacturers time to invest, innovate and sell competitively, and which provides the right incentives to take the consumer with us.”
Paul Morozzo, at Greenpeace, said: “The car industry has a lot to answer for. Emissions and pollution from cars are much higher than billed, yet the government still fears to act.”
The CCC noted the UK’s success in cutting emissions in the decade since the Climate Change Act set legal targets, down 43% compared to 1990 levels. The government had set out the right direction in its Clean Growth Strategy published in October, Stark said, but urgently needed to put words into action: “The government knows how to do this – they just have to get on and do it.”
A government spokesman said: “As the Committee on Climate Change has recognised, we’ve made huge progress in cleaning up the power and waste sectors and through our ambitious Clean Growth Strategy we’re confident of cutting emissions across the wider economy to meet our carbon budgets while seizing the economic opportunities of clean growth.”
… we can’t turn away from climate change. The Guardian’s environmental coverage reports the scientific facts, social consequences and political choices that are shaping the fate of our planet.

But despite its placid appearance it has become a deadly threat to tens of thousands people living beneath it as a result of global warming.
A handful of residents of Huaraz, the city below the lake, can recall its destructive power. In 1941 a chunk of ice broke away from the glacier in an earthquake, tumbling into the lake. The impact caused a flood wave which sent an avalanche of mud and boulders cascading down the mountain, killing about 1,800 people when it reached the city.
Today the lake is even more potentially dangerous, swollen with glacial meltwater like an almost-overflowing bathtub. A temperature rise of 0.5-0.8C between the 1970s and the 2000s has seen a third of Peru’s ice caps vanish in the last four decades. 
The city’s population has grown too. With more than 150,000 inhabitants, today Huaraz is about 15 times larger than it was during the last deadly landslide. 
Flood wave modelling by the University of Texas shows how a breakaway chunk of glacier could displace up to 15bn litres of meltwater from the 70-metre deep, mile long (1.7km) lake, propelling a wave of up to 30 metres over a ridge of rocks and down the mountain. 
“There are around 50,000 people living in the danger zone,” says Noah Walker-Crawford, a social anthropologist from Manchester University.
“According to the authorities’ estimates, even if you were able to warn the people, there could still be about 20,000 fatalities,” he adds.
The people would have 30 minutes to evacuate, says Cesar Florez, a risk management specialist for the region’s government and the man ultimately responsible for the people’s safety. 
“It’s more than enough time,” Florez says. “It’s the same time allotted to evacuate coastal areas in the case of tsunami,” he tells the Guardian, adding the escape time could be lengthened by a series of energy dissipators and dykes. 
So far, however, none of that flood mitigation infrastructure is in place. For now, 10 black tubes pump out water to reduce the lake’s level. Perched on a bluff facing the lake, Calef de la Cruz radios in a status report to the regional government every two hours. 
Living in a hut for up to a fortnight at a time, it is a lonely and sleepless vigil. But until an early warning system is installed, which authorities say will happen later this year, the watchfulness of De la Cruz and his colleagues is all that stands between the lake and the residents below.
But for the poor, largely indigenous farmers in the verdant mountains around the ice caps, the problem is not too much water but too little. The Andean country is home to 70% of the world’s tropical glaciers and as they gradually ebb away, a water crisis looms. Climate change has made the weather unpredictable and the unseasonal melting of the glaciers has thrown the farmers’ existence into jeopardy.
Alejandro Rosales is a 62-year-old farmer from Yarush, a tiny hamlet above Huaraz. For him, like many residents of the mountains, the snow-capped peaks are apus – beings of mythic or semi-divine importance. He never thought he would see the white peaks he gazed at as a child turn black, he says.
“Sometimes there are years when you get a good harvest; there are also years when the harvest fails. That means the children go to school without their daily bread. It’s really hard,” he adds, showing the Guardian blackened potatoes which crumble in his hands.
The potatoes, which were stored months earlier to sow later this year, are riddled with moth caterpillars. The warming has meant new pests are creeping to higher altitudes where the colder weather once held them at bay.
Saúl Luciano Lliuya, a farmer and mountain guide whose home in Nueva Florida is in Lake Palcacocha’s flood path, has filed a lawsuit against the German electro-domestic firm RWE for its role in causing global warming, as one of the world’s top emitters of carbon dioxide.
“The glacier is a source of water for those in the countryside and for us all in the city, so you can imagine what the future will be like if we don’t have it,” he says. 
“From the risk problem to the water scarcity problem; all of this is what inspired me to file a lawsuit,” he adds. Lliuya’s 2015 demand for damages from RWE has been admitted on appeal by a higher regional court in the German city of Hamm.
Lliuya is seeking compensation of about $20,000 (£15,000) from the energy giant to help install the lake’s safety measures, as well as the reimbursement of €6,384 he has spent on flood protection.
It is a tiny amount for the company, he admits but adds: “What we are saying is this is happening and it’s putting us at risk. The damage caused is irreversible; for that no amount of money is enough.”

The National Farmers’ Federation (NFF) has released its submission to the Australian Government’s Energy White Paper, reinforcing the importance of affordable fuel and energy to the long-term competitiveness of Australia’s agricultural sector.
“Fuel and energy are among the largest costs for Australian farmers, and the spike in fuel prices over the past decade has had a significant impact on our sector,” NFF President Jock Laurie said.
“According to ABARES, the direct cost of fuel and lubricants is around eight to nine percent of all farm cash costs – and the vast majority of that cost is diesel. Including indirect costs sees energy and energy-dependent farm input costs as a proportion of total farm input costs increase to almost 50 per cent for some major agricultural sectors.
“In fact, in just one year, the fuel costs for Australian farmers jumped 12 percent - a significant impact on our competitiveness. This is why we remain ardent supporters of the Fuel Tax Credit scheme, and we are absolutely opposed to any suggestion that the scheme may be scaled back.
“Requiring farmers to pay excise on fuel would be a tax on farm production that will hurt the bottom lines of farmers and the broader economy – it’s as simple as that. That is why the NFF is so concerned about any suggestion that the coming budget will adjust the Fuel Tax Credit scheme,” Mr Laurie said.
The NFF submission also raises concerns about increased costs of energy emerging from the carbon tax and changes to state utility ownership regimes while warning against future land use issues emerging in the development of new fossil fuel based energy sources.
“With the carbon tax set to be introduced from July this year, farmers will face even greater costs; in some cases up to $10,000 per annum due to increased electricity and fuel costs,” Mr Laurie said.

Its the conservative lot of politics to which the NFF is fully bolted on, is the problem. The NFF may have seen some light but now divorcing itself must be full. Not ""just a little bit""
The NFF has been a solid reason for us being many years behind in the work that needs to be done.
However I do think that the NFF has a point with some of the opportunities and maybe the government should shift its vocal coal support to that end. Along with the vast amount of subsidies shifted to farms away and from coal, before they find some politicians lurk to spend it on. A transfer is not and increased cost its a re-alocation only, and I would see it as a better use of the public purse. Put the economy back on the sheeps back again, figuratively speaking. Also give the farmers some relief from the personal ups and down that need some help for stability. But flogging all my beef to China is NOT ON.

You bet
Rice is the world's second-largest crop, an already significant source of methane emissions, and that methane is a more powerful, if shorter-lived, greenhouse gas than CO2
The expansion of the human population has necessitated increased rice production and so methane emission from this source. 
As the world warms it both increases the methane emissions from rice paddies, and decreases the crop yield of rice... research on rice grown in Asia has shown that for every 1°C increase in minimum nighttime temperatures crop yields declined 10%.
The global warming potential of methane is 25 times that of carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide is 298 times that of carbon dioxide. This means that 1 tonne of methane is equivalent to 25 tonnes of carbon dioxide. One tonne of carbon is equivalent to 3.67 tonnes of carbon dioxide.

Simpson's got a nerve.

The media also needs to get a bit more honest in sheeting the blame back to where it belongs.

It appears that Norman Farming [John Norman being Littleproud's father in law] had been given $25 million to enlarge eight of their dams as part of government-funded water efficiency programs whose aims were to increase the amount of water flowing into the ailing Murray-Darling River system.
But they also had 52.3km of unapproved earthworks which effectively dammed floodwaters for harvesting, causing the neighbours on one side to have their property inundated, and neighbours on the other to miss out on the flow.
Norman Farming is operated by high-profile former Cotton Grower of the Year John Norman.
Who just so happens to be the father-in-law of his local federal member, the man that Barnaby chose to replace him as Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, David Littleproud.
Littleproud had only been in parliament for 18 months when gifted this extremely important portfolio by Barnaby in late December last year. Littleproud was an agribusinessman before entering politics. [Littleproud worked in agricultural banking for 20 years, at NAB and more recently Suncorp] 
 His father Brian Littleproud was a National Party member of the Queensland Parliament and state government minister.
Barnaby had been aware of the allegations against Norman farming for well over a year when he made this decision.
In a document compulsorily ordered by the Senate, a senior adviser to Barnaby Joyce emailed the department in 2016 expressing two concerns — that Norman Farming may have been diverting floodwaters and that the Healthy Headwaters funds were not being used for their intended purpose.
“I have copies of some satellite maps which show extensive diversion of floodwaters from its natural course. Could you please get in touch with the (Qld Department of Natural Resources and Mines) and ask what investigations are underway? Do we have any audit processes in place to ensure that this funding goes to its intended purpose? I believe the allegation here is that (Healthy Headwater) funding … has been used to direct more water onto the farm,” the adviser wrote.
Barnaby’s office issued a statement to Lateline following the police raid.
“The matter is subject to an ongoing investigation by the Queensland Police and it would be inappropriate to comment,” a spokeswoman said. “The Coalition Government is committed to delivering the Murray Darling Basin Plan and takes very seriously any allegations of illegal behaviour.”
So seriously that they give the Water portfolio to the accused’s son-in-law?

‘Farmers are set to be the early movers in the Federal Government's first Direct Action auction … but analysts who have modelled the scheme say it simply will not work.
The Emissions Reduction Fund (ERF) is supposed to be the main player in reducing Australia's emissions.
Comprised of $2.5 billion of taxpayers' money, the ERF directly pays polluters not to pollute and, among other things, encourage farmers to develop carbon sinks.’ ABC 12 April 2015.
The latest shocking facts about the increase in emissions doesn't even take into account emissions from agriculture which are exempted .
And the rorting by farmers like Stokes etc is shocking too.

A company part owned by News Corp disregarded advice from a leading carbon trading expert and went ahead with a plan to establish the world’s ­largest carbon farm – which then failed.
RM Williams Agricultural Holdings, which received $9.1 million in government money, had secretly agreed to provide enough carbon to offset all of News Corp’s emissions for five years. 
It collapsed last year owing $100 million and failed to establish the carbon farm or sell any offsets to News Corp…. “An agreement had been drafted saying that if RM Williams failed to deliver 1.9 million tonnes of carbon credits in the first four years, News could force the company and other shareholders at any time to buy back News Corp’s shares in the company,"" Mr Newcombe said.

Out in the bush, far from the ritualised political jousting in Canberra, attitudes are changing. Regional Australia has turned the corner when it comes to acknowledging the reality of climate change, says the woman now charged with safeguarding the interests of farmers in Canberra.
Fiona Simson, a mixed farmer and grazier from the Liverpool plains in northern New South Wales, and the president of the National Farmers’ Federation, says people on the land can’t and won’t ignore what is right before their eyes. “We have been experiencing some wild climate variability,” Simson tells Guardian Australia’s politics podcast. “It’s in people’s face”.
“While we are a land of droughts and flooding rains, absolutely at the moment people are seeing enormous swings in what would be considered usually normal. They are getting all their rainfall at once, even though they end up with an annual rainfall that’s the same, it’s all at once, or it’s in so many tiny insignificant falls that it doesn’t make any difference to them.
“And the heat. We’ve had some record hot summers and some weird swings in seasons”.
Simson acknowledges there are “always going to be some outliers who are going to have some wild ideas” in farming or in any other sector of the Australian economy but she says “overwhelmingly, I think it’s got to the point where the science is very acceptable”.
The shift under way in the bush has filtered through to lobbyists lane in Canberra. Only a few years ago, when the then Labor government put a price on carbon, legislating a market mechanism to drive emissions reduction at least cost, the NFF rose in full battle cry against the heresy. But now, the NFF stands at the front of a phalanx of business groups trying to support the Turnbull government through the deeply fraught business of landing the national energy guarantee.
Simson isn’t trying to pretend black is white. She acknowledges the Neg looks a whole lot like the emissions trading scheme that her group shouted down only a couple of years ago. “I think the Neg for us is some sort of ETS potentially. It certainly talks about carbon and putting a value on that. There will be a price on that and there we go.”
People are really frustrated at the moment with the politics
She says it’s time to see the climate change-driven transition under way in the energy market as opportunity, rather than something to resist. “I think farm representation and farmers generally have come quite a long way in their attitude to climate, and climate change and climate variability and dealing with all of these things, and accepting some of the facts behind the science.”
“We have turned quite a corner ourselves, and our approach now to this is quite different than it was in those days [when Labor pursued emissions trading], when the [previous NFF] leaders chose that path.”
She is supportive of the efforts of the agriculture minister, David Littleproud – a next-generation Queensland National – to reset the resting disposition for the Nationals on climate change and energy. Littleproud is happy to acknowledge that climate change is happening and he characterises the shift to renewables as “exciting”.
But the Nationals are lagging their communities on the issue. The party remains split on climate change and energy, and on the Neg. Some are trying to cook up a coal transition fund as the price of supporting the policy, but if that’s the price of entry, Labor federally and the Labor states might veto the framework before it can ever get off the ground.
Simson says dissenters need to get out of the road of a settlement. Consensus needs to be reached because the damage inflicted by the last decade of policy warfare is going to take time to unwind, and the key to unwinding the destruction is policy certainty. “I have some sympathy for [the Nationals] because I know that our sector has had some wide-ranging discussions to come to the agreement that we have.”
“But at the end of the day, that’s their job”.
She says politicians “need to stop picking winners. This is not about coal versus renewables ... it’s a bit like a farm, we are probably going to need a bit of everything. Surely, let the market decide is the best way rather than one politician thinking what’s going to be the technology of the future”.
Simson notes that Australian farmers love markets. They are entirely comfortable with competition. So the same rules should apply to the energy market. “For us it is very important that the policy be technology neutral, and let the market decide.”
She says politicians also need to understand that voters have had enough of the internal intrigues and the brinkmanship. “People are really frustrated at the moment with the politics, whether it is internal politics and infighting within the parties, or whether it is party against party. People are wanting now to have outcomes. People are facing skyrocketing energy prices. Some of my members are facing bills triple what they were a few years ago.”
So while there are still questions to answer about the detail of the policy framework, the Neg must be approached as opportunity. Simson says affordability, reliability, technology neutrality is fundamental, and the farm sector needs a tailored solution where emissions reduction can be built into the core of the business. “We think there are a lot of opportunities for small-scale energy generation and it’s already happening”.
“We would particularly like to take advantage of some of the heat generation that some of our intensive industries are using. For example, the pork industry has been amazing at capturing methane and then using that as energy generation – all the manure, the slurry going into the pits, having the methane captured and then driving a lot of the technology.”
“Things like that on farm are amazing opportunities.”
She says farms are often at the end of the power grid and are not well served by the status quo. She says the Neg framework could allow farmers to band together, and small communities to band together, to build their own energy infrastructure.
“We can work with this general framework. There is lot of opportunity”.
… in the fight to protect the environment. By keeping the Guardian’s environmental coverage open and accessible, we can report on the changes needed to avoid climate and natural catastrophe. The choices made by individuals are important, but we need to work together for the systemic transformation that will make a real difference. As well as reporting the facts about what is happening now, we investigate the causes and talk to the people trying to make the future better. But we need our readers’ support.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute.

The speaker is:John BushellConsultant in Value and Risk ManagementSydney
Introduction, from the ABC website:
'Australia’s Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) was established in 2012 to be a financier for clean energy projects. The aim was to reduce carbon emissions. Carbon capture and storage projects (CCS) were excluded from the CEFC. In 2017, the government sought to change the rules, allowing investment in CCS.John Bushell analyses the long-term implications of carbon capture and storage. He says there is more than a one-off capital cost. While the benefits from the electricity generated lie with today’s generation, CCS places costs and risks with all future generations.

See above comment about the large increases in network costs. In Australia network cost account for 54% of the retail price of electricity. The cost of generating the power accounted for around 22% of the retail costs. 
The coal for the coal fired power stations in Port Augusta was rail 250 km from the Leigh Creek mine. These days most coal fired power stations are sited next to the coal mine for economic reasons. In South Australia this could not be done as there is no water either fresh or salt at Leigh Creek. At Port Augusta there is salt water. There are cheaper of generating electricity in South Australia than using a power station 250 km from its coal mine. Power prices in South Australia are similar to power prices in Queensland. However the high power prices are not due to the 22% contribution of the cost of generation but instead are the product of the greater than 54% contribution of the network cost in these two decentralised states where urban consumers subsidise far flung regional and rural consumers.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1528031386000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'the 22 % contribution of the cost of generation', u'effect': u'however the high power prices are not but instead are the product of the greater than 54 % contribution of the network cost in these two decentralised states where urban consumers subsidise far flung regional and rural consumers'}], u'author_id': u'12483673', u'in_reply_to': u'116536593', u'id': u'116548879', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'FelixKruell', u'text': u'Huh?

That is not how it will be expressed. If the past is a guide, the government is likely to quietly issue an understated press release saying the latest auction of the emissions reduction fund – the scheme better known as Direct Action, which the former environment minister Greg Hunt described as the centrepiece of Australia’s efforts to tackle climate change – has been a success. 
However, the specifics of how the money is to be spent will be all but impenetrable to most people. 
First, a recap: Hunt hastily conceived Direct Action over the summer of 2009-10 after Tony Abbott pipped Malcolm Turnbull by a vote in a ballot for the Liberal leadership, having run on a platform of quasi-climate scepticism and withdrawing Coalition support for requiring big polluters to pay for the carbon dioxide they emitted. With Kevin Rudd a popular first-term leader, Abbott becoming prime minister seemed a remote possibility. But he proved a brutally effective opposition leader, Labor imploded and the 2013 election was a blue-tied landslide. Hunt set about implementing a $2.55bn policy that, even within the Coalition, many thought unlikely to ever be legislated.
It would have been cheaper if the government negotiated to buy the land rather than pay landowners to protect it.
The emissions reduction fund pays farmers and businesses to cut carbon dioxide emissions below what they would have otherwise been. It does this through a reverse auction – people nominate how cheaply they believe they can reduce emissions and bureaucrats choose the cheapest bids. The government buys carbon credits from the successful projects once emissions cuts are verified.
 According to the scheme’s architect, it is great value for money. In the run up to the landmark Paris climate conference in 2015, Hunt said early auction results were “stunning”. He looked forward to telling the United Nations meeting about how Australia had built “one of the most effective systems in the world for significantly reducing emissions” that would meet our recently announced 2030 target, a cut of at least 26% cut below 2005 levels.
Turnbull described it another way. While on the backbench, he observed that Direct Action would involve billions of taxpayers’ dollars being spent paying farmers to create offsets so industry could freely pollute, a plan he described as “a recipe for fiscal recklessness on a grand scale”. He noted that, from Abbott and Hunt’s perspective, the policy at least had the virtue that it could be easily scrapped if climate change proved not real, or if the rest of the world was doing nothing about it.
Today, the evidence of the impact of climate change continues to mount, the world has made significant, though inadequate, commitments to address the problem, and the emissions reduction fund rolls on. It has now been Turnbull government policy longer than it was Abbott government policy.
The Clean Energy Regulator, which runs the fund for the government, has signed contracts to buy credits equivalent to 191.7m tonnes of carbon dioxide over the next decade or so – about 3% of what Australia is expected to emit in that time. About 30.5m have been acquitted so far. 
But national emissions, which fell between 2012 and 2014 under the carbon price scheme introduced by Labor and the Greens and abolished by the Coalition, are tracking upwards year-on-year. A thinktank analysis late last year found Australia was the only wealthy country where emissions from energy combustion were at a record high.
Though it continues, the government’s enthusiasm for its self-described main climate policy has visibly waned since Turnbull returned to the leadership in 2015. The “Direct Action” label has disappeared from the government’s lexicon. Frydenberg does not spruik the emissions reduction fund’s wares with Hunt’s brio, and its notional funding has been slashed.
In the dying months of Abbott’s prime ministership, he and Hunt promised it would be topped up with $200m a year between 2018 and 2030, lifting public spending on offsets to nearly $5bn. But there was nothing for it over the next four years in the recent budget.
While political and media attention has fallen away, projects being bankrolled by the emissions reduction fund may become increasingly important in the years ahead assuming the government is successful in negotiating into life its plan for the electricity sector – the national energy guarantee, or Neg.
As proposed, it would allow electricity retailers to buy carbon offsets as an alternative to reducing emissions, potentially creating a larger secondary market beyond the government for farmers and businesses to sell the credits they generate. Big polluters covered by the other part of Direct Action – what the government calls the “safeguard mechanism”, which was promised to stop industrial emissions increasing emissions to wipe out the cuts the government is paying for – are already using the offsets in small amounts.
Two questions, then: what are taxpayers getting for their billions? And how robust are the projects that are counted as emissions cuts?
About 80% of projects with contracts under the emissions reduction fund are in the rugby league states north of the Murray. The overwhelming majority of those are in a corridor of land between Cobar in western New South Wales and Quilpie in south-western Queensland and involve restoring or protecting plant life. Vegetation projects – regenerating degraded habitat, tree-planting and “avoided deforestation” schemes in which landowners are paid to not clear their land – are expected to deliver two-thirds of the cuts promised to date. 
Using these projects to create offsets isn’t a new idea. Many existed under the Carbon Farming Initiative introduced under Labor in 2011. The notable difference between the parties is who pays for the credits. Under Labor, they would have been mostly sold to business. Under the Coalition, it is taxpayers who have been doing the buying.
The regeneration projects have broad support – few would argue that they do not perform valuable work or store carbon dioxide. University of Queensland research fellow Megan Evans found they can have not just environmental benefits, but be good for regional communities, bringing investment and jobs.
However, some critics have questioned what happens after the “permanence period” – either 100 or 25 years, depending on the contract, in which the land must not be cleared. As the law stands, bulldozers could come out as soon as the period is up. Equally, fire or drought could sweep through at any point and release what has been protected. Yet supporters believe that once a market is established, the rationale to use carbon farming to make marginal land profitable will continue.
Avoided deforestation projects, which have been signed up to deliver 26m tonnes and – based on the average $11.90 per tonne of carbon dioxide paid under the scheme – could receive more than $300m of public money, are more contentious. They rely on a counterfactual though – it is impossible to know if a landowner ever really intended to clear the land.
Tim Baxter, a legal academic with the Australian-German Climate and Energy College, doubts many with government contracts did. He says some landowners had permits to clear their land for more than eight years before registering with the fund. At the other end of the scale, one project received a permit to clear just 49 days before registering. “Both raise serious questions,” he says.
Thinktank the Green Institute looked at the cost per hectare and found that it would have been far cheaper in most cases if the government negotiated to buy the land rather than pay landowners to protect it.
But early evidence from satellite data suggests avoided deforestation projects could be making a difference. In an analysis published by the government’s Climate Change Authority, academics Megan Evans and Andrew Macintosh found a steep decline in deforestation in western NSW since 2012, while other parts of the state showed little change in land-clearing rates. Evans did say, however, it was a desktop analysis only and it is not yet clear what has caused the decline.
About half of all outback vegetation abatement projects are being managed by the Sydney-based environmental markets company Green Collar. Its chief executive and co-founder, James Schultz, says the methods used to estimate the emissions reductions from avoided deforestation and habitat regeneration projects are based on conservative assessments of what drove changes in land-clearing rates in the past, such as commodity prices and input costs.
“The method doesn’t pretend to say ‘this is a precise estimate of exactly what happens with clearing over every square inch of every property’,” he says. “They’re all estimates. The important thing is the estimate is well within the margins of what we think happens in the real world. They’re all going to be under-estimates of what is delivered.”
While it is necessarily imperfect, Schultz says Australia’s carbon offsets scheme is world-class and rigorously policed. “We do hundreds of audits a year and then the Clean Energy Regulator does spot audits across the top of that,” he says. 
According to Baxter, a glaring omission from the rules is the impact of climate change itself. Australia’s scientific agencies suggest that, under the goals of the Paris conference, western NSW is projected to be on average 2.3 degrees warmer and have 8% less rainfall by 2100, a shift that would make it more akin to outback Queensland. “The difference between the closed woodlands of Bourke and the open woodlands of its future is a loss of approximately half its foliage cover – and a commensurate loss of carbon stored in the forests,” Baxter says. “The law doesn’t deal with that.” 
An arguably larger question hangs over landfill sites that receive credits for capturing and combusting methane that leaks from decomposing rubbish. As revealed by Guardian Australia, an independent expert committee has recommended the government not extend contracts with sites that use the methane to generate electricity as they are what economist Paul Burke calls “anyway” projects – they would have existed without the fund and have a viable revenue stream from selling electricity and renewable energy certificates. This has been a long-standing criticism of landfill gas projects, dating back to their inclusion in earlier schemes. Critics say it means they are creating “junk” credits that do not reflect additional emissions cuts. Frydenberg is yet to say whether he will accept the committee’s advice.
Less employed emission reduction fund methods – including supermarkets installing new lighting systems and companies reducing pollution from vehicle fleets – have also drawn flak. Burke, from the Australian National University’s Crawford School of Public Policy, says the fund should never have been extended to include industrial emitters, energy or transport as there were more effective ways to cut emissions in those parts of the economy – some form of carbon price, for example. “I don’t think it’s a good idea for the Australian public to be paying for Coles and Woolies to change their lights,” he says.
As Turnbull has pointed out, in Australia the offsets scheme is the policy. And it is barely making a dent.
Added up, it is difficult to know what taxpayers are getting for their investment. There has been surprisingly little academic research into what it is delivering. Some insiders privately say the Clean Energy Regulator does not do enough to ensure the projects they sign contracts with will be able to deliver, pointing particularly to the experimental techniques involved in storing carbon in soil. Even supporters believe as designed it is unlikely to deliver the cuts the government has promised.
What is clear is that there is little support inside and outside government for using taxpayers’ money to offset a fraction of Australia’s growing emissions. An offset scheme is generally used in conjunction with other policies to help make cuts as cheap as possible for those having to make them.
As Turnbull has pointed out, in Australia the offsets scheme is the policy. And it is barely making a dent.
The most recent greenhouse gas data shows pollution is up in every sector of the economy that gets money from the emissions reduction fund. Deforestation is outstripping habitat restoration by a rate of five-to-one based on government data. Emissions from waste, agriculture and big industry all rose last year. Recent auctions indicate industry interest has slumped, in part because the government seems indifferent to the scheme.
James Schultz, whose company is perhaps the greatest beneficiary under the emissions reduction fund, is among those who wants the government to change tack. “I’m a strong advocate for a more pure market-based mechanism,” he says. “It is just not economically efficient to have the taxpayer pay for it rather than private industry.”
The only sector in which there has been a fall in emissions is the one not covered by the emissions reduction fund – electricity, due to the closure of some coal-fired power. Electricity is also the area where there are obvious steps being taken to introduce a policy. The government wants to bring in a Neg with a target of a 26% cut by 2030 – a level scientists say is far short of what is needed in the power sector. Some analysis has suggested this goal would be reached regardless given the pace of the transition under way. 
The government is also moving to make changes to the safeguard mechanism that covers big industrial emitters. Currently, polluters are set an emissions limit – known as a baseline – at the highest level they emitted between 2009 and 2014. Though the scheme is supposed to stop emissions rising, companies can apply to get a higher baseline. This freedom to increase emissions without penalty did not stop 16 industrial sites breaching their baseline last year and having to hand in millions of dollars-worth of carbon credits, mostly bought from emissions reduction fund projects – a sign that Australia has an operational carbon market, albeit a small one.
The government is now considering making the safeguard mechanism less tied to historic emissions. A climate policy review released in December suggested emission limits could be loosened so they “increase with production, supporting business growth”. This has widely been interpreted as letting companies emit more without penalty.
Insiders say an effective reboot of the scheme could also be used to tighten the baselines for the majority of polluters that are now emitting below – sometimes well below – their historic highs. It would prevent these businesses being able to argue in future that they should be given free carbon credits for beating an outdated historic baseline and selling them to polluting companies that are breaching their limit.
Those familiar with the thinking say there may also be a shift in the way the baseline is expressed from total emissions to emissions intensity – that is, how much a company emits for each widget it makes. This would allow emissions at a site to “increase with production” as the government has promised without immediately blowing out the baseline.
This could leave industrial emissions soaring unchecked. But it is also being interpreted as potentially laying the groundwork for a future emissions intensity scheme – the kind the government emphatically ruled out for the electricity sector amid uproar from the Coalition’s right wing. 
The argument goes that a trading scheme – or two, if you count the Neg – could eventually provide a future government with a market for Australia’s carbon credits if it chose not to put more cash into the emissions reduction fund. 
Of course, these sort of predictions have been made before and the government’s position is that it opposes any form of carbon price or trading. Its message is that it will not stand in industry’s way and wants to encourage new and expanding operators to invest in Australia without penalty.
But it is worth remembering that Hunt promised the safeguard mechanism would cut industrial emissions by 200m tonnes between 2020 and 2030 to help meet the Paris greenhouse target.

Flanked by Nationals on Monday in Trangie, Turnbull acknowledged climate change remained a live political debate but he said: “I don’t know many people in rural New South Wales that I talk to that don’t think the climate is getting drier and rainfall is becoming more volatile.”
The minister for agriculture, David Littleproud, said the last agricultural ministerial council had agreed to help transition farmers into a changing environment and a changing climate.
The south-east of Australia this year has experienced record high temperatures during an unseasonably dry and hot autumn, prompting fire bans and warnings from authorities.
In its latest winter outlook, the Bureau of Meteorology is forecasting warmer and drier than average conditions across large parts of the country. It suggests winter rainfall is likely to be below average for NSW, South Australia, northern Victoria and western parts of Western Australia.
The bureau says the dry is likely to be particularly intense in areas around the Murray-Darling Basin and in eastern NSW, with a 70-80% chance of below average rainfall. “Elsewhere around the country, the chances of exceeding average rainfall are roughly 50%,” the new forecast said.
The overwhelming consensus among climate scientists is climate change is accelerating and human activity is making a contribution. If greenhouse gas emissions aren’t reduced, human populations become more exposed to the negative effects of warming, which include extreme weather events – such as prolonged drought, heatwaves, wildfires and storms.
Emissions in Australia fell during the carbon pricing scheme implemented by the Labor government but the Abbott government repealed that scheme and emissions are now trending upwards year-on-year.
The latest official emissions data shows pollution increased by 1.5% in the year to December 2017. Australia’s emissions levels are now higher than they were in 2012 and have climbed 3.6% since the carbon price was repealed in 2014.
Emissions are increasing in most sectors of the economy – in waste, agriculture and transport. Only one sector of the economy has recorded a decrease – the electricity sector – because ageing coal-fired power plants have exited the system, and new renewables projects are coming on stream.
The Turnbull government is trying to implement a policy in electricity that would see emissions come down by 26% on 2005 levels by 2030 – a target many analysts say is too low for Australia to meet its commitments under the Paris agreement – but even that target is being gainsaid by government conservatives who have not ruled out crossing the floor to oppose it.
Analysis from Green Energy Markets says the national energy guarantee (Neg) will deliver no meaningful emissions reductions in its own right unless the target is made more ambitious, because the capacity of renewable projects now under construction already exceeds what is required to achieve the 2030 target.
While battling internal pressures over the Neg, the government has also been stalling on new vehicle emissions standards for vehicles, bracing for more internal ructions. Australia no longer has a domestic car manufacturing industry but motoring groups have been lobbying against a 105gCO2/km emissions target.
It is unclear how Australia will meet its emissions reduction commitments under the Paris agreement without a policy roadmap to get there.
Ahead of a meeting of the G7 in Canada, a coalition of institutional investors has meanwhile sounded the alarm that countries are falling short of their Paris commitments.
A group of institutional investors with $26 trillion in assets under management – including Australia’s Investor Group on Climate Change – presented a statement of concern to G7 leaders and it was delivered to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
The joint statement said: “We are concerned that the implementation of the Paris agreement is currently falling short of the agreed goal of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels”.
Emma Herd, the chief executive officer of the Investor Group on Climate Change, said investors were “stepping up in unprecedented numbers to act on climate change”.
“Investors could do even more if governments delivered the policies required to effectively manage climate risk and accelerate investment in low-carbon solutions,” Herd said.

How do you intend to prevent dangerous climate change at the same time as expanding air travel, given that a) Britain needs to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 80% between 1990 and 2050 to meet its legal requirements under the Climate Change Act. 
(Although this is a step in the right direction, we actually need much more drastic cuts than that, see e.g. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41401656)
b) Emissions from UK air travel were estimated in 2010 to be the equivalent of between 13 and 15% of UK Greenhouse gas emissions (see https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/apr/06/aviation-q-and-a)

Do you really think, given what I've written above, that I fly? I know the internet is full of utter dishonesty, but I find it incredible that you would think it likely I flew.
A carbon tax is about accounting for the costs of our actions.

You describe a series of cuts we could make in other areas, all of which are sensible, but why would we be happy to make these more difficult changes before making the much easier reductions in our aviation use? As an individual, far and away the easiest change you can make to reduce your carbon emissions is to choose not to fly.

Do you? However I am not sure what level of tax would be enough to make me not fly. 
Also paying a carbon tax doesn't actually prevent carbon emissions from occurring. Not flying, not driving, not taking public transport, not buying anything brought into the UK by airfreight, not eating meat, not living - these things prevent carbon emissions but they're not very practical suggestions.
In addition a very punitive carbon tax would need to be a global initiative as only charging in the UK would penalise the UK. Also be careful of unintended consequences of these suggestions - take dieselgate as an example: a few years ago everyone was encouraged to buy diesel cars and now they are shown to be very polluting vehicles. I think they have been shown to have caused a lot of the health problems in cities today.
If we are so discouraged from flying what are all those who are employed on the ground at our airports going to do? Plus all of those employed in ancillary services that support the airport? Plus all of those employed directly at aerospace companies (Rolls Royce, Airbus)? 
Also since a lot of goods we consume in the UK are imported by airfreight are you prepared for the costs of these to go up? Unless you personally do not ever fly or buy anything brought in by airfreight it's a bit hypocritical to prevent Heathrow (or Gatwick) expansion on purely environmental grounds.
Heathrow should never have been built in the first place but shouting could've should've doesn't help mitigate the fact it is in place.

If that is won, and all goes according to plan, the bulldozers will go in around 2021, when the inevitable cycle of cost overruns and slipping deadlines can begin, 31 years after the project was first mooted. By then the UK may be two years into a lengthy “transitional” post-Brexit period, and the bright economic forecasts which are used to justify the plan may be no more use than hot air balloons.
There is a case that air travel has made life better for many people and that more of it would continue to do so. Nearly two-thirds of Heathrow’s present traffic is leisure flying. Mass tourism has boosted the economy of many countries and greatly enlarged our experience of the world, and perhaps our sympathies as well. However unpleasant the experience of a modern airport can be, through which we are run like rats in a maze of shopping malls and security checks, it still seems better to many of us than being trapped in our own countries all year round. Heathrow as it stands today is an unimposing portal to Britain. Failing to expand it is simply sabotaging the country. Beyond that, the country is dependent, like all others, on air freight. So the plans for expansion are in some ways well motivated. We can even overlook the fact that they are promoted by Mr Grayling, a man notoriously unable to make even trains run on time.
Much of the opposition is simply nimbyism. Those West London Tory MPs who claim to be opposed to Heathrow’s third runway on environmental grounds, and then propose that it be built onto Gatwick or Stansted instead illustrate this clearly. There is some amusement to be derived from the rumoured machinations to allow the foreign secretary (the MP for local Uxbridge) to be out of the country on the occasion of the vote, so that he does not have to live up to his stated determination to oppose it even if he has to lie down in front of the bulldozers, but this is a frivolity, like most things about Mr Johnson. The serious objections to the plan remain, as they have been for most of this century, the environmental ones. The simple fact is that it is impossible to combine a commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050 with the strategic encouragement of air travel.
Mr Grayling’s statement made much play of technological advances. Aircraft will be quieter, cleaner, and greener, he said. It is entirely possible that they will be quieter, and the promise of an enforceable night time curfew when even the quieter planes will be silent must have done much to still some of the opposition from under the flight path. But the lasting damage the planes do is silent and far from the airport. It is their emissions in the upper atmosphere which drive climate change and all its disastrous effects. Nor can those be confined to the poorer parts of the world, as we’re already seeing. As the world warms, the price of mass tourism will be paid in mass migrations. It is true that aircraft have got lighter and more fuel efficient, but this is of no benefit to the environment if there are more of them, flying more often – and that is the underlying logic of the Heathrow expansion. In the long term, which gets closer every day, the only answer to the problem of fossil fuels is to keep them in the ground. Doing so demands that we keep aircraft on the ground as well. MPs should reject this plan when it comes to the vote.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/05/the-guardian-view-on-heathrow-expansion-better-never-than-so-late

Planning families is not easy, 4 June). The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) strongly agrees that “crude attempts to raise and lower birthrates are unlikely to produce sustainable solutions”. Instead, they are more likely to violate internationally agreed human rights standards and cost women their freedom or lives.
UNFPA promotes the view that family planning should always be firmly based on the right of all individuals to control their fertility and therefore determine freely the number of their children, which your sensible recommendations on education and empowerment of women and greater access to family planning support.
This right was proclaimed 50 years ago, in May 1968, at the international conference on human rights. The principle of informed free choice, without any coercion, is essential to the long-term success of family planning.
Experience has repeatedly shown that challenging population dynamics (as a result of high or low fertility) are best addressed by respecting women’s rights. Sadly, more than 200 million women lack access to modern contraception, with about $700m needed to meet their demand for something that will save and transform their lives. This requires a collective will and funding to provide women with the means to exercise their right to determine their family size.Arthur ErkenDirector, division of communications and strategic partnerships, UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund
• Your editorial on the implications of family size and population erroneously bought into the narrow economic narrative that this is simply an issue of productivity, resources and dependency ratios. It is partly about those things – but far more importantly and fundamentally it is about our planetary crisis. In the era of climate change and with the “sixth mass extinction” well under way, we must recognise that each one of the extra 15,000 people added to our global population every hour places more demands on our already stressed planet and its ecosystems. Everyone on Earth deserves a fair, sustainable share of our planet’s resources – but that human right will only be possible if we learn to moderate both our numbers and consumption.
Yes, there are challenges associated with lowering birthrate and promoting smaller families. Those are infinitely easier to solve than the environmental devastation exacerbated by the increasing billions of people on our finite planet. This is solvable through ethical, non-coercive means and the available technology of family planning – but only if we grasp the nettle now and take positive action.Robin MaynardDirector, Population Matters

Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy recently got Kevin Rudd. Australia’s Nelson Mandela Day committee has snaffled Julia Gillard for their next annual lecture.
What about our most recent former PM, Tony Abbott?
Next month, Abbott will deliver the “2018 Bob Carter Commemorative Lecture” to the Australian Environment Foundation (AEF), where the ticketing site says he’ll talk about “Climate Change and Restraining Greenhouse Gas Emissions”.
The AEF is an “environment charity” that promotes views that wind turbines make you sick, that human-caused climate change isn’t really a thing, and that environmentalists (the other sort) are killing farmers, fisheries and the economy. 
Abbott’s lecture will no doubt pick up from his speech in London in December, where he delivered a suite of climate science denial talking points to the Global Warming Policy Foundation.
So who, or what, is the AEF? To look into its history, and the people involved with it, is to take a deep dive into Australia’s climate science denial network.
But first let’s look at the AEF right now because, as an “environmental charity”, Abbott’s next port of call doesn’t seem to do very much.
Latest figures available from the Australian Charities and Not-for-Profits Commission show that in 2016, the charity declared an annual income of just $1,175.
The AEF’s YouTube channel has just 11 subscribers and has posted only one video, from December 2016.
In May 2017, the AEF lent its logo to a letter to US President Donald Trump to offer “enthusiastic support” for his commitments to withdraw from the UN Paris climate agreement. But between July 2017 and February 2018, there was virtually nothing posted on its website.
Much of that website, including the “Climate News” section, is content from former Institute of Public Affairs fellow Alan Moran and postings that variously dismiss human-caused climate change and renewable energy, in particular wind power. 
The charity has two other trading names listed with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission – the Australian Climate Science Coalition (ACSC) and ListenToUs – but both of these seem to be defunct.
The ACSC at one time was receiving cash from a US affiliate, the American Climate Science Coalition, itself an offshoot of the International Climate Science Coalition. The ACSC received $107,000 from its American donors in 2009 and 2010, after which the donations stopped.
The ACSC didn’t do any actual climate science, but did host talks from folks like climate science denier and self-titled “high priest of climate scepticism” Christopher Monckton, who once compared then Australian government climate policy advisor Professor Ross Garnaut to a Nazi. 
The AEF’s ListenToUs website was an attempt to generate an online social media campaign against carbon pricing. But now, either the AEF has a new line in promoting “Male Strippers Melbourne” and “Home Cleaning Melbourne” or some sort of hackery or lapsing of domain names has eventuated.
When Abbott delivers his lecture, he’ll be introduced by Dr Peter Ridd, the controversial marine scientist sacked from James Cook University for alleged multiple breaches of its code of conduct. 
Ridd has been a director at the AEF since 2005. That’s a neat segue into the AEF’s history.
In late 2004, the Institute of Public Affairs – by then already pushing out climate science misinformation – held its “Eureka forum” to work out how to push back against “environmental fundamentalism” that, it claimed, was “denying farmers, foresters, fishermen, prospectors, miners, beekeepers, 4WD enthusiasts and others access rights, property rights, water rights”.
As part of this push back, the AEF was formed in early 2005 with the Institute of Public Affairs as its business address. Then IPA boss Mike Nahan and IPA staffer Jennifer Marohasy were both founding directors. These days the IPA says it has nothing to do with the AEF.
Over the years, the AEF has consistently promoted climate science denialism. The group has campaigned against marine parks, carbon taxes, climate science and wind farms, which it says make people sick.
For several years, the AEF gained a little notoriety thanks to TV celebrity Don Burke serving as its chairman.
The AEF’s current chair, lawyer Tom Bostock, was also a board member of the Lavoisier Group – another collection of conservative white males that came together in 2000 to fight Australia’s engagement in United Nations climate agreements and to attack the science of human-caused climate change.
Another AEF director is Tom Quirk, a former director at the IPA and a member of the ACSC advisory panel when that project was a thing. Quirk is involved with another effort to convince right wingers that human-caused climate change science is a massive con. 
The unincorporated “Climate Study Group”, of which Quirk is a member, has been running a series of odd adverts in the Australian.
The half-page ads have evoked the philosopher Socrates and some cod-psychology to claim sea levels are not rising, global warming isn’t caused by rising levels of greenhouse gas, and we should all be preparing for a coming ice age.
So what of Abbott’s lecture? The AEF says it “established the lecture series to commemorate the life and work of Bob Carter”, who was an AEF director at the time of his death in 2016 (Carter was affiliated with 10 or more climate science denial groups around the world). 
Abbott’s lecture will be the second in the “series” – the first was delivered in November 2016 by Canadian denialist Tim Ball (that’s the one YouTube video on AEF’s channel).
At the time, Ball was in Australia with former One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts.
Ball’s speech was a classic of the climate denial genre, mixing conspiracy theories, hatred of “leftists” and disregard for any evidence contradicting a view that climate change is the “biggest deception in history”.
Ball claimed the United Nations, led by a favourite enemy of climate science denialists, Maurice Strong, was attempting to exert global control over people’s lives to push a socialist agenda. Ball even used a slide of a quote from Strong, supposedly uttered at the 1992 Rio Earth summit, which read: “Isn’t the only hope for this planet that the industrialised civilisation collapses? Isn’t it our responsibility to bring that about?”
This quote is widely used among climate science deniers as evidence of the nefarious motives of the UN. The quote was actually from two years earlier, when Strong was talking to a journalist about the plot of a novel he hoped to write (incidentally another Maurice, Tony Abbott’s former lead business advisor Maurice Newman, has also used the fake quote in a 2015 opinion column in the Australian. Until recently, One Nation also ran the quote on its website).
I emailed three of the listed AEF directors – Ridd, Bostock, and Alan Oxley, the former Hawke-era diplomat and now chairman of the APEC Study Centre at RMIT University. 
I asked about the charity’s activities, how they secured Abbott’s appearance and the charity’s apparently defunct projects (including the Melbourne strippers) but I didn’t get a response.
… we can’t turn away from climate change. The Guardian’s environmental coverage reports the scientific facts, social consequences and political choices that are shaping the fate of our planet. As the world's leaders turn their backs on the environment, we are at a crisis point. Individual consumer choices are important, but we need collective action to achieve the systemic change that will really make a difference. Our pioneering and our fearless reporting on the environment can play a vital role in that. But we need our readers’ support.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute.

• Timothy Garton Ash (1 June) is not the only one to fear for the future of the European project. However, I find fighting talk about reclaiming “European sovereignty” as depressing and shortsighted as Brexit. Mass migration is not a “threat” to Europe; it is a complex human struggle driven by war, poverty and climate breakdown, issues in which we are globally complicit. The approval in April of a new immigration law cuts asylum application deadlines, doubles detention times and will introduce a one-year prison term for entering France illegally. In northern France, police are confiscating tents and removing shoes from refugees. This does not make Macron “impressive” and “compelling”, it makes him cruel and miserly – the same as all other European leaders who are overwhelmed by their obligations and so retreat to identity politics. We might feel reassured pretending this emperor is the one wearing shiny new clothes, but we have a greater responsibility to our neighbours – people, not “juggernauts” about to “trample us”. Less “courage”, fellow Europeans, perhaps, and more compassion.Libby RuffleWoodbridge, Suffolk

When the machine ran out of water, he asked passing boys to fetch a bucket. When he had to give directions to workers in the building across the lane, he shouted. Every few minutes, he took a long swig from his water bottle and spat the contents on to the ground without swallowing. “Ramadan,” he explained.
Northern India, like neighbouring Pakistan, is in the grip of a heatwave, with temperatures reaching 47C. A blanket of hot air has settled on Delhi clearing pavements across the usually busy capital. India is particularly vulnerable to temperature increases associated with climate change. Since 1992, about 25,000 Indians are estimated to have died because of heatwaves. Yet the country is quietly optimistic that it can prevent at least some of those deaths.
In the past two years, the numbers dying from heat-related illnesses has fallen sharply, from 2,040 in 2015 – when roads melted in the searing heat – to half that the following year and to a little over 200 in 2017, according to government data.
Public health advocates say this has been a triumph of common sense. A combination of public awareness campaigns, training for medical staff and simple policy changes – such as unlocking the gates of public gardens during the day –have averted thousands of deaths for little cost.
The catalyst was a heatwave in May 2010 in Ahmedabad, the largest city in the western state of Gujarat, that killed more than 1,100 people, and prompted authorities to seek help. “The first thing was making people aware that heat can kill,” said Parthasarathi Ganguly, a professor of public health and former World Health Organisation official.
“India is a tropical country, so people are used to heat: they take it as a natural phenomenon. They say, it will be hot – what’s new?”
Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?
This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.

Under Ahmedabad’s action plan – first implemented in 2013, when temperatures rose so high it risked triggering organ failure – school days were reduced, government work programmes ceased, and free water was distributed in busy areas. White reflective paint was applied to roofs in slum communities, cutting temperatures in homes by up to five degrees.
In hospitals, staff were trained to identify early signs of heat stroke, including dizziness or severe diarrhoea. Instead of waiting in stifling wards, patients were rushed to dedicated cool rooms equipped with fans, ice packs and, electricity supply permitting, air conditioning.
“Doctors don’t go on vacation any more when it’s hot,” said Anjali Jaiswal, of the US-based National Resource Defense Council, which advised on the plan. “They watch the temperature and make sure the hospital is staffed.”
Ahmedabad already had plenty of charities willing to distribute water. “They see it as an act of god,” Ganguly said. The city government simply allocated each charity a zone, to ensure the whole city was covered. The gates of city gardens, usually closed in the daytime, were opened so that hawkers, traffic police and rickshaw pullers could seek shade. “The council didn’t spend a rupee,” Ganguly said.
The first test of the new system was in May 2014 when, he says, temperatures again reached the levels that had killed so many. “According to our initial estimates, 800 fewer people died,” he said. “In terms of cost per lives saved, it is one of the most effective interventions in public health until now.” Since then, 11 more cities have adopted similar heat action plans, and one is currently in the works for Delhi.
India’s national disaster management authority is aiming to reduce the death toll from excessive heat to zero. So far this year, government officials say, the heat has killed 11 people. Temperatures will drop across India at the end of this month with the arrival of the monsoon rains.

Asteroids capable of causing worldwide consequences don't hit the Earth that often. The last was 65 million years ago. There are projects by astronomers to keep an eye on near Earth asteroids.
Super volcanoes are somewhat more common than large asteroid impacts but there no current indication of any activity at possible super volcano sites.
We have successfully nipped some recent pandemics in the bud thanks to aid programs and good governance that have extended modern medicine to poorer countries. The abuse of antibiotics is a concern.
War has been a regular feature of the last century and this one to a lesser extent and once again is avoided by good governance in the majority of countries.

If the climate of a region becomes hotter or colder or wetter or drier or alternates more between hot and cold and wet and dry, the climate has changed by definition. In your post you comment on what an ""incredibly complex system"" our climate and related weather systems are. To understand how these regional climate and weather systems work in response to our warming global climate helps us prepare for and adapt to climate change.
""Why don't we just start from the position that 'the climate can change rapidly, we need to develop adaptation and social/ecological resilience strategies.""
Up until recent centuries the global climate has not changed rapidly. See previous paragraph re the need to understand how the current rapid global climate change impacts on regional climates and weather systems. As in treating a bacterial disease we need to treat the bacterial cause at the same time as we treat symptoms allowing the patient to adapt and develop the resilience to withstand the damage caused by the bacteria; with global warming we need to treat the cause at the same time as we deal with the symptoms of climate change that results from that warming. In my state we have developed good strategies to deal with increased cyclone destructiveness and flooding which include both infrastructure, emergency response and social responses among communities at risk. Tree clearing legislation has increased ecological resilience to the direct and indirect affects of increased cyclone destructiveness but the direct effect of global warming on sea surface temperatures has seen unprecedented destruction of one of best protected and certainly the largest of worlds coral reef ecosystems.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1528170131000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'the bacteria', u'effect': u'the damage'}], u'author_id': u'12483673', u'in_reply_to': u'116581006', u'id': u'116608068', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Ummerr', u'text': u'Wouldn't you realistically apply a filter for OECD countries?', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1528168501000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'15326060', u'in_reply_to': u'116607391', u'id': u'116607871', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'cnog01', u'text': u'The guys who wanted to blow up the Etihad flight?

Depending on where you choose to draw the line on our evolutionary lineage, we've here for 500,000 years or more or at least 200,000 years during which time we've seen changes in the global climate, though none as quick as what we've seen recently.
As described above after the deglacial global greenhouse warming ended 9,000 years ago we've slow cooling of a generally stable climate as Co2 has remained at the usual interglacial level of 280 ppm.
If we hadn't increased atmospheric CO2 to over 400 ppm we would have seen continuing slow cooling as NHHLSI continued its decline for another 50,000 years until it reached a critical level where once again the northern glacial ice sheets started to advance reducing CO2 eventually to around 200 ppm as the next glacial period set in. Stability is a relative term but we would not have seen warming at the current rate without the human intervention of burning fossil fuels in large quantities.
""By the way why do you think the marketing term changed from global warming to climate change.""
While more familiar with science than marketing, I wasn't aware that there'd any change in terms. Since becoming aware of global warming and climate change in the early seventies as a student studying Pleistocene sediments and landforms influenced by global warming and climate change, I'd always though one led to the other because after all a warming of the globe is by definition a change in its climate.

Why was it warmer? Why colder?""
My country has the world's continual human civilisation and the climate has changed during the 60,000 years that humans have been here. From 60,000 to 20,000 years ago the climate was colder and there were valley glaciers in Tasmania and snow melt fed rivers draining inland from the Australian Alps, Barrington Tops and the New England Plateau. At this time atmospheric CO2 was between 190 and 200 ppm resulting in a reduced greenhouse effect compared to that of the last 9,000 years. The world was in a glacial period. The oceans were 120 metres lower and it was possible to walk from Hobart at the southern latitude equivalent of Toronto to equatorial Port Moresby.
19,000 years ago Northern Hemisphere high latitude summer insolation (NHHLSI) peaked causing the vast continental glacial icesheets that covered North American to just south of the Canadian border and northern Eurasia to start melting. The meltwater from this regional warming stopped the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) stopping the flow of cold dense saline water to the Southern Ocean. In the absence of this cooling water, the Southern Ocean warmed oxidising carbon rich oceanic oozes and releasing CO2 which over the next 10,000 years increased astmospheric CO2 from 200 to 280 ppm causing global greenhouse warming, retreat of the vast North American and north Eurasian continental glacial icesheets and sea rise of 120 metres or more. As this CO2 rise and consequent global warming took over 10,000 years, the rate of warming was much slower than that which we have seen in the last century. The people of my country witnessed the inundation of wide continental shelves and found themselves separated from their people in New Guinea and Tasmania by dangerous seas.
We are currently in an interglacial period. There have been many such periods over the last 2.6 million years. Modern humans were around at the time of the last interglacial which was hotter than the current preindustrial interglacial was because NHHLSI was higher. The last 2.6 million years have seen alternations between glacial and interglacial periods initiated by NHHLSI changes but driven by changes in atmospheric CO2. 
Over the last 9,000 years of the current interglacial NHHLSI has slowly but steadily declined resulting in slow global cooling. The greenhouse warming of the last century and a half which has seen atmospheric CO2 increase from 280 to over 400 ppm has overwhelmed the slight cooling of a slowly declining NHHLSI resulting in the global warming we have seen over that period.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1528164128000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': None, u'effect': u'the global warming of the last two centuries'}, {u'cause': u'what', u'effect': u'the climate to change pre - human civilisation'}, {u'cause': None, u'effect': u'a reduced greenhouse effect'}, {u'cause': u'northern hemisphere high latitude summer insolation', u'effect': u'the vast continental glacial icesheets that covered north american to just south of the canadian border and northern eurasia to start melting'}, {u'cause': None, u'effect': u'global greenhouse warming'}, {u'cause': u'nhhlsi was higher', u'effect': u'was'}, {u'cause': None, u'effect': u'slow global cooling'}, {u'cause': None, u'effect': u'the global warming'}], u'author_id': u'12483673', u'in_reply_to': u'116581006', u'id': u'116607375', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'ramAustralia', u'text': u'You didn't research that one too deeply did you?

The Australian Senate’s declaration in May ‘18 that climate change is a “current and existential national security risk” is in most respects simply an extension of the mentality of hard borders eagerly promoted by successive Misgovernments since the Tampa matter of 2001. Observe the obvious disinterest in productive solutions; the problem is not merely militarised but institutionalised.
What we see virtually every day in “our” “leaders” talk of “border protection”, but too often fail to observe, is the normalisation of criminal, reckless and gratuitous violence by a nation-state. Extraordinary demonisation of desperate people fleeing desperate situation is promoted not as an regrettable circumstance but an absolute necessity, often as a manhood extender.
Ruling class warfare against the 99% is the central cause of today’s social dislocation and political protest. As Hockey emphasised, the wealth of our society is not for those in it but for those who control it. Climate change is regarded as a “national security risk” because it potentially threatens the capacity of the filthy rich to loot our society to the extent to which the have become accustomed since 1983. That’s what all this is really about. See the list in a post below for just one portion of what we could take off them.
Such impunity plus the frequent invocation of “strong borders” plus “national security” plus “supporting the troops” plus the Anzac mythology is in fact giving us worsening conflict at greater cost, with steadily worse potential solutions.

We could combine refugee relocation anywhere in our region (e.g. Bali or any other littoral neighbour) with aggressive support for both refugees and locals through education, training (especially in highly portable professions such as nursing), assistance with placement, and light industry.

Science is never entirely settled but rarely entirely unsettled. The cause of the global warming of recent centuries is settled. Which part of climate science are your 'deniers"" saying is not settled?

My activism in the early 1970s and consequent employment led to the establishment of a number a large national parks and nature reserves from tall forested country to desert grasslands. Near to now and nearer to where I now live, my daughter declared Australia's largest peri-urban national park 500 metres from my house and 11 km from the city centre and extending to Sunshine Coast hinterland.
""People clear fell their blocks to plant their spikey minimalist gardens.""
After I felled the Brazilian Pepperbush, Chinese Celtis, Viburnum, Pride of Bolivia, Poinsianna, African Tulip, Queen Palm and Alexander Palms, I added to the native species that were already there. They now total over 150 species. Some are a bit spikey, particularly the Citrus australis or Round Lime.
""Then they build their six star energy efficient homes,""
Our small home was built in the early '70s. It already had good roof insulation and a reverse cycle air conditioner when we bought it early this century. The larger of those 150 plus native species provide good shade in summer when the sun is directly overhead and allow the sun to angle under their canopy at this time of year. We also have large secure screens front and back which allow a cooling through breeze. So we only use that air conditioner on those days when the wet bulb temperature exceeds 34-35 degrees C and at such times a set of solar panels covers its energy use and that of the overhead fan. Unlike my washing machine it has no stars on its side wall.
""buy an electric car""
My fuel efficient Corolla is now getting old and may soon be up for replacement but an electric car equivalent would be much more expensive than similar new fuel efficient small cars. However many cars are left at home in my commuter suburb while there owners catch public transport to work and an electric car left at home could be charging from those rooftop solar panels.
""then pat themselves on the back about how 'green' they are."" 
I've never used your term ""green"" but if their homes, like mine are energy efficient, and they're charging their electric cars from their rooftop solar panels, and if like me their growing large native trees some of which are spikey, they are paying their part in reducing net CO2 emissions, which is a good thing.

Which is, no doubt, exactly what you'll do. So whatever facts are presented, they get dismissed. So how can they make their case if people refuse to listen? Yet the people that get called 'deniers' are usually not doing what 'warmists' do; they are not claiming absolute certainty about the future. They are not suggesting drastic policy measures on future unknowns in an incredibly complex system. They accept climate change; but they say the 'science is not settled'. They are not convinced that humans are causing it. If humans are the main factor, then I ask you again: what caused the climate to change pre-human civilisation? Why was it warmer? Or colder? Are you suggesting that if we weren't here, the climate would have remained stable forever? By the way, why do you think the marketing term changed from global warming to climate change? Can't you see the weaselling out? Now, hot or cold, dry or wet...climate change! Why didn't they just start from the position that ""the climate can change rapidly, we need to develop adaptation and social/ecological resilience strategies"".

There are many other apocalyptic things we can dwell on if we choose to....why CO2? What are the politics behind it? We are not really in control of this planet! The 'deniers' say the warmists cannot prove that CO2 will have/has had the effect that they are claiming. Hansen's own failed predictions  support that claim. The IPCC quote from the other thread supports that claim. Climategate showed the corruption. The vicious attacks on scientists who simply have other views shows the politicisation and cult-like thinking. That's what I don't like.

The developers of the housing project were major donors to the political party which contains a significant climate science denying extreme right wing faction.

It basically has the entire story from a geopolitical standpoint - lots of detail and very interesting predictions for various different countries. Also a really good interview with him here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELqZe6Xqwzc). 
From my perspective - and I wish people would get this - we need to recognise that batteries are not going to work for all sectors (pretty obvious) and that hydrogen is basically humanities only hope for full-on decarbonisation. 
And by 'hydrogen' all I mean initially is building hydrogen refuelling stations - they produce the hydrogen on-site and therefore require renewable energy, and so in this regard are fairly simple once you have found suitable locations for them.
So the situation is: Toyota are increasing production capacity to 30,000 cars per year by 2020, and will going to keep going up from there, and then there are 4 or 5 fuel cell/FCEV manufacturers building factories in China. And Korea, which will probably ramp up production in line with Toyota.
So this is what needs to happen - governments need to have the balls to build hydrogen refuelling stations and get off their fossil fuel imports - which shouldn't even need to be at all painful as the cost of hydrogen per km in the EU should easily reach 5c/km dispensed - and in fact just to prove this Bulgaria are building 10 stations by 2025. And this is a country (admittedly with good solar resources) that is right next to Russia and therefore has very low petrol prices to begin with.
So absolutely no argument about the financial viability or the economic basis - it really does point to the level to which the fossil fuel industry is pulling the strings policy-wise. And just to make clear: the amount of tax received by EU governments for fuel is miniscule when compared to income tax and other taxes; it is not that they are scared of losing this money. They are just either not up to speed on the issue or are essentially on the side of various oil lobbies.
We need to start understanding that hydrogen does not have an alternative for energy storage, winter heating, pre-existing transmission networks, industry heat & feedstock and yes - transport; because just as an example we would need 50% of the copper ever mined if we wanted to hook everything up to wires.
For those wanting to check up on the continuing decline of hydrogen production costs versus natural gas, Cédric Philibert who is a senior analyst at the IEA outlines the issues from a European perspective in a recent article (https://twitter.com/reupdateinfo/status/1000336768317771776) - this is the route we have to take - and then Equinor is confident that floating offshore wind will reach 3-4c/kWh by 2030 (so slightly better than figures he provides, although he does work for the IEA). 
Australia has far better renewable resources and recent investments there mark the start of a large export industry.

The birth-rate in India is falling significantly, unlike Pakistan

This is simply incorrect. The birthrate in both countries has been falling fast, fastest in Pakistan. Pakistan's fall just started about 12 years later (1975) than India (1963). India has gone from 6 to 2.3, and Pakistan from 6.7 to 3.4. Both are still falling although India's fall has slowed down in the last few years (which is unfortunate as they are not yet under replacement rate (2.1).

We export coal, so it's our responsibility.... If we were to export even more coal it would be an even greater level of responsibility. If we were the only country to export coal it would be ALL our responsibility... etc. I can beat you at the ""If scenarios"" game any time, bob.

That is based on the assumption that burning coal is a very seriously bad thing to do. Frankly its a silly assumption.

Err no we wash our hands because the society who burn it are responsible for maintaining their territory as viable for the continuing lives of their citizens.

Previous articles have said having less children is the most important thing you can do to prevent climate change..
BQENDThis is bollocks for a great many reasons, including children add little to carbon footprints, not nothing, but it is a small factor, when their personal and the state infrastructure would largely remain the same whether they existed or not. Yes there's schools and other industries that rely on them, but their footprint is far smaller than an adult, and a 2 child family footprint differs little from the same family with a third child. Which then gets to the key point of when they become adults and have children of their own, etc. If we have successfully migrated to a low carbon economy and other sustainable aspects, as we must, it is not a problem, HENCE, the most critical thing we can do is to vote for Governments that are committed to decarbonising the economy as rapidly as possible.

Bringing together the unusual bedfellows of military generals and environmentalists to warn about the dangers of climate change, it has the possibility to break though Australia’s culture wars on the issue. However, by framing climate change as a security matter, it also has significant consequences in shaping how we respond to a warming planet. As the climate crisis unfolds, is the military the institution we want to turn to for solutions?
The Australian Senate inquiry was initiated by the former Greens senator Scott Ludlam and heard from diverse actors, including humanitarian agencies and defence strategists. It examined the likely impacts of extreme weather on military infrastructure, the economy and the wider region. It concluded that “climate change is exacerbating threats and risks to Australia” and called for improved military preparedness, better studies of “risks” to Australia, and enhanced coordination between government agencies.
The question rarely asked is whose security are we talking about - security of what, for whom and from whom?
In this, Australia is following a well-worn path forged by the European Union and the United States. The Pentagon in 2003 was the first to talk about climate security, framing climate change as a “threat multiplier” that would exacerbate conflict, terrorism, mass migration and social instability. In 2008, the EU concurred saying that global temperature increases of more than 2 degrees (current predictions suggest we are heading for more than 3 degrees) would “lead to unprecedented security scenarios”.
Security is a modern day weasel word – who can be against security? The question rarely asked is whose security are we talking about - security of what, for whom and from whom? The US, EU and now Australian strategies, though, clearly state they are talking about the security of their respective nations in the face of “threats” usually coming from the consequences of climate change in neighbouring countries. 
The submission from Australia’s Department of Defence to the inquiry put it this way: “When climate impacts are combined with ethnic or other social grievances, they can contribute to increased migration, internal instability or intra-state insurgencies, often over greater competition for natural resources. These developments may foster terrorism or cross-border conflict.”
They argued that this “could lead to an increase in the demand for a wide spectrum of Defence responses including maintaining law and order following disasters”. The image they paint is a dystopian one, which assumes that climate change disruptions will lead to a dog-eat-dog world, causing conflicts and wars, and prompting millions to migrate – and this will require the military to deal with the ensuing chaos. 
The effect of this approach is to turn the victims of climate change into potential threats and to make a militarised response to the impact of climate change the default response. The Australian Senate report is more nuanced than some US Pentagon reports in advocating for a range of strategies, including additional climate finance and better disaster resilience planning. 
But by blurring the distinction between the military’s ideas of security and other “human security” approaches, it embraces and reinforces a military response to climate change. This can be seen in the report’s strong appeals to the military to expand its role in disaster relief, even though this typically is the most costly form of relief and can end up militarising humanitarian disasters as the world witnessed graphically in New Orleans in the aftermath of hurricane Katrina where deployed National Guards ended up shooting at flood victims. 
The Senate report has less focus on the way the impacts of climate change will vary dramatically depending on the level of poverty and vulnerability of the affected community. Nor does it challenge the economic structures or laws that have led to this inequality and vulnerability, such as the role of Australia’s trade policies in undermining rural livelihoods and disrupting food systems. This is not surprising. After all, the essence of “security” is to secure what already exists. This means securing a world order in which Australia’s per capita income is 25 times that of nearby Kiribati or Solomon Islands and where even in Australia 2.9 million people live under the poverty line. It is an approach that seeks to build walls to exclude the dispossessed rather than tackle the underlying causes that cause people to migrate – shown today most visibly in Australia’s inhumane treatment of refugees in Nauru.
 Australia’s experience of unprecedented heat waves and fires in recent years has already shown that climate change will have a big impact on the country and the wider region. But how those impacts play out will depend to a great degree on how we choose to respond. An approach that relies on military forces and barbed wire will worsen the crisis and create a world no one wants to live in. Real security emerges from recognising our interdependence, tackling injustice and inequality, and working together to protect those who are most vulnerable.

Fossil fuel reserves and production facilities will become stranded assets, having absorbed capital but unable to be used to make a profit. This carbon bubble has been estimated at between $1tn and $4tn (£3tn), a large chunk of the global economy’s balance sheet.
Investors with high exposure to fossil fuels in their portfolios will be hurt, as those companies and assets cease to be profitable. Jobs will be lost in fossil fuel production and related industries. If the bubble bursts suddenly, as a new paper in Nature suggests it might, rather than gradually deflating over decades, then it could trigger a financial crisis. 
Arguably yes, in that it corrects what has long been a market failure. Currently, fossil fuel prices do not reflect the environmental damage the fuels do, in climate change and air and water pollution. If they were priced to take these external factors into account, they would cost much more and businesses would seek alternatives – that is the idea behind carbon pricing. However, adding those external costs at a stroke would send energy prices soaring, with far-reaching effects across the economy. That is why economists prefer to phase in more realistic pricing for carbon-rich fuels over time. And the converse is also true: if renewables and energy efficiency were to result in an unexpected plunge in demand for fossil fuels, independently of government actions, that could send fossil fuel prices through the floor, triggering a crisis among the millions of investors in those assets.
Probably, but it could encourage some countries to pump out more, at least in the short term. For instance, if demand for fossil fuels drops suddenly then the OPEC countries could flood the market with cheap oil and gas, leaving those with more expensive assets – shale, tar sands, Arctic drilling – unable to compete.
Again, not quite. Lots of other actions are still needed, not least because the world could adjust to lower fossil fuel demand with a glut of energy production. The transition to a low-carbon economy is happening, but still much too slowly. At current rates, we will smash through the 2C ceiling promised under the Paris agreement, with rises of 3C and higher forecast. Without strong further commitments on climate change from major nations, we will reach our emissions targets too late and face a future of locked-in global warming that will result in floods, droughts, heatwaves and losses to global agriculture.
China relies on high-cost fuel imports at present and is benefitting from its investments in renewables, as is Japan, which has also invested heavily in energy efficiency. The EU is likely to be another winner as it has also moved early to pursue a low-carbon path.
Middle Eastern oil-rich states have built their economies on fossil fuels, so would need to diversify, which some are beginning to talk about. Russia could see its domestic fossil fuel industries collapse. Canada and the US could also be at risk: with their production of high-cost unconventional oil and gas from tar sands and shale, they are vulnerable both to a drop in demand and a drop in fossil fuel prices, unless their industries have invested in renewable energy and greater efficiency.
A reversal of major nations’ support for low-carbon technology and a reversion to an over-reliance on fossil fuels, which in many cases would have to involve large taxpayer subsidies for the latter.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/04/what-is-the-carbon-bubble-and-what-will-happen-if-it-bursts

Your speculation (specious 'assertation') that the AMOC in the mechanism for heat getting to the depths is also nonsense, as is covered here, both in terms of some of the mechanisms for heat transfer, and most noticeably that thermal expansion due to ocean's warming has not been due to the AMOC (an area where it has actually contracted) and expansion has occurred elsewhere.

What would be really interesting to know is how this vertical mixing may affect the heating of the planet.

You should make familiarise yourself with the parts of a sentence i.e. subject and predicate. The subject of Trenberth's statement is the measurement of accumulating heat at the earth's surface.

The use of the word 'travesty' is also key to understanding the statement, since it is defined as 'a false, absurd, or distorted representation of something'. Clearly, this cannot apply to heat, which is a passive phenomena and not a representative of anything except radiation; it applies only as a characterisation of their failure to figure out where the heat had gone.

Climate affects animals, but is the reverse true? Can animals affect the climate?
I don’t know how to answer that question definitively, but I was fortunate enough to read a very recent paper from a top fluid dynamics research team from Stanford. The team, led by Dr. John Dabiri, is well known for their work on bio-inspired flow. Part of what they study is the influence of living organisms on fluid flow, especially flow of water in the oceans.
This team’s recent work deals with something called aggregate motion of swimmers and it was published in Nature this year. The researchers wanted to know what happens when thousands (or millions) of small creatures swim in a single direction. Can the wakes they create add up to a larger scale motion and can these motions affect the ocean waters that they swim through?
The team fabricated large tanks and filled them with water and Artemis salina (a species of brine shrimp). Using LED lights they were able to get the shrimp to swim upwards and downwards in the tank, replicating their daily vertical migrations. In the oceans, the vertical motion is hundreds of meters, but in the experiment, the shrimp swam upwards and downwards just a few meters. 
Before the shrimp began their motion, the researchers measured the water stratification. That is, less dense water tends to rise to the top while heavier, more dense water sinks. In the oceans, as well as in experiments, the water density is dictated by its saltiness and the temperature. 
The authors discovered something amazing. After tricking the shrimp to swim upwards and downwards in the tank, the water stratification changed greatly. The shrimp brought heavier water upwards and lighter water downwards. While one or even a few hundred shrimp may not change the water structure, thousands of shrimp moving together can. A video of upward aggregate shrimp motion is shown here. Fluid motion from a single shrimp is shown here.
What the researchers also discovered was that shrimp, because they are dense, find it more difficult to swim upwards than downwards. Consequently, they have to create a strong propulsion jet when they swim upwards and virtually no propulsion jet when traveling downwards. Since these small propulsion jets are additive, shrimp cause much more mixing as they rise through the ocean waters compared to their descent. At the end of the day, the effect aggregate motion and turbulent mixing increased the normal mixing capacity of the water by a thousandfold.
I asked Dr. Dabiri about the importance of this project and he told me: 
Ocean dynamics are directly connected to global climate through interactions with the atmosphere. The fact that swimming animals could play a significant role in ocean mixing – an idea that has been almost heretical in oceanography – could therefore have consequences far beyond the immediate waters where the animals reside.
What would be really interesting to know is how this vertical mixing may affect the heating of the planet. By stirring up ocean waters, do the shrimp help bring cool water to the surface and carry hotter waters under the surfaces? And, if this is occurring, how large is the impact on a global scale?",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jun/07/tiny-shrimp-could-influence-global-climate-changes

James Hansen is one of the planet's most accomplished climate scientists with a long track record of accurate predictions. 
In addition to that accurate 1981 paper of Hansen’s which I linked to above, he ran what is arguably the planet’s most prestigious Earth science organization, NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies for over 30 years. 
From a New Yorker article by the Pulitzer-Prize winning author Elizabeth Kolbert about James Hansen:
“From early on, the significance of Hansen’s insights was recognized by the scientific community. “The work that he did in the seventies, eighties, and nineties was absolutely groundbreaking,” Spencer Weart, a physicist turned historian who has studied the efforts to understand climate change, told me. He added, “It does help to be right.”
“I have a whole folder in my drawer labelled ‘Canonical Papers, ’ Michael Oppenheimer, a climate scientist at Princeton, said. “About half of them are Jim’s.””

Wrong.
The following is from a 1981 paper by James Hansen that at the time hit the front page of the NY Times, all the projections in it have either come to pass or are well underway. 
“Potential effects on climate in the 21st century include the creation of drought-prone regions in North America and central Asia as part of a shifting of climatic zones, erosion of the West Antarctic ice sheet with a consequent worldwide rise in sea level, and opening of the fabled Northwest Passage.""

Heatwaves tend to happen in July and August, and although there were famous falls of snow in parts of England on 2 June 1975, such events are mercifully very rare.
Occasionally June will surprise us. Last year, the month started with unsettled conditions and heavy rain. But from the middle of the month temperatures began to rise, with very warm air from continental Europe bringing temperatures above 30C every day from the 17th to 21st, reaching a peak of 34.5C (94.1F) at Heathrow Airport on the 21st, the highest June temperature since the long hot summer of 1976. That helped push the average temperature up for the month, so that, despite a return to cooler, fresher weather, this was the equal fifth warmest June in the UK since records began in 1910.
Yet June 2017 was also surprisingly wet – the sixth wettest June on record. It was the wettest ever in Scotland, where more than 112mm (4.5 inches) of rain falling in Moray during a single day, and temperatures at the famous “cold spot” of Altnaharra fell to a chilly –2.3C.

But the modern version has also opened up a new battleground – the environment.
Last week, as several hundred protesters tried and failed to gain entry to the Kentucky statehouse, concerns over healthcare roiled the crowd. But the campaigners also decried the pollution of air and water by the state’s mining industry, which has sickened residents and contributed to a sprawling, existential crisis – climate change – that was barely on the horizon when Martin Luther King Jr was assassinated.
“The police were blocking us from the statehouse, which tells us that even people with black lung aren’t welcome there,” said the Rev William Barber, a North Carolina pastor and a rousing progressive voice who has taken on King’s mantle in the campaign, referencing the disease suffered by some coalminers. “We understand the connection between systemic racism, voter suppression and ecological devastation. They are interlocking injustices and we can’t ignore any of them.”
Black majority churches are increasingly speaking out on environmental issues, jolted by reams of evidence showing that people of colour are far more likely than whites to live next to sources of harmful pollution such as coal plants and landfills. 
The toxic water crisis in Flint, Michigan, as well as high-profile pipeline protests such as the one staged by the Standing Rock tribe in North Dakota, have also helped install the environment as a central plank in the Poor People’s Campaign. 
This has set up a theological collision with some evangelical conservatives who view the Earth as a resource for humans to exploit. “God has blessed us with natural resources. Let’s use them to feed the world. Let’s use them to power the world,” Scott Pruitt, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and devout Christian, said last year. Under Pruitt, the EPA has moved to roll back dozens of regulations aimed at maintaining clean air and water.
Barber is derisive of this attitude, which he says stems from a disastrous misunderstanding of a passage in Genesis in which God gives man “dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth”.
“Dominion in this sense means to care for, not destroy,” Barber said. “The first commandment is to take care of creation. To destroy creation is fundamentally irreligious. It’s a violation. It’s a sin. Pruitt says he believes in God but you’ve never seen him pull out scripture that shows Jesus said we must help corporations poison the water.
“You get white so-called evangelicals who say they are against abortion but say nothing about environmental devastation that is destroying lives and stunting children. The president may have chosen the worst person to run the EPA but ultimately Earth is the only place we have to live. A lot of people of faith are now articulating that not taking care of Earth is an affront to basic theology.”
Barber, a 54-year-old man who walks with the aid of a cane due to an advanced type of arthritis called ankylosing spondylitis, grew up with an acute appreciation of clean air and water. A pulp mill near his North Carolina home “filled the air with all sorts of smells and toxins”, Barber recalls. His father, also a pastor, helped workers at the mill get adequate insurance to help pay for cancer treatments.
Since then he has helped galvanize his flock against toxic waste dumped in rivers in North Carolina and Virginia, visited black families in Alabama who endure raw sewage in their back yards, headed north to see the retreating ice in Alaska and allied with the Apache tribe over concerns a copper mine will taint their drinking water.
“This is real for me,” Barber said. “Where there’s pollution a community will get a cold but poor people will get pneumonia. The love of money is the root of all evil and it’s the root of all environmental devastation. It’s a dangerous self-destruction.” The Poor People’s Campaign is demanding the US shifts to 100% renewable energy, curbs oil and gas drilling and ensures clean drinking water for its citizens.
These goals stem from an environmental movement that King did not live to see or fully embrace. But there is evidence King was cognizant of what was at stake, praising the beauty of the world and lamenting that “cities are gasping in polluted air and enduring contaminated water”.
Just five months before he was shot, King’s famous speech A Christmas Sermon on Peace contained key ecological touchstones. “All life is interrelated,” he said. “We are all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly. We are made to live together because of the interrelated structure of reality.”
Last year, Barber met with Pope Francis, who has perhaps now eclipsed Al Gore as the world’s most famous environmentalist. The pope’s 2015 encyclical called climate change “a global problem with grave implications” and warned the Earth is “beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth”. Francis added that Christians who believe that God “invites us to subjugate the Earth” are mistaken.
There are allies closer to home, too. Black pastors have started to organize various outreach efforts to engage their communities on issues such as climate change and energy efficiency. “We focus on the election, we focus on poverty, we focus on Black Lives Matter,” said the Rev Kip Banks, a senior pastor in Washington DC. “Equally important is the environment.”
While stressing the urgency of climate change can be a hard sell, the presence of heavy industry, asthma-ridden children and foul smells is immediately apparent to the communities that are burdened with them.
“We are called upon to care for the Earth, not deplete it,” said the Rev Leo Woodberry, who spearheaded a campaign to halt a proposed wood pellet mill in the small North Carolina town of Hamlet, a majority black area already surrounded by a cluster of industrial plants. 
“African Americans are far more likely to have asthma, our children are more likely to die than white children,” he said. “People stand up in church and say they need a respirator. We are pushing and pushing and pushing so that something is done about it.”

A paper from the progressive thinktank the Australia Institute finds the Turnbull government’s target of a 26-28% reduction on 2005 levels is “inadequate according to any recognised principle-based approach” and the Labor target of a 45% reduction is “the bare minimum necessary for Australia to be considered to be making an equitable contribution to the achievement of the Paris agreement’s two degree target”.
The research analyses Australia’s targets using the conventional approaches used to determine abatement levels – population, cost-sharing, “historic responsibility” and hybrid models. It says in the context of the global carbon budget, neither policy would see Australia doing its fair share.
It points out that despite the clarity of the climate science, spelling out the urgent need to reduce emissions to keep surface temperature increases to less than two degrees above pre-industrial levels, the international community is continuing to struggle to agree on an equitable division of the global emissions budget.
Individual nation states have been reluctant to incur the economic and political costs associated with mitigation. 
“Whether you assess the fairness of a country’s emissions reduction target by population, economic cost, or a combination, our analysis shows Australia’s reduction target is unambitious, unfair and irresponsible,” says Richie Merzian, a former federal climate policy bureaucrat who now runs the Australia Institute’s climate and energy program.
The next round of international climate negotiations will be held in the Polish city of Katowice in December this year. The looming talks are critical to ensuring the signatories to the Paris deal maintain the momentum of their various emissions reduction pledges.
Unlike the United States, Australia remains in the Paris agreement, despite continued rumbling from conservatives about climate policy. However, the Turnbull government is still struggling to land its national energy guarantee which would impose emissions reductions in the electricity sector.
Because of internal pushback within the Coalition, and lobbying by some sectors, the government has not yet flagged a roadmap for emissions reductions across the economy, and there is widespread criticism of the lack of ambition in the target proposed for emissions reduction in electricity.
The latest official emissions data shows pollution increased by 1.5% in the year to December 2017. Australia’s emissions levels are now higher than they were in 2012 and have climbed by 3.6% since the carbon price was repealed in 2014.
Emissions are increasing in most sectors of the economy – in waste, agriculture and transport. Only one sector of the economy has recorded a decrease – the electricity sector – because aging coal-fired power plants have exited the system, and new renewables projects are coming on stream.
Merzian says Australia is continuing to “profit from high emissions rather than take up its fair share of reductions. We are unfairly shirking our global responsibilities onto others.”
“As we approach the next climate conference, what UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa is calling Paris 2.0, Australia will come under pressure from our friends and neighbours to lift our game and chip in our equitable share.”
“It is in Australia’s best interest to have targets that do our fair share. Inadequate targets that need continual revision bring uncertainty to business. The reduction target uncertainty that has plagued the energy sector will spread and be experienced by all sectors unless we get this right.”

Individual consumer choices are important, but we need collective action to achieve the systemic change that will really make a difference. Our pioneering and our fearless reporting on the environment can play a vital role in that. But we need our readers’ support.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute. Thank you.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/12/australias-emissions-reduction-target-unambitious-irresponsible

I know the climate science literature. Out of tens of thousands of articles the papers to which you allude are almost entirely countable on your hands and feet, even if you include the ""not very much warming"" category, and once you start to pull their 'science' to pieces it very quickly becomes aparent that they're all froth and no beer.
Further, the lame attempts by deniers to publish this grade of tripe has fallen away over the last few years in the face of the overwhelming body of literature that corroborates what scientists have been saying for decades. What really killed it for them was when the (genuinely) sceptical Richard Muller presumed to dismantle the science of global warming with his 'Best' project, and in the process managed to prove that everyone else was right after all, and guess what? it's warming, and probably a bit more than they said...
These denialist 'scientists' certainly don't deserve a 'hooray'. Almost to a person they can be demonstrated to be beholden to vested interests of one sort or another, whether it be fossil fuel sellers, fundamentalist conservative ideologues, or government entities who want to preserve the status quo regardless of the destruction of the future that such a stance demands.
Of course I might be wrong despite my familiarity with the scientific literature. In that case you'll be able to rebut me by providing the citations for the papers to which you refer, and the foundational tenets of the climatological consensus that they refute.

What could I possibly mean, seeing that I am not a climate scientist, and limit my involvement to putting on a jumper in the winter? Afterall, my science is in the area of human health, not the science of climate.
Well, to start with, my world view of climate is not coloured by what I see in the sky, or in my back yard or on the six-o'clock news. It is shallower than that - it is a healthy scepticism fuelled by all of the rubbish we were fed about nuclear winters and the world freezing over because of the ozone-layer hole, and the increase in Carbon Dioxide in the 1970's. 
The pollution police were ostracised in those days, and have succeeded in getting the dirty-exhaust-spewing cars off our roads, except for those ghastly diesel-fume-spewing 4WD's etc that have somehow gained an exemption from being taken off the roads because of their filthy lung-destroying fumes. 
Yes - we were told in the 1970's that CO2 is a gas that rose in concentration during the ice age. Today that is qualified by climate scientists on one hand who tell us that the CO2 levels rose before the big freeze ... and then qualified by those on the other payroll, who tell us that CO2 levels rose after the big freeze.
Then there are those that tell us that the vast and giant forests that grew before our coalfields were laid down, were possible because of the high levels of CO2 present during their growing phase.
I'll stick to my knitting and leave the debate to others.MY view: That climate change has always been with us, and we are probably just going through a wave of adjustment in an ever-revolving cycle.
I'd like to see the focus on pollution, rather than specific anthropological anti-this/anti-that projects. Surely that is something we can all work together on, and leave the politics to those of a more mendacious and duplicitous persuasion. Why don't they talk about the big plastic plug in the Pacific Gyre a little more? http://www.popsci.com.au/science/guess-how-many-giant-patches-of-garbage-there-are-in-the-ocean-now,469087
I doubt I am open to any more of this - and apart from an occasional glance at ""what are they saying now"" in the press, my back is usually turned to the rubbish spopken about climate change, and I try to get on with what I do know - true science in the care of human bodies.', u'recommendation_count': u'2', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1528885691000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'the ozone layer hole', u'effect': u'freezing over'}, {u'cause': u'their filthy lung destroying fumes', u'effect': u'being taken off the roads'}, {u'cause': u'the high levels of co2 present during their growing phase', u'effect': u'that the vast and giant forests that grew before our coalfields were laid down were possible'}], u'author_id': u'100083899', u'id': u'116933687', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'AwakenstoEmptiness', u'text': u'What a brilliant display of logic!Do you really think that ""global warming alarmists"" are against environmental protection and maintenance?', u'recommendation_count': u'8', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1528860192000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'100031067', u'in_reply_to': u'116921605', u'id': u'116921879', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'PeterJM', u'text': u'How can you beleive this?

If the wholesale spot price goes to its maximum, it is because some fossil fuel generators are offline and demand is high - either inadvertently or gas generators manipulating the market (yes, they can and the rules aren't being fixed).
The influence of renewables not working as well as its capacity is much less on those price spikes, and pushes down on the wholesale price normally (no fuel cost - ever!). 
There are supply problems in NSW at the moment, because Liddell, Bayswater and Vales Point *COAL* plants all have supply problems. No headlines on that from the biased media eg Murdoch, ABC etc.
Coal and gas plants tripped and went down 50+ times last summer. Large scale renewables none. It must have stung you that there were no generator blackouts last summer, even though the proportion of renewable energy was higher than the summer before.
Demand management helped, but solar (rooftop and large scale) sailing through completely reliably during sunny summer hot days covered the failures of the fossil fuel plants to a large degree.
Coal is unreliable. Gas is unreliable and subject to market manipulation.

For The Guardian, reporting on the environment is a  priority.  We give climate, nature and pollution stories the prominence they deserve, stories which often go unreported by others in the mainstream media. At this critical time for our species and our planet, we are determined to inform readers about threats, consequences and solutions based on scientific facts, not political prejudice or business interests. But we need your support to grow our coverage, to travel to the remote frontlines of change and to cover vital conferences that affect us all.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute. Thank you.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/12/its-hooray-for-climate-scientists-day-formerly-hug-a-climate-scientist-day

Baobab trees may react differently than other trees to the cutting and drilling. They may have introduced pathogens. Perhaps the substance they used (if any) to seal the cuts was toxic to the trees just as some substances which are safe for most humans (like peanuts) might kill others.
""To compare ages of different parts of the trees, the researchers collected samples of wood from the inner cavities and exteriors of the trunks and from deep incisions in the stems, which were then sealed to prevent infection.""

Toledo Aceves also points out that the number of studied baobabs is low and says it’s possible—although unlikely—that the findings are just reflecting a natural pattern of mortality in older individuals.
“These trees can live for more than two thousand years, and while the researchers are following exactly the older individuals, I think it is remarkable that more than 70 percent of them died in such a short period of time,” she says.

I would think any researcher or scientist doing any study would be well aware of how a tree works.

There is a social matter that contributes equally to the crisis:  government greenwash. I was startled, while plotting data, to see  the vast disparity between government words and reality. Greenwashing,  expressing concern about global warming and the environment while  taking no actions to actually stabilize climate or preserve the  environment, is prevalent in the United States and other countries,  even those presumed to be the ""greenest"". 
 The tragedy is that the actions needed to stabilize climate, which I  will describe, are not only feasible but provide additional benefits  as well. How can it be that necessary actions are not taken? It is  easy to suggest explanations - the power of special interests on our  governments, the short election cycles that diminish concern about long-term consequences - but I will leave that to the reader to assess.
 I believe the biggest obstacle to solving global warming is the role of money in politics, the undue sway of special interests.

I love baobab trees.. 
My father and I planted a waist high baobab tree on a game farm near Hoedspruit (greater Kruger area) in 1994. We bought this baobab (Adansonia Digitata) from the Hoedspruit airforce base nursery. I have visited it once or twice a year almost every year since and it has grown well - the trunk diameter is now about 105 cm. The main threat has been elephants and about 10 years ago, it's trunk was broken at a height of about 3 meters. We placed a disk of stones around the tree extending several meters out and now the elephants can only nibble the leaves (which make a good salad) with the tip of their trunks. 
I think one of the iconic baobab trees that have recently crumbled must be the Sunland baobab near Tzaneen: https://letabaherald.co.za/36765/world-famous-baobab-splits-again/. The hollow interior was used as a bar and in days of old as a prison. I have a photo from 1991 of my grandfather at 90 years old standing with his walking stick in front of it.

They do fine. And they may survive the environmental crisis. But as you go up the scale of what we call intelligence, they are less and less successful. By the time you get to mammals, there are very few of them as compared with, say, insects. By the time you get to humans, the origin of humans may be 100,000 years ago, there is a very small group. We are kind of misled now because there are a lot of humans around, but that’s a matter of a few thousand years, which is meaningless from an evolutionary point of view. His argument was, you’re just not going to find intelligent life elsewhere, and you probably won’t find it here for very long either because it’s just a lethal mutation. He also added, a little bit ominously, that the average life span of a species, of the billions that have existed, is about 100,000 years, which is roughly the length of time that modern humans have existed.""

These places are home to some of the largest trees in the world – baobabs, known to live for thousands of years. These amazing trees have trunks that can reach 30m in circumference or more. In Togo, there is a proverb: “Wisdom is like a baobab tree: no one individual can embrace it.” In many African cultures, the tree is sacred.
There are nine species of baobab in the world, and Madagascar, one of the world’s biodiversity hotspots, is home to six. The African mainland and the Arabian peninsula have two, and Australia has one. Africa’s most notable species is the Adansonia digitata, named after the French botanist Michel Adanson, who undertook an 18th-century exploration of Senegal. He stayed there for five years and contributed to the publication of 1757’s Natural History of Senegal.
Some of the most impressive trees from back then are still around, those from Madagascar especially: for example, the Adansonia grandidieri, or giant baobab, which can reach a height of 30m. It remains the most famous species of baobab in Madagascar. The rarest baobab species in Madagascar are the Adansonia perrieri and A. suarezensis.
All three of these species are threatened and are on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, and recent assessments have suggested that the latter two species be reclassified as critically endangered. A. perrieri’s habitat is being lost to agriculture and development, whereas A. suarezensis’s biggest threats to survival are lightning, water logging, black fungus and drought. To make matters worse, the large animal species responsible for carrying seeds may have become extinct and hence reduced the wider distribution of the plant species.
Africa’s “tree of life” may not have much longer left. It forms an integral part in people’s livelihoods. In west Africa, it is also called the “palaver tree” because of its social functions: when there is a problem in the community, meeting under the baobab tree with the chief or the tribesmen would be synonymous with trying to find a solution to that problem; it reinforces trust and respect among members of the community. Its extinction would not simply be an environmental tragedy.
The tree grows in very harsh conditions but is completely adapted to its environment: it sheds its leaves during the dry seasons to reduce water loss; it has a tap root system long enough to reach moisture or even water; and the thick bark protects it from bush fires. From a scientific point of view, the baobab tree is truly a complete plant. The leaves are used in traditional medicine to cure infectious diseases, while the fruit is high in nutrients and is used to make health foods. The seeds yield oil that is prized by the cosmetic industry. The trunk stores water and can be harvested by thirsty travellers.
Yet these highly important species are threatened with extinction, due to climate change and human development. Some species may not survive the next century. While plants have generally adapted to extended droughts, climate change is different, and with the Anthropocene we are already witnessing the loss of these impressive trees.
The greatest irony is that the African continent has hardly produced any greenhouse gases and yet is already bearing the brunt of the vagaries of climate change. Africa’s largest, oldest inhabitants, that have played silent witness to numerous generations, are already paying a heavy price for the environmental crimes of foreign lands.

… we can’t turn away from climate change. For The Guardian, reporting on the environment is a  priority.  We give climate, nature and pollution stories the prominence they deserve, stories which often go unreported by others in the mainstream media. At this critical time for our species and our planet, we are determined to inform readers about threats, consequences and solutions based on scientific facts, not political prejudice or business interests. But we need your support to grow our coverage, to travel to the remote frontlines of change and to cover vital conferences that affect us all.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute.

BQENDIndeed, such is the argument of lukewarmists and alarmists both of whom insist they accept AGW.
I agree with you.

you are calling mainstream science alarmist or extremist.
BQENDNo, that's a huge leap - you're claiming that according to know science the chances are equal which given your understanding of the pdf of ECS you know to be untrue.
The difference between 1.5℃ with a p=5 (5% probability) and 3℃ (68% probability) are huge because you're right at the edge of the limit of statistical probability.
Given the weight of research indicating ECS=circa 3℃ there is no way you can ascribe the whole range of bell curve with identical likelihood.
My point remains unaddressed; that if the lukewarmist 'view' is 4σ and the alarmist view at the far end of the range is 4σ (bracketing 3℃ @ 1σ) then whilst they all accept AGW, those extremities are both extreme and very unlikely scenarios.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1529585726000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u""you 're right at the edge of the limit of statistical probability"", u'effect': u'the difference between 1.5 \u2103 with a p=5 \u2103 probability are huge'}], u'author_id': u'14842422', u'in_reply_to': u'117269357', u'id': u'117270382', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Walsunda', u'text': u'""One last thing - it's interesting given your stated position, in every way aligned with my own, that you take issue with my position and not that of your Dennis Horne...""

If you honestly misunderstood ""We should stick to calling both groups on either side of the accepted science ""extremists"" because that us what they literally are"" to mean that 'one side' was the consensus then I could see your point of view if that was all that I had written.It wasn't though, was it.
I made it perfectly clear.
With context being the range of ECS probability then clearly I'm referring to both sides as in either side, bracketing if you will, of the upper/vs/lower extent (range) accepted level of ECS.
What was interesting is that you carried on ignoring my words and repeatedly insisting that I was denigrating the consensus as ""alarmist"" even when made doubly clear to you that I was not - yet you were perfectly happy with DennisHorne's absurdly alarmist claim that ECS starting at 3℃ as the lowest ECS could possibly be and he expects current accepted levels of ECS to be overturned and be massively higher - which of course is every bit as contrary to accepted climate science as AGW contrarianism.Alermism and warmism nothing more than extremes - a scientist shouldn't regard alarmism (exceeding the accepted science) as 'valid' or any more acceptable than its opposite.

The Earth will be, it's been through pretty bad times. But us? 
A population of a few million human hunter-gatherers was apparently beyond the carrying capacity of the planet as everywhere we showed up the megafauna disappeared.
Around 10-12,000 years ago, when large climate oscillations settled down, we developed agriculture which allowed us to double our population many times into the billions.
But agriculture faces big challenges if we don’t change our ways soon (1), as do our fisheries, and if they both decline significantly, forcing us back to being largely hunter-gatherers, history tells us that out of every 1000 people you see maybe one survives.

Apart from the paragraphs directly above and in this post, where have I spoken recently to you or anyone else about ECS, its central estimate and range of probabilities? Note my comments in the post above about my biologically determined seniority and lack of distinction.
BQENDWe were talking about the extremities of the ECS range and how Warmists believed the actual value was at the lower extremity and alarmists believed it was higher extremity and thus were both extremist (high sigma) positions - I went to some detail explain this to you and your responses read as if you had no idea what I was talking about.
It's a simple concept and one you must understand - it certainly didn't require explaining the number of times you asked for explanation.
By that stage I wasn't even asking you to agree with me - I was asking you to understand a simple concept and instead you decided to insult me with strawmen and accusing me of calling mainstream climate science 'alarmist'
So from my perspective you either had no idea or were ankle biting.

By analyzing the fish fossils inside, researchers determined that global temperatures were stable for a long time before the asteroid impact, but then, afterwards, temperatures quickly rose and stayed about 5 degrees Celsius warmer for about 100,000 years. 
MacLeod says it's notable that the impact pumped up carbon dioxide over a short time span that, geologically speaking, is comparable to what humans have been doing in burning fossil fuels since the start of the Industrial Revolution.
""The atmosphere was loaded for a very brief interval of time, and the consequences of that change in atmospheric composition lasted for 100,000 years,"" MacLeod says. ""So it illustrates, I think, really strongly, even if we went back to 1850 levels of carbon dioxide emission, it's going to take a 100,000 years for the carbon dioxide that we've already put in the atmosphere to cycle through the Earth's systems.”

Note the ""it"" you appear to talking about is equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS). Cox, Huntingford and Williamson (2018) in ""Emergent constraint on equilibrium climate sensitivity for global temperature variability"" Nature 553, 319-322 Januaryhttps://www.nature.com/articles/nature25450 discuss ECS as follows.
""However, the 'likely' range for ECS stated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has remained at 1.5 - 4.5 degrees Celsius for 25 years. The possibility of a value toward the upper end of this range reduces the feasibility of avoiding 2 degrees Celsius of global warming as required by the Paris Agreement. Here we present a new emergent constraint on ECS that yields a central estimate of 2.8 degrees Celsius with 66 per cent confidence limits of (equivalent to IPCC 'likely') of 2.2 to 3.4 degrees Celsius.""
Above you say as follows ""Furthermore, we have your bizarre claim that IPCC AR 5 is contradicted / superceded by 2017 Royal Society report and that 'new' science will overturn the science of the last 40 years that says ECS is very likely 3 degrees C-""
As Cox et al explain the IPCC summary of the established science of the last 25 years is of an ECS range of 1.5 - 4.5 degrees C whereas their empirically based modelling tightens this range to 2.2 - 3.4 degrees C. Their central estimate is close to the ballpark figure of 3 degrees C mentioned by other climate modellers in reviews of ECS estimates.
As the range of values around the central estimate contracts scientists who may have earlier published wider estimates based on the empirical data of the time, will in their earlier papers come to lie outside the new consensus.
""Incidentally, Walsunda is a distinguished senior scientist.""
""Who doesn't understand that ECS is in a range of probability from low to high.""
Apart from the paragraphs directly above and in this post, where have I spoken recently to you or anyone else about ECS, its central estimate and range of probabilities? Note my comments in the post above about my biologically determined seniority and lack of distinction.

I am satisfied that I'm not an ""alarmist"". I don't claim to know what is going to happen. This is not only because I'm a non-expert, it's because we don't know what future CO2 levels will be (that depends on us) and there is also uncertainty as to what all the climatic consequences will be.

Unfortunately we've ignored what the science has been telling us for decades. Consider that the first report from the IPCC was in 1990. Nearly 30 years in which we could not plead ignorance, yet our emissions have increased by 60 percent since then.
So now, instead of a gradual transition of our energy sector, we are faced with needing a rapid transition.
Why? Because the planet isn't waiting for us as these two independent teams of scientists reported in 2014 regarding the irreversible retreat of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.

These are low-quality heavy tar-like oils that are mined from sand or rock. Much of the mining occurs in Alberta Canada, but it is also mined elsewhere, in lesser quantities.
Tar sands are the worst. Not only are they really hard to get out of the ground, requiring enormous amounts of energy; not only are they difficult to transport and to refine; not only are they more polluting than regular oils; they even have a by-product called “petcoke” that’s used in power plants, but is dirtier than regular coal.
This stuff is worse than regular oil, worse than coal, worse than anything. Anyone who is serious about climate change cannot agree to mine and burn tar sands. To maintain climate change below critical thresholds, tar sands need to be left in the ground.
This fact is what motivated me to testify to the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission last November, to inform my state’s ruling commission about the impact of tar sands on the climate. Canadian energy company Enbridge has petitioned to put a pipeline through my state to carry this dirty tar to refining sites on the coast. 
The proposed pipeline is called “Line 3.” The pipeline would carry approximately 760,000 barrels per day – the new pipeline would make it easier and cheaper for the oil companies to transport tar sands and consequently, would boost their bottom line. We already move over two million barrels per day through Minnesota in Enbridge pipelines. This new pipeline would encourage them to extract and sell more tar sands.
So, how much pollution would this pipeline carry? 170bn kilograms of carbon dioxide each year. The emissions are equal to approximately 50 coal power plants. These are huge numbers, but more importantly, approval of pipelines like this make it more likely that all of the tar sands in Alberta will be extracted. If that happens, global temperatures will increase by approximately 0.65°F (0.36°C). An astonishing number – approximately three decades worth of global warming.
If you care about climate change, then it is not logically possible to approve any pipeline or other infrastructure that may further worsen our climate. We are already screwing up the climate enough as it is. 
The decision-making body in my state has heard climate arguments before. In fact, in 2016, the same body ruled against the coal giant Peabody. That ruling decided that fossil fuel companies low-balled the social cost of carbon. Back then, Peabody brought in a group of climate contrarians to argue their nonsense. My colleagues and I were able to convince the Commission that the facts were clear – we are causing climate change, and our decisions today can make tomorrow’s climate worse. This ruling was used when evaluating the social cost of carbon pollution for a new Line 3 pipeline. A judge found that emissions from this project would impose $287bn in social costs over 30 years.
In this case, the oil company Enbridge did not invite any contrarian climate scientists. They simply focused on arguments that a new pipeline will be safer to operate (fewer spills) and lessen other issues like rail traffic. They effectively conceded the climate arguments.
The decision will be revealed later this month. But already, an Administrative Law Judge has given a recommendation that the new pipeline be built, but in the exact same location as the current pipe. While this recommendation presents large costs to Enbridge, it completely misses the science. The judge’s opinion made no mention of climate change. How can a decision on extracting tar sands be made without considering climate effects?
Just last week, the staff of the commission also recommended construction of the new pipeline. They too omitted climate change from their decision.
I was proud to be able to stand alongside tomorrow’s leaders. Courageous youth became parties to the litigation and helped arrange the testimony of various climate experts like myself. One of the youth involved in the litigation, Frances Wetherall, summarized her view and told me why she was involved in the case.
With every barrel of oil burned, my future children and grandchildren’s chances of a long and happy life diminish. I can’t stand by while Big Oil profits off the destruction of future generations.
Whether or not these youth prevail in this case, their courage, intelligence, and drive give me hope for a better future.
I am hopeful that the commission dismisses these opinions. It is clear to me that not only must tar sands be kept in the ground, but actions to assist in their extraction make one complicit. I believe that decisions have consequences and we must take responsibility for our decisions. We cannot say “climate matters” and then facilitate tar sands extractions. We also cannot say “we didn’t know” when our children ask us why we made poor decisions. 
I would hate to be a fossil fuel lawyer, or executive, or lawmaker who fights for climate destruction today and has to justify his actions to his kids tomorrow. History will be a very harsh judge to them; but of course it will be too late for the rest of us.
I’ve said this before and I will say it again, if we cannot say no to tar sands, what can we say no to?
Disclosure: I testified as an unpaid expert witness on behalf of Youth Climate Intervenors.
… we can’t turn away from climate change. The Guardian’s environmental coverage reports the scientific facts, social consequences and political choices that are shaping the fate of our planet. As the world's leaders turn their backs on the environment, we are at a crisis point. Individual consumer choices are important, but we need collective action to achieve the systemic change that will really make a difference. Our pioneering and our fearless reporting on the environment can play a vital role in that. But we need our readers’ support.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute.

Admittedly the character is a meteorologist but he has a point: other countries have a climate whereas we in Britain have weather. But finally catching up with Haig’s much-travelled play, first seen in Edinburgh in 2014, I was struck by how it expands to acquire meanings beyond its immediate subject.
Haig has seized on the historical fact that there was much tension surrounding the timing of the D-day landings in Normandy in June 1944. General Eisenhower, in charge of European operations, had set a precise date of 5 June. However, James Stagg, chief meteorological adviser to the allies, arrives at the HQ at Southwick, Hampshire, and warns of severe weather conditions on the appointed day. If he is right, the invasion will be a disaster leading to massive loss of life. But he is vehemently opposed by his American counterpart, Colonel Krick, and Eisenhower is left to make the crucial decision as to whether to delay the operation.
I was even reminded of the debate about climate change where wilful denial is confronted by inescapable fact
 Since we know the outcome, you might say there is little tension. Haig, however, gets round that in several ways. One is by giving us detailed information about the shifting weather patterns in the Atlantic so we begin to grasp the dilemma faced by Eisenhower.
 Haig also sets up a contrast in character and method between the rival meteorologists. Krick relies on analogue charts recalling weather patterns in previous years; Stagg, a tenacious, hard-headed Scot, bases his forecasts on hourly scientific readings and precise knowledge of the complexity of British weather.
 Haig constantly reminds us what is at stake but his play transcends its context. Given that the story involves Britain and the European mainland – though, in this case invasion rather than withdrawal – the conflict between a self-deluding optimism and a pragmatic realism takes on an unexpected resonance. I was even reminded of the debate about climate change, where wilful denial is confronted by inescapable fact.
 Haig seems reluctant to bring his play to an end and overstresses the coincidental pressure on Stagg, whose wife is due to give birth even as D-day is imminent, but he has found rich drama in the interaction of war and weather.
 As an actor, he is also ideally equipped to play Stagg. Haig’s forte is playing men in the grip of an idee fixe: in farce that can be very funny but here it means he endows Stagg, head always thrust forward in a state of permanent inquiry, with a peculiar brusque intensity. Even if Stagg’s worries about his wife occasionally intrude, Haig also makes something deeply moving out of the moment when the character’s quivering anxiety breaks through his surface stoicism.
 Malcolm Sinclair is exemplary as Eisenhower showing how the poker-backed professional soldier is awed by his sense of responsibility. Laura Rogers also tactfully suggests the thwarted adoration of Ike’s driver, Kay Summersby, for her boss and John Dove’s finely calibrated production boasts good support from Philip Cairns as the Pollyanna-like Krick and David Killick as a garrulous electrician. It may be a traditional play but it is one where, as so often, history acquires the power of metaphor.

I do fully understand the importance of these pristine habitats & I as much as the next person I care deeply about ensuring they are preserved. Which was on my part the reason for my concerns posted on this forum.
I do fear the direction wildlife conservation is taking as a whole & some times the arrogant righteous attitude occasionally displayed by science professionals. I do sometimes struggle to understand the relevance of cataloguing organisms as a means to conserve them over simply respecting those ecosystems right to exist. I feel perhaps that some times it is the wrong approach to attempt to provide a ""value"" in terms how will it benefit Humans rather than encouraging a respect for nature as a life support system. 
Evidently if those ancient pristine habitats/ecosystems have been lost, then we are unable to learn anything about how the natural world works or how to help reestablish them. Perhaps had the article offered greater insight into the actual discoveries & not come across as a ego-trip for a privileged few it may have been received better. 
I would still highlight my concerns regards exactly how science intends to preserve this wonderful gem without commodifying it & therefore damaging the very thing you seek to protect. I personally feel the past models of monetizing nature hasn't helped to preserve them. Of course with modern technology the wall of stone isnt a barrier to those that may wish to exploit it for profit. As you point out perhaps its the duty of journalists like yourself to highlight the dangers of logging to dwindling pristine natural places like Lico. We require a cultural change in our attitudes to the natural world so we ""value"" it as whole not its select parts, I feel that's where conservationists & journalists can help most.

Its encouraging and exciting to have so many people comment on this story. 
This was a fast, early look at an expedition that took years in the making and was put together to place the most comprehensive set of relevant local and international scientists on top of what is likely one of the most interesting mountains found in Africa in a long time. Shrill calls to the contrary, it is only through understanding these forest systems and treasuring them through science that we will be able to protect them. 
Time is running out. 
It was heartbreaking on this expedition to see the destruction of nearby Mount Socone, a forest every bit as magical as Lico’s but with no protective wall. We spent time in both forests. In only three years at least half the Socone forest has been cleared for short term agriculture and timber. Millions of years of evolution, countless numbers of plants and animals, all lost for just a few years of cultivation that could have been financed by the cost of the laptop you wrote your angry missive on.
The truly sad fact is that the forests of Mozambique are disappearing. They are being wiped out today by slash and burn agriculture as well as the international appetite for rare and beautiful hardwoods. If we are going to save Mozambique’s mountain forests, as so many of you are clearly keen to do, it is going to take a global community to value them. The very people who sound upset here on this forum are the ones who need to write and pressure countries like China, Mozambique and mail-order wood sellers in Europe and the USA to end the legal and illegal trade in tropical hardwoods. Mozambique is losing thousands of trees per day.
On this expedition animals were studied, cliffs were climbed and holes were dug (and carefully filled in) in order to understand how to protect this and many other mountain repositories of diversity and climate resilience, two commodities we will need a lot of in the near future. We came to Lico to help our global community understand how forests store carbon so that nations and their people responsible for climate change can fund poorer countries to keep their forests standing - all in order to deal with the carbon pollution the first world creates every day by living beyond the planet's means. Without understanding how this carbon cycle works, and passing on funding for forest communities to preserve their precious trees, a future without rainforests is probably what awaits us all. 
There are so many important questions here on Lico to grasp but one from this forum really shouts at me: How did the fish get up the cliff? Well possibly they were marooned there so long ago that the ground was as high as the top, which is a very long time ago indeed. Only through scientific understanding can we know how to protect these places. Furthermore, every confirmed new species, like a fish or a mouse, or even a new beautiful butterfly, gives these forests a better chance of gaining some sort of critical official protection. 
They have none at all today.
Countless species are being wiped out in this region without anyone recording them. What we are losing we do not know, but because of this and other expeditions there is hope that some sort of protective status can be conferred before it is too late. 
There are many more unanswered questions about Lico which will be uncovered as more science is done. From the pots found on top, to the forest’s age, to how it might act as a baseline for other rainforest carbon traps and in-turn be valued so communities in Mozambique see these trees as something other than board-feet of timber or in the way of a new maize field. It is a race against time. The two fish in the gauze of Vanessa’s collection could save their entire species. 
It is this journalist's belief that we are not protecting forests by turning a blind eye to them and leaving them alone in these times of climate change and global environmental upheaval. Not only are people felling trees daily, but we need to study and listen to these incredibly ancient and resilient systems that have survived so much. Our own very survival may well depend on the lessons we learn from their longevity.
It’s true that this story leaves many more questions than answers, but that is usually the nature of science. As more information comes to light we will be updating you all, possibly here at the Guardian but definitely through our not-for-profit environmental and scientific reporting initiative: www.allianceearth.org. Feel free to find out more there, or just write us a very mean letter or a nice one. We like them too. 
One last thing. In the 1000 words I was granted to explain this rather immense undertaking I didn’t even get a chance to mention the rodents of unusual size. 
But thats a story for another time.

Like a villain’s fortress in an old James Bond movie, Mount Lico rises vertically from the land around it, the ancient centre of a volcano with the forest nestled in its crater. It was discovered by Dr Julian Bayliss, who examined satellite imagery looking for an undisturbed tropical rainforest. When he spotted Lico on Google Earth, he said, the forest on top “was isolated and appeared totally undisturbed”. With a smile, he added: “That makes it very exciting.”
Bayliss, from Oxford Brookes University, had form:  he is known for having found Mount Mabu, the largest rainforest in southern Africa, as well as a number of new species of butterflies and other creatures in the area since then.
Rainforests are the oldest living biomes on Earth and contain roughly half the known species of life. They also store more carbon for longer than any other living system. Some tropical rainforests date back to the dinosaur age, but virtually all show signs of past human activity. Bayliss wondered if there were mountaintop forests that might be untouched. He remembers thinking: “What would a forest like that look like?”
The answer was Lico. But the mountain’s formidable geography – its circling rock wall rises 700 metres above the plain – raised a whole new series of questions in terms of accessibility. Bayliss decided to focus on a “shorter” cliff of about 125 metres on one side, and to put together an expedition that would place scientists on the top of Lico via that vertical rock. But how would they be able to get up there?
It took two years to assemble the 28-person dream team of biologists, logistical crew, plant experts, and researchers for the first expedition that took place last month, led by Bayliss. Funded in part by Ranulph Fiennes’s Transglobe Expedition Trust, UK-based Biocensus, as well as the African Butterfly Research Institute, the project was an academic partnership between 13 universities, museums and research institutions on three continents.
From his home office in a converted chapel in the Welsh mountains, Bayliss contacted Jules Lines and Mike Robertson, professional climbers widely regarded as two of the best in the UK. Robertson famously ascended the Eiffel tower solo in protest against French oil company Total (and was subsequently arrested by the French police). Lines is known in climbing circles as The Dark Horse for his solo climbing without a rope.
The climbers scaled the rock face above the scientists’ basecamp and secured two ropes from the top all the way down to the bottom. Patiently they taught the scientists how to get up and down safely. “Learning to ascend a 125-metre cliff in the jungle is a lot to ask of people,” said Robertson, with a certain understatement, holding the safety line for 29-year-old Ana Gledis da Conceição Miranda, a Mozambican biologist working at the Pringle and EO Wilson laboratory.
Like most of the researchers, she struggled with the rope ascenders but didn’t give up. “These scientists are bloody gritty and determined; it’s impressive,” Roberston said.
Ferrying gear and supplies, the two climbers went up the ropes more than 40 times. Despite a medical emergency as a result of an extreme infection, everyone was able to get up and down the ropes safely. But the risk remained. “There is no rescue here,” said Lines, taking a break at the top. “We are it.”
Bayliss believes Lico could be one of the most pristine forests on Earth. Willcock and his colleague, Dr Phil Platts from the University of York, dug for two days to get to the forest bedrock to read the soil layers like a history book of Lico’s past. Every fire that ever burned here, many of the plants that grew, even millions of caterpillar droppings are all recorded in the soil. (Caterpillars are everywhere on Lico, so numerous in the trees above that their droppings fall like a dry, soft rain.)
“This forest provides a unique insight into the effects of climate change on forests over time,” said Platts, shovelling from the pit.
After 10 days of discovery, the team was back at base camp in Lico’s shadow. The hole in the forest had been refilled, the topsoil replaced, and Colin Congdon, a veteran lepidopterist, was comparing finds with Bayliss. Among their small translucent papers was Lico’s first confirmed new species: a butterfly. The scientists expect it will be far from the only one. There is a line-up of potential new species to be confirmed in the months to come, from snakes to frogs, toads, a snake-like amphibian called a caecilian, a shrew, a snub-nosed rodent, more butterflies, crabs and even a flowering plant. Cataloguing potential new fish species, Vanessa Muranga, a 27-year-old marine biologist from Mozambique’s Natural History Museum, had two wrapped in gauze in front of her. “It’s so exciting when you find something that might be new,” she said.
Lico contains other mysteries, too, including partly buried ancient pots that the team discovered near the source of the main stream. According to the local community, no one in memory or legend has ever been on top of the mountain. How did the pot-makers get up the sheer cliff? Was the land around Lico higher then? Could the soil analysis help date them? Anthropologists from Mozambique’s Natural History Museum are investigating.
From a South African herpetologist to a Brazilian biogeographer, a botanist with the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, to a mammal expert from Swaziland, the expedition to Lico represented a successful collaboration between local and international research institutions. This, according to Hermenegildo Matimele, curator of the National Herbarium of Mozambique in Maputo and Bayliss’s Mozambican counterpart on the expedition, was the greatest thing about it.
On the last night of the expedition, the scientists gathered around the base camp’s fire to share a celebratory drink. Perched on a packing crate with a big smile, Bayliss expressed satisfaction that everyone had made it off the mountain with their precious samples. And, he added with characteristic understatement, “it’s great, too, that nobody died”.

The inquiry, launched on Friday by the House of Commons environmental audit committee, will explore the carbon impact, resource use and water footprint of clothing throughout its lifecycle and supply chain. 
Inviting evidence on how the influential sector should remodel itself to be both “thriving and sustainable”, it will look at how improved recycling rates of clothing could slash waste and pollution. 
“Fashion shouldn’t cost the Earth” said Mary Creagh MP, chair of the committee. “But the way we design, make and discard clothes has a huge environmental impact. Producing clothes requires climate-changing emissions. Every time we put on a wash, thousands of plastic fibres wash down the drain into the oceans. We don’t know where or how to recycle end-of-life clothing.” 
Despite recent troubles on the UK high street, the fashion sector has continued to grow. According to the British Fashion Council, the UK fashion industry contributed £28.1bn to national GDP in 2015, up from £21bn in 2009. But the globalised market for fashion manufacturing has facilitated a “fast fashion” phenomenon; a proliferation of cheap and cheerful clothing, with quick turnover that encourages consumers to keep buying, the committee warns. 
The raw materials used to manufacture clothes require land and water, or extraction of fossil fuels, while carbon dioxide is emitted throughout the clothing supply chain and some chemical dyes, finishes and coatings may be toxic. Research has found that plastic microfibres in clothing are released when they are washed, and enter rivers, the ocean and even the food chain.
Last year the fashion designer Stella McCartney condemned her own industry as “incredibly wasteful and harmful to the environment.”
A report from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation put the annual cost to the UK economy of landfilling clothing and household textiles at about £82m. It warned that if the global fashion industry continues on its current growth path, it could use more than a quarter of the world’s annual carbon budget by 2050.
Key to the inquiry is how consumers could be encouraged to buy fewer clothes, reuse clothes and think about how best to dispose of clothes when they are no longer wanted. An estimated 300,000 tonnes of fashion waste goes straight into landfill each year, despite growing efforts to encourage consumers to recycle their worn and unwanted clothing.

If the country’s greenhouse gas emissions continue on their current trajectory, Australia will miss its Paris target by a billion tonnes of CO2, which is equal to about two years of Australia’s entire national emissions.
NDEVR replicates the federal government’s National Greenhouse Gas Inventory (NGGI) quarterly reports, but releases them months ahead of the official data. Previous NDEVR reports’ figures have been within 1% of the official figures when they are eventually released.
The latest figures include the first three months of 2018 and show Australia’s national emissions up to March were the highest since records began in 2002.
It projects that emissions for the year to March, excluding land use emissions, will be 556.9 m tonnes.
Even with land-use data included, it projects emissions would continue their upward trend, taking Australia further away from its Paris commitment of a 26% to 28% reduction in emissions on 2005 levels by 2030. 
Although emissions from the electricity sector had fallen in the previous three quarters, the report identifies a slight increase of 1.7 m tonnes of CO2 in the most recent quarter, due to an increase in fossil-fuel based electricity generation throughout the national electricity market states.
The report also finds that fugitive emissions due to increased gas production and exports are at their highest levels ever.
As debate over the government’s proposed national energy guarantee continues, NDEVR projects that the Australian electricity sector would meet the proposed Neg target of a 26% cut on 2005 levels by 2030, five years ahead of schedule, simply if business as usual continues.
The reason for this is the ongoing investment in renewable energy developments as well as the impending decommissioning of large coal plants.
“Our indicative analysis shows that electricity emissions in a business as usual sense are decreasing faster than what the Neg projects anyway,” the NDEVR environmental managing director, Matt Drum, said.
Drum said while the government’s focus was on the electricity sector, emissions were rising across other areas of the economy in the absence of a working climate policy.
“The numbers speak for themselves. They’re heading in the wrong direction,” he said.
“It’s one thing to focus on the electricity sector – it’s 36% of our emissions. But that leaves 64% of the economy that is essentially untouched by policy or mitigation.”

Since then the wetlands that covered half the state have been largely drained, strip malls have replaced Seminole camps, and the population has increased a thousandfold. Over roughly the same amount of time the number of black college degree holders in the United States also increased a thousandfold, as did the speed at which we fly, the combined carbon emissions of the Middle East, and the entire population of Thailand.
About 60 of the region’s more than 6 million residents have gathered in the Cox Science Building at the University of Miami on a sunny Saturday morning in 2016 to hear Harold Wanless, or Hal, chair of the geology department, speak about sea level rise. “Only 7% of the heat being trapped by greenhouse gases is stored in the atmosphere,” Hal begins. “Do you know where the other 93% lives?”
This is a modal window.
A teenager, wrists lined in aquamarine beaded bracelets, rubs sleep from her eyes. Returns her head to its resting position in her palm. The man seated behind me roots around in his briefcase for a breakfast bar. No one raises a hand.
“In the ocean,” Hal continues. “That heat is expanding the ocean, which is contributing to sea level rise, and it is also, more importantly, creating the setting for something we really don’t want to have happen: rapid melt of ice.”
A woman wearing a sequined teal top opens her Five Star notebook and starts writing things down. The guy behind her shovels spoonfuls of passionfruit–flavored Chobani yogurt into his tiny mouth. Hal’s three sons are perched in the next row back. One has a ponytail, one is in a suit, and the third crosses and uncrosses his gray street sneakers. The one with the ponytail brought a water bottle; the other two sip Starbucks. And behind the rows and rows of sparsely occupied seats, at the very back of the amphitheater, an older woman with a gold brocade bear on her top paces back and forth.
A real estate developer interrupts Hal to ask: “Is someone recording this?”
“Yes.” The cameraman coughs. “Besides,” Hal adds, “I say the same damn thing at least five times a week.” Hal, who is in his early seventies and has been studying sea level rise for over 40 years, pulls at his Burt Reynolds moustache, readjusts his taupe corduroy suit, and continues. On the screen above his head clips from a documentary on climate change show glacial tongues of ice the size of Manhattan tumbling into the sea. “The big story in Greenland and Antarctica is that the warming ocean is working its way in, deep under the ice sheets, causing the ice to collapse faster than anyone predicted, which in turn will cause sea levels to rise faster than anyone predicted.”
According to Marco Rubio, the junior senator from Florida, rising sea levels are uncertain, their connection to human activity tenuous. And yet the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change expects roughly two feet of rise by century’s end. The United Nations predicts three feet. And the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates an upper limit of six and a half feet.
Take the 6 million people who live in south Florida today and divide them into two groups: those who live less than six and a half feet above the current high tide line, and everybody else. The numbers slice nearly evenly. Heads or tails: call it in the air. If you live here, all you can do is hope that when you put down roots your choice was somehow prophetic.
But Hal says it doesn’t matter whether you live six feet above sea level or sixty-five, because he, like James Hansen, believes that all of these predictions are, to put it mildly, very, very low. “The rate of sea level rise is currently doubling every seven years, and if it were to continue in this manner, Ponzi scheme style, we would have 205 feet of sea level rise by 2095,” he says. “And while I don’t think we are going to get that much water by the end of the century, I do think we have to take seriously the possibility that we could have something like 15 feet by then.”
It’s a little after nine o’clock. Hal’s sons stop sipping their lattes and the oceanographic scientist behind me puts down his handful of M&amp;M’s. If Hal Wanless is right, every single object I have seen over the past 72 hours – the periodic table of elements hanging above his left shoulder, the buffet currently loaded with refreshments, the smoothie stand at my seaside hotel, the beach umbrellas and oxygen bars, the Johnny Rockets and seashell shop, the lecture hall with its hundreds of mostly empty teal swivel chairs – will all be underwater in the not-so-distant future.
**** 
One of the few stories I remember from the Bible vividly depicts the natural and social world in crisis. It is the apocalyptic narrative par excellence – Noah’s flood. When I look it up again, however, I am surprised to find that it does not start with a rainstorm or an ark, but earlier, with unprecedented population growth and God’s scorn. It begins: “When human beings began to increase in number on the earth.” I read this line and think about the 6,000 inhabitants of south Florida turning into 6 million in 120 short years. “The LORD saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become.” I think about the exponential increase in M&amp;M’s, Chobani yogurt cups and grande lattes consumed over that same span of time. The dizzying supply chains, cheap labor and indestructible plastic. “So God said to Noah, ‘I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them.’” And then the rain began.
I do not believe in a vengeful God – if God exists at all – so I do not think of the flood as punishment for human sin. What interests me most is what happens to the story when I remove it from its religious framework: Noah’s flood is one of the most fully developed accounts of environmental change in ancient history. It tries to make sense of a cataclysmic earthbound event that happened long ago, before written language, before the domestication of horses, before the first Egyptian mummies and the rise of civilization in Crete. An event for which the teller clearly held humans responsible.
****
Dig into geologic history and you discover this: when sea levels have risen in the past, they have usually not done so gradually, but rather in rapid surges, jumping as much as 50 feet over a short three centuries. Scientists call these events “meltwater pulses” because the near-biblical rise in the height of the ocean is directly correlated to the melting of ice and the process of deglaciation, the very events featured in the documentary footage Hal has got running on a screen above his head.
He shows us a clip of the largest glacial calving event ever recorded. It starts with a chunk of ice the size of Miami’s tallest building tumbling, head over tail, off the tip of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Then the Southeast Financial Center goes, displaying its cool blue underbelly. It is a coltish thing, smooth and oddly muscular. The ground between the two turns to arctic ice dust and the ocean roils up. Next, chunks of ice the size of the Marquis Residences crash away; then the Wells Fargo Center falls, and with it goes 900 Biscayne Bay. Suddenly everything between the Brickell neighborhood and Park West is gone.
The clip begins again and I watch in awe as a section of the Jakobshavn Glacier half the size of all Miami falls into the sea.
“Greenland is currently calving chunks of ice so massive they produce earthquakes up to six and seven on the Richter scale,” Hal says as the city of ice breaks apart. “There was not much noticeable ice melt before the nineties. But now it accelerates every year, exceeding all predictions. It will likely cause a pulse of meltwater into the oceans.”
In medicine, a pulse is something regular – a predictable throb of blood through veins, produced by a beating heart. It is so reliable, so steady, so definite that lack of a pulse is sometimes considered synonymous with death. A healthy adult will have a resting heart rate of 60 to 100 beats per minute, every day, until they don’t. But a meltwater pulse is the opposite. It is an anomaly. The exception to the 15,000-year rule.
From 1900 to 2000 the glacier on the screen retreated inward eight miles. From 2001 to 2010 it pulled back nine more; over a single decade the Jakobshavn glacier lost more ice than it had during the previous century. And then there is this film clip, recorded over 70 minutes, in which the glacier retreats a full mile across a calving face three miles wide. “This is why I believe we are witnessing the beginning of the largest meltwater pulse in modern human history,” Hal says.
As the ice sheets above Hal’s head fall away and the snacks on the buffet disappear, topography is transformed from a backwater physical science into the single most important factor determining the longevity of the Sunshine State. The man seated next to me leans over. “If what he says is even half true,” he whispers, “Florida is about to be wiped off the map.”

A big, big error of judgement for a professional media man, attempting to influence public opinion on climate change, to instance the tragicomic energy trajectory of Germany. 
And such a comment on the day that the singular, one-and-only technology that can 'save' humanity from the worst of climate change is given a long overdue boost. If you want REAL, skilled, well paid, secure jobs, Owen, look to the 100 GW of new nuclear we'll be getting to decarbonise our electricity generation/heating, industrial process heat and transport fuel sectors: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-deal-with-industry-to-secure-uk-civil-nuclear-future-and-drive-down-cost-of-energy-for-customers
Yes indeed, abundant electricity and process heat from nuclear power plants can deliver carbon-neutral, liquid fuels for all our transport needs, including aviation and shipping.
We're 8 years away from the game-changer: the breakers being thrown on the first NuScale 720 MW nuclear power plant, comprising of 12 x 60 MW Small Modular Reactors. The contracts are signed, the customer is in place - it will happen and in 8 years, all this 'green-crap' will start to wither on the vine.
It takes 22,116 MW of the very latest 9.5 MW offshore wind turbines, at a capital cost of £41.9 billion, to deliver the same amount of intermittent electricity as the 24/7 electricity the 3,200 MW Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant will deliver at a [contracted] capital cost of £18 billion.
But 3,200 MW of NuScale SMRs will only cost £10.2 billion, so - why pay over 4X more for technologies that deliver a truly pathetic, grid-degrading, intermittent product that will forever require fossil-fuelled back up?

The 3rd runway has been planned for over 30 years, and 99% of all the work was done before the word brexit was invented. 
Secondly, most those objecting to the Heathrow expansion come from places nowhere near the place, with an overnight interest in environmental concerns, with arguments developed by preconceptions boosted by reading an article over breakfast in this mornings paper.
If anyone is going to argue with any credibility about pollution, they better include in the conversation closing down our car plants, our steelworks, and all other industrial activity. 
To pick on one thing, which for most arguing against it is probably 200 miles away, is parochial. Despite our decline, we still have loads of polluting factories and polluting commercial activity, where concrete was poured over green fields over 100 years ago. 
Heathrow is a huge employer in the South East. The fact is, it is the 6th biggest airport hub in the whole world. It started operations over 70 years ago. This seems to be resented by others not because of the environment, but because of sour grapes?
Heathrow is a British success story , which creates 70,000 jobs directly and probably 2 or 3 times that indirectly. All this generates a tax take which is shared by all. In fact, more of it probably goes north of Watford than stays in the area.
So if you are going to have an environmental argument, get it in context of all the polluting industries we still have. Also get it in context that whatever the objection is, air traffic will increase. Where it takes off and lands is the only question, and stopping Heathrow will either push it to Gatwick or Luton or quite possibly Paris, Amsterdam or Frankfurt which are the only other European airport hubs vaguely in the same league. 
This 3rd runway has been on the table for over 30 years, and all of the homes directly affected have already received huge payouts many years ago, which were taken and banked. 
Where I sit now, 17 miles from Heathrow, within 50 meters of this laptop there are 5 people employed by the airport.
It may be an abstract conversation for 24 hours for some, but for others it means the same as the Cowley car plant, or Port Talbot, or the Nissan factory in Sunderland etc. 
My grandma used to tell me 'Where there is muck there is brass' and of course this also means employment. This maxim has not changed.

Unfortunately their words have been rendered meaningless by their vote. You cannot truly fear the impact of climate change and then opt to raise Heathrow’s emissions by 7.3m tonnes of carbon dioxide – a figure that, as Greenpeace notes, is equivalent to the annual total output of Cyprus.
The talk of promoting jobs and economic growth that swirled around the vote is self-destructive short-termism. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature, the floods, droughts and heatwaves that climate change will bring will cost the economy tens of billions of pounds, as well as hundreds of thousands of jobs, by 2050. By focusing on high-carbon infrastructure as a means to create jobs, we distract ourselves from exploring how we can create hundreds of thousands of skilled, well-paid, secure jobs in the renewable energy sector, as Germany has done.
A disastrous vote then, but also one that offers a revealing insight into what the Tory approach to Brexit means. According to her spokesman, Theresa May believes that expanding Heathrow “sends out an important message about global Britain and making the most of the opportunities which lie ahead of us”.
The airport’s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, echoed the government rhetoric, lauding a “real Brexit bonus”. Clearly a hard Tory Brexit – grievously damaging economic relations with our nearest trading bloc – means a Trumpian hell-for-leather dash for growth at any cost. Who benefits from that growth, or what it means for the environment, are not high-priority questions. Indeed, on the same day as the Heathrow vote, the government rejected plans for a £1.3bn tidal lagoon in Swansea Bay, another potential source of jobs and growth that would help to counter global warming.
As the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) warns today, the Tory obsession with scrapping what David Cameron infamously called “green crap” will saddle us all with higher costs in the future. As for the “green Brexit” cynically trumpeted by Tory leadership wannabe Michael Gove, that was clearly yesterday’s soundbite.
Yes, climate change can seem like an abstraction – too technical, too distant. I admit my own brain tends to fade out when I hear about it. History may judge that one of the most disastrous consequences of the financial crash was that it distracted from the imperative of dealing with climate change: here-and-now crises of falling living standards, a lack of secure jobs and public sector cuts suddenly became more pressing and urgent.
Brexit, too, sucks in all the political oxygen, starving other crises of attention and giving the Tories a pretext to bet the farm on making departure from the EU look like it can work. But our government is legally bound to cut emissions by 80% by 2050, meaning our aviation emissions must be at the levels they were in 2005 – 37.5m tonnes – by mid-century. A Department for Transport report reveals we will already have hit 43m tonnes by 2030 after Heathrow expansion. Because we are signatories to the Paris agreement, we are obliged to limit a rise in global temperatures to well below 2C. But as Lord Deben – a former Tory minister and chair of the CCC – put it to the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, regarding Heathrow expansion: “We were surprised that your statement to the House of Commons … on 5 January 2018 made no mention of either of these commitments.”
If we’re going to abide by our targets, as well as expand Heathrow, that means deeper cuts in emissions in other parts of the economy. Where? As Deben has wryly noted, the CCC “has limited confidence about the options [for achieving the compensatory cuts needed]”.
Who will benefit most from this expansion? More than half of Britons don’t fly at all in any given year. Just 15% of Britons – disproportionately the most affluent – take more than 70% of all flights. House of Commons research suggests that having a second home and a household income of more than £115,000 are the best indicators of whether or not you are a frequent flyer. And as Labour’s Clive Lewis points out, many of the beneficiaries of a bigger Heathrow will be international transfer passengers whose money will never even make it into the UK economy (except maybe by buying the odd bottle of whisky in duty free). Is bulldozing communities, increasing noise pollution and noxious fumes, and above all accelerating climate change, a price worth paying for that?
Consider the challenges we must confront. Greenpeace’s chief scientist, Doug Parr, tells me: “We’re looking at scale-ups of water shortages, heatwaves and extreme weather across the world.” The Tories might laud their approach to Brexit as paving the way for Britain’s resurrection as a global trading nation. But the damage inflicted by climate change on our trading partners means we will suffer too. The impacts in Britain will be felt on agriculture, road and rail, electricity, water and sewage systems – all hit by rising temperatures. Look at the fire on Saddleworth Moor: other factors are at play, such as how the land is managed. But we can be sure that climate change will increase the likelihood of such disasters.
This week, our political elite sent a message to the future that will not be forgotten. They could have championed an ambitious route: one that invests in skilled green jobs as part of a new just and sustainable order. Instead a decision was taken to play Russian roulette with our planet for short-term, limited gain. In two generations’ time, what will those yet to be born make of a reckless decision taken when there was still time to act in the face of coming catastrophe? The Heathrow vote was a wanton act of vandalism and we will all suffer from this particular “Brexit dividend”.
• Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist
… we can’t turn away from climate change. For The Guardian, reporting on the environment is a  priority.  We give climate, nature and pollution stories the prominence they deserve, stories which often go unreported by others in the mainstream media. At this critical time for our species and our planet, we are determined to inform readers about threats, consequences and solutions based on scientific facts, not political prejudice or business interests. But we need your support to grow our coverage, to travel to the remote frontlines of change and to cover vital conferences that affect us all.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute.

If we destroyed two thirds of what we have now then eventually (as in literally tens of millions of years) you would probably see diversity restored to the sort of level we have now (dependent on other factors). It isn't really about managing with a third because a) ecosystems and species have value independent of their value to humanity in the view of many of us, b) ecosystems can collapse if species are removed (a good example is what would eventually happen to the Mauritian rainforest if the flying fox is driven to extinction - the rainforest would eventually shrink/ or collapse)
You have no way of knowing what species are 'important' - that isn't how ecology works, you might think that the Mauritian flying fox is unimportant but it turns out (As an example) that it is needed to spread seeds of forest plants (say a particular fruit tree) - so which is important - the tree or the bat or both. But then the bat is dependent on other plants and also on it's predators (as these prevent over dominance of certain species). And those species are dependent on others who are, in turn dependent on others and so on. And it's basically impossible to fully understand the dynamics of these ecosystems - you don't know what puling out each individual brick will do to the wall

Nobody predicts individual years or even groups of years because it is a) impossible and b) irrelevant. The important thing is the long term trend - look what that shows - it's up. Fluctuations within that do not matter. which is one of the reasons why no one predicted it - it's not important, it's the trend. It;'s why predictions say things like 'by XXXX' rather than in year XXXX' because any individual year or group of years can be up or down.

BQEND
Wrong. Every surface temperature dataset shows statistically significant warming speed up (0.24 to 0.3 C per decade) from 2006 to now.
That the slowdown and the speed up overlap merely highlights how sensitive short term trends are to specific dates. This is what enabled confusionists to cherry pick and make the slowdown appear much longer and greater than it really was.
Furthermore, your claim that recent warming is entirely attributable to the El Niño is also wrong.
2013, 2017 and 2018 to date had no El Niño (this year even started with a weak La Niña), and yet all are among the very warmest years in the instrumental record:

The answers to the survey showed a wide variety of opinions, but it was clear that a large majority of climate scientists agree that anthropogenic greenhouse gases are the dominant cause of global warming. Consistent with other research, we found that the consensus is strongest for scientists with more relevant expertise and for scientists with more peer-reviewed publications. 90% of respondents with more than 10 climate-related peer-reviewed publications (about half of all respondents), agreed that anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHG) are the dominant driver of recent global warming... 
Literature analyses (e.g. Cook et al., 2013; Oreskes et al., 2004) generally find a stronger consensus than opinion surveys such as ours. This is related to the stronger consensus among highly published – and arguably the most expert – climate scientists...
Furthermore, contrarian viewpoints were likely overrepresented in our study compared with others.

They ridiculous Cook study doesn't say 97% of climatologists agree Man is mainly responsible for warming
BQEND
Once again: if you'd prefer to say that 3% of peer-reviewed climate change papers dispute that humans are the main cause of warming, that's fine with me. We can both agree that Cook et al showed that.
BQSTART
And as I have linked to previously, an actual survey from the Netherlands revealed 65% of climatologists believe people are mostly (greater than 51%) responsible for the Earth's recent warming
BQEND
This is how the lead author of your linked study puts it:
BQSTART
The answers to the survey showed a wide variety of opinions, but it was clear that a large majority of climate scientists agree that anthropogenic greenhouse gases are the dominant cause of global warming. Consistent with other research, we found that the consensus is strongest for scientists with more relevant expertise and for scientists with more peer-reviewed publications. 90% of respondents with more than 10 climate-related peer-reviewed publications (about half of all respondents), agreed that anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHG) are the dominant driver of recent global warming... 
Literature analyses (e.g. Cook et al., 2013; Oreskes et al., 2004) generally find a stronger consensus than opinion surveys such as ours. This is related to the stronger consensus among highly published – and arguably the most expert – climate scientists...
Furthermore, contrarian viewpoints were likely overrepresented in our study compared with others. 
No matter how you slice it, scientists overwhelmingly agree that recent global warming is to a great extent human caused.

No, the reason they didn't predict the slowdown is because they are not designed to predict short term deviations caused by temporary factors (which, remember, occur in both directions).

Where we have acted it’s been in a mostly haphazard and modest way — a protected area here, a conservation program there, a few new laws, and a pinch of funding. The problem is such actions — while laudable and important — in no way match the scope and size of the problem where all markers indicate that life on Earth continues to slide into the dustbin.
But a few scientists are beginning to call for more ambition — much more — and they want to see it enshrined in a new global agreement similar to the Paris Climate Accord. They also say that the bill shouldn’t just fall on nations, but the private sector too. 
In 2016, E.O. Wilson — arguably the world’s most lauded living evolutionary biologist — published a book called Half Earth where he proposed that to save life on Earth (and ourselves) we must set aside around half the planet in various types of reserves. Not surprisingly, the idea was immediately controversial — but it was also picked up by other scientists hungry for an ambitious, hopeful way of facing a future of ecological Armageddon.
Last year, 49 scientists wrote a landmark paper exploring how feasible Half Earth might be across Earth’s different terrestrial ecosystems. But the head-line news of this paper was really this sentence: “We propose a Global Deal for Nature — a companion to the Paris Climate Deal — to promote increased habitat protection and restoration, national — and ecoregion — scale conservation strategies, and the empowerment of indigenous peoples to protect their sovereign lands.”
In less technical parlance, this is a ringing call for a massive, global agreement that would look at drastically increasing the amount of the world covered by parks — in some cases up to the Half Earth goal — and indigenous protected areas. Indigenous people are now widely recognized as some of the best defenders of nature after decades of being sidelined.
This new agreement, they authors contend, should embrace the Half Earth — or Nature Needs Half — goal.
“A number of empirical studies are telling us that we need to set aside about half of the terrestrial and marine realms to avoid the worst of the two great environmental catastrophes — climate change and the sixth extinction crisis — looming on the horizon,“ Eric Dinerstein, the lead author on the paper, said. Previously with WWF, Dinerstein is today the Director WildTech and the Biodiversity and Wildlife Solutions Program with the NGO, RESOLVE.
Such an agreement would likely fall under the United Nation’s Convention on Biological Diversity, first established in 1992, as an international treaty. Today, the CBD meets every two years.
In 2010, the nations of the CBD agreed to something called the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, these are 20 goals that nations are supposed to be working towards by 2020. We’ve pretty much failed to meet the majority the targets, including halving habitat loss and deforestation, sustainably managing fisheries, preventing the extinction of known endangered species, and minimizing the impact of climate change on coral reefs.
But we are close on one of the targets: setting aside 17 percent of land area under protected areas and ten percent of marine and coastal areas. Currently, 15 percent of land area is protected (though much of this lies in so called ‘paper parks’ which suffer from a dearth in funding) and about 8 percent of the oceans.
The CBD has had a number of disadvantages. For one, much like the Paris Agreement, it’s non-binding and largely voluntary. This has been a necessary concession in order to get so many nations sign on — just like with Paris — but it also means there’s no legal way to enforce action. Just international peer pressure.
For another it’s lacking a major signatory. Guess who? Yes, of course, the United States — that global black sheep. The non-binding treaty was signed by President Bill Clinton in 1993, but was never ratified by Congress. Every other nation in the world is a member of the agreement however.
Finally, the CBD has not been able to garner the same kind of media attention and interest as the various climate change declarations. For some reason, an agreement about the fate of millions of species on Earth just hasn’t grabbed our attention-deficit media. 
But these drawbacks need not ensure that the CBD be toothless or ineffectual. And if there’s a time for it to prove its mettle, it’s now.
Since the Aichi Targets expires in 2020, the CBD needs something to replace it. And it looks likely that the idea of Half Earth will be discussed. The Executive Secretary of the CBD, Dr. Cristiana Pașca Palmer, recently told the Guardian in April that a new agreement should include a proposal to make half the planet more nature-friendly by 2050. This is not quite Half Earth — which envisions half the planet under various types of protection — it does, however, offer a significant ratcheting up of ambition compared to the Aichi Targets committed to ten years ago.
The former Minister for Environment, Waters and Forests in Romania, Pașca Palmer says biodiversity is the “infrastructure” that keeps our planet going. 
“In my view, we need to ensure that the entire planet is used sustainably,” she said in an interview. But this, according to Pașca Palmer, will require a wholesale change in our economy operates.
“We need to...shift to an economic model that accounts for the fact that we operate within a closed system – planet Earth – and that our economic growth is limited by the ecological limits of the planet”
Arguably, the largest element holding back greater conservation action worldwide is funding. To date, the money is simply magnitudes less of what is actually required.
“As with any public good, biodiversity conservation suffers from a free-riding problem, in which governments have an incentive to provide less than the optimal level of funding in the hope that others will cover the costs,” said Edward Barbier, an economist with Colorado State University, adding, “the current global biodiversity crisis is in large part due to the lack of international commitment and funding over the past 25 years.”
Barbier is a lead author on a new paper suggesting a novel way to ratchet up funds for the other eight million-plus species on the planet.
“It will take around $100 billion a year to protect the earth’s broad range of animal and plant species, and current funding fluctuates around $4-10 billion annually,” he said, illustrating the massive shortfall for global conservation. 
In order to raise $100 billion a year — ten times more than is currently spent in the very least — Barbier argues we can’t just depend on governments but must turn to the private sector. He and his co-authors argue any new agreement through the CBD should create a mechanism that would allow private corporations to join with their own targets and funding goals. 
But what would compel corporations to sign on?
“Corporations depend on the health of our eco-systems and are therefore at risk of losing the very foundations upon which their businesses rely,” explained Thomas Dean, co-author of the paper and sustainable develop professor at Colorado State University. ”Growing awareness of this challenge will increasingly motivate corporations to engage.”
The paper points to industries where biodiversity is vital to their bottom line such as fisheries, forestry, agriculture and insurance.
“For too long we have viewed corporate and environmental interests as adversarial. However they need to become aligned if we are to be successful both economically and environmentally,” Dean said. “After all, this is the fundamental purpose of an economic system — serving the needs of society in the short and long term.”
But is protecting 50 percent of the world even possible? Let’s put it this way: it’s not impossible.
Dinerstein’s study last year found that of the 846 ecoregions on land, over ten percent of them already have attained fifty percent protection. Moreover a number of countries — including Namibia, Bhutan and Venezuela — are close to fifty percent protection on land.
Dinerstein says that conservationists will have to get creative to reach such an ambitious target, but he believes it can be done. 
“We will have to include semi-intact areas, managed areas, areas under indigenous protection, and probably about 7-10 percent restoration of key areas…The key here is to be strategic and protect the most irreplaceable sites first over the next decade and fill in the rest over the coming years.”
This doesn’t mean every ecoregion can hit the 50 percent target. Some — think the tallgrass prairies of the US — have no chance. Indeed, the study found that 207 of the world’s ecoregions have less than four percent habitat left.
Dinerstein says getting to 50 percent in these areas is “delusional” but aiming for 10-15 percent in such habitats via restoration would be a starting place.
Such an endeavor would go a long way towards solving another global environmental crisis: climate change. Preserving and restoring forests and other habitats has long been touted as one of the quickest and cheapest ways of decreasing global carbon emissions. Around 15 percent of global CO2 emissions today are directly tied to forests being chopped down, peatlands drained or mangroves cleared.
“Without [Half Earth] by 2050…the goal of Paris accord will not be achievable,” argues Dinerstein. “In essence, the two goals are mutually interdependent. You can’t succeed in one without success in the other.”
Of course, the biggest hurdle is likely to be political — as it was, and continues to be, with combating climate change. Will proponents be able to convince the world that Half Earth would be a positive — and inspiring — way to create a better, more ecologically stable world?
“It is certainly a major challenge, as has been the case with the Paris Climate Accord. But we need to start somewhere,” Dean said.
If all this sounds like utopian fiction, Dinerstein pointed to the fact that Chinese scientists have already published a paper on how they could hit 50 percent protected land in one of the most populous countries on Earth.
“Nature Needs Half is the biggest idea out there,” Dinerstein said, “and the only one that could guarantee a future for all life on Earth.”
… we can’t turn away from climate change. The Guardian’s environmental coverage reports the scientific facts, social consequences and political choices that are shaping the fate of our planet. As the world's leaders turn their backs on the environment, we are at a crisis point. Individual consumer choices are important, but we need collective action to achieve the systemic change that will really make a difference. Our pioneering and our fearless reporting on the environment can play a vital role in that. But we need our readers’ support.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute.

As the army joined firefighters to tackle the blaze near Manchester and a second fire was reported on nearby upland, scientists said similar events are increasingly likely in future, with potentially devastating consequences for the environment and human health. 
Guillermo Rein, professor of fire science at Imperial College London, said recent studies showed “climate change is expected to increase the fire frequency and severity of wildfire in Europe”.
He said the effect is predicted to be “even more pronounced in northern Europe, including the UK and Ireland”.
Dr Richard Payne of the University of York agreed, saying that “devastating events like we are seeing today at Saddleworth Moor are likely to happen more often in the future”. He also warned the fires would exacerbate climate change, as the UK’s peatlands store huge amounts of carbon that is then released.
“The UK’s peaty moorlands are crucial for the carbon they lock away as peat,” he said. “Since the last ice age these peatlands have helped cool our climate but fires can reverse that effect, rapidly returning carbon to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide.”
The fire at Saddleworth Moor could also have more immediate health implications. Prof Susan Page of the University of Leicester said peat fires release toxic chemicals into the air as well as small particulates that have long-term health implications – especially for children or those with existing respiratory conditions.
“For the Saddleworth Moor fire,” she added, “a further concern is the industrial legacy of this region, with the peat soils containing the fallout from many years of heavy industry in surrounding towns and cities. The peat soils contain this pollution legacy in the form of increased levels of heavy metals, which will also be liberated into the smoke by the fires.”
The Saddleworth fire has reached seven square miles across (18 sq km), with the active “fire front” stretching up to 2.5 miles (4km), according to firefighters, who say it could take weeks to put out. People across the region have been advised to stay indoors and keep windows shut.
Prof Vincent Gauci of the Open University said Saddleworth Moor had “been a sponge for regional pollutants for decades and centuries, as the region was an engine of the UK’s industrial revolution”, and warned the health implications of the fire were unknown.
He said: “With none of the current pollution abatement strategies in the early industrial period, these moors were on the receiving end of a whole range of quite nasty industrial pollutants. So these peats are a store of past pollution, which could be remobilised in the current fires with unknown consequences for human health.”
Campaigners have also warned that the use of UK uplands for grouse shooting makes fires more likely. Guy Shrubsole, an environmental activist who is writing a book on land ownership in England, said there was “a strong correlation” between the fire on Saddleworth Moor and “the tell-tale signs of intensively managed grouse moor”.
He said there was growing evidence that grouse shooting degraded the environment and made both flooding and fire more likely.
Pat Thompson of the RSPB said management of UK uplands for grouse shooting had made them more susceptible to fire over the past 150 years: “Over time large parts of the land have been transformed from wetlands with a high water table to a drier, heather-dominated environment.”
He said this made them more susceptible to fire and less able to absorb water, contributing to flooding.
“What we need to do is get this dry hard habitat back to being a wetland environment that can resist fire more effectively and across which water travels much more slowly,” he said.
Thomas Smith at the LSE said other UK moorlands were highly susceptible with “moderate to very high fire danger ratings across most of the UK and the Republic of Ireland”.
He said that besides the Saddleworth Moor fire, there were at least two fires burning in the Northumberland national park this week, “one of which appears to be quite large at over 2km across”.
“The last time we had conditions similar to this was in spring 2011,” he said, “when there were fires breaking out across the whole of the UK and the Republic of Ireland, from a forest fire in Berkshire to moorland fires in the Scottish Highlands.

And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute. Thank you.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/29/more-saddleworth-style-fires-likely-as-climate-changes-scientists-warn

“There is a big difference between the economics of climate change and the politics of climate change,” said Christiana Figueres, the former executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention of Climate Change, who oversaw the landmark Paris agreement on climate change.
“Investors are seeing a tipping point in terms of climate change” and more investors are now taking the risks into account when allocating funds, she said. The growing interest of investors in low-carbon activity will, she said, determine the global response to climate change much more than the actions of Trump.
Speaking on the anniversary of Trump’s public decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement, and ahead of a G7 meeting where climate change will be high on the agenda, Figueres said not only businesses but also other governments were moving ahead of the US on the issue.
“The US is in a frankly un-understandable position,” she told the Guardian. “How is [withdrawing from Paris] going to strengthen the US economy? How is it going to open up new opportunities for the US when the rest of the world is becoming increasingly decarbonised?”
She pointed to the large number of US businesses and cities that had reaffirmed their commitment to cutting greenhouse gas emissions and investing in low-carbon technology. “They are saying they will continue to decarbonise,” she said. “It’s very difficult when the White House is speaking in one direction and the real economy is continuing moving in a different direction.
“Is the White House going to stop this advance [by businesses]? I don’t think so.” 
Figueres had praise for the UK, which she said was leading the world in areas such as offshore wind. “In the country that saw the birth of the industrial revolution, we are seeing a new industrial revolution,” she said. Brexit was not a reason to change the UK’s determination to move to a low-carbon footing, she said, as Britain could benefit from green economic growth.
Figueres was also scathing about those who claim the world cannot now avoid warming of more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, the limit set out in the Paris agreement based on scientific advice that warming above this level would cause catastrophic and irreversible changes. “To say we can’t avoid [such a future] and give up, that is irresponsible. That is completely unacceptable to me.”
She expects a key report due from the International Panel on Climate Change later this year to underline the need for urgency in cutting emissions, but said it was still possible to stave off the worst effects of warming and that the world should focus on such efforts. “I was told in 2009 it was already too late. Had we had a global framework 10 years ago, it would have been better. 20 years ago would have been better yet. 25 years ago would have been better, better, better yet. But the point is that we are dealing with the reality that we have.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/01/businesses-will-act-on-climate-despite-trump-says-ex-un-climate-chief

The voluntary deal, aimed at curbing global temperature rise to under 2C, was “draconian” and would cause a “very diminished quality of life” for Americans, Trump said on 1 June last year. “I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,” the president added.
Almost immediately, Bill Peduto, the mayor of Pittsburgh, retorted via Twitter: “I can assure you that we will follow the guidelines of the Paris Agreement for our people, our economy &amp; future.”
In the year since, an alliance of American cities, states and green groups have flung themselves at the gaping void left by Trump’s decision to remove the world’s second-largest carbon polluter from a deal aimed at preserving the livability of much of the planet. This coalition has experienced a bruising 12 months during which successes at a local level have been regularly overshadowed by an administration intent on tearing down any edifice of climate policy. 
Pittsburgh is one of 405 municipalities representing 70m Americans that are signed on to the Climate Mayors initiative, which has blossomed in the past year. More than 80 US cities - some, like San Diego, run by Republicans - have committed to 100% renewable energy. 
A broader group of several thousand businesses – including Amazon, Levi Strauss &amp; Co and Google – cities and states have pledged to follow the Paris goals via the We Are Still In coalition, spearheaded by the billionaire former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg and the California governor, Jerry Brown. Brown has attacked Trump’s “reckless disregard” for climate change and said California will launch its own climate-monitoring satellites if Republicans hobble Nasa’s science programs. 
“The collective commitments of business and state governments have sent a powerful signal that they are not stepping into line with the federal government when it comes to their attitude to climate – and they must continue with determination,” said Helen Clarkson, chief executive of the Climate Group, which runs a 100% clean energy pact joined by companies such as Apple, Kellogg’s and Visa. 
This backlash has spurred cities to quicken the pace in certain areas – New York is to electrify its bus fleet and Los Angeles has promised to abandon coal-fired electricity. New York has also vowed to divest from fossil fuels and is suing the world’s largest oil companies for their role in escalating sea level rise, heatwaves and natural disasters.
Meanwhile, states such as California and New Jersey have heightened targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions while ramping up solar and wind energy capacity. 
Environmental groups, bolstered by a surge in donations after Trump’s election, have pushed for the retirement of US coal power plants, with some success – more than half of the coal facilities operating in 2011 have been earmarked for retirement, primarily due to strong competition from cheap natural gas.
“Trump was a momentum killer so the job now is to rebuild momentum,” said Bill McKibben, co-founder of the climate group 350.org. “It’s powerful to see cities and states stepping up. Global warming is the biggest thing humans have ever done and in a rational world we’d all come together to address it. But we don’t live in a rational world, so smaller entities are having to fill the gap.”
Still, the antipathy of the Trump administration towards climate action is taking its toll. US energy emissions are at a 25-year low due to trends in energy efficiency and the decline of coal. But at a juncture when far deeper emissions cuts are required to avoid 2C of warming, the US is in danger of stalling – by 2025, the US is set to achieve only half of the reductions it pledged in Paris, according to a new analysis.
The Trump administration threatens to overwhelm the defiance shown by cities and states by reversing vehicle emissions standards, loosening regulations around oil and gas drilling and working to scrap Barack Obama’s centerpiece clean power plan. Trump, who donned a coal miner’s helmet during the 2016 presidential campaign, has claimed he has “ended the war on beautiful, clean coal”.
Trump’s promise to withdraw from the Paris deal – which can’t become reality until November 2020 due to notice periods – hasn’t caused the agreement to unravel. But it has certainly shifted the international dynamics of the accord, despite the best efforts of US cities and states to provide a countervailing view.
“It’s good news that other countries haven’t walked away,” said Todd Stern, who led talks for the US in Paris. “The less positive part is that it has been very damaging for the US. In the absence of the US, we are seeing some countries try to pull back on what was agreed to in Paris. When you have the largest historical emitter not part of the deal, that is obviously not good.” 
Last year the US was rattled by three savage hurricanes that caused record damages, serving as a sobering reminder that even if anti-Trump jurisdictions ameliorate the worst of the reversals, it may not be enough to stave off some punishing consequences.
“Everyone is doing their best but it’s not like there are levers of power to pull in Washington at the moment,” said McKibben. “The problem with climate change is that it’s a timed test. The physics of the planet aren’t in a holding pattern. You lose a few years and there goes an ice cap.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/31/paris-climate-deal-trump-exit-resistance

There has been no intensification of agriculture in the UK for 25 years.
Government statistics show pesticide and fertiliser use has been significantly reduced. There are fewer crops grown and the numbers of pigs, sheep and cattle have fallen. So to point the finger at farming as the cause of environmental degradation through intensification makes no sense, especially when you consider the other changes that have taken place in that time – increased housebuilding, more roads, and more cars on those roads – and the impact they have had on the country’s landscape.
As British farmers we are up for the challenge of improving the way we farm in harmony with wildlife while not decreasing food production. But this will not be achieved through some sort of kneejerk blame game that focuses purely on agriculture rather than the bigger picture about how we are all leading our lives and using Britain’s land.
We should remember here that if British farmers produce less then we as a nation become more dependent on imports for our food needs. These will most likely come from countries where environmental protection gets lower priority.
The British countryside is not a degraded, sterile landscape. It is a rich and beautiful one managed by farmers and much appreciated by most people. I’d urge your reporters to drive through the agricultural heartlands of the US midwest, South America or eastern Europe and report back how they compare with our green and pleasant land.Guy SmithDeputy president, National Farmers’ Union
• Industrialised agriculture is often harmful (Industrial-scale beef production is a sign of crisis in our farming, 31 May) but is often claimed to be necessary for food security. Levels of food wastage suggest otherwise.
The IMechE’s Waste Not, Want Not report estimates that at least 30% of global production never reaches shops or markets, while massive waste occurs in shops, restaurants, canteens, homes, outside fast-food stores and on airlines. Wasteful uses of human food include livestock feed, biofuels, alcoholic drinks, cosmetics and even packaging. Add in overeating, excessive cash-crop production and the stampede to cover good land in development, and clearly there is massive scope for both increasing and improving food supplies just by reducing waste, although there are other options. Methane-reducing feed additives for ruminant livestock have existed for decades but not been adopted, even though they often boost growth.Iain ClimieWhitchurch, Hampshire
• Your report on the study led by Joseph Poore (Avoid meat and dairy to reduce your impact on planet, say scientists, 1 June) is right about everything concerning our production of meat and dairy foods except that by far the single most effective thing you can do to reduce your environmental footprint is to not reproduce. The most recent of many studies showing this, published in 2017 by researchers at Sweden’s Lund University and Canada’s University of British Columbia (Best solution to climate change? Fewer children, 12 July 2017), found that having one fewer child was about 60 times more effective than eating a plant-based diet, 30 times better than avoiding airplane travel and 20 times better than living car-free.
Since the study led by Poore did not rigorously compare the environmental impact of our diet with such other factors, he cannot base his claim that diet is “the single biggest way” for us to lower our footprints on that study. It is not in the interest of either sustainability or quality of life for the Guardian to continue to almost always regard population size as a negligible impact factor. All environmental and animal-welfare problems are much easier to solve at the present human population level – or of course lower – than after the highly likely addition of 2 or 3 billion more people in the next few decades.Dr Blake AlcottIstanbul, Turkey

A sudden drop in demand for fossil fuels before 2035 is likely, according to the study, given the current global investments and economic advantages in a low-carbon transition.
The existence of a “carbon bubble” – assets in fossil fuels that are currently overvalued because, in the medium and long-term, the world will have to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions – has long been proposed by academics, activists and investors. The new study, published on Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change, shows that a sharp slump in the value of fossil fuels would cause this bubble to burst, and posits that such a slump is likely before 2035 based on current patterns of energy use.
Crucially, the findings suggest that a rapid decline in fossil fuel demand is no longer dependent on stronger policies and actions from governments around the world. Instead, the authors’ detailed simulations found the demand drop would take place even if major nations undertake no new climate policies, or reverse some previous commitments.
That is because advances in technologies for energy efficiency and renewable power, and the accompanying drop in their price, have made low-carbon energy much more economically and technically attractive.
Dr Jean-François Mercure, the lead author, from Radboud and Cambridge universities, told the Guardian: “This is happening already – we have observed the data and made projections from there. With more policies from governments, this would happen faster. But without strong [climate] policies, it is already happening. To some degree at least you can’t stop it. But if people stop putting funds now in fossil fuels, they may at least limit their losses.”
By moving to a lower-carbon footing, companies and investors could take advantage of the transition that is occurring, rather than trying to fight the growing trend. Mercure said fossil fuel companies were likely to fight among each other for the remaining market, rather than have a strong impact on renewable energy businesses.
Prof Jorge Viñuales, co-author, said: “Contrary to investor expectations, the stranding of fossil fuel assets may happen even without new climate policies. Individual nations cannot avoid the situation by ignoring the Paris agreement or burying their heads in coal and tar sands.”
However, Mercure also warned that the transition was happening too slowly to stave off the worst effects of climate change. Although the trajectory towards a low-carbon economy would continue, to keep within 2C above pre-industrial levels – the limit set under the Paris agreement – would require much stronger government action and new policies.
That could also help investors by pointing the way to deflation of the carbon bubble before they make new investments in fossil fuel assets.
The paper supports the view of some policy and investment experts that economics and technology are now driving action on climate change, where before impetus was all from policymakers. Former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres told the Guardian, a year after Donald Trump announced the withdrawal of the US from the Paris agreement: “There is a big difference between the economics of climate change and the politics of climate change. Is Trump going to stop that advance [by businesses towards low-carbon technologies]? I don’t think so.”
Frédéric Samama, of Europe’s biggest asset manager Amundi, also believes investors have reached a “tipping point”, in relation to taking action on greenhouse gases through their portfolio management. He told Bloomberg last month that “until recently, the question” of climate change was “not on their radar screen”.
Separately, an analysis in Nature Energy forecast that global energy demand would be about 40% lower than today by 2050, despite rises in population and income, and a growing global economy. The authors found that such a scenario would allow the world to stay within 1.5C of warming, the aspirational goal set under the Paris agreement.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/04/carbon-bubble-could-spark-global-financial-crisis-study-warns

In an exclusive interview with Guardian Australia, deputy vice chancellor Prof Iain Gordon said he was frustrated at reports claiming Ridd was sacked for his fringe views on climate change or for his rejection of the scientific evidence linking human activity to degradation of the Great Barrier Reef.

“We defend Peter’s right to make statements in his area of academic expertise and would continue to do that until we are blue in the face,” Gordon says.
“The issue has never been about Peter’s right to make statements – it’s about how he has continually broken a code of conduct that we would expect all our staff to stick to, to create a safe, respectful and professional workplace.”
Ridd’s case has been followed extensively in conservative media, where it has been claimed he was fired for his rejection of the science of human-caused climate change and of evidence that the Great Barrier Reef is threatened by global warming and poor water quality from dredging and farm run-off.
Ridd was sacked in May, prompting an outcry among conservative commentators and climate science deniers. 
Politicians including the former prime minister Tony Abbott, the environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, the assistant science minister, Zed Seselja, and independent MP Bob Katter have gone on the record expressing concern about Ridd’s sacking.
The National Tertiary Education Union (NTEU) last week called for JCU to reinstate Ridd, arguing he was allowed to publicly question the university’s decisions.
Michael McNally, Queensland NTEU secretary, wrote: “Given the nature of the (entirely predictable) extensive media coverage, all management have done is to feed a rightwing media narrative that universities are conformist and actively suppress heterodox views on topics such as climate change.”
In November 2017 Ridd started court proceedings against JCU over the misconduct allegations and, later, his sacking, and raised $260,000 in a crowdfunding campaign to cover legal costs.
The disciplinary process began after Ridd wrote a December 2016 email to a News Corp Australia journalist with a report attached, claiming the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, which is based at JCU, was knowingly using “misleading” historical pictures of degraded reef.
That email was forwarded to a JCU academic, who complained, leading the university to investigate and issue a formal censure, saying Ridd had broken the university’s code of conduct. Ridd defended his actions and denied his alleged breach. 
Against the university’s instructions, Ridd later spoke about the disciplinary proceedings, repeating some of his criticisms and then, in later interviews, claimed the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) and the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies “can no longer be trusted”.
Both AIMS and the coral studies centre have staff based at JCU. Ridd later published “private and confidential” correspondence on a blog and wrote about the issue on a crowdfunding page, while repeating other claims in further interviews and on his website.
“There has never been any constraint on Peter to express his opinion,” Gordon says.
He pointed to a “viewpoint” paper Ridd had cowritten for a journal in late 2017 that had laid out his claims about a lack of quality control in scientific studies related to the Great Barrier Reef. Some of the scientists Ridd had criticised responded, saying his claims were largely based on misinterpretations and “selective use of data”.
Gordon said: “That is what you would except an academic to do – to publish their views on the ways in which data is interpreted and that gives other academics the chance to rebut his particular views.
“So this is not about academic freedom. It is to do with the code of conduct at the university and the ways in which he had transgressed that code of conduct that we would expect any member of our staff to adhere to.”
He said the university was now trying to “put the record straight” about why it had disciplined and then sacked Ridd, amidst media claims he was muzzled because of is his views on climate change, reef science and his academic freedom was not upheld.
“The university characterises the coverage of this issue in the media as untrue and misleading,” Gordon says.
“There is a significant amount of information out there that would allow people to come to a conclusion other than those that some outlets are coming to.
“This appears to be Peter using the media attention to achieve some ends to his own that I don’t always understand.
“It is a mystery to me and I’m genuine about that. We would not have wished this matter to end in the way that it did, but ultimately we have to ensure we uphold the ethics and the code of conduct of this organisation.”
In a termination letter published on Ridd’s website, the university lays out a series of allegations relating to “serious misconduct” which Ridd is challenging in an ongoing court case.
Among the allegations, the university says Ridd had “perpetuated a view that you were not allowed to talk to your wife about the disciplinary process, when in fact this was contrary to what you were told by verbally, and in writing … ”. He had denigrated a colleague, disclosed confidential information and “failed to take reasonable steps to avoid or manage a conflict of interest between your own interests and the interests of the Institute of Public Affairs (IPA) and the interests of the university”.
The IPA has been a key promoter of climate science denialism for two decades, publishing books and sponsoring speaking tours. The Melbourne-based thinktank has supported Ridd, helped his crowdfunding campaign and given him $8,566 to pay for initial legal advice.
Ridd’s case against JCU is adjourned until later this month.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/07/academic-peter-ridd-not-sacked-for-his-climate-views-university-says

Last week the Irish Environmental Protection Agency confirmed that Ireland will miss its 2020 international emissions target by a wide margin. The goal is 20% cuts on 2005 levels; in reality we’re on track for 1%. 
It further predicted that the gap between stated ambition and reality will, if anything, widen over the coming years. Starting from 2020 this will almost certainly mean fines – potentially of millions of euros – being levied by the European commission.
Plans such as a 20% increase in milk production to satisfy export markets in China and beyond point Ireland unambiguously in the wrong direction. Peat, the most dirty fuel of all, is still commercially extracted and burned to produce some of the country’s electricity. As well as increasing our carbon footprint it degrades our national ecosystems. Microgeneration of electricity cannot be pushed back on to the grid, even for free, making Ireland a sore thumb anomaly internationally and curtailing domestic renewables uptake. Electric vehicle take-up remains abysmally low. Ireland has a lot to do just to play catch-up, let alone take a leadership role, in tackling climate change.
Ireland has also been heavily in the news recently over the referendum to repeal the eighth amendment, which prohibited abortion. The role of the Citizens’ Assembly, an exercise in deliberative democracy, in the process has, quite rightly, been lauded. It proved that given time, access to expert evidence, the absence of the proverbial megaphones of vested interests, and a conducive environment to discuss issues, citizens can, and will, come to informed and nuanced opinions.
Less well known, at least outside Ireland, is that the assembly have considered a number of additional topics. These included how the state can help make Ireland a leader in tackling climate change. As noted already, Ireland’s progress to date on this issue has been wholly inadequate.
It was my privilege to serve on the expert advisory group of the assembly for its climate deliberations. Citizens were presented over two weekends with what amounted to a crash course in, not just the evidence basis for climate change, but also what critical aspects of their life, such as energy, transport, agriculture, and our homes might look like 30 years hence, were Ireland to become a leader in tackling climate change. They were also shown inspiring present day exemplars such as the Dublin fire brigade station that has gone carbon neutral, through community owned renewable energy efforts in Tipperary, to organic low-impact farmers. 
Crucially, these discussions were undertaken without the voices of vested interests, from both ends of the spectrum. These all too often tend to obfuscate, and discussions of climate change in the public sphere turn into a slanging match.
At the end of the two weekends citizens voted on a range of questions. If the citizens are as representative of broader society as implied by the eight amendment deliberations, where the assembly ballot results almost exactly matched the referendum result, then the results were awe-inspiring. They should act as a real wake-up call to both the current government and future governments. Every single question given to the citizens attained at least 80% agreement. Most attained close to unanimous agreement.
Real efforts were made to ensure that the questions given were balanced and nuanced and properly reflected trade-offs that would be required in the real-world. There were no questions, for example, about subsidies without a commensurate counterweight of a source of increased revenues to cover the costs. 
But they also recognised aspects such as equity that could and should be achieved. So, for example, there was a question around raising taxes on carbon intensive activities. But the funds would then be ringfenced and used to enable the transition to lower-intensity activities, with priority given to those in fuel poverty and community owned activities.
The citizens were almost unanimous in desiring an act similar to the UK Climate Change Act with a watchdog similar to the Climate Change Committee charged with setting sector-wise targets but given real teeth – the ability to sue the government or other public bodies for non-conformance.
The citizens also voted strongly for the imposition of tax and subsidy basis for the farming sector to penalise carbon intensive activities and encourage more climate friendly behaviours in the sector. They also wanted Ireland to reimagine its approach to transport, in both urban and rural areas.
The recently unveiled 2040 strategy of the government, if enacted in full, starts to make substantive progress in addressing many, but by no means all, of the issues raised. But, unless and until strategy is translated into action and results across successive governments the jury must remain out.
There is clearly an enormous appetite to make Ireland live up to its reputation as the emerald island by being a leader in addressing climate change. Citizens recognised the competitive advantages of energy independence and first mover advantage, as well as co-benefits such as air quality improvements.
Will our politicians give the same due diligence to the Citizens’ Assembly’s climate change considerations as the eighth amendment? Time will tell.

The draft climate change bill, published on Thursday morning, sets a target of a 90% reduction by 2050 – which the UK Committee on Climate Change states is currently “at the limit of feasibility” – with the aim of achieving 100% reduction, or “net-zero”, as soon as possible.
Announcing the targets, Holyrood’s climate change secretary, Roseanna Cunningham, said: “Our 90% target will be tougher even than the 100% goal set by a handful of other countries, because our legislation will set more demanding, legally binding, annual targets covering every sector of our economy. By 2030, we will cut emissions by two-thirds and, unlike other nations, we will not use carbon offsetting, where other countries are paid to cut emissions for us, to achieve our goal.”
But Tom Ballantine, chair of Stop Climate Chaos Scotland, described the targets as hugely disappointing. “By failing to ally with the global momentum towards zero emissions, led by countries like France, Sweden and New Zealand, Scotland is missing a huge opportunity to end its contribution to climate change in a generation, attract clean investment and retain its position as a leader on the global stage,” he said.
Ballantine called on MSPs from all parties to push for net-zero by 2050 at the latest, to keep Scotland in line with the 2016 Paris agreement.
Earlier this month, transport minister Humza Yousaf admitted that the Scottish government did not have to the powers to ban the sale of diesel cars, despite pledging to phase them out across the country by 2032, eight years ahead of the UK government’s target.

Insects are vital to most ecosystems and a widespread collapse would cause extremely far-reaching disruption to life on Earth, the scientists warn. Their research shows that, even with all the carbon cuts already pledged by nations so far, climate change would make almost half of insect habitat unsuitable by the end of the century, with pollinators like bees particularly affected.
However, if climate change could be limited to a temperature rise of 1.5C - the very ambitious goal included in the global Paris agreement - the losses of insects are far lower. 
The new research is the most comprehensive to date, analysing the impact of different levels of climate change on the ranges of 115,000 species. It found plants are also heavily affected but that mammals and birds, which can more easily migrate as climate changes, suffered less.
“We showed insects are the most sensitive group,” said Prof Rachel Warren, at the University of East Anglia, who led the new work. “They are important because ecosystems cannot function without insects. They play an absolutely critical role in the food chain.”
“The disruption to our ecosystems if we were to lose that high proportion of our insects would be extremely far-reaching and widespread,” she said. “People should be concerned - humans depend on ecosystems functioning.” Pollination, fertile soils, clean water and more all depend on healthy ecosystems, Warren said.
In October, scientists warned of “ecological Armageddon” after discovering that the number of flying insects had plunged by three-quarters in the past 25 years in Germany and very likely elsewhere.
“We know that many insects are in rapid decline due to factors such as habitat loss and intensive farming methods,” said Prof Dave Goulson, at the University of Sussex, UK, and not part of the new analysis. “This new study shows that, in the future, these declines would be hugely accelerated by the impacts of climate change, under realistic climate projections. When we add in all the other adverse factors affecting wildlife, all likely to increase as the human population grows, the future for biodiversity on planet Earth looks bleak.”
In the new analysis, published in the journal Science, the researchers gathered data on the geographic ranges and current climate conditions of 31,000 insect species, 8,000 birds, 1,700 mammals, 1,800 reptiles, 1,000 amphibians and 71,000 plants. 
They then calculated how the ranges change when global warming means some regions can no longer support particular species. For the first time in this type of study, they included the 1.5C Paris target, as well as 2C, the longstanding international target, and 3.2C, which is the rise the world will experience by 2100 unless action is taken beyond that already pledged.
The researchers measured the results in two ways. First, they counted the number of species that lose more than half their range and this was 49% of insect species at 3.2C, falling to 18% at 2C and 6% at 1.5C. Second, they combined the losses for each species group into a type of average measure.
“If you are a typical insect, you would be likely to lose 43% of your range at 3.2C,” Warren said. “We also found that the three major groups of insects responsible for pollination are particularly sensitive to warming.”
Guy Midgley, at University of Stellenbosch, South Africa and not part of the research team, said the new work built on previous studies but is far more comprehensive. He said major impacts on wildlife would be expected given the potential scale of climate change: “Global average surface temperatures in the past two million years have rarely approached the levels projected over the next few decades.”
Warren said the new work had taken account of the ability of species to migrate, but had not been able to include the impact of lost interactions between species as ranges contract, or of the impacts of more extreme weather events on wildlife. As both of those would increase the losses of range, Warren said the estimates of losses made were likely to be underestimates.
Warren said that the world’s nations were aware that more action on climate change is needed: “The question is to what extent greater reductions can be made and on what timescale. That is a decision society has to make.”
Another study published in Science on Thursday found that one third of the world’s protected areas, which cover 15% of all land, are now highly degraded by intense human pressure including road building, grazing, and urbanisation.
Kendall Jones, at the University of Queensland, Australia, who led the work, said: “A well-run protected area network is essential in saving species. If we allow our protected area network to be degraded there is a no doubt biodiversity losses will be exacerbated.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/17/climate-change-on-track-to-cause-major-insect-wipeout-scientists-warn

Food and farming is one of the biggest economic sectors in the world. We are no longer in the 14th century, when as much as 76% of the population worked in agriculture – but farming still employs more than 26% of all workers globally. And that does not include the people who work along the meat supply chain: the slaughterers, packagers, retailers and chefs. 
In 2016, the world’s meat production was estimated at 317m metric tons, and that is expected to continue to grow. Figures for the value of the global meat industry vary wildly from $90bn to as much as $741bn. 
Although the number of people directly employed by farming is currently less than 2% in the UK, the food chain now includes the agribusiness companies, the retailers, and the entertainment sector. According to the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, in 2014 the food and drink manufacturing sector contributed £27bn to the economy, and employed 3.8 million people.
It is not simple to separate out the contribution that meat production makes to this – particularly globally. The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation states that livestock is about 40% of the global value of agricultural output and supports the livelihoods and food security of almost a 1.3 billion people.

What about its cultural and social importance?
Cooked meat may have been partially responsible for the large brains that characterise Homo sapiens and have put humans where we are now. Cooking made calories from meat (and from vegetables) easier to consume and absorb than in a raw form. 
And the domestication of certain animals – along with the domestication of wild grains and vegetables – marked the beginning of human agricultural history in the “fertile crescent”. Throughout human history the hunting and farming of meat has been part of our stories and mythologies and some of our legal and religious systems; the fatted calf for the prodigal son; the medieval forest laws that created areas where no one but English royalty could hunt; the sacrifical sheep to mark the beginning of Eid Al-Adha; even the roasted wild boars consumed at the end of every adventure by Asterix and Obelix.
 But is meat still crucial to human life? Some argue that, just because we’ve always eaten meat, that doesn’t mean we always have to. If we can get all the dietary nutrients and protein that we need elsewhere, should we? 
How has meat production changed?
The old-fashioned vision of a mixed farm with wheat and chickens and pigs still exists. More than half of the farms in the US, for example, were small enough in 2012 to have sales of less than $10,000 dollars. But the 20th century saw the application of the principles of the industrial revolution to agriculture - how could inputs be minimised and profits be maximised? 
 The result was the factory farm, first for chickens, then pigs, and more recently cattle. Producers discovered that animals could be kept inside, and fed grain, and could be bred to grow more quickly and get fatter in the right places. Since 1925, the average days to market for a US chicken has been reduced from 112 to 48, while its weight has ballooned from a market weight of 2.5 pounds to 6.2. 
Pig and cattle farming has followed suit. Sows are held in gestation crates for up to four weeks once they are pregnant, and then put into farrowing crates once they’ve had their piglets to prevent them accidentally crushing their young. Industrially reared pigs spend their lives in indoor pens. Cattle farming is now being similarly streamlined, with cows in the last few months of their lives being fattened in feedlots with no access to grass and sometimes no shelter.
What is the environmental impact of our current farming model?
 It is extremely difficult to separate out the different impacts of different farming models and types. Many measurements look at agricultural impact without making a distinction between arable v livestock, or industrial v small farms. However, the following information begins to indicate the scale of the problem.
 An influential study in 2010 of the water footprints for meat estimated that while vegetables had a footprint of about 322 litres per kg, and fruits drank up 962, meat was far more thirsty: chicken came in at 4,325l/kg, pork at 5,988l/kg, sheep/goat meat at 8,763l/kg, and beef at a stupendous 15,415l/kg. Some non-meat products were also pretty eye-watering: nuts came in at 9,063l/kg. 
 To put these figures into context: the planet faces growing water constraints as our freshwater reservoirs and aquifers dry up. On some estimates farming accounts for about 70% of water used in the world today, but a 2013 study found that it uses up to 92% of our freshwater, with nearly one-third of that related to animal products.
 Farms contribute to water pollution in a range of ways: some of those are associated more closely with arable farming, and some with livestock, but it’s worth remembering that one-third of the world’s grain is now fed to animals. The FAO believes that the livestock sector, which is growing and intensifying faster than crop production, has “serious implications” for water quality. 
 The types of water pollution include: nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilisers and animal excreta); pesticides; sediment; organic matter (oxygen demanding substances such as plant matter and livestock excreta); pathogens (E coli etc); metals (selenium etc) and emerging pollutants (drug residues, hormones and feed additives). 
 The impacts are wide-reaching. Eutrophication is caused by excesses of nutrients and organic matter (animal faeces, leftover feed and crop residues) – which cause algae and plants to grow excessively and use up all the oxygen in the body of wate at the expense of other species. A review in 2015 identified 415 coastal bodies already suffering these problems. Pesticide pollution can kill weeds and insects away from the agricultural area, with impacts that may be felt all the way up the food chain. And although scientists do not yet have full data on the connection between antibiotic use in animals and rising levels of antibiotic resistance in the human population, water pollution by antibiotics (which continue to have an active life even after going through the animal and into the water) is definitely in the frame. 
Livestock is the world’s largest user of land resources, says the FAO, “with grazing land and cropland dedicated to the production of feed representing almost 80% of all agricultural land. Feed crops are grown in one-third of total cropland, while the total land area occupied by pasture is equivalent to 26% of the ice-free terrestrial surface”.
It’s hard to work out exactly what quantity of greenhouse gases (GHG) is emitted by the meat industry from farm to fork; carbon emissions are not officially counted along entire chains in that way, and so a number of complicated studies and calculations have attempted to fill the gap.
According to the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, agriculture, forestry and other land use accounts for 24% of greenhouse gases. Attempts to pick out the role of animal farming within that have come up with a huge range of numbers, from 6-32%: the difference, according to the Meat Atlas, “depends on the basis of measurement”. Should it just be livestock, or should it include a whole lot of other factors? Different models of farming have different levels of emissions: this has generated an energetic discussion around extensive versus intensive farming, and regenerative farming – a model that aims to combine technologies and techniques to regenerate soils and biodiversity levels while also sequestrating carbon. 
What about the giant companies that dominate the sector? A 2017 landmark studyfound that the top three meat firms – JBS, Cargill and Tyson – emitted more greenhouse gases in 2016 than all of France. 
 What next?
 Some argue that veganism is the only sane way forward. A study last year showed, for example, that if all Americans substituted beans for beef, the country would be close to meeting the greenhouse gas goals agreed by Barack Obama. 
But there are some alternatives. Reducing the amount of meat you eat while improving its quality is advocated by many environmental groups. But where do you find this meat? The organic movement was founded on the pioneering work of Sir Alfred Howard. It is still relatively small - in Europe 5.7% of agricultural land is managed organically - but influential. There are other agricultural models, such as biodynamic farming and permaculture. More recently some innovators have been fusing technology with environmental principles in the form of agroforestry, silvopasture, conservation farming, or regenerative agriculture to create farming methods which all encompass carbon sequestration, high biodiversity and good animal welfare. A recent study showed that managed grazing (a technique which involves moving cows around to graze) is an effective way to sequester carbon. However, while organic and biodynamic meats have labels, regenerative farming, as yet, does not - so you need to investigate your farmer yourself.

The Australian Communications and Media Authority found that Andrew Probyn’s piece to camera on a 7pm news bulletin last October was “problematic” and “incongruent” with the rest of his news report.
“Although the statement was very brief, its impact was heightened by the fact that it was delivered by the ABC’s political editor in the report’s only piece to camera,” the Acma investigation found. “It was not in keeping with the ABC’s requirement to present news with due impartiality. Accordingly, the ABC breached Standard 4.1 of the Code.”

It is the second time since 2011 the ABC has breached its code.
In Probyn’s report on the former prime minister’s speech to the Global Warming Policy Foundation thinktank, he said: “Tony Abbott, already the most destructive politician of his generation, now intends waging war on what he calls ‘environmental theology’.
“If this tells us anything, it’s that Malcolm Turnbull can’t do anything to appease Tony Abbott on climate action, which may even embolden cabinet to pursue and deliver the energy policy it wants.”
A former political reporter for the West Australian, Probyn had just replaced Chris Uhlmann, who resigned to join the Nine network when Laurie Oakes retired.
The ABC’s own investigation found the story was impartial and in keeping with its editorial standards.
“Abbott’s speech, which was made as the government are finalising their new energy policy, was therefore highly newsworthy, in the public interest and appropriate for further contextualisation and analysis,” the ABC told the Acma.
“We have also referred to the Macquarie dictionary which provides the following definition for ‘destructive’: “tending to overthrow, disprove, or discredit”. It is the case that Mr Abbott over his long political career has succeeded in overthrowing his political and ideological opponents, and in his speech to the GWPF he sought to discredit or disprove the consensus on climate science. In the highly competitive context of federal politics, “destructive” is not necessarily a pejorative descriptor.”
Acma disagreed and said the ordinary reasonable viewer “would have understood this statement to be a comment on Mr Abbott’s political career generally, rather than a comment specific to his involvement with climate change policy”. 
“Contrary to the ABC’s submissions that ‘destructive’ is not necessarily a pejorative descriptor, the ACMA considers that the ordinary reasonable viewer would have understood it in those terms.”
The ABC said Probyn had made a professional judgment expected in news reporting, as opposed to giving his opinion. ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/may/01/abc-report-calling-tony-abbott-destructive-found-to-have-breached-code

This is how nature does it and changed our climate and pCO2 from ""dinosaur conditions"" to the ""Plio-Pleistocene conditions"" over tens of millions of years. 
It is also literally a ""stone-age"" solution to a ""stone-age"" problem. Artificially speeding up rock-erosion to solve artificial change to the geological carbon-cycle. 
The fossil industry lives in this reality of physics: The joy of fossil fuel is based on the same thermodynamics as AGW. Fossil fuel gives off energy when one burn it. But to collect and bind the waste-product (although it can be done) simply does not add up when scaled to the energy produced in the first step (and the price it is sold for). 
This means that CO2 levels will eventually go back to natural - because of rocks. But it takes the age of human civilisations times thousands to do it properly - after being left alone. 
There is only one solution to this problem - to scale back our mucking about with the geological carbon cycle - to zero. 
Even if we price energy on the level that carbon can be profitable with CCS (meaning that the profit from making energy from wind and solar will be crazy high and cause fossil to collapse instantly) - the efficiency of CCS is still too low. 
CCS research is still needed, though - for non-fossil applications such as cement-production etc. 
Finally - this is science. It looks into the effect industrial scale crushing of rocks (similar in size to global industrial scale fossil geology) - and ends up with a 10% ""effect"". It is bleedingly obvious that it will be the fossil companies that will pay for the hundreds of thousands of jobs and machinery for this global scale dunite and basalt mining and crushing and fertilisation project. It will be billed to customers on the electricity and fuel-price at the petrol-station. 
It is how science does a bit of sarcasm. Sure the laws of the universe can make your emission problem a bit smaller. 
Science did the same sarcasm with the CCS dream. Sure science can help you design a CCS plant. No problem. But you must pay for it's construction - and you must offset 30% of the coal you buy - and burn it non-profit to give the energy for the CCS-system (if you do not want to invest in a lot of wind-mills or solar farms to provide that energy).Then you must send these numbers over to your economics section and ponder what you can sell ""clean fossils"" for

Wind, rain, ice and snow all contribute to weathering; nibbling away at mountains, sea cliffs, limestone pavements and even solid granite tors.
Freshly exposed rock surfaces react with carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to make bicarbonate ions, which flow down to the ocean (hitching a ride on rivulets of rainwater) and are used by ocean critters to make limestone. This natural process helps to keep the Earth cool by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and locking it up in rocks underground for a few million years.
So could we speed up this cooling process by smashing up more rocks? German scientists have been investigating the cooling potential of two types of rock: dunite and basalt. Their results, published in Environmental Research Letters, show that, if done on a large scale (comparable with today’s coal industry), crushed basalt could mop up nearly 10% of mankind’s carbon dioxide emissions every year, while dunite could absorb double that. Basalt could also have the co-benefit of adding nutrients to soil in tropical regions. 
Pricewise, the technique would cost about 10 times as much as afforestation and about two to four times as much as carbon capture and storage.

Billing themselves as “the counterweight” to the pro-coal power Monash Forum, the North Shore Environmental Stewards have held at least two recruitment functions at which attendees were urged to tap into their networks of environmentally conscious people to join the Liberal party branches in Abbott’s seat of Warringah and on the lower north shore.
The NSES has a Facebook page that says the group “supports clean energy and a healthy environment, and believes in traditional Liberal party values of environmental stewardship”.

But some participants believe its objectives appeared to be aimed at candidate change.
“I was asked to participate in an initiative to have a representative in Canberra who acknowledges climate change,” said one person who attended the meeting in Seaforth on 25 March.
Exactly who is involved in the group remains a matter of conjecture.
Certainly, Liberals have attended. Several high-profile figures in the moderate faction of the Liberal party, including the powerbroker Michael Photios and his wife, Kristina, attended the lunchtime gathering of the NSES at Seaforth in March.
Also attending were the New South Wales MP for North Shore, Felicity Wilson, and David Begg, a longtime Liberal party member who ran against Abbott for preselection in the 1990s. 
Photios addressed the meeting and, according to one attendee, put the case that the Liberals were the party that would tackle climate change – and that they should join. He highlighted his own record of defending the environment when in state parliament. . 
“At the meeting I soon realised that the NSES was ... seeking to recruit people concerned about the lack of action on climate change to join the Liberal party in order to block the preselection of Tony Abbott to stand in Warringah at the next federal election,” the attendee claimed.
One invitation for the Mosman meeting said: “We have a real opportunity be a force for good in the party, a voice for the environment right here in the electorate of the Monash Forum’s figurehead – Tony Abbott. Come and learn about how we can shift the politics here in Warringah at our info session this Sunday!”
Photios told Guardian Australia he had attended the Seaforth meeting because his wife, a passionate environmentalist, had been asked to speak. She ultimately didn’t speak but Photios did and was the main speaker at the event.
He said there was “zero involvement” of the Liberal party or the moderate faction in the formation of the NSES.
 Kristina Photios quit the Liberal party in 2016 because she was appalled by its stance on climate change but has since rejoined.
A year ago, the Photios couple formed a spinoff from Photios’s lobbying firm, Premier State, to represent clean energy companies. The firm, Clean Energy Strategies, describes itself as “a boutique corporate advisory firm specialising in energy”.
Until a few years ago Photios held several senior positions in the state executive of the NSW Liberal party and was head of the moderate faction, known as the Group, which has been locked in a long-running power struggle with the right. Abbott is one of the leading members of the right faction.
 As prime minister, Abbott pushed through rule changes in the Liberal party to ban registered lobbyists from holding party positions. 
Several members of NSES are also members of the activist group GetUp. A GetUp spokeswoman said the NSES “was definitely not a GetUp project but the environmental justice team knows of it ... and think they’re great”.
The official organiser of NSES, Rob Grant, told Guardian Australia the group was no more than “a group of like-minded people on the north shore who want to see action on climate change, and who believe in driving change from inside the tent”.
Grant, a businessman who had a company in the renewables sector, is also a member of the Liberal party’s Neutral Bay branch.
Senior figures in the moderates scoffed at the idea that Abbott was in any danger of losing his northern beaches seat in a preselection. They said he had a firm grip on the numbers and that to take part in a preselection members must have joined at least six months earlier.
There is no firm date for federal preselections but they are likely to take place by the end of the year or earlier, if an early election is called.
But figures closer to the machinations in Warringah warned the seat could be vulnerable to an attack by Young Liberals, whom they described as marauding across NSW.
This is because the geographic rules that require members to join their local federal branch do not apply for members under the age of 30. Young Liberals can therefore vote in preselections outside where they live.

It was hotter than in 2016, which was also the hottest in history. The vineyard owners spoke nervously of how difficult it was to find people willing to pick grapes in this heat. The apple trees dropped all their apples. Over the summer the smoke from hundreds of wildfires burning throughout the state gave me a chronic cough, which turned into walking pneumonia. People began to talk about how illnesses are getting weirder these days. I decided to attend a climate change action meeting I had seen announced in the local newspaper.
It was an experimental prototype course founded on the ideas in George Marshall’s book Don’t Even Think About It: Why Our Brains Are Wired to Ignore Climate Change. After spending 15 years studying climate change-denying microcultures, Marshall concluded that facts don’t change people’s minds – only stories do. We’re so motivated by wanting to belong that we’d rather risk the dangers of climate change than the more immediate symbolic death of estrangement from our peers. In order to address climate change in our communities, Marshall suggests, we must appeal to the same desires that religion does: belonging, consolation and redemption.
For this reason, the purpose of the group – or “fellowship”, as the organisers called it – was to borrow the most effective tools of religion in order to create a community of people who would work together when it was time to implement policy change, or even take to the streets. Their aim was to galvanise 3.5% of the local population – the number that social scientists estimate is the tipping point for effecting social change.
You had to apply to join the prototype course, so after the informational meeting I wrote the organisers the following email: “I grew up with a dad who would regale us with climate change statistics over the dinner table. If my brother said he was going to a Giants game, my dad would say that he better enjoy it now because there weren’t going to be any Giants games in the future. Hanging on the wall was a colour-coded map he had created, showing what property values would be when ocean levels rose in the Bay Area. He terrorised all my friends by describing how the atmosphere would start to smell like rotten eggs as soon as the oceans warmed and started pluming carbon. In effect, I assumed that by 2020, life on Earth wouldn’t exist anymore. I teach environmental studies, and am looking for ways that I can bring hope to my students but also help motivate them (as well as myself).”
The organisers tried many methods for cultivating a feeling of fellowship. They’d start the session by banging a gong, or by reciting a poem by William Stafford, or one about holdfasts – the dangly part of seaweed that clings to rock – which we were encouraged to commit to memory in order to steady ourselves when things got rough. They encouraged us to discuss our vulnerabilities. But the most effective method was to scare the crap out of us with mini-lectures about the realities of climate change, which bonded us in common terror.
We were presented, at the beginning, with a self-proclaimed “humourless, brain-numbing deep dive into climate science”. They told us it wasn’t supposed to happen this quickly. Climate scientists had predicted that by 2017 we would be at 380 parts per million (ppm) of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, but we were already past 410ppm. The man who presented this information was, like my father, a local architect. Scrunching up his face he said, “I don’t want to depress you, but I want to tell it to you straight.”
The most effective glue for bonding, our organisers said, was collaboration: we needed a goal we could all work towards. Our goal was to phase out the internal combustion engine in California by 2030. They gave us questionnaires so we could spend the next week testing the public’s receptivity to this idea. Here are some of the responses we got:
“What happens if the power goes out?”
“Where do the cars on the road go? Do we get a free car? What happens to the oil companies? Would you be punished for having a gas car?”
“Do I have to get rid of my brand-new car? How did we get into this mess? What can we do to ensure our children can understand so they know what is going on by the time they get through high school?”
“Why not just get everyone to stop eating meat instead? Agriculture creates as many greenhouse gases as automobiles. Haven’t you seen Cowspiracy?”
“There are so many other issues. Why electric cars? We need to change our habits! Our schools should feature human relationships and our relationship to the Earth. The 4 Rs: Reading, ’Riting, Rithmetic, Relationships.”
“Could I go to Nevada to buy a car?”
“Isn’t solar production toxic?”
“What will I do with my beloved van that carries all my stuff day after day?”
“Would there be violent, emotional reactions to such a ‘radical’ move? How do we deal with that reaction?”
“I like it. Get there!”
“Proud of you, Bill, for being involved. It’s inspiring.”
“I’m not driving an electric car! I’m allergic to electricity and smart-meter rays!”
“2030 may be too late to avoid some of the most catastrophic climate &amp; social issues.”
“We have such a gas + car culture. Why do we let high-schoolers drive to school? We need to change the consciousness. Only HS kids who work should have a car.”
I was surprised by the responses. To be honest, I thought people would be more excited about it.
Our climate change group provided a metastudy about the 97% scientific consensus on climate change. Because scientists never say that something is 100% true, and by nature, are often poor at communicating on an emotional level and tend to resist alarmist scenarios, the climate change deniers have been able to point to that 1-3% of doubt (97% is also the proportion of scientists who support the theory of plate tectonics).
We also learned that 61% of Americans say climate change is important to them, but rarely or never discuss it with people they know. Our homework was to become climate change evangelists for a month. To prepare, we discussed how to raise the topic with a stranger: “Sure is hot these days”, or “How often do you take the train? Trying to save on fossil fuels?” or “Do you ever remember it being 97 degrees in October?”
I decided, as an experiment in humiliation, to discuss climate change everywhere I went. The following are methods I do not recommend:
1. Bumping into someone’s shopping cart at the supermarket: “Oh, sorry, I was just so distracted thinking about climate change.”
2. After complaining to my boss about the measly salary I make as an adjunct professor: “I apologise for expressing myself in such a heated manner about how impossible it is to live on this salary. I was just really distressed thinking about climate disruption.”
3. During Hurricane Harvey, I was having dinner with my neighbour, whose car has bumper stickers that say things like “My other car is a broom” and “Never fear, the Goddess is here!” So it was unsurprising to hear her say: “This hurricane is Earth Mama expressing her anger at the patriarchy!”
“Actually,” I said, “I’m not sure if the hurricane has anything to do with the Earth getting angry. It might have more to do with greenhouses gases. I’m not saying that climate change is causing the hurricane. It acts more like a hormone, or an adverb, an intensification of the qualities already present. I’m afraid things are only going to get worse.”
4. I went to my friend’s Blade Runner party, which was filled with fortysomething guys who kept reciting all the lines and knew all the trivia answers. During the pee break, one guy started talking about how we’d all be wearing Google Glass in 10 years.
“If the Earth doesn’t burn up,” I added.
“Right!” someone interjected, and I thought we might be on our way to a useful discussion.
“This party just turned into a real downer,” someone else said, so we went back to the movie.
Oh, no, I thought. I’m turning into my dad. Over dinner, he often told stories about how the heartbeat of the ocean might stop, which would affect the wind and freeze parts of the midwest and Europe. For this reason I think of discussing climate change as a relaxing family activity. My father’s second wife, on the other hand, got so tired of hearing about global warming that she considered getting a “Stop global dooming” bumper sticker for her car. When my brother announced that his wife was pregnant, my dad told him he wouldn’t need a college fund since there wouldn’t be any college in the future. My brother, who was tenderly grilling ribs, threw down his barbecue fork and said: “For once I want to talk about life, and not always be focused on the end!”
After that, climate change became a forbidden topic on holidays. Now I was rediscovering what I had understood as a kid: people don’t respond well to threats, to cajoling, to end-of-the-world scenarios, to dystopian futures, to hopelessness.
But as I watched the news about Hurricane Harvey, I was astonished that not a single anchor mentioned climate change. Instead they blamed the flooding on Houston’s paved surfaces. According to George Marshall, those who don’t believe in climate change are less likely to believe in it after a climate disaster. Every single member of our group was confounded by this. “That makes no sense!” we said to one another.
If a person believes that weather fluctuates regardless of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, or that catastrophes represent some kind of punishment from God, confirmation bias will lead him to view the latest climate disaster as proof. And after a climate disaster, people feel a heightened sense of community; they don’t want to get into a politicised discussion with the neighbour who just saved their dog. Furthermore, Marshall writes, climate disasters operate according to the same psychological logic people develop when they get struck by lightning. They tend to believe they are statistically immune to it happening again, even as the actual odds remain the same. And if your house floods due to a changing climate, it is more likely it will flood again. If your house burns down, it is more likely it will burn again.
The night the fires started in northern California, my boyfriend and I had an argument. Afterward, he took out the garbage. “Come here,” he said when he opened the door. “Check out how hot it is outside.” A little while later, the wind started to sound like airplane engines. The following morning, my mom and my aunt both told me that they’d thought we were being attacked by North Korea.
On the evening of 8 October 2017, severe gusts of dry winds blew across desiccated grasses and diseased trees caused by years of excessive heat and drought. A great flood had fattened grasses into combustible fuel. The wind knocked down power lines, which lit the trees on fire. The firestorm destroyed a thousand homes in a single neighbourhood. Neighbours pounded on neighbours’ doors, honking horns, trying to rescue one another. It took hours to leave town. Most people reported that drivers were calm, though a few resorted to the sidewalk, the median, and the opposite side of the road. One woman managed to stuff her pony in the back seat of her Honda Accord. Another woman had to choose between saving her car or her horse. She jumped on her horse in her pyjamas and rode away from the flames. The fires burned for over a week, killed 44 people, and destroyed more than 10,000 structures and square miles of land. It was the most destructive outbreak of fires in California’s history.
During the fires I took walks, and I tried to read the paper falling from the sky. I wanted to collect the scattered notes, but they disintegrated when I picked them up, leaving the smell of poison on the tips of my fingers. The paper pieces lay curled like chocolate shavings. They were all the size of my palm. I was looking for stories, but I could only find information. Bible pages (sections from Genesis); phone bills; pieces of romance novels (so many of those); perfectly preserved letters so meticulously burned around the edges that they looked the way letters do when you burn them in fourth grade to make them look romantic; gold-embossed stationery with someone’s name written over and over in tiny letters at 45-degree angles; musical scores; Swedish package-tour vacation brochures; pieces of phone books (people still have phone books); a kid’s homework (he did poorly); journal pages (so many pages of people talking to themselves); as well as tar paper and bits of insulation burned until thin as paper.
I walked and walked and tried not to breathe. Why was the sky directly above me blue, while everywhere else it was gunmetal grey, and flickering with particulate matter? Everyone spoke of particulate matter. In the hardware store all you needed to say was “Where are they?” and they’d point you to the pile of N95 respirator masks. Someone passed me on the trail. I imagined he was judging me for not wearing a mask, but I couldn’t read his expression because he was wearing one. I looked at the dun, shoulder-high grass. That explosive fuel, the colour of pale grasshoppers, was all that stood between an out-of-control fire and me.
Outside the grocery store, the usual produce had been moved inside to avoid falling ash. Walking down an aisle, I heard a woman yelling into her phone: “Keep it watered down. Dammit! Keep watering it down!”
The news never reported where the active fire was. We only knew that it was completely uncontained, and that all effort was focused on rescuing people, evacuating the hospital, and getting elderly people out of their homes. All we could do was hope the winds wouldn’t change. I walked into the grasses to get away, to get away from the panic on people’s faces.
There was no digesting this fire. There was no beginning, middle or end. I couldn’t stop thinking about Sugarloaf Ridge State Park, which was now decimated. I hadn’t walked on Sugarloaf Ridge in years, but whenever I used the words “poison oak” or “gallop” or “fog”, my mind flashed femtosecond images of the park. Now it was ash. My old high school had burned down, as well as everything along the roads to get there.
Before the fires, I had been teaching a class on ecology. We were learning about systems theory and the interdependency of ecosystems, how trees communicate and send messages and medicines to other parts of the forest, and draw up water to share with other plants.
We learned how insects can digest the compounds in eucalyptus and create poop that inhibits the growth of encroaching plants such as mustard. This is probably one reason why the eucalyptus has been so successful as an invasive species here. But in the 1850s, when the government planted eucalyptus throughout California at maniacal speed because its fast-growing wood was essential for railroad ties and fence posts, it turned out that these trees – unlike old-growth eucalyptus groves in Australia – twisted when they dried and became so hard that they were no longer suitable for building. And now the volatile oils in their leaves turned out to be extremely combustible. In seasonably dry climates, native oaks are fire-resistant, but with the introduction of eucalyptus we introduced an extreme fire hazard. I stared at the eucalyptus twisting in the heat.
The weekend before the fires, I attended a grief workshop sponsored by the climate change group. They told us that grief processed on one’s own turns to despair, but grief processed communally becomes medicine. Our workshop leader suggested that the thing that will save us may be our own broken hearts, for true action can only come through these deeper feelings.
The night after the grief workshop I got into an argument with my boyfriend.
“You should get out of the Silicon Valley rat race and dedicate yourself to transitioning to a green economy,” I heard myself saying. “You’re a scientist. You can help develop technologies. This article says we have to treat climate change like we are fighting the second world war. For example, we have to start movements where everyone paints their roofs white to try to dissipate the heat before it reaches a rise of 1C. We have to cut carbon emissions now,” I said. “Here’s an article about what we can do to stay below a one-degree rise. There are solutions. If you were to really internalise that we are the first generation to see the effects of climate change and the last generation to be able to do anything about it, would you change your life?”
Even while I spoke, I could hear myself sounding like a maniac. I kept reminding myself that people don’t respond well to threats, to cajoling, to end-of-the-world scenarios. But I couldn’t help it. I was in a bad mood because it was so hot outside.
“Yes, it’s the right thing to do,” my boyfriend finally said, calmly. “But if it were really that bad, as bad as you say, don’t you think Google would be doing something about it?”
On the fourth night of the fires, the humidity plummeted again, and anxiety peaked. A dry wind was expected to blow almost as strongly as on the night the fires started.
I packed a suitcase full of clothes and looked around my room. Should I pack the vase I bought in Turkey? How about the old Soviet tourist books about Tbilisi? How was it possible to choose between items of sentimental value? Better to leave it all.
“At least we have the public pool across the street,” my mom said. We’d heard about the couple who took refuge in their neighbour’s pool while their own house burned. They stayed in the water for six hours, covering their faces with wet shirts whenever they had to come up to breathe. “How long does it take for a house to burn?” the woman had wondered underwater.
My sister-in-law called and said: “Remember how when your brother and I first got married and your dad was always talking about global warming? Turns out he was right!” My dad called: “I’ve been needing Ambien to sleep. I’ll forgo that tonight.”
The next day, having survived the night and craving fresh air, I drove to the ocean. I was searching for clean air, but smoke covered the soot-coloured sea all the way to the horizon. I could have felt guilty for driving a car with an internal combustion engine, but guilt goes on hold during fires. I sped on my way home, because the rule of law no longer applies during fires. This is the wildness that descends. This is the triggered reptilian brain. During the fires we craved sugar and fat and ordered pizza and didn’t mention that we usually never order pizza. During the fires my neighbour, the goddess, forgot she was gluten-intolerant. During the fires all I could think of was the word “holdfast”.
We made a plan. It seemed perfectly reasonable at the time. If the wind blew the fire this way, we would get in our cars and head to the ocean. If the fire kept following us, we would drive into the ocean.
A student of mine complained that he still had to work at the bank during the fires, since his branch was the only one open in the region. In one day customers deposited $600,000 in cash – a record – which they must have been keeping under their mattresses. My student said that all day his nerves were on edge because people kept walking into the bank wearing N95 masks. Later, the firemen told us that the masks don’t actually help much.
A friend who was evacuated said he grabbed his two dogs and two banjos and hustled into his car. Driving away, he realised he had forgotten to pack any clothes. During fires you hear, over and over, “I lost everything, but at least I have my life.” A couple of people, after losing everything, knocked on the door of a man whose house was for sale. They said: “We’ve lost everything. Can we buy your house and everything in it?” He left everything he owned to them, including his toaster and bath towels.
The songs on the local radio stations were especially upbeat during the fires. They interspersed Tom Petty’s I Won’t Back Down with quotes from locals who had lost their houses. “Fires are burning in eight California counties,” the news announcer said, with the Tom Petty beat in the background. A woman’s voice: “I came out to get my dog and looked down the ridge and saw a glow and I looked at the wind and I told my parents that they might want to pack up something just in case, and my mom said that the fire was already at the bottom of the hill … ”
No I won’t back down, no I won’t back down / You can stand me up at the gates of hell but I won’t back down …
Another woman: “I just want to thank all of you first responders. I love you all from the bottom of my heart. I thank you all for being there. For being away from your families, to help everyone else out there … ”
Hey baby, there ain’t no easy way out / Hey …
“We are Sonoma County strong … ”
I cried when the song came on, though I’d already heard it five times. I cried while driving, and when I saw the banners on every highway overpass: “Thanks, first responders.” “Thank you, firefighters.” Or the signs in front of the cafes: “Firefighters eat for free.” Even as the fire raged on.
All the Mexican restaurants were closed except one. I went in to get a burrito and found it full of evacuees. “Sure is busy here,” people kept saying. One man said to the cashier: “It’ll have to be bulldozed. Totally demolished. How was yours?”
“We’re OK.”
It was still hot: 35C (95F) in late October. We wondered if winter would ever come again. You can’t get into a pumpkin-carving mood when it’s so hot. On Halloween a few kids came looking for candy, but it seemed like everyone else went to the movies. The parking lot at the theatre was full. I had a dream that I had to evacuate, and the only thing I grabbed was the leftover bag of Halloween candy. I handed out Kit Kats to people as we ran from the fire.
After the fires, on Facebook people posted about the most random item they grabbed when they evacuated.
– daughter’s piggy bank with $2.35 in coins in it
– Grandmother’s Christmas cactus
– a wetsuit
– an avocado
– the cat-scratcher tree
– a Hermione wand
– the cookie cutters
– tarot cards
– all the beer
– kids’ pinewood derby trophies
– the sewing machine
– dog’s ashes
– the spice rack
– Norton Anthology of English Literature
– son’s Darth Vader alarm clock
– husband’s Hawaiian shirt collection
– jury duty notice for the next day
– the cat-litter box and all the cat litter
– combat-ready lightsabers
– a toothbrush (even though the man who grabbed this one was evacuating to a dentist’s office)
– a jar of Miracle Whip (because they were evacuating to a mayo-heavy household)
The fires didn’t discriminate between the houses of the rich and the poor. Everyone’s pearls melted, no matter how large. Nor did they discriminate between the houses of the “realists” and the “idealists”. After the fires, the realists wanted to rebuild as fast as possible with the same footprint. The original developers of Santa Rosa’s Coffey Park, which was destroyed by the fires, offered to use updated versions of their old floor plans in rebuilding efforts. Homeowners were upset to learn that they were now required to rebuild in adherence with the California green building standards code. They argued that they shouldn’t have to.
Before the fires, the builders who showed up to city council meetings were the same people every time – they all seemed to be on a first-name basis. But after the fires, something changed. People began presenting ideas to install rain-catchment and grey-water systems, community gardens and bike paths. They wanted to revamp the land-use laws, change the zoning for tiny houses, use fire-resistant straw-bale construction, and concrete and foam. The city council was inundated with people wanting to rebuild with green roofs and walls, to rebuild in a way that would promote bees and carbon-capturing methods, even permaculture methods and composting plants. City officials looked a little frightened as they listened to a large group of people talk about a town in Kansas that rebuilt with renewable energy after getting hit by a tornado. More than 600 people showed up for a breakfast sponsored by Daily Acts, an organisation that builds community by working with neighbourhoods to turn lawns into drought-tolerant gardens. A farmer who had lost his farm and all of his bees spoke at the podium: “Why can’t Sonoma County always be able to feed its poor?” My neighbours started talking about “agrihoods”, a new trend in which affluent, slow-foodie millennials move to neighbourhoods surrounding a farm, instead of to the golf-course communities of their parents’ generation. My dad even wrote an op-ed about it.

Sorry, I have no idea what that's supposed to mean - are you saying the green movement accepts renewables and nuclear and CCS - -which the IPCC and UNECE refer to as a critical technology? 
BQSTART
no. but they do accept the science- they just disagree with the policy of implementation.
BQENDDo they indeed -
Matt Ridley has a similar position on AGW - he generally accepts the science - but has decided to disregard the conclusion and insert one of his own.
I have yet to see any Green party/NGO policy comment on nuclear/and/or/CCS which wasn't dismissive, full of falsehoods, straight scare mongering - or a mix of all of them.

more of your FUD- and my comment- oxyburn is the process where coal is burnt in pure oxygen and considered the most viable method- of course 20% of the energy is used to distill oxygen from the air- with the nitrogen being dumped- leaving only CO2 [and other toxic particulates and gasses in the flue gas- this is then cooled and pumped underground. 
What did you imagine would happen in oxyburn?that the CO2 would be released into the air- not CCS.

What did you imagine would happen in oxyburn?that the CO2 would be released into the air- not CCS.
And that is the policy issue- coal is struggling anyway to make a profit- the industry has not invested in any sizeable CCS, has relied on either grants [which have produced the data required] or as a means for gas generation to produce CO2 as a product for enhanced oil recovery- to produce more oil and not to sequester CO2 [as it will come out with the oil and gas].Any CCS will mean 20% of the energy will be lost- and hence generation will be 20% more expensive excluding 
The scientific issue is how secure old gas wells are for storage over centuries- meaning the exercise could be pointless.
So it is expensive, wasteful, requires an old dirty industry to be propped up- ensures that energy policy has another 50 years of investment and commitment.
That is for coal- gas however could be reduced to hydrogen with the CO2 separated in the normal industrial process- and then disposed of in old gas wells for which existing infrastructure .So I wonder if hydrogen becomes a major transport fuel especially for goods transport if Greenpeace will take the same stance.

Shame on you for repeating such lies. Prof. Happer asked the fake client (the Greenpeace scammers) to donate his fee to one of his favorite charities: The CO2 Coalition, an outstanding 501(c)(3) science education charity.
Rather than admit that someone they disagree with is a kind and generous man, Greenpeace fabricated a slanderous lie about him. The Greenpeace ""spin"" was that Prof. Happer wanted them to ""funnel"" his fee through the CO2 Coalition to ""hide"" it.
That spin was grotesquely dishonest. Happer didn't ""funnel"" anything ""through"" anyone. He very generously sought to donate the fee to which he was entitled, to that very worthy charity.
Prof. Happer does that sort of thing a lot. He donated also the honorariums he earned from TheBestSchools to charity (to the UNC Physics Dept., as it happens).
I encourage you to read that in-depth, on-line debate, between two leading climate alarmists on one side, and a leading climate realist (Prof. Happer) on the other:http://thebestschools.org/special/karoly-happer-dialogue-global-warming
Unlike Greenpeace, Prof. Happer never lied, and never did anything which was in the slightest bit shady unethical. On the contrary, his behavior is proof of his exemplary character and tremendous generosity -- just as their misbehavior is proof of the opposite.
When someone trashes a man of Prof. Happer's calibre with blatant, intentional, hateful lies, by claiming that his generous donations of his speaking fees to charities were money laundering, as Greenpeace and DeSmogBlog did, it infuriates me. Such behavior should cause anyone of good character to end his or her association with those despicable organizations.

Temperature and Growth: A Panel Analysis of the United States
BQSTART
Abstract We document that seasonal temperatures have significant and systematic effects on the U.S. economy, both at the aggregate level and across a wide cross-section of economic sectors. This effect is particularly strong for the summer: a 1oF increase in the average summer temperature is associated with a reduction in the annual growth rate of state-level output of 0.15 to 0.25 percentage points. We combine our estimates with projected increases in seasonal temperatures and find that rising temperatures could reduce U.S. economic growth by up to one-third over the next century.

BQEND
A clue for you: some of Russia isn't permafrost peat, in fact vast swathes of Russia aren't peat.
Australian soils are relatively infertile, yet Australia has been one of the world's major agricultural exporters. That peat is relatively infertile isn't that important, it can always be improved to some extent by1) hydraulic engineering to drain some of the swamps, and 2) soil improvement eg fertilisers
As for how this will lead to vast putative wealth, simple supply and demand should suffice: when the much of the rest of the world is too hot for agriculture, anye remaining tracts that aren't too hot become much more valuable.

BQEND
no and no- I have not been insisting on anything, purely on the facts that 'dangerous' can mean different things, GP using it is not unscientific although I agree it is deliberately vague. Is nuclear dangerous? yes, hence the need for extensive safety, and extremely complicated buildings to avoid failure, the need to keep the fuel well away from life, and the need to keep the spent fuel locked away.It is also a fact that in total less than a 1000 reactors have been built and operated over the last 70 years and 2 have had critical failures with several severe. If you want to look at broad statistics 1:500 is bad.Economically nuclear can be dangerous- the loss of land to contamination is long lasting.But so far it has been fairly benign to human fatalities.Greenpeace is simply spinning a fact, in the same way that fossil fuel companies overlook the death toll and instead point to poverty being alleviated by it.
it may not be the entire truth but it is not lying or anti science- when AGW denial operates it simply lies, as do the anti vaxers etc etc.
Forbes is the data source for renewable deaths per TWh, the deaths per TWh are only found there and compiled by the author. if you can point to a peer reviewed study that determines death rate per TWh for solar or wind then please present it- all the links posted in the article were for coal and other fossil fuels- and not like for like- how do you calculate the heat TWh of wood burning in Africa over history [undefined] and attribute a death rate- you can't and you can't then conflate it with electrical generation.it is plainly nonsense- written by a scientist make the nonsense even worse.

On the issues of positive feedbacks, they'll not lead to runaway warming because anthropogenic contribution will cease in the next couple of decades (that's what science does; it guides and informs real-world activity) and because the feedbacks are not sufficiently rapid.
At the moment, atmospheric CO2 is about that of the height of the Pliocene Epoch when sea levels were ~25 m higher than present, but the sea level rise to match the Pliocene will take of the order of centuries to a couple of millennia - and as ice melts it takes up heat anyway, so it'll limit warming.

This latter finding suggests that the divergence problem is not limited purely to tree-ring data, but instead may extend to other proxy records.

Many will be replaced with gas turbines and wind. Gas plants have a short life expectancy- just 20 years - so as a project that will take decades the challenge is achievable.
The UK has demonstrated that wind can generate 30% of electricity needs in just a couple of decades and this will be boosted to 50% by 2030 or so. Wind turbines and solar are made in factories and are erected and functioning in weeks.
It will be a process that will last years- perhaps to 2100 for last bit.hydro in the US is extremely important- and removal of dams is not going to be helpful- however many can be converted to pumped storage.
The first 805 is the easy bit- the last 20% in 2050 and beyond will be the tricky bit.
the US biggest issue is investing and upgrading the grid- it should have been done decades ago- but there has not been the political will.
Transport is the next big issue, but the speed of EV development is stunning. Battery prices fallng from over $1000 kwh to $200 in just a few years, and on course to be $100 kWh in 5 years. Range has increased as battery density has improved- the luxury SUV market - Jaguar, Tesla, Merc, Porche all offer or will offer 300 mile super fast charging.The prediction is most cars will be EV by 2030. The impact will be severe on oil producers- with choice in fuel oil cannot compete on price unless it is very cheap oil as produced in some of the Gulf. Peak oil has always depended on price of economic extraction- if transport switches then demand declines and only $30 oil can be economically extracted.
Buses, trucks, even farm tractors and construction equipment can be run on batteries- China has 1000s of buses that are cheaper than their diesel versions.
Rail is already electrified in many countries.
The last tricky bit is long distance HGV [with overhead lines being tested in Germany with batteries], hydrogen fuel etc- air transport and shipping. So again the 80% first part is not impossible and in current economic climate will happen because it fits the economics.
Heating a problem in the UK too- most is gas but this is not something that has been around for that long- many home in the UK were powered with coal only a few decades ago. Gas boilers again needs replacing every 25 years - commercial properties use heat pumps so the switch is possible, as is bio gas or wind or solar gas.
whether AGW was urgent or not the oil age has only a few decades at current consumption levels- it could be even shorter if US shale oil is not maintained at current 5 million barrels day. Technologically the transition is happening- wind is mass produced and unsubsidiesed in parts of the world as is solar- and we seem to be pursuing battery technology as a current fix- lithium ion battery production is undergoing a massive expansion- 600% growth in production and new factories over a 5 year period.

Simple....start first by reading this....
http://www.rff.org/blog/2018/decarbonization-it-ain-t-easy
Instead of alarmists touting supremely unrealistic policies, it's time for realistic conversations about how to create energy/decarbonisation policies that are reasonable, fair, economically and logistically possible. For example...it is impossible in the short run (a few decades) to convert entirely to renewable.....it just is. With that acknowledgment, policy makers must then leverage ALL possible options to realistically decarbonize, including nuclear. Many sectors of the debate are very apprehensive to nuclear. 
Speaking of sectors, I live in the northwest of the US. One group of environmentalists want to remove many hydro dams to allow salmon to return to their historical spawning grounds. Of course, something will have to make up the power generation difference left by the dams being removed....it would probably be fossil fuels if these dams are removed within the decade. 
Bottomline, different groups have different priorities. But for the climate extremists, speedy conversion to renewables is the only option.

Firstly you fail to evidence why we won’t get to 1000 ppm,
BQEND
I give a partial answer: anthropogenic addition to atmospheric CO2 will cease before 500 ppm CO2 because already-apparent damage will motivate people, particularly sea-level rise that will inexorably inundate most coastal infrastructure eg cities; I forgot to add that by mid-century climate science will be much better characterised than at present, and that non-fossil alternatives for power and transport will be far and away the cheaper choices, even without carbon pricing.
As for nature not getting the world to 1000 ppm CO2 (so-called runaway greenhouse) it's becoming apparent that permafrost isn't going to thaw and emit carbon at high enough rate, ocean isn't going to warm up quickly enough (huge thermal inertia; at present rate of earth system thermal accumulation Ref: PROGRESS ARTICLE ""An update on Earth's energy balance in light of the latest global observations"", Stephens et al, Nature Geoscience 5, 691–696 (2012) doi:10.1038/ngeo1580) to burp enough CO2 at high enough rate to photosynthetic carbon-fixing ... especially if a new generation of more enlightened humans think it's a Good Idea to encourage carbon drawdown.
This only leaves CO2 emissions from volcanic super-eruptions. While I can't rule that out, such eruptions are beyond the scope of the discussion since whether or not they occur is independent of human activity.
As for personal incredulity regarding nation states, I base that on the observation that people speak different langages and practice different religions, which most directly results in people marrying and creating families within their religious grouping. Since religion is still largely a matter of nation-building mythology (eg Judiasm and Israel, Shi'ism and Iran), so long as religion exists nation-states are going to exist.

they do not have suxh a large tower

For any passes by- the comparison is making a point about eating bacon- i.e excess is demonstrated to increase the likelihood of certain cancers. And for the contrarian argument of- smoking causes even more cancers.
What you are being very clumsy in doing is conflating an opposition to nuclear as an endorsement of coal.
You also conflate construction incidents- i.e the erection of wind turbines or solar panels but neglect to link to the number of industrial accidents in the mining, and construction and operation of plants.

So your initial point was 'if it settled why do they still study it?'Like gravity Newton's work was pretty good- and it is still used today but in many areas it stops working in the very small areas like nuclear and quantum levels and huge areas like the universe.
This is relevant for technology and human advancement- we cannot rely purely on Newton or Einstein - with Einstein we could not make GPS work.
AGW is settled- up to a point, i.e the present, although we do not have a full picture of everything such as what is happening on the ice shelfs of Antarctica - or how current changes effect forests or desertification.
Unusually for science the very unsexy, under funded task of replication is carried out a lot for AGW- the science is far more vigorous because the stakes are so high. Ironic that Mann hockey stick study way back 20 years ago has received so much attention in that unusually something like 24 [at last count] replication studies have happened since. And all of them come to a similar conclusion.In scientific terms historical proxy record showing recent and rapid warming is settled science.Likewise the other area of criticism by sceptics is global thermometer record - which again has been duplicated over and over again- the record of the last 200 years is settled science.
The unsettled bit is the future- hence the range of possible outcomes.
We could have cast iron prediction of the state of the planet in 50 years- however there is a variable - us. If we made a global effort to massively reduce CO2 then that would change the outcome.

Academics have suggested that people who tend to accept conspiracy theories also underplay or reject the science showing humans are causing rapid and dangerous climate change.
But a new study that tested this idea across 24 different countries found the link between so-called “conspiratorial ideation” and “climate scepticism” only really holds in the US.
University of Queensland psychology professor Matthew Hornsey and colleagues surveyed 5,300 people to test the link between climate “scepticism” and acceptance of four internationally propagated conspiracy theories around the assassination of President Kennedy, the 11 September terrorist attacks, the death of Princess Diana and the existence of a new world order.

Only in the US did the correlation fall outside the margin of error. This is perhaps not surprising, given the booming online conspiracy culture in the Trumpocene, with even would-be presidential science advisers hanging around with conspiracy theorists.
The study also tried to tease out the links between the rejection of human-caused climate change and the ideologies that people hold. 
It’s here that the study offers the greatest cause for hope, Hornsey says. He has developed a form of “jiujitsu” persuasion technique that he thinks might work.
There’s been a general acceptance that people who have broadly conservative or rightwing ideologies tend to rail against climate science because it rubs their worldview up the wrong way. That is, that tackling climate change will require broad interventions from governments.
But Hornsey’s study finds that “there is nothing inherent to conspiratorial ideation or conservative ideologies that predisposes people to reject climate science”.
Instead, it suggests vested interests have managed to reshape the conservative identity with “ignorance-building strategies” in two countries – the US and Australia.
Hornsey agreed to expand on the study by answering further questions by email. 
You found that in the US people’s climate “scepticism” was more aligned to a conservative worldview than any other country surveyed. Why do you think the US is in this position?
I think it’s a result of two things. First, a lot of the big business interests that are threatened by climate change are situated in the US. My overall argument is that there’s nothing inherent to political conservatism that makes people want to reject climate science.
Rather, the link between conservatism and climate scepticism only emerges in countries that are economically threatened by the notion of responding to climate change. When the vested interests are high (in terms of the fossil fuel industry, for example) then there is more of a motivation for big business to engage in an organised campaign of misinformation around climate change. These campaigns often develop as a collaboration between the fossil fuel industry and conservative thinktanks, media and politicians, and are designed to “coach” conservatives to believe that the climate science is not yet settled. From this perspective, conservatives don’t spontaneously feel the need to reject climate science; they only do so when they are taking their cues from conservative elites, and these cues only emerge when the economic stakes are high.
Second, America has an unusually intense brand of conservatism, one that has a particularly strong opposition to government interference in the free market. Climate science is a nightmare for these people, because in some ways it does imply a big-government response designed to regulate industry. 
What role do the views of high-profile politicians have in influencing voters to think about the issue in a certain way?
In the US people advertise their climate scepticism like they’re advertising their political gang colours
I think it plays a massive role. In many countries, climate scepticism is not part of the language of the conservative parties. But in Australia and America it is. So in those countries being a climate sceptic starts becoming part of the package of attitudes that you’re supposed to have if you’re a good conservative. The obvious example of this is in the US. Of the 17 candidates who campaigned to be the Republican nominee for the 2016 presidential campaign, the majority were climate change sceptics. So people’s sense of what it means to be a Republican in America has expanded to incorporate something that shouldn’t really be political, like climate science. There, people advertise their climate scepticism like they’re advertising their political gang colours. It’s not quite as bad here, but threatened to become like that during the [Tony] Abbott era.
Why do you think this has happened?
I think it’s all about vested interests. When the vested interests are high, the fossil fuel industry and conservative thinktanks, media and politicians collaborate in an organised campaign of misinformation. In my data, the link between conservatism and scepticism is really only obvious in countries with high per capita carbon emissions. If you think of per capita carbon emissions as a measure of how fossil fuel reliant a country is, then this makes sense. In countries with low fossil fuel reliance – where the vested interests are low – then there’s no need to kick off a campaign of misinformation, and no motivation to believe one either.
In the paper, you say “there is nothing inherent to conspiratorial ideation or conservative ideologies that predisposes people to reject climate science”. Can you clarify this? Doesn’t endorsement of small governments and low regulation actually predispose conservatives to engage in motivated reasoning to reject the science of climate change?
Yes, but most conservatives aren’t paying that much attention. I really think conservatives have to be trained and coached to pay attention, and to see the issue through the lens of their worldviews. In the 1980s you didn’t see conservatives get upset about governments shutting down CFCs to protect the ozone layer. Technically the issue was the same – government regulations curbing the freedom of industry – but because the vested interests were low there was no need for conservative elites to fight back.
What do you think it would take for the US and Australia to break the apparent link between conservative ideology and climate “scepticism”?
As the negative consequences of climate change become more severe and more immediate, I think the ideological element will fade away (although by then it’s likely to be too late, sadly). The other option is to use what I call “jiujitsu” persuasion techniques; to talk about climate mitigation in a way that aligns with people’s underlying ideologies rather than competing with them. There’s already evidence that if you frame climate change mitigation as something that’s sympathetic to free markets, or as a patriotic act designed to maintain energy security, or as a chance to generate green jobs, then conservatives are less likely to resist the science.

Aluminium is used to make cars, construction materials, industrial machinery, electrical products, drinks cans, foil packaging and much more. But its production relies on processes that have changed little since the 1880s when the first smelting processes were pioneered.
On Thursday the Canadian government and two of the world’s biggest aluminium producers, Alcoa and Rio Tinto, hailed a “breakthrough” technology that they said would remove carbon dioxide from the smelting process. Executives from the companies said it was “the most significant development in aluminium in a century”.
The companies said the change would reduce carbon dioxide production by 6.5bn tonnes a year in Canada alone, where it is first being rolled out. That is equivalent to taking about 1.8m vehicles off the road. The technology would also reduce operating costs by about 15%, the executives said.
Carole Ferguson, the head of investor research at the Carbon Disclosure Project, which rates businesses and sectors on their performance in reducing carbon, said: “This is very important. It is fantastic to have this technology that reduces carbon and eliminates it from the [smelting process].” 
However, she said aluminium production would still require large quantities of energy, and emissions from the production process were only a part of its overall carbon footprint. 
Smelting aluminium conventionally requires anodes made of carbon-rich material as carbon is a good conductor of electricity as well as being cheap and plentiful. They are used to release the metal from aluminium oxide. During the process the carbon anodes are destroyed, releasing carbon dioxide gas.
Alcoa and Rio Tinto’s new process involves the use of a proprietary material they invented and developed over a decade that can be used in place of carbon. When used in smelting, it releases oxygen instead.
The new process will not reduce the need for vast quantities of energy in the smelting process, but if it comes from renewable sources it will in effect mean the aluminium produced is carbon-free.
Aluminium production accounts for about 0.8% of global greenhouse gas emissions and demand is rising. But it is also a material at the core of plans to reduce emissions. For instance, aluminium cars are lighter than vehicles made from steel, requiring less fuel. Aluminium is also easy to recycle, giving it the potential to be a “green” resource.
Alcoa and Rio Tinto have formed a joint venture, Elysis, to exploit the new smelting material, which they said had been proven to work at industrial scale in plants. Investors in the $144m (£106m) project include the Canadian and Quebec governments, and Apple, which helped broker the deal between the rival aluminium companies and which intends to use the resulting product in its hardware.
Products using the new technology are not expected to become commercially available until about 2024. 
While most of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions come from energy production for electricity, transport, and heating and cooling, a sizeable chunk also comes from industrial processes, such as the production of plastics, petrochemicals and cement. But methods of reducing emissions from industrial processes have proved difficult to develop.
Researchers working on cement production, which emits carbon dioxide as calcium carbonate is broken down, have explored using graphene and other materials to reduce emissions.

In 2015 I met my partner Stephen who knew that the facts of climate change couldn’t be ignored. He took it upon himself to try to convince me. We started watching documentaries on the subject on Netflix. The first documentary that caught my attention was Cowspiracy directed by Kip Andersen and Keegan Kuhn. This documentary really hit home and I even wrote an essay on it. Then came What the Health by the same directors. After we watched the movie Stephen and I turned to an all plant-based diet. We have our ups and downs on staying true to our new lifestyle change, but we always keep in mind that for every burger we don’t eat that is 660 gallons of water that we are saving for others in need. I was lucky enough that Stephen took the time and saw that if I could see the issues I would see that the facts are true.
As a graduate student in the early 2000s, I did not really have an opinion on the matter but the debate raised my curiosity. So when some of the prominent sceptical websites made claims about some scientific papers, I searched for the papers online and checked for myself. It soon became quite obvious that the sceptic claims made no sense whatsoever. So I became politically active and I’ve now been active in the Finnish Green party for 10 years. 
Climate change seemed like a questionable thing to me at first and now it’s not. What made me change my mind is several news articles and blogs that I’ve read up on the internet as well as visits to museums and exhibitions. It was informative and introduced aspects such as rising temperatures, rising seas, extreme weather events and risks that we as a community face. I believe it will help people understand how serious the situation is and I would like to encourage the community to visit museums and learn about climate change. Given everything I have been told, my belief in climate change has gone from weak to very strong even if I still have many questions. After learning about how bad this can really get, it not only changed whether or not I believed in it, but also made me worry more and more. I now understand that I must try to do things that benefit the environment but at the same time I must also understand that I can’t save the world.
I was a teenager when President Ronald Reagan reassured us that global warming was all part of a natural, cyclical process - not dangerous and not caused by humans. Being a young, naive Republican, I believed him. When Al Gore’s documentary An inconvenient Truth came out in theatres, I would never have considered going to see it if I hadn’t become angry about Bush’s decision to invade Iraq and cynical about the Republicans’ lip service to Christian values. The movie was an eye-opener to say the least. Now I am a Green Party member, try to live a zero waste life, I’m nearly vegan and read up on climate change issues in the news on a regular basis. I agree 100% with Pope Francis’ encyclical on the environment that fighting climate change is a moral imperative for social justice and that it is a grave sin to be tyrants rather than stewards of the earth. 
I believe that the climate is changing, but I now think that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s view on the importance of CO2 is significantly overstated. I assumed that mainstream science was right and agree that burning fossil fuels is generally harmful and should be reduced if possible. However, after researching more about the factors effecting our climate I am of the opinion that other factors are more important than the IPCC stated factors. The sun and solar magnetic flux, plus the ocean currents are much more significant than stated by some scientist and the press. I also see significant data manipulation and misinformation (from both sides) so finding good independent sources of information is hard. I check published ‘hard data’ against obvious proxy data to see if it agrees, and too often it doesn’t. I think climate science has become political (understandable given the consequences) which means normal scientific debate is not happening as it should. 
I used to think climate change was a serious problem but now I think it has been overblown. As a research physicist I looked at research first hand and came to the conclusion that the modelling of climate is not particularly good. Catastrophic predictions are silly. Global warming is real but not as serious as portrayed in the press. The probable total effect on the climate due to people is nothing to worry about compared to other, far more urgent ecological or environmental concerns, such as land management, ocean management, invasive species etc. Also, regardless of the actual reality of catastrophic global warming the actual actions taken have been ridiculous, futile, expensive and have had no impact on CO2 production in any meaningful way. If predictions made in the 90s had been true, the only solution was to use the already developed, reliable, cheap nuclear power and to get India, China and African countries using it. Instead people are burning fuel.

The most common and significant GHG is actually water vapour NOT Co2
BQEND
You are correct that water vapour is the dominant GHG, but without CO2, the Earth would not be warm enough to have a water vapour greenhouse effect in the first place.
Water vapour cannot drive climate change, because any excess water vapour simply precipitates and quickly falls back to Earth. The atmosphere can only hold more water vapour if something else causes the temperature to rise first. Adding extra CO2 to the atmosphere does precisely that. 
CO2 thus acts as the main ""control knob"" of the greenhouse effect, with the consequent water vapour feedback serving as an ""amplifier"".

Yet you use similar arguments to creationists who try to argue away the reality of Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection.
To know for sure that understanding the reality of the world around us through scientific observations has its own intrinsic rewards and also enables us to better cope with that world, you first have to understand that world through scientific observation. How are you coping?
As with evolution producing the biodiversity past and present, there is ample evidence that increased atmospheric concentrations of CO2 as a result of net CO2 emissions has produced global warming and hence a difference to the climate and a sensible course of action to reduce CO2 emissions will in time allow a reduction in atmospheric CO2 and a consequent difference in the climate.', u'recommendation_count': u'11', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1526818114000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'12483673', u'in_reply_to': u'116008029', u'id': u'116021504', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Walsunda', u'text': u'""You put so much faith in truly tiny amounts of a trace gas being the cause 10k years ago in what was a truly huge change in the climate""

Peat has been used a a fossil fuel foe centuries but there are practical difficulties involved in cutting and drying mid-oceanic oozes that preclude its use as a fuel - but they're both fossil fuels. Burning is simply fast oxidation.

There are however 7.4 billion observers. Science is carried out by observers. Our understanding of science and objective reality (that which exists independently of us) is the sum of what is seen by a large number of observers. There is a greater reality that includes both objective and subjective reality which includes large and distant black holes and the reality of you and what you last ate. As you affect the world around you and are affected by the world around you, the distinction between objective and subjective reality is blurred to moot. That is a wonderful understanding of our existence.

Currently some Australian politicians are wanting taxpayers to provide a 100% subsidy to build new coal power plants. After all that was how the existing stock of coal fired power stations were built.
What subsidies go to windfarms and solar panels are certainly much less than 100%. In the case of windfarms they result in devices which supply the cheapest electricity at point of generation. In the case of rooftop solar panels they reduce the network charge which amounts to 54% of the retail price of electricity paid by consumers.

Climate change is a physical reality that we have produced and which we can correct. Tony's ex-Chief of Staff admitted that we had a price on carbon, not a carbon tax. Tony convinced some voters on the margins that they would have much cheaper electricity once what he called the ""carbon tax"" was removed. Once it was removed, with the cooperation of the Palmer United Party in the Senate, electricity price fell slightly for six months before rising even higher again as the network charge was increased. Under PUP pressure Tony agreed to retain the reimbursement of lower income voters until the next election.

Of course everyone,. including the Denial Industry and their shills, knows exactly what is meant by 'denier' or 'denialist'. It has long been part of the everyday vernacular.
Calling someone a denier is a simple statement of fact.
The word denier dates from the 15th century and simply means 'one who denies'.
""...Denialism is the employment of rhetorical tactics to give the appearance of argument or legitimate debate, when in actuality there is none. These false arguments are used when one has few or no facts to support one's viewpoint against a scientific consensus or against overwhelming evidence to the contrary.

That definition fits climate change deniers to an absolute 'T'. There is simply no other word in the English language that is more apt.
By attempting to inject doubt into the public discourse where there is none in the scientific community you are personally contributing to and partly responsible for the observed climate change and possibly future climate catastrophe.So pardon me if I couldn't care less how butt-hurt and sensitive you vile scum are. 
Deniers have no expertise.They are in conflict with the near unanimous consensus of research by thousands of professional climate scientists.The fossil fuel 'think tanks' are willing to risk the future of society and the biosphere by trying to convince the public that the consensus is inaccurate.These disgusting sociopaths will stand trial one day - the sooner the better.

The Senate committee inquiry into the implications of climate change for Australia’s national security recommended an increase in foreign aid to be dedicated to climate change mitigation and adaptation in the region, as well as a government white paper on climate security, Department of Defence emissions targets and a dedicated climate security post within the Department of Home Affairs.
The inquiry, which released its report on Thursday afternoon, heard that the security risk of climate change was not a possible future threat but one that endangers Australia and its region now. The Asia-Pacific was the region “most vulnerable” to the security and humanitarian impacts of climate change, the committee heard, and faced an “existential threat”.
An existential threat was defined as “one that threatens the premature extinction of Earth-originating intelligent life or the permanent and drastic destruction of its potential for desirable future development”.

The committee report said climate change threatened Australians’ health, and the viability of communities, businesses and the economy. Climate change was heightening the severity of natural hazards, increasing the spread of infectious diseases and increasing water insecurity, and threatening agriculture.
Sherri Goodman, a former US deputy undersecretary of defence in the Clinton administration and founder of the CNA Military Advisory Board, told the committee climate change was a “threat multiplier”, exacerbating existing conflicts over water and other resources, and that it posed “a direct threat to the national security of Australia”.
“The problem also is not a distant one in the future but it’s now. We are experiencing this in regular sunny-day flooding at military bases in the United States and in changes in the Arctic, forcing the first wave of displaced persons from villages in the Arctic.”
The Climate Council told the committee climate change was “already contributing to increases in the forced migration of people within and between nations, as well as playing a role in heightening social and political tensions, flowing onto conflict and violence”.
The Australian government has recognised the security implications posed by climate change. Its seventh national communication on climate change to the United Nations in December highlighted that Australia was “already experiencing the impacts of a changing climate, particularly changes associated with increases in temperature, the frequency and intensity of extreme heat events, extreme fire weather and drought”.
It noted “communities in the Torres Strait are already being impacted by rising sea levels and many of the region’s coral reefs have been severely impacted by increased sea surface temperatures”.
And the Department of Defence agreed climate change had the potential to worsen existing conflicts.
“When climate impacts are combined with ethnic or other social grievances, they can contribute to increased migration, internal instability or intrastate insurgencies, often over greater competition for natural resources. These developments may foster terrorism or cross-border conflict.”
The Senate committee heard that acute climate disruption – in particular long-running and severe droughts – exacerbated conflicts in Mali and Syria, contributing to the destabilisation of fragile states.
In Australia’s region, the Australian Council for International Development said: “For Pacific nations such as Tuvalu, Kiribati and Micronesia, climate change is already a genuine existential threat with the capacity to diminish their livelihoods and even erase their states’ territorial footprints.”
The Senate committee noted Australia does not have an overarching climate security strategy. 
Research Director for Breakthrough National Centre for Climate Restoration David Spratt said there was a disconnect between the evidence presented to the inquiry and the recommendations that emerged from it.
“Existential risk management requires brutally honest articulation of the risks, opportunities and the response time frame. At the moment we are knowingly locking in an existential disaster without being prepared to articulate that fact … at least this Senate inquiry report is significant for having broken the ice, but it should be so much more.”
Greens Senator Peter Whish-Wilson said the defence personnel who appeared before the committee “engaged deeply with climate change science and were in no doubt that a warming world is a more dangerous world”.
“What this inquiry has brought home to me is that when people choose to engage with the climate science, without any partisan or ideological blinkers, they quickly understand the seriousness of the challenge and decide to act. We have seen that the Australian Defence Force is changing how it does things because it is taking climate change seriously, but we have a government that is doing nothing to reduce emissions to actually reduce the threat of climate change itself.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/18/climate-change-an-existential-security-risk-to-australia-senate-inquiry-says

""Despite the large numbers of birds killed by cats in gardens, there is no clear scientific evidence that such mortality is causing bird populations to decline.

There is evidence that cats tend to take weak or sickly birds...It is likely that most of the birds killed by cats would have died anyway from other causes before the next breeding season, so cats are unlikely to have a major impact on populations...Those bird species which have undergone the most serious population declines in the UK (such as skylarks, tree sparrows and corn buntings) rarely encounter cats, so cats cannot be causing their declines""

Yes. Some of us jokingly refer to ""coal-powered cars"" but I am forced to admit that, to a small degree, electric is better in terms of pollution — largely because it transfers the pollution to a belching smokestack somewhere remote. 
It's just inconvenient; I don't have to plug in my gasoline monster each night. It goes 'way more than a few hundred miles (and few electrics can get even that far). I can refuel it anywhere in ten minutes versus special battery-recharge places where I spend hours watching my ... watch. And it doesn't need a $10,000 battery replacement after a few years (that battery being, itself, a very nasty environmental problem).
Make me a me an electric that can be recharged in ten minutes once or twice a month at any of tens of thousands of stations around the country, that can go 300 or more miles on a charge, that doesn't cost as much as my house, and that doesn't need an expensive rebuild at 50,000 miles — and I'm all in.

As to what we can do individually there are a great many things, preodmoninantly round our gardening habits and support for companies that produce food using fewer pesticides.
As a society there are a great many things - 
1. ban neonics (it cannot be stressed strongly enough how important this is) - it does seem to be the case that the EU are close to banning it
2. Stop building so many roads - habitat fragmentation is a death knell for wildlife, you can actually calculate pretty accurately how much each habitat 'downsizing' - for example if you drive a motorwa or bypass through the middle of half the woodland you don't just create a minor barrier you create two sperate woodlands exactly half the size of the previous one - you then get a pretty linear decline in species numbers and total biomass.
3. Shift to public transport - car usage (as well as needing more roads) increases nitrogen content near roads which causes homogenisation of plants (cow parlsely, nettles and brambles do well - other things such as poppies and other flowers that have evolved to do well in low nitrogen soils do worse) and this has a knock on effect on the diversity of species that can be supported.
4. More joined up planning - the ever increasing trend for these estates of 3/4/5 bedroom houses outside towns that have no amenities and no bus access is driving the eating up of habitat.
5. Stop paving over gardens (which I appreciate you might not have done!) but it's a real scourge!
6. Support (and government needs to fund) programmes to reduce invasive species, for insects things like rhododendron might seem good but they are hugely invasive and drive out pretty much all other plants (which leads to a reduction in insect biodveirsty)
7. Support local wildlife trusts - this one is important as wildlife trusts (when they can) buy new land to be protected (in Norfolk for example they bought Hickling broad about a year ago - it's the largest and most important broad for wildlife)', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1526925183000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'which', u'effect': u'homogenisation of plants'}, {u'cause': u'which', u'effect': u'a reduction in insect biodveirsty'}], u'author_id': u'12031469', u'in_reply_to': u'116068601', u'id': u'116069116', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Harvestingkarma', u'text': u'Governments may be career building and business building!

I have a nice pond which I counted 16 adult newts this spring, they laid a mass of newt spawn larger than a football. Its not got a lining and I think they have intentionally kicked up the silt for camouflage, I now occasionally see a baby newt come too the surface for air, it's lovely.

How to avert an insect Armageddon,article,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/shortcuts/2018/may/20/save-our-bugs-how-to-avert-an-insect-armageddon,0,"Already beset by degraded landscapes and a toxic environment, insects are going to suffer a catastrophic decline in numbers unless climate change is controlled, according to new research from the University of East Anglia. This is on top of the alarming collapse reported in Germany, where 75% of the flying insect biomass has vanished from protected areas in less than 30 years.
Insects are the backbone of a healthy ecosystem and the consequences of their absence will be global. Is there anything we can do other than despair? Insects will need stepping stones to move around the country as the climate changes. Here are some ways you can help.
If you have a garden, make it part of the solution. Insects need food and we have destroyed 97% of our wildlflower meadows. The charity Buglife has a great guide that shows which plants help which insects: winter flowers such as hellebore, erica and mahonia for pollinators such as bees; evergreen shrubs and climbers for bugs such as woodlice and spiders.
Insects need water – make sure you have some in your garden. Watching bees drink at the bird bath is fun; better still is watching dragonflies emerge from your wildlife pond.
Look beyond your own patch and lobby your council to turn verges into highways for insects. Plants help insects, which help mammals, bats, amphibians, reptiles and birds to thrive. We need to fix the system, not just an isolated component.
B-Lines, a series of insect pathways running through the countryside, are the best way to help on a national scale. You can help by writing to your MP and asking them to support Ben Bradley’s Protection for Pollinators bill. The “B-Line bill” will make the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs take this innovative landscape ecological solution seriously. It passed the first stage of the process through parliament unopposed.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/shortcuts/2018/may/20/save-our-bugs-how-to-avert-an-insect-armageddon

The Israeli academic, whose first book, Sapiens, became a surprise publishing sensation by charting the rise of the human species, turns his attention to current affairs for the first time with a swipe at what he argues is a short-sighted response to global challenges in countries such as the UK, US, Russia and Israel.
“Brexit may well initiate the simultaneous unravelling of both the UK and the EU. But in the long run, history’s direction is clear cut,” he writes. “In recent generations the few remaining civilisations have been blending into a single global civilisation.”
The new book, 21 lessons for the 21st Century, is published in August and comes amid a period of unprecedented introspection in British politics over how to leave the European Union. Yet Harari argues the coming challenges of global warming, technological disruption and nuclear proliferation will make us “ever more interdependent” and in need of cooperative projects such as the EU.
“In a different century and different situation, I don’t think there is anything necessarily wrong about Brexit,” he added in an interview. “If you want to be a completely independent country and not part of a bigger organisation, then fine. The problem is that given the kind of challenges we face today, the opportunity costs of being very self absorbed are becoming higher and higher all the time.”
The thesis may infuriate Brexit supporters who regard it as a way for Britain to look out to the world more, but Harari also has words of criticism for liberals who regard the EU referendum as a catastrophe.
“Like a person imagining that a bad headache signifies a terminal brain tumour, many liberals fear that Brexit and the rise of Donald Trump portend the end of human civilisation,” he writes. “The first step is to tone down the prophecies of gloom and switch from panic mode to bewilderment … more humble, and therefore more clear-sighted.”
He also claims it is not inevitable that humanity will learn to collaborate more, warning of a possible “unravelling” of the EU in the wake of Brexit – with worrying implications.
“If the European project fails … it would indicate that belief in the liberal values of freedom and tolerance is not enough to resolve the cultural conflicts of the world,” writes Harari. “If Greeks and Germans cannot agree on a common destiny, and if 500 million affluent Europeans cannot absorb a few million impoverished refugees, what chances do humans have of overcoming the far deeper conflicts that beset our global civilisation?”
“Let’s say the rise of artificial intelligence completely disrupts the global job market, this will create far far bigger social and economic challenges than the immigration of a few million people to the EU or some workers from Poland and Romania to the UK,” he added.
Harari, who lectures at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, was also critical of Israeli nationalism in the wake of the killing of Palestinian protesters last week.
“If every nation thinks about itself, then who is thinking about the global problems?” he said. “I don’t see Israel making any significant contribution to confronting the main challenges of humankind.”
But the book singles out the EU as a model for how national interests can be balanced and what is at stake if it fails.
“After centuries of terrible bloodshed, French, Germans, Italians and Britons have finally built a mechanism that ensures continental harmony – only to have the British public throw a spanner into the miracle machine,” writes Harari.
“We have a global ecology, a global economy and a global science – but we are still stuck with only national politics,” he adds. “To have effective politics we must either deglobalise the ecology, the economy or the march of science – or we must globalise our politics.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/may/21/yuval-noah-harari-brexit-will-not-halt-drive-to-human-unification

Fact is for them, is that it was science that identified all these natural cycles (from AMO to glacials) - and it was science that identified the warming properties of CO2. Surprisingly often in reverse and mixed order. 
I think the latter mess with their thought process (that seems to be very linear, maybe from how school pedagoics work). 
It is if they got a glimpse of Popper at some social science of science class, and think that Poppers critical rationalism is a descriptive theory and the fact that properties of CO2 being discovered before Newtonian motion of our planet was nailed, somehow break science. 
The good trend is that the pletoria of ""alternative theories"" are heavily reduced, though. 
We have been in the age or sun-spots. We have been in the age of ocean outgassing. We have been through the age of cosmic rays and even the odd ""pole-switch"" theory. 
Sure - there are still some stuck in the 80s, when hemispheric analysis put a huge damper on the local analysis of UK grape harvests during the medieval. 
But in general, it is now more about misunderstanding of science instead of made up science. 
These days, the argument seems to gravitate towards vulcanos under Antarctica a lot. Gone are the days when volcanoes were wrongly argued to be the source of CO2. There is a new kid in town - they melt Anarctica from below. 
This is of course correct. This planet has geothermal heat. It is important. Lake Vostok is not exactly new. But in terms of causality for observed AGW it is down the list with solar activity, orbital configuration and similar information discovered and brought to attention by - hey - science. 
The only non-scientific argument that lives happily these days is the global conspiracy theory of science (but strangely not for companies that has own value vested).

Following on from my comment above WRT proof, what science does do is rely on Coherence, Consilience and Consensus.
AGW is a Coherent theory, the specific issue of it strengthening the intensity of storms is Coherent based on basic Physics. It enjoys Consilience of Evidence(TM) from multiple disciples (meteorology, oceanography, physics etc), and thus enjoys Consensus amongst the scientific community.
If you have Evidence(TM) to the contrary, from actual practicing scientists, then you should be capable of providing such Evidence(TM).

It was a truly awesome display of the power of weather and the country is still reeling from the effects. In the climate community, there has been years of research into the effect that human-caused global warming has on these storms – both their frequency and their power. 
The prevailing view is that in a warming world, there will likely be fewer such storms, but the storms that form will be more severe. Some research, however, concludes that there will be both more storms and more severe ones. More generally, because there is more heat, there is more activity, which can be manifested in several ways.
Regardless, there is very little doubt that a warmer planet can create more powerful storms. The reason is that hurricanes feed off of warmer ocean water. In order to form these storms, oceans have to be above about 26°C (about 80°F). With waters that hot, and with strong winds, there is a rapid evaporation of moisture from the ocean. The resulting water vapor enters into the storm, providing the energy to power the storm as the water vapor condenses and falls out of the storm as rain.
As a large hurricane passes over warm water, it sucks in heat not only from the top layer of water but also from quite deep in the ocean, at least 160 meters (approximately 525 feet) or more. The main way heat is pulled out of the ocean is through the aforementioned evaporation process. There are also smaller effects from mixing the ocean waters and blocking sunlight to the ocean. Basically, when a hurricane passes over warm waters, the ocean “sweats” and cools off – a process enabled by the strong winds. The image below shows this evaporation and condensation process.
A very recent publication in the journal Earth’s Future studied the impact of hurricanes on warm oceans in order to understand how warm waters fuel the storms and also how storms affect the water temperatures. With Hurricane Harvey, a near perfect natural laboratory was available in the Gulf of Mexico. Temperature measurements are plentiful there and the scientists were able to measure the total ocean heat content in the upper 160 meters just before Hurricane Harvey passed and compare the heat measured after the storm. 
What they found was very interesting. As seen in the image below, before the storm (top frame), the ocean heat content was very high (red colors). After the hurricane passed (bottom frame), the waters were notably cooler. 
The scientists calculated that the waters lost approximately 6 x 1020 Joules of heat because of Harvey. That’s about 10 million times as much energy as the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Then the scientists used rainfall data and calculated how much heat fell in the form of rain. The results were a nearly perfect match with the energy taken up by the storm. That is, they were able to balance the energy and water flows into and out of the storm to a very high level of accuracy.
With the passage of the hurricane and the “cold wake,” it made the scientists consider how future storms would be impacted. That is, any storms following Harvey would pass over a cooler ocean and should not be as intense as Harvey was. 
The researchers discovered that the so-called “cold wake” was still hot enough to fuel future storms. The surface temperatures were reduced by about 2°C (3°F), but remained above the threshold needed to fuel hurricanes. The reason why the waters remained hot was that the temperatures before Harvey were off-the-charts hot because of human warming. Just before Harvey, ocean waters both globally and in the Gulf of Mexico were at record temperatures.
So, what does this all mean? First of all, the balancing of energy flow into and out of a hurricane is a tremendous accomplishment and it validates much of what is understood about these storms. Secondly, this study shows that storms can become more violent in a warming world. Not only that, but there is the potential of getting very active seasons, as occurred in 2017. All of this is related to the high water temperatures not only at the ocean surface but also deep beneath the surface.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/may/23/global-warming-made-hurricane-harvey-more-destructive

 The recommendation is in a review of the $2.55bn emissions reduction fund, the central plank of Direct Action, which pays landowners and companies to avoid emissions or sequester carbon dioxide in plants at the lowest cost. The fund is supposed to support projects that would reduce Australia’s carbon pollution below what it would otherwise have been.
 But the Emissions Reduction Assurance Committee found one type of project – existing landfill sites that capture methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from decomposing rubbish and burn it to generate energy – already make enough money from the sale of electricity and renewable energy certificates to cover their costs and were mostly likely to continue without taxpayer support. The report was published online in late March. 
 It follows long-standing criticism that the emissions reduction fund is in some cases not delivering the cuts the government has promised. Critics say under the current design it is creating “junk” carbon credits that do not represent actual reductions, but are used by industry and government to offset emissions. 
 The committee recommended that no electricity generating landfill gas projects currently receiving carbon credits be given extensions when agreements lapse. Most existing contracts run to 2021 or longer. 
The University of Melbourne legal academic Tim Baxter, who has published peer-reviewed research revealing flaws in the fund, said the change was long overdue.
 He said several analyses had suggested many of the emissions reductions paid for from the fund were not genuine as they would have happened without spending more than $2bn of taxpayers’ money. Landfill gas was probably the worst example, he said.
 “There is no way that 191m tonnes of abatement is being kept in the ground or sequestered (as the government has claimed),” Baxter said. “Based on the design and accounting, we are either counting abatement that they were already doing or we’re counting emissions they were not going to be released anyway.”
The emissions reduction fund is the only policy the Coalition has legislated to cut emissions. It was hastily devised by then opposition environment spokesman Greg Hunt after Tony Abbott took the Liberal leadership in December 2009 promising to oppose carbon pricing, and introduced in 2014.
 Landfill gas projects have long been controversial inclusions in the Direct Action scheme, largely because about three-quarters of them were already operating before the emissions reduction fund was created in 2014.
 Half of the projects received payments under the defunct New South Wales greenhouse gas reduction scheme (the world’s first mandatory emissions scheme) or the federal greenhouse friendly offsets program that shut in 2010. Labor and the Greens offered continued support by including them in the Carbon Farming Initiative set up in 2011. The Coalition extended it further by including them in the list of projects that could win funding under Direct Action.
 All parties received departmental or agency advice that they may be crediting projects that were likely to happen anyway, and therefore not cutting emissions below what they otherwise would have been. 
 Baxter said it was a transparent case of political expediency overruling good policy.
 “For the sake of being able to say ‘our scheme per tonne of emissions is cheaper than the previous government’s scheme’ you’re seeing essentially junk credits being created,” he said.
 “These projects are allowed into the fund to make the price cheaper based on a spurious argument that if we don’t provide credits that these worthwhile landfill gas projects would close. There is no evidence that any of these projects were at or near closure.”
 Iain Macgill, from the University of NSW’s Centre for Energy and Environmental Markets, welcomed the committee’s recommendation but said the evidence that landfill gas should be excluded was not new, and suggested it should be extended to cover other projects that just flared methane emissions but did not generate electricity. “Why has it taken so long to address?” he said.
 Macgill said emissions from landfills needed to be cut but policy efforts would be better focused on reducing the proportion of waste being dumped.
Environment minister Josh Frydenberg did not directly respond to questions about whether he would accept the committee’s recommendation. He said a departmental review of climate policies last year confirmed Australia had a comprehensive set of emission reduction policies and the emissions reduction fund was internationally recognised as one of the world’s largest domestic carbon offset markets.
 Emissions from waste increased 1% last year, part of an overall increase in national emissions of 1.5%.
 Under Labor and the Greens, the credits would have been paid for by businesses offsetting their emissions. Under Direct Action, their main source of income to date is public money.
 The government has 87 existing emissions contracts with landfill gas projects, promised to prevent about 20m tonnes of emissions – about 4% of what Australia emits each year. Assuming landfill operators are paid the average price of $11.90 per tonne of carbon dioxide, they would be getting $243m worth of carbon credits from taxpayers.
 This is likely to be an overestimate. The emissions reduction fund works as a reverse auction – the lowest credible bids win government contracts. Given they have existing revenue streams for their electricity, landfill operators could bid in at a price less than the average. Some estimates suggest they may be paid about half the average price.
 About half of the promised emissions cuts are contracted with one company, Adelaide-based LMS Energy. The rest are spread across several companies and councils. They included energy giants AGL and EnergyAustralia, though AGL sold its landfill gas generation assets last month. LMS Energy declined to comment on the proposed changes.
 In a research paper with Dr George Gilligan published in the Australian Journal of Environmental Law in December, Baxter found the emissions reduction fund had been set up to include landfill gas projects even though they should not qualify based on three tests built into the legislation to ensure all projects were “additional” – that they are delivering carbon abatement that would not happened anyway. 
 In simple terms, the three tests are that each project must be new, not have access to other government funding and not be required by other laws or regulations.
 For landfill gas, Baxter said the last two tests were overruled by a declaration that being a methane-capture-and-combustion project alone was enough to qualify, regardless of other circumstances. The “newness” test has been overridden by ministerial decision.
 “Two of the three tests are replaced with a statement that ‘a landfill gas operator is a landfill gas operator’. It’s just nuts,” Baxter said. “It is legal because it is built into the act, but it is of questionable morality. It is a neutering of the letter of the law and the spirit of the law.”
 The independent expert review comes as the Clean Energy Regulator, the government agency that runs the emissions reduction fund, prepares for its seventh auction on 6 and 7 June. To date, $2.285bn has been contracted, leaving $265m to spend.
The Clean Energy Regulator chairman, David Parker, told a Senate estimates hearing last week that he expected contracts worth between $50m and $100m would be signed in June.

Nope. I am making a case why working people want to continue working in unsustainable industries, and hence why they feel threatened by the notion of climate change. Workers wanting to continue in a job is not an economic necessity.

Your first attempt to explain this phenomenon was a psychological one (hence the fight and flight references).

These are political matters and subject to ideology and propaganda. Anyone who watches a Murdoch news source for any length of time will adopt the perceived threats that that source supplies. This includes scapegoats, foreigners and jobstealers and you name it. It is hardly any wonder that people believe such hoodoo devil dolls that are shaken before them daily.

... as NASA’s Dr Gavin Schmidt has pointed out, the IPCC’s implied best guess was that humans were responsible for around 110% of observed warming (ranging from 72% to 146%), with natural factors in isolation leading to a slight cooling over the past 50 years. 
Similarly, the recent US fourth national climate assessment* found that between 93% to 123% of observed 1951-2010 warming was due to human activities.
These conclusions have led to some confusion as to how more than 100% of observed warming could be attributable to human activity. A human contribution of greater than 100% is possible because natural climate change associated with volcanoes and solar activity would most likely have resulted in a slight cooling over the past 50 years, offsetting some of the warming associated with human activities.

Evidence for your assertion that scientists believe humans are only contributory to climate change please?
BQEND
It depends which definition of the phrase ""climate change"" they use by default in their research.
From the IPCC's AR5 ""Annex III : Glossary"" :
BQSTART
Climate change : Climate change refers to a change in the state of the climate that can be identified (e.g., by using statistical tests) by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties, and that persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer. Climate change may be due to natural internal processes or external forcings such as modulations of the solar cycles, volcanic eruptions and persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere or in land use. 
Note that the Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in its Article 1, defines climate change as: ‘a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods’. The UNFCCC thus makes a distinction between climate change attributable to human activities altering the atmospheric composition, and climate variability attributable to natural causes.
BQEND
Any scientists using the UNFCCC definitions will distinguish between ""(100% anthropogenic) climate change"" and ""(100% natural) climate variability"".
People like myself (and the OP if I'm not mistaken ...) who prefer the IPCC definition will be confused for a few seconds (at least) if the term ""climate change"" is used in the UNFCCC manner without clarification.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1527960134000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'natural internal processes or external forcings such as modulations of the solar cycles', u'effect': u'climate change may be'}], u'author_id': u'3985037', u'in_reply_to': u'116495029', u'id': u'116523937', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'sophiia2222', u'text': u'Welcome.

Now, why this to us amazingly strong thing is such a weak force (we are talking about the force that lock us to the ground and bind galaxies together), still being so weak that I can use the force of capillary effect to lift water up against the entire mass of our planet pulling it down. 
Similar, there is zero question about principles of AGW. Doubling of CO2 gives a one degree direct effect, 2-5 degrees with feedbacks. 
If it is 2 or 5 degrees in an open feedback system is a range largely representing the complexity of the open system peaking by both historical and different theoretical considerations to land around 3 degrees. 
To use cosmology as an example is a bit like biting yourself in the foot. Those guys are applying philosophy of mathematics to probe what is possible to make sense of. It is pure theory - and in terms of standard science, they do have a problem because many of these theories struggle giving measurable hypotsis for testing. 
Climate science does not rewrite fundamental physics. It is all applied classic theory (with a bit of quantum physics and relativity thrown in). 
Remember - high-end satellites use applied science to record how fast oxygen atoms vibrate at some optical depth in the atmosphere. Classic science - transfered back to degrees Kelvin. 
US secret labs did huge amount of science on how CO2 and water blocks heat post Ww2 - because they designed heat-seeking missiles. 
Black body calculations are important for many things. If you treat Earth as a black body object you quickly realise that it would be quite chilly here. The greenhouse effect is a pretty big thing. 
And the fact is that we knew this a long time before we even discovered that black holes could exist in theory. The theory of AGW is not resting on the potential information paradox of black holes. 
Remember - Newtonian physics still works fine even though it was puzzled together centuries before anyone started pondering new data suggesting that the entire universe is expanding instead of being steady state. 
The rather fun (and surpringly accurate) game of ""Kerbal"" allows us to play around with the same physics NASA used for suborbital, orbital and extraorbital physics. It is not like the international space station instantly fell to the ground after Hawkins shared doubts about our understanding of deep cosmology. 
It is similar with AGW physics. A lot of physics is sand-boxed - because of scale. If Higgs had not been discovered, it would not have changed the effect of mass we live with.

Dissent? Good heavens, cant have that. Let assassinate the authors.
BQENDThat's the kind of paranoia that comes from reading too many conspiracy blogs. Here is an article about that study with a quote from the lead author...

BQSTART
About 300 years ago the water reached its coolest point. From about 1950 onwards the water warmed very rapidly. Over the last 60 years, these middle depths of the Pacific warmed by 0.18 degrees Celsius – a rate of warming 15 times faster than anything seen over the last 10 millenia. 
Lead author of the study, Yair Rosenthal, told us this rapid rate of change is another piece of evidence showing that current climate change is unusual:
“This seemingly small increase occurred an order of magnitude faster than suggested by the gradual change during the last 10,000 years thereby providing another indication for global warming.”
The recent warming adds to the idea that oceans are taking up much of the extra heat trapped as a result of human activities. In its major review of climate science last month, the IPCC concluded that the oceans had absorbed more than 90 per cent of the heat trapped by human activities since the 1970s.https://www.carbonbrief.org/10000-year-record-shows-pacific-depths-warming-fast

I’ve never seen scientists in this field use consensus to refute other theories expressed in published research. Consensus comes in at a different level: when a reporter, blogger or commenter on this board decides on a different interpretation of the facts or invents a pet theory out of fresh air it is entirely legitimate to point out that the overwhelming majority of people working in the field disagree and so the reporter, to be taken seriously, needs to go out and do that research themselves.

MacLeod says it's notable that the impact pumped up carbon dioxide over a short time span that, geologically speaking, is comparable to what humans have been doing in burning fossil fuels since the start of the Industrial Revolution.
""The atmosphere was loaded for a very brief interval of time, and the consequences of that change in atmospheric composition lasted for 100,000 years,"" MacLeod says.

IMO, the position that all (or more than all) the warming we observe is caused by human activity is at least an arguable position, and has some serious support.
BQENDThe IPCC synthesis report is the summation of literally thousands of reports.
The RS report adds to this - it does not contradict the IPCCs conclusion and whilst it is tempting to read between the lines I believe that it is important to remember that these reports are very carefully drafted - they are intended to describe our current scientific understanding in accessible language and as such they are absolutely not meant to be re-interpreted to conform to a more emphatic message.
This changes nothing - AGW is still as real as ever and the science is now irrefutable - but I think that makes all the more important that we accept the science as it is presented to us without any of the exaggeration or undue emphasis that, no matter how well intended, a number of people wish to apply to it.
If we exaggerate or are overly dogmatic then we give a handle for the AGW contrarians to pull on and cry foul.

The memo presented three options without endorsing any of them: conducting a “red team/blue team” exercise to “highlight uncertainties in climate science”; more formally reviewing the science under the Administrative Procedure Act; or deciding to just “ignore, and not seek to characterize or question, the science being conducted by Federal agencies and outside entities.”
In short, the White House considered ‘debating’ established climate science, casting doubt on scientists’ conclusions, or just ignoring them. Accepting and/or acting on the findings of the scientific experts is not an option they’re willing to consider.
So according to this memo, the administration considered 3 options--(1) framing reality as being up for debate; (2) developing their own view of reality; or (3) ignoring reality--and went with option 3.Interesting that ""accepting reality"" was not an option. https://t.co/ejqBOEa0B0
Meanwhile, a paper published in Nature last week concluded that limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial temperatures would save more than $20tn as compared to a temperature of 2°C. The carbon pollution cuts needed to achieve the 1.5°C target would cost about $300bn more than efforts to meet 2°C. In other words, the economic benefits of the more aggressive target would outweigh its costs by a factor of about 70-to-1.
Current international climate policies will only limit global warming to about 3–3.5°C global warming, and America’s policies are “critically insufficient” to meet either the 2°C or 1.5°C targets. Under the Trump administration, the US has no plans to try and cut its carbon pollution, and in fact the administration has been taking every possible step to undo established climate policies and increase pollution from the coal and oil industries, even though global warming will especially hurt Trump country.
Basically, taking aggressive action to curb global warming would save the world a lot of money, and it would especially benefit the economies in southern, conservative states. But it wouldn’t be good for the fossil fuel industry, and the Trump administration has prioritized short-term corporate profits above all else, including American welfare and lives.
There’s a 97% expert consensus that humans are causing global warming, and the scientific research is clear that the consequences of continued rapid climate change could be devastating for the economy and for all species on Earth.
The case for the Trump administration approach – ignoring and casting doubt on the conclusions of climate science experts – is that of a bad gambler. It’s not a 100% consensus; maybe the less than 3% of climate contrarians are onto something. Perhaps the experts are wrong and climate change won’t be so bad.
If the stakes were something inconsequential like a Trump steak, that would be fine, but it should go without saying that betting the future of humanity and life on Earth on a less than 3% long shot is a bad idea. The stakes could not be higher. Prudent risk management dictates that we should be taking serious steps to mitigate the chances of such a disastrous outcome. That’s why Americans buy home and auto and health insurance. It’s why fewer than 17% of Americans today are smokers, down from 42% in 1965.
Not only is global warming denial terrible policy, but it’s bad for the long-term health of the Republican Party. There’s a climate change generation gap – most young Americans realize that humans are causing global warming, and young conservatives want their leaders to do something about it. Climate change impacts will only become more severe over time, and today’s youth know that they’ll have to live with the consequences of our actions today. They simply can’t afford denial, and the GOP risks losing these voters forever by willfully ignoring the problem that poses an existential threat to young Americans.
There are a few glimmers of hope in the party. Trump’s new Nasa administrator now accepts climate science. Eight House Republicans signed a letter to leaders of the Appropriations Committee urging them to reject any provisions in the 2019 spending bill that would undermine efforts to combat climate change. The conservative Climate Leadership Council proposed a free market, small government, revenue-neutral carbon tax ready to go as soon as the GOP can elect a leadership that’s willing to make a great climate change deal.
But right now the GOP is still stuck being, as Governor Bobby Jindal (R-LA) described it five years ago, “the stupid party.” Its leadership won’t even consider the possibility that 97% of climate science experts are right. That denial is going to be very expensive, and as Americans increasingly accept the realities of climate change, it will also land the GOP on the endangered species list.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/may/29/trump-administration-refuses-to-consider-that-97-of-climate-scientists-could-be-right

Laura Tenenbaum, a former science communicator for Nasa, said she was warned off using the term “global warming” on social media and restricted in speaking to the media due to her focus on climate change.
“Nasa’s talking point is that it’s business as usual, but that’s not true,” said Tenenbaum, who departed Nasa in October after a decade at the space agency. 
“They have stopped promoting or emphasizing climate science communication, they have minimized it. People inside the agency are concerned Trump will cut climate science funding. There is a fear and anxiety there and the outcome has been chaos.”
Tenenbaum said that around a month after Trump’s inauguration last year an “arduous review process” was put in place over every blog post, Facebook post and tweet that she put out from Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California.
“I was told verbally by media relations it was because with Trump as president, climate change is now a sensitive subject,” she said. “There was confusion about what to do now we have a president who doesn’t believe in climate change. Everyone was scrambling. It was chaos.” 
Planned blogposts on coal plants being turned into solar plants, “reasons to be positive about Nasa” and an interview with Gavin Schmidt, a senior Nasa climate scientist, were all either halted or scrapped due to interference from career staff nervous about provoking the new administration, according to Tenenbaum.
Figures show there has been a notable decline in Nasa’s output of climate information since the election of the Trump administration. During 2016, Nasa posted frequently on its climate change Facebook page, peaking at 122 posts during August of that year, according to CrowdTangle. 
There were 53 Facebook posts in January 2017, the month of Trump’s inauguration, and Nasa hasn’t come close to this total since, posting 21 times this March and 31 times in April.
This drop off in posts has resulted in dwindling interactions with the public on Facebook. During January 2017 there were more than 61,700 interactions – defined as likes, comments and shares – on the climate page. This has slumped dramatically since then, totaling just 7,000 in April. In April 2016, under the Obama administration, there were more than 100,000 interactions. 
Nasa’s Earth Right Now blog, which Tenenbaum wrote for, has also seen a decrease in activity, with just two originally-produced posts since Tenenbaum’s last entry in August 2017. Tenenbaum said she was warned about speaking to the media and then was offered another job elsewhere in the agency, before taking a leave of absence and then resigning. 
Nasa’s climate change website and Facebook page still clearly outline its findings, common with other scientific organizations, that the world is warming and the seas are rising.
A Nasa spokesman said there has been “no policy change about how we communicate out science to the American public”.
“Nasa Communications has not received any directive to change how we communicate about agency research, which includes climate change,” he added. 
“The frequency of blogposts on climate.nasa.gov has always varied depending on personnel availability and other factors including mission activities (launches, expeditions in the field, etc).”
There has been some angst within Nasa over Trump’s aversion to climate science – which he has previously called “bullshit” and a “hoax” inspired by China – and his administration’s dismantling of efforts to address global warming.
The White House’s proposal to cut funding for Nasa’s Earth science work, which uses satellites to measure the planet’s climate, soils, wildfires and weather events such as hurricanes, is also a point of contention. 
One agency scientist, who didn’t wish to be named, said: “Some people are apprehensive, some are defiant and some put their nose to [the] grindstone and get on with it.”
Nasa has yet to attract the level of controversy that surrounds the Environmental Protection Agency, whose administrator Scott Pruitt has denied basic facts on climate science, remodeled scientific panels to include more industry representatives and oversaw the removal of climate change information from the EPA website for a “review” that has lasted for more than a year. 
Kate Marvel, a climate scientist at Columbia University and the Nasa Goddard Institute of Space Studies who said she was speaking in a personal capacity, said no one has told her to “shut up” about her work.
“Physics doesn’t change just because the administration has changed,” she said. “It’s my job to understand how the planet works and I will continue to keep doing that.”
Jim Bridenstine, Nasa’s new administrator and former Republican congressman, has previously voiced doubt over the mainstream scientific understanding that the world is warming due to human activity. 
But he appeared to have shifted his position during a televised meeting with Nasa workers earlier this month.
“I don’t deny the consensus, I believe fully in climate change and that we human beings are contributing to it in a major way,” Bridenstine said, adding that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and “we are putting it into the atmosphere in volumes we haven’t seen before.

Three out of four (72%) of the world’s biggest meat and fish companies provided little or no evidence to show that they were measuring or reporting their emissions, despite the fact that, as the report points out, livestock production represents 14.5% of all greenhouse gas emissions.
“It is clear that the meat and dairy industries have remained out of public scrutiny in terms of their significant climate impact. For this to change, these companies must be held accountable for the emissions and they must have credible, independently verifiable emissions reductions strategy,” said Shefali Sharma, director of the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy European office. 
The new Coller FAIRR Protein Producers Index has examined the environmental and social commitments of 60 of the world’s largest meat and fish producers and found that more than half are failing to properly document their impact, despite their central role in our lives and societies.
Many of the names in the index will be unfamiliar, but their consolidated revenues of $300bn cover around one-fifth of the global livestock and aquaculture market – roughly one in every five burgers, steaks or fish. 
The companies looked at by the index include giants like the Australian Agricultural Company, which has the biggest cattle herd in the world; the Chinese WH Group, the largest global pork company; or the US’s Sandersons, which processes more than 10 million chickens a week.
Many of them run vertically integrated systems, sourcing meat from contracted farmers around the world, processing it themselves through their own slaughter and packing houses and then selling on to frontline, more familiar companies such as McDonalds, Walmart, Nestle and Danone.
But a close examination by the Farm Animal Investment Risk and Return (FAIRR) group has shown that, despite their critical part in our food system, these companies appear to be neglecting some of their social responsibilities. 
The food system, according to FAIRR, is “very sensitive to changing public sentiment”, and really large sums of investor money in the sector are often at risk due to little-understood risks. The organisation, founded by financier Jeremy Coller in 2015, aims to shed greater light on these risks.
Animal welfare, water scarcity, deforestation and working conditions were some of the areas in which the 60 largest protein-producing companies around the world were assessed. The index looked at self-declared information from each company, and set a wide range of key performance indicators such as targets for deforestation reduction, a policy on antibiotic reduction, or water exposer of supply chains. Overall 60% were found to be “either not managing critical risks or are failing to disclose basic information”.
“The findings from this first index create cause for concern,” said the report’s introduction. “There is still a worrying lack of ESG [environmental, social and governance] data availability and disclosure … despite the sector’s myriad sustainability impacts.”
Climate change emerged as a particular concern. Despite the fact that, according to the report, livestock production represents 14.5% of all greenhouse gas emissions, almost 72% of companies provided little or no evidence to show that they were measuring or reporting their emissions. Some 19 companies received the lowest possible mark in this section, including Australia Agricultural Company, Cal-Maine (a US company which reportedly produced 1bn eggs in 2017), Russian Cherkizovo and Indian Venky’s. This, the report argues, may be “putting the implementation of the Paris agreement in jeopardy”. The Guardian approached these companies for comment but received no response. 
 Studies over the last decade have repeatedly shown that the production of red meat is energy and water-intensive compared to the production of most grains and vegetables. But many government officials appear to be reluctant to suggest that consumers should reduce their meat consumption.
Antibiotic use also stood out. Antibiotic resistance has soared in recent decades and is now considered one of the biggest public health threats facing the world. The role of farming and food production in spreading resistant bacteria has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years as growing evidence points to a direct threat to human health from veterinary overuse of antibiotics on farms.
Despite this, there has been a “widespread failure to respond” to the crisis, the report says. The report says that 77% of the sector - 46 companies worth an estimated $239bn - rank “high risk” on antibiotic stewardship, with “little or no measures in place to reduce excessive use of antibiotics”.
Abigail Herron, global head of responsible investment, Aviva Investors, said: “Our research shows that three in four of these companies are ignoring the calls from regulators, health professionals and the financial community to manage and reduce their use of antibiotics. That failure puts both global public health and their business models at risk.”
 
Indian poultry giant Venky’s is among the companies ranked as “high risk” on antibiotics. Sanderson Farms, one of the US’s largest poultry producers, is also given bottom-tier ranking.
Venky’s was recently found by an investigation by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism to be advertising colistin, a so-called “last resort” antibiotic, for sale as a growth promoter in India, one of five pharma companies found to be doing the same.
Deforestation is another area in which many companies are falling short. A recent analysis by Forest 500 found that despite cattle production being the biggest driver of tropical production globally, only 17% of assessed cattle companies had a policy addressing forest production. And the Coller Index finds that of the 24 companies processing beef and dairy (where deforestation is a particular risk), only one is assessed as “low risk”.
 “From an investment point of view, it is not only this $300bn group of companies at risk but the wider multi-trillion dollar global food supply chain ... Investors sit at the top of the chain as ultimate owners of these listed businesses. They need to use their influence as responsible stewards of these assets to start a dialogue on best practice and encourage a race to the top to build a more sustainable food system,” said Aarti Ramachandran, head of research and corporate engagement at FAIRR.
“A major, systemic change is needed in the way we source protein if we are to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, habitat loss and water stress. This can only be achieved if businesses and policymakers, working with the latest food technologies and scientific advice, collaborate to create a sustainable and nutritious food revolution that meets tomorrow’s demand,” said Emily Farnworth, Head of Climate Change Initiatives, World Economic Forum.
“It’s always worth remembering that there is no such thing as cheap meat—these industries have been subsidised for years by the public because we pay for their environmental pollution, public health costs that they do not account for in their business model. This is where governments need to step in,” said Sharma.

Justin Trudeau’s government announced on Tuesday that it would nationalize the Kinder Morgan pipeline running from the tar sands of Alberta to the tidewater of British Columbia. It will fork over at least $4.5bn in Canadian taxpayers’ money for the right to own a 60-year-old pipe that springs leaks regularly, and for the right to push through a second pipeline on the same route – a proposal that has provoked strong opposition.
That opposition has come from three main sources. First are many of Canada’s First Nations groups, who don’t want their land used for this purpose without their permission, and who fear the effects of oil spills on the oceans and forests they depend on. Second are the residents of Canada’s west coast, who don’t want hundreds of additional tankers plying the narrow inlets around Vancouver on the theory that eventually there’s going to be an oil spill. And third are climate scientists, who point out that even if Trudeau’s pipeline doesn’t spill oil into the ocean, it will spill carbon into the atmosphere.
Lots of carbon: Trudeau told oil executives last year that “no country would find 173bn barrels of oil in the ground and just leave it there”. That’s apparently how much he plans to dig up and burn – and if he’s successful, the one half of 1% of the planet that is Canadian will have awarded to itself almost one-third of the remaining carbon budget between us and the 1.5 degree rise in temperature the planet drew as a red line in Paris. There’s no way of spinning the math that makes that okay – Canadians already emit more carbon per capita than Americans. Hell, than Saudi Arabians. 
Is this a clever financial decision that will somehow make Canada rich? Certainly not in the long run. Cleaning up the tar sands complex in Alberta – the biggest, ugliest scar on the surface of the earth – is already estimated to cost more than the total revenues generated by all the oil that’s come out of the ground. Meanwhile, when something goes wrong, Canada is now on the hook: when BP tarred the Gulf of Mexico, the US was at least able to exact billions of dollars in fines to help with the cleanup. Canada will get to sue itself.
No, this is simply a scared prime minister playing politics. He’s worried about the reaction in Alberta if the pipe is not built, and so he has mortgaged his credibility. His predecessor, Stephen Harper, probably would not have dared try – the outcry from environmentalists and First Nations would have been too overwhelming. But Trudeau is banking on the fact that his liberal charm will soothe things over. Since he’s got Trump to point to – a true climate denier – maybe he’ll get away with it.
But it seems like a bad bet to me. Faced with the same situation – a revolt over the Keystone XL pipeline – Barack Obama delayed for several years to avoid antagonizing either side. He ultimately decided he couldn’t defend the climate cost of building it, and so became the first world leader to explicitly reject a big piece of infrastructure on global warming grounds. Trudeau has made the exact opposite call, and now we’ll see if pipeline opponents cave. 
I was in Vancouver two weeks ago to help activists raise money for lawyers, and I would guess that the civil disobedience will continue – so far, two members of parliament have been arrested, an escalation we’ve never seen even in the States. Coast Salish elders have built a “watch house” along the pipeline route and, as at Standing Rock, other native activists have been pouring in – I’m guessing that making this petro-colonialism officially state sponsored will only harden people’s resolution. The showdown will be powerfully symbolic: kayaktivists, for instance, have paddled peacefully around the pipeline’s terminal, at least until Kinder Morgan put up an ugly razor wire barrier in the middle of the harbor.
Now it’s Trudeau who owns the razor wire, Trudeau who has to battle his own people. All in the name of pouring more carbon into the air, so he can make the oil companies back at the Alberta end of his pipe a little more money. We know now how history will remember Justin Trudeau: not as a dreamy progressive, but as one more pathetic employee of the richest, most reckless industry in the planet’s history.

However as for the LNP policies, I know it is out of the Liberal party propaganda machine however :In 2016, there was a five-fold increase in investment in renewables.According to Ernst and Young, Australia is one of the top 10 most attractive countries in the world in which to invest in renewables.We are supporting the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) with over $1 billion of grants to invest in new renewable projects. For example, grants for 12 new large-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) projects which will triple Australia’s large-scale solar capacity from 240 MW to 720 MW – enough to power 150,000 Australian homes.The $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation will continue to operate as a “green bank” financing new technologies.By Building Snowy 2.0, we will make renewable energy reliable by increasing storage by 50%, adding 2,000 megawatts of renewable energy – enough to power 500,000 homes.
And off the ALP propaganda machine: Climate change is driving the most profound restructuring of the world economy this century – the transition from fossil fuel based energy to renewable energy. The transition is happening now and it is accelerating. With the right policies the renewable energy sector provides immense opportunities: it will drive jobs creation, drive manufacturing investment and put downward pressure on power prices for families and small businesses.That’s why a Shorten Labor Government will: Ensure that at least 50% of the nation’s electricity is sourced from renewable energy by 2030;Expand the investment mandate of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation;Provide $206.6m to ARENA to support a specific Concentrated Solar Thermal funding round;Establish a Community Power Network and Regional Hubs at a cost of $98.7m over four years; andEnsure the Commonwealth Government leads by example as a direct purchaser of renewable energy.The Liberal Government has done everything in its power to try and destroy Australia’s share in one of the world’s fastest growing industries with devastating consequences for our country. In the last two years more than 2 million renewable energy jobs were added to the global economy, but over the same period 2,900 jobs were lost in Australia.In 2014, clean energy investment grew in China (32 per cent), the US (8 per cent), Japan (12 per cent), Germany (3 per cent) and the UK (3 per cent). But over the same period, investment in large scale renewables dropped by 88 per cent in Australia– from over $2 billion to around $240 million.A strong renewable energy sector will be at the centre of Labor’s response to the challenges of climate change. With the right policies the renewable energy sector also provides immense opportunities: it will drive jobs creation, drive manufacturing investment and put downward pressure on power prices for families and small businesses.

Speaking at the Carbon Market Institute emissions reduction conference in Melbourne on Wednesday, Butler said that Australia was a case study in how “toxic politics” could stymie efforts to decarbonise the economy.
Australia should follow the example of the United Kingdom, he said, which has maintained bipartisan commitment to its climate policies through Brexit and divisive debates around immigration despite a “similar media market”.
“I fear that we’re not going to get on the sort of path that we need to get on to until we resolve the toxic politics that has put climate right at the centre of the culture war in Australia,” Butler said. “Until we find a way through that we’re not going to get deep decarbonisation in Australia.”
He said he was not sure that the national energy guarantee (NEG) was the right mechanism to achieve that bipartisanship but said he was “open to that discussion.”
Butler said high-polluting industries that fought against the a carbon pricing mechanism under the previous Labor government now wanted an emissions reductions mechanism.
One of the most vocal opponents in the Gillard era, Rio Tinto, confirmed at its annual general meeting on Wednesday that climate concerns had played a role in its decision to pull out of thermal coalmines in New South Wales.
According to the Australian, chairman Simon Thompson said the decision to withdraw from coal was “based purely on value [but] we very much took into account the implications of climate change for the supply and demand of the commodity going forward”.
Claire Savage is deputy chair of the Energy Security Board, which was established to provide advice on the energy policy overhaul. She told the conference that Australia needed integrated energy and climate change policy and the NEG was “an opportunity for bipartisanship on a mechanism to deliver emissions reduction”.
It does not follow that bipartisan acceptance of the NEG would mean a bipartisan position on emissions reductions targets, Savage said. 
“Industry do need confidence around the mechanism that will operate and the framework within which the targets will change.”
Savage also said Australia should focus on energy efficiency as the main policy lever that could reduce energy prices, reduce emissions and increase reliability.
“Reducing peak demand is a way of dealing with peak demand,” she said.
Butler said addressing the inefficiency of Australian industry and households was “critical” to both reducing costs and ensuring supply.
“We have an enormous challenge in that we’ve gone from being a low-cost energy economy to a high-cost energy economy but we’re still behaving like a low-cost energy economy,” he said. 
Butler and Savage were speaking on a panel that included the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, the Nationals MP Damian Drum and the Australian Industry Greenhouse Network chief executive, Susie Smith. 
Di Natale said the Greens would consider supporting a policy of either party if it felt it was a “step forward,” and the NEG was not.
Drum said the push for renewables in the form of state-specific targets was “bullshit” if it came at the expense of affordable dispatchable power.
“We all love to have a social conscience, just think about your social conscience when you get the price of energy to the stage where mums and dads can’t pay their bills,” he said. 
Drum said that Australia’s capacity for gas electricity generation had been “hijacked by liars.”
“Gas is half the emissions of coal, and better, and it’s dispatchable and it’s available and we lock it up,” he said. “We lock it up for political reasons. I continually get challenged, ‘Hey mate, why don’t you blokes accept the science on climate change?’ I say, ‘Mate, I do, why don’t you accept the science on gas?’.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/02/labor-says-australia-will-fail-on-emissions-targets-unless-climate-culture-war-ends

The southern city of Nawabshah recorded a high of 50.2C on Monday. 
“We are worried that the extreme heat started too early this summer, and are planning to migrate to other cities if the situation remains the same,” one city resident, Ismail Domki, said.
The director general of the Pakistan Meteorological Department, Ghulam Rasool, said: “We have issued forecasts about the extreme heat in Sindh province but were not expecting a world record in the month of April.”
Domki said the official response had been inadequate. “There is no response from the government, at least 24 cases of heatstroke were reported on April 30 and five of them were serious cases with people losing consciousness,” he said, adding that these were just known cases at the government-run hospital.
A report in the Dawn newspaper said the unbearable heat forced people to remain indoors throughout the day. Roads and markets looked deserted and business activities came to a halt. The worst sufferers of heatstroke were labourers and motorcyclists.
Recent summers across the Middle East and south Asia have produced sweltering heat above 50C, melting roads, overwhelming power infrastructure and raising serious questions about the liveability of settlements from Iraq to India.
Last year, Pakistan was ranked among the top 10 most vulnerable countries to climate change. A severe heatwave in the southern port city of Karachi in 2015 left more than 1,200 dead, with more than 40,000 people suffering from heatstroke.

Ministers have been battling privately over whether or not to ban hybrids to strengthen the government’s policy of banning new diesel vehicles in 22 years time.
The environment secretary is in favour, as is the business secretary, Greg Clark, but the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, is opposed, the FT reported on Friday.
Hybrid car sales dwarf those of fully electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, but the former emit more pollution because they are still overwhelmingly reliant on burning oil.
The proposed hybrid ban is part of a plan called Road to Zero, which is being “heatedly discussed” within government, one source said. 
A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “It is categorically untrue that government is planning to ban the sale of hybrid cars in the UK by 2040.”
A hybrid ban would mean the sale of new cars such as the Toyota Prius would be prohibited after 2040, while 100% electric cars and plug-in hybrids, which have larger batteries and a longer range without using petrol or diesel, could still be sold.
The motor industry responded angrily to the news, saying it was disappointed to see policy being communicated by leaks.
Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said: “Unrealistic targets and misleading messaging on bans will only undermine our efforts to realise this future, confusing consumers and wreaking havoc on the new car market and the thousands of jobs it supports.
“We cannot support ambition levels which do not appreciate how industry, the consumer or the market operate and which are based neither on fact nor substance.”
When the 2040 ban was announced last summer, shortly after a similar plan by France, the UK government declined to be drawn on whether it covered hybrids.
About 98% of new car sales are petrol or diesel, including hybrids. The latter accounted for 72,523 new car registrations in 2017, compared with 13,597 for fully electric models and 33,666 for plug-in hybrids.
Prof David Bailey, an automotive expert at Aston university, said the switch to 100% electric cars would only begin to take off in a big way in the 2020s. “We will see a quicker shift into hybrid technology which is set to become the mainstream,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/04/michael-gove-leading-plan-to-ban-sale-of-new-hybrid-cars-from-2040

 The EU has committed to a 20% cut in its energy use by 2020 to be achieved by two directives, covering energy efficiency and buildings.
But leaked documents seen by the Guardian show that Britain is pushing for its 2014-2020 timeline to be stretched backwards four years to count “early actions” taken that comply with the efficiency directive. 
Any “excess energy savings” during the law’s writ would then be forwarded to the post-2020 period. MEPs have branded the plan “incomprehensible”.
 Benedek Jávor, the vice chair of the European parliament’s environment committee, told the Guardian: “The UK’s proposal to widen ‘flexibilities’ is completely mad and undermines the principle of additionality, as well as the overall ambition of the energy efficiency directive.”
 “This approach would risk failure in our efforts to reach even moderately ambitious overall targets, while the higher – and beneficial targets – that we need to strive for could become lost altogether.”
Jávor added that it was “rude” for the UK to weaken climate measures that it would only be bound by during a transition period, before it left the bloc.
 Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade and climate spokesman, said: “2018 is the year when countries have been asked by the UN to ratchet up their commitments on climate change. Instead our government is actually proposing to count emissions savings made from as far back as 2010 towards fulfilling their obligations in the next decade from 2021-2030.”
“This sneaky, behind-the-scenes amendment indicates a government that likes to pretend it is a global leader but will not take the strong policy action needed to deliver the necessary change.”
A UK government spokesperson said: “We are asking for clarity on certain energy savings between 2010 and 2013 and agreeing these for the 2020 target. This is not about applying these energy savings post-2020. To suggest otherwise is incorrect and we continue to advocate ambitious future targets.”
The British correspondence with the European council, dated 4 May, proposes allowing EU states to count climate actions taken “in any of the four previous or three following years” towards the energy efficiency directive’s annual 1.5% energy savings obligations.
Any “excess energy savings” between 2014 and 2020 “may count towards the fulfilment of obligations between 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2030”, it says.
The UK tried but failed to have similar loopholes added to the original directive in 2012. The Liberal-Democrat MEP, Catherine Bearder said it “gave the lie” to Michael Gove’s claims to be leading a “green revolution”.
 “One despairs,” she said. “In the face of Brexit, we really don’t have a leg to stand on. We’re in no position to start issuing demands. This is a carefully crafted agreement to decrease our carbon emissions and make our energy use more efficient. It is disappointing and ludicrous that we would come forward trying to water that down as we head towards the EU’s exit door.” 
 The EU’s climate goals for 2020 are a staging post to its more ambitious promise to the Paris conference of a 40% emissions cut by 2030. 
 Europe is expected to easily achieve this, although its CO2 emissions appear to be rising as economic activity picks up, while energy efficiency gains have gone into reverse. 
 Eurostat figures released last week showed a 1.8% rise in CO2 emissions from fossil fuel use in 2017 after a 0.4% fall the year before. Surprisingly though, the UK was the only EU country to reduce its electricity consumption in 2017. 
Almost all UK environmental policy currently derives from EU law and the union’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has insisted that a ‘non-regression article’ be included in any final EU-UK agreement to prevent backsliding.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/09/secret-uk-push-to-weaken-eu-climate-laws-completely-mad

The peak season for Atlantic storms, which officially starts on 1 June, is set to spur as many as 18 named storms, with up to five of them developing into major hurricanes, according to separate forecasts from North Carolina State University and Colorado State University. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will soon provide its own 2018 hurricane predictions. 
The initial forecasts of an above-average season for hurricanes follow a punishing 2017, most notable for Hurricane Harvey, which drenched large areas of Texas, Hurricane Irma’s sweep over Florida and the devastation that stubbornly lingers in Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria. 
These huge hurricanes brought winds of up to 185mph and lashing rains, causing hundreds of deaths, flattening homes, felling power lines and ruining roads. Combined, the three storms caused around $265bn in damage, and all ranked in the five most destructive hurricanes ever recorded.
Many communities, particularly in Puerto Rico and Texas, are still struggling to recover from last year’s hurricanes as the upcoming storm season approaches. And while the US may be spared 2017 levels of devastation this year, scientists have warned that the warming of the oceans, driven by climate change, is likely to stir greater numbers of prodigious storms in the future.
Atlantic hurricanes are intensifying far more rapidly than they did 30 years ago, according to a new study that analyzed the acceleration in wind speed of previous storms. Major hurricanes are defined by a sharp increase in speed, of at least 28mph in a 24-hour period. 
Researchers at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory found that these big hurricanes are, on average, speeding up 13mph faster in this 24-hour period than they did 30 years ago. Much of this has to do with shifts in a natural climate cycle called the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation.
Separate research from the National Center for Atmospheric Research suggests this natural variation will combine with escalating warming in the oceans and atmosphere, caused by the burning of fossil fuels by humans, to produce stronger hurricanes in the future. A warm ocean surface, combined with consistent wind patterns, contribute to the formation of fiercer, if not more numerous, hurricanes.
In the weeks before Hurricane Harvey smashed into Texas in August last year, the Gulf of Mexico’s waters were warmer than any time on record at around 30C (86F), the NCAR research found. 
“The implication is that the warmer oceans increased the risk of greater hurricane intensity and duration,” said Kevin Trenberth, an NCAR senior scientist and lead author of the study. “As climate change continues to heat the oceans, we can expect more supercharged storms like Harvey. 
“While we often think of hurricanes as atmospheric phenomena, it’s clear that the oceans play a critical role and will shape future storms as the climate changes.”
Hurricanes act as a sort of relief valve for hot tropical oceans, funneling heat away into the atmosphere. Persistent warmth in the oceans, however, adds further energy to hurricanes and risks causing worse damage to life and property when these storms make landfall.
Faced with the prospect of supercharged hurricanes, as various other burgeoning climate change-related threats, Donald Trump has rescinded Obama-era rules preparing infrastructure for climate impacts. He has taken an axe to policies that would lower greenhouse gas emissions from cars and power plants and announced that the US will withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. 
This agenda has been criticized by researchers who have called for an urgent reappraisal of the risk posed by climate change. 
“We know this threat exists, and yet in many cases, society is not adequately planning for these storms,” Trenberth said. 
“I believe there is a need to increase resilience with better building codes, flood protection, and water management, and we need to prepare for contingencies, including planning evacuation routes and how to deal with power cuts.”
This year, however, the focus will again be on disaster recovery rather than long-term mitigation. Ken Graham, director of Noaa’s National Hurricane Center said that the “entire Gulf Coast is at risk from storms and that several hurricanes can strike in a single season”.
“Don’t wait for a hurricane to be on your doorstep to make a preparedness plan, by then it may be too late,” he added. “Take the time now to get prepared for the season ahead.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/11/hurricane-season-may-be-even-worse-in-2018-after-a-harrowing-2017

I kind of want them to worry about GDP growth - it's not just an arcane economic theory...
BQENDEndless growth is in fact arcane theory, and lauding it without taking into account the corollary (recession), and/or environmental limits is, frankly, irresponsible management.
BQSTART
I don't think you can fault them for not caring about energy prices - their opposition to the carbon tax, and now the NEG, are in part geared towards stopping future price rises.
BQENDThe carbon pricing mechanism (calling it a ""tax"" was and is a political ploy - admitted to by Credlin a while ago) was halted before it could have the full effect on energy pricing. The so-called 10% 'correction' when the carbon price was removed was almost instantly absorbed in price rises.
The NEG is just another re-grouping of the same old same old board members that have been the regulatory and price-fixing cartel of AEMO and the NEM.
Loading energy retailers with the 'responsibility' to have any new energy manufacturing linked to their new favourite definition of 'dispatch able' energy (one known as caseload, and when that proved a further they re-branded).
We all know wheat they mean by that - coal and gas-fired energy.
Why retailers should have to take responsibility for government ideology is neither good management, nor good business practice.
Further, the NEG has not been linked to a progressive decline in CO2 emissions, and thus, because renewables are cheaper than the aforementioned (b.s.-branded) 'dispatchables', will inevitably be responsible in the medium term to 'locking in' higher-than-otherwise-would-be power prices.
IF the government wanted to lower energy prices, they would have insisted on a domestic supply policy for gas that incorporated a surplus.IF they wanted to have energy prices drop, they would pay attention to reforming both AEMO and the NEM - they are literally 'client captured' by the energy manufacturing sector (look at their boards for a start... then think about the 'buy in' system - it's a farce, built for highest profit, not lowest price).IF they wanted energy prices to drop they would pay attention to reforming the grid control and attendant distribution networks.
Look, given we stupidly privatised an essential service (well, thanks to Costello and others... most essential services) the LEAST various governments could do it to limit the gouging behaviour that has been going on ever since.They are just making it worse.And all in the service of (impossible) ever-'growing' GDP and Balance of payments.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1526454678000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'13011646', u'in_reply_to': u'115823130', u'id': u'115865845', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'MightyDrunken', u'text': u'A carbon tax is really the first step to tackle CO2 emissions.

There's no price on carbon | Greg Jericho,article,http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2018/may/15/its-no-surprise-emissions-keep-going-up-theres-no-price-on-carbon,0,"Late last Friday, the government quietly released the latest data on greenhouse gas emissions and, as has been the case since the ending of the carbon price, they show emissions are increasing. But the figures also highlight that the government’s current plan to focus almost exclusively on electricity, through its national energy guarantee , means Australia will be unable to meet its commitment to reduce economy-wide emissions by 28% below 2005 levels by 2030.
The government is never all that excited about releasing the quarterly update on greenhouse gas emissions. In December it released them the week before Christmas, and this time it released it late Friday afternoon – the end of budget week. 
The minster for environment and energy, Josh Frydenberg, didn’t bother to even put out a media release which, given the importance of the figures to his portfolio, would be like the treasurer not bothering to note the release of the quarterly GDP figures. 
The budget last week was not exactly replete with money and news about action on climate change. There was $500m to go towards mitigating the impact of climate change on the Great Barrier Reef, which is often the government’s favoured way with climate change – do bugger all to prevent the harm, and then spend money to make it seem like they care after the damage has been done.

But as for actual efforts to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, for now the only thing close to a policy is related to electricity via the national energy guarantee.
​The latest emissions data, however, shows that will in no way be enough.
In 2017, Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions are estimated to have been 533.7 Mt CO2 -e. The report notes that this is 2.4% below emissions in 2000 and 11.7% below emissions in 2005.
But that rosiness is really a bit of a figleaf as it refers to total emissions including the emissions from the land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sectors, which were very high in the early 2000s but which have been reduced due to less forest reduction and planting more trees.
Such activity was included in our Paris emissions targets because doing so made the cuts easier to achieve. But the measurement of the LULUCF sector is subject to a fair degree of error, and if you really want to look at actual greenhouse gas emissions you exclude it – but doing so makes the job of reducing our emissions to 26% below 2005 levels by 2030 much harder:
Even including LULUCF, there was a 1.5% increase in emissions in 2017 compared with 2016.
The report notes that a big reason for this was “the expansion in LNG exports, which saw a 41.4% increase in LNG production in 2017 and a forecast increase in LNG production for 2018 of a further 18.1%.”
And certainly the report puts to bed any claims that we have some sort of a gas-supply crisis – production is at record levels – but most of the increase is going towards LNG exports rather than domestic gas:
But let’s not be coy about the cause of these emissions. 
There is one reason Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions have increased, and it is the same one that has been in place since July 2014 – we no longer have a carbon price:
In the three and half years since the carbon price was removed, total greenhouse gas emissions (excluding LULUCF) have grown on average by 1.3% each year – compared with an average annual fall of 1.1% during the carbon price period.
The somewhat good news is that since the end of the carbon price, emissions in the electricity sector, which accounts for just over a third of total emissions, have actually fallen:
The reason, however, is not due to any great work by the government in crafting an energy policy designed to encourage renewables or cleaner energy, but because the extremely dirty and inefficient Hazelwood power station has closed. This has seen the use of brown coal to generate electricity in the national energy market fall from accounting for 25% in 2009 to now just 18%:
But while emissions from electricity have fallen, they have not fallen anywhere near enough to counter the rises in emissions in other sectors:
And with a focus on electricity set to remain, that means our ability to meet our emissions targets looks set to be impossible.
Consider that since June 2016, the increase in emissions from transport and stationary energy (emissions that come via manufacturing, mining and other commercial activities) have almost cancelled out the fall in electricity emissions in that period:
A one-sector-only approach to emissions reduction is not going to cut it (literally).
The government’s own projections last year for our path to 26% or 28% below 2005 levels highlight just how far we have to go, and how unlikely it is to be achieved with the current policy:
No one ever really believed Direct Action would work, and it clearly has not. The data shows unequivocally that the government’s climate change policy has been a complete failure.
And so long as this government remains beholden to climate change deniers within the partyroom and cabinet, who break out into spasms of lunacy at the mere suggestion of an emissions trading scheme or price on carbon, it will continue to be a failure and our emissions will continue to rise.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2018/may/15/its-no-surprise-emissions-keep-going-up-theres-no-price-on-carbon

I've never been anywhere near a rainforest. 
The rainforests are trashed by those who live nearest to them - the inhabitants of the countries - where they are situated. These are developing world inhabitants - who are usually not all that environmentally aware. 
Litter, for example, is not high on their lists of priorities - as photos from such places quite easily demonstrate.

I got that from his post. I just don't agree. I've got people on the G arguing with me about whether or not we even have free will, let alone having the ability to do exactly what we wish. I believe in a limited free will. However I don't buy the idea that everybody can succeed if they just apply themselves. Those who apply themselves are obviously going to have better odds at succeeding than those who don't. However to claim that the deck isn't stacked isn't factual, and you can go back to the pujo committee to see what I mean. I don't have time to debate this at the moment but there are problems that need to be addressed and just because some people can overcome these problems, it doesn't negate the fact that the world isn't fair.

There was that time when I, a very young father, oh-so-briefly and absentmindedly left Number One Daughter in her baby capsule on the roof of the clapped-out Morris. It all turned out fine. So much so that she is now about to have her own child.
And there was the time when Number One Son, aged about two, bellowed from the back of the car, “Ahh fuck – you idiot!” I’d just slammed on the brakes, inspiring him to speak with perfect intonation in precise mimicry of ... words I may have previously uttered from behind the wheel in a similar situation.
Which brings me to something Number Two Daughter, a nearly-teen, said in the car a few months ago.
“Mum and Dad – I don’t want you to be upset at this or anything,” she began.
She had our attention. “Yes?” came our chorus.
She continued, “OK and when I talk about you in what I’m about to say I don’t actually mean you personally – I mean your generation. OK?”
“Yes ... ”
“Well, you’re wrecking the world for my generation. The world is more unsafe than when you were kids, more and more species are going extinct, there are more refugees and the world is meaner to them, there are more wars, there’s more terrorism and more racism and you haven’t stopped climate change. No offence – but it’s true. You’re ruining the world.”

For good measure she also threw in something about being priced out of the housing market.
It’s impossible to overstate quite how devastating this was.
Devastating – because it’s mostly true. Those of us gen Xers in our early to mid-50s inhabit a world that is vastly more dangerous and uncertain than the one we were bequeathed. Us gen X men were the first generation since federation not to be forced or urged to go to war. We all had free tertiary education, stable government, a strong national and global economy, reasonable job prospects and security and, despite ridiculous interest rates in the mid-1980s, every prospect of owning our own homes.
In the 1980s our chief global concern was nuclear Armageddon at the tail end of the cold war. Today the daily threat might be China, Iran or North Korea, with the constant, of course, given the bellicosity and unpredictability of Trump, always America. Many Australian conservatives let slip much about their fears of a Trump White House as the beast roared on its way up – his hatred of women and minorities, his temperamental unsuitability, in short all of the things our children so easily identified and empathetically condemned as they would the schoolyard bully. My daughter and her friends talk of Trump constantly as a present and future threat to their world.
Meanwhile, toxic nationalism, in Australia and elsewhere, is more potent than it has been since the world wars, manifesting here in even greater oppression and marginalisation of Indigenous people, and the political vilification of asylum seekers and their banishment to earthy hell. The militarisation of Australian history and culture continues apace at the expense of gentler, more thoughtful forms of patriotism.
Terrorism was frightening for us, though largely in the abstract – a thing that mostly happened elsewhere, and quite rarely, rather than the global and domestic threat it is for our kids. It did not cross our minds when we boarded a plane, attended a big public event – or walked through a mall in the city.
The early science was there for us on climate change and ozone depletion. Governments needed little convincing of their reality and had begun to act. The change was not deliberately contorted, like today, as a matter of belief (despite the science) that divides politics, media and society – and delivers a status quo of stalemate between enlightenment and darkness that bequeaths to our young bleaching reefs, vanishing species and rising sea levels.
Some parents go to great lengths to shield their children from the worst realities of the world – war, famine, the threat of global warming, toxic racism, terrorism. We’d never tried – or wanted – to do that. The days have always began and ended in our homes with radio news and current affairs. There have always (until recently) been daily newspapers, and family conversation has inevitably included a fair amount of domestic and geopolitics. We wanted to raise informed, socially and politically engaged, and caring, young people.
We have tried, as parents and as people engaged with the world, who want to make it and this country better, to argue our causes. Some days there are wins. Others, it feels like progress is stuck in a morass beyond our control, at the whim of those at the very top of the power tree.
I inherited a better world, indeed, a better Australia, than my mother and father. But were I gone tomorrow, I doubt my kids would say the same about their parents.
But I’m not done yet – and I heard everything Number Two Daughter said in the car that day. The one thing I did not hear was any hint of fear. She sounded defiant and courageous. But never afraid. Perhaps that’s one of the things we did get right.

The move by the three undergraduates is part of an ongoing divestment campaign at the university that has been supported by hundreds of academics and scientists – including Sir David King, until recently the UK’s permanent special representative for climate change, Thomas Blundell, the former president of the UK Science Council and the author Robert Macfarlane. 
The university, which campaigners estimate has £377m invested in fossil fuel firms both directly and indirectly, is expected to take a decision on its future investment strategy at the university’s council meeting on Monday. 
A spokesperson said: “The council will consider all aspects of divestment, including ethical issues, in its response to the working group on divestment’s final report ... The objective, as the report sets out, is to promote and execute urgent and tangible action to deliver a carbon neutral future. The university is already taking steps that must be further expanded in the areas of its investments, research, education, estate and policy decisions.”
But student Sam Warren-Miell, one of the hunger strikers, said the university must fully divest from all fossil fuels.
“We have exhausted all democratic channels to full divestment and so we are left with no other option but direct action.
“University council have an opportunity on Monday to show real leadership. We hope that by taking this action, we will encourage them to make the right decision on Monday and be on the right side of history.”
The divestment campaign has been backed by the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams and the Cambridge MP Daniel Zeichner. This week students chalk-sprayed the university administration building as the protests escalated.
The university says its investments were reviewed in 2016, when it found it had “no directly held exposure to the most pollutive industries, such as thermal coal and tar sands, and no expectation of having any such exposure in the future.”
But Ben Margolis, another of the hunger strikers said: “Unless decisive action is taken quickly, we’re heading for a global temperature increase of over 2C which will be a catastrophe for the whole of humanity in our lifetimes, and we must also acknowledge that climate change is already having a devastating impact on millions of people in the global south today. 
“Every day that the university continues to invest in fossil fuels, directly or indirectly, it is complicit in their suffering, and this is why we will not stop the university commits to full divestment.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/18/students-go-on-hunger-strike-to-pressure-cambridge-university-to-divest-fossil-fuels

The company was part of earlier efforts to build a £1bn prototype carbon capture coal plant, but pulled out in 2015 after it missed out on renewable energy subsidies. Now the firm will try again with a pioneering form of the technology, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), to cut emissions from one of its four biomass-burning units. Experts believe the project is a world first.
In theory, BECCS can reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, as the trees for the power station absorb carbon dioxide as they grow, while the carbon dioxide released from generating electricity does not enter the atmosphere.
Most of the UN climate science panel’s scenarios for stopping dangerous global warming assume the use of such “negative emissions” technology, though critics have said it would not work at scale. 
Drax has partnered with University of Leeds spin-off C-Capture for the project, which starts this month. The carbon will be stored in a compressed form on the site, which the firm hopes to sell to an as-yet-unidentified partner for industrial processes.

China has made strong progress on its new carbon markets, which when complete will be the biggest in the world, while the EU initiated reforms of its carbon trading system which have already had an effect on prices.
Though these fledgling efforts need to be confirmed in the coming few years, more carbon markets are also likely to come forward: 88 of the countries that have completed the first stage of the Paris agreement, representing more than half of global emissions, have said they are using or plan to use carbon pricing as a tool.
The World Bank, in Tuesday’s annual report on carbon pricing, found that governments raised about $33bn in revenue last year from putting a price on carbon through carbon trading or taxes, a 50% increase on the previous year.
John Roome, senior director for climate change at the World Bank, said: “Governments are starting to see the effectiveness of carbon pricing in their efforts to cut carbon, while also raising revenues for climate and other policies. Carbon pricing mechanisms are proving to be essential elements of the toolkits [to meet the commitments made in the Paris agreement].”
Dirk Forrister, chief executive of the International Emissions Trading Association, told the Guardian the report showed “widespread interest in using pricing systems to meet the Paris goals”. He said: “The market is beginning to accelerate. We anticipate a major role for China and the market for international aviation [which when operational from 2020 will] more than double the amount of carbon subject to market pricing.”
In addition to the national carbon markets across the world, there are more than 20 that have been set up at a regional level.
If taxes on carbon are also included, the value of the world’s carbon markets and carbon taxes is likely to be about $82bn this year, compared with $52bn in 2017, according to the World Bank report.
Carbon pricing has long been considered a key way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and numerous efforts have been made to develop markets where organisations can trade “rights” to produce carbon, with an overall cap on the allocation of rights ensuring emissions are limited.
Economists consider carbon trading, which was enshrined in the Kyoto protocol of 1997, an efficient tool to encourage businesses to cut their greenhouse gases in the most cost-effective ways, but the problem has been that governments – the main creators of carbon markets – have been unwilling to impose costs on their industries. As a result, the caps on carbon have usually been too weak and the resulting price of carbon too low to generate a strong signal to the markets.
Carbon markets are also supposed to benefit developing countries, as under UN systems rich countries can buy credits from poor countries that have instituted protections for their forests, or other ways to reduce greenhouse gases.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/22/carbon-markets-back-from-the-brink-of-collapse-says-world-bank

Female bears need to reach a threshold weight to be able to reproduce. As R Anon says the sea ice they depend upon for hunting ""is melting quicker & earlier & reforming later & slower"" - one region is losing about 1 day of sea ice cover per year now - and each day lost reduces the number of calories that can be obtained, and hence the maximum weight that can be obtained even if hunting goes very well.
Once the ice days reach a critical threshold, bears won't be able to reach the necessary weight reproduce unless they find replacement food sources on land (and they aren't finding it now whilst waiting hungrily for the ice to form, so that's not going to happen). And once bears can't reproduce, the local population must move or die out. And moving isn't always viable - you need to be able to find a region with both food and sufficient ice days

The following link supports the claim that the Inuit are not making a traditional living relying on Polar bear meat as a reliable consistent staple to their diet,... 
Once again debunking the myth of a culture coexisting with nature as part of an ecologically functioning comunity...
BQEND
Firstly, it's a red herring to suggest that the argument is that Inuit should only be allowed to hunt because they've traditionally hunted for meat. For one thing, traditionally they've used pretty much every part of the animal, and they've also hunted in defence.
Secondly, the argument that Inuit should be allowed to continue hunting references their culture long before present day, not just ""now"", and as the 2nd paragraph of your linked article points out:
BQSTART
Inuit have hunted polar bears as an element of their overall set of ecological relations for millennia with this hunting (see Nelson 1970; Robbe 1975; Wenzel 1981) being conducted for spiritual-cultural reasons and to contribute to the traditional food economy.
BQEND
In other words, it pretty much says that polar bear is part of their diet and has been for a long long time, and (if you look into it) eating polar bear is not just about calories but has a community/cultural/spiritual dimension.
And whilst the document does go on to point out that the subsistence role of polar bears changed ""in the last 50 years or so"" to include some sports hunting, it rebuts your apparent view and the objection based on it (as I read it in comments you made elsewhere) that polar bear hunting was not a significant part of a cultural - or culinary - tradition at any time in Inuit history, so we can dispense with that line of argument.
The document does discuss present day (up to about the year 2000) sport hunting and social and economic factors that have motivated more of it since about 1970, which seems more relevant to your position. You can argue that sports hunting should not be allowed, and I had a lot more sympathy with that position before I talked to the polar bear tour guides - who you'd think of all people would object, but they accept it, given the cultural significance of bear hunting and the resulting use of the animal, and the realities of living in the far north. 
However, more importantly, you also appear to conclude that this document supports your key claim that the Inuit don't coexist with nature as part of an ecologically functioning community, but I'm not sure that follows either, at least not as most people would interpret the term ""ecologically functioning community"" which would probably indicate living in such a fashion as to maintain the local ecosystem in a reasonably ecologically-sustainable fashion (and which the government-managed harvest scheme appears to be attempting to do).
So when you say ""ecologically functioning community"" here, do you intend to imply ""not aided by a single drop of oil"", which you clarified elsewhere was intended to be understood when you use the term ""sustainable""? Or, since you say:
BQSTART
It's all about the MONEY.
BQEND
...do you mean something like ""without using money as a medium of exchange for any resource obtained from the ecosystem, or for any tools used for obtaining said resources""?
If so, it seems a bit rich if not outright hypocritical to be complaining that the Inuit don't get to adopt money in their culture, or should drop or decline to evolve millennia-old elements of their culture because they can make money from it, when you and I and all of our fellow readers are living in Western capitalist (it's all about the MONEY!) societies that have a much bigger negative impact on the earth's ecosystems.
BQSTART
The historical record shows the commercial exploitation of any species always results in diminished biodiversity.
BQEND
This is probably the crux of one of your arguments, but I think it's a dubious assertion. A well-run management scheme for even a commercially exploited species can definitely maintain biodiversity levels that would otherwise diminish (e.g. fisheries management schemes that stepped in to prevent total collapse).
So the effect of bear harvest management scheme on biodiversity must depend on how it operates. Do you have any evidence that the management scheme has led to, is leading to or must lead to diminished biodiversity? I'm not saying there is none, but a brief look at how the management scheme operates suggests diminishment isn't an obvious outcome.
Certainly as climate change gets worse, the harvests for some populations will have to drop rapidly towards zero so the scheme's settings/policy must be dynamic.

BQEND
I'm not an expert nor am I pretending to be one, and my comments were not intended to be either rude or arrogant (although having one's ill-considered opinions challenged can make one feel like that). Please re-read my comments in that light.
On the other hand, since that's your standard, many of your comments can easily be read as arrogant - but I haven't seen many complaints about that.
BQSTART
...however she must have some form of evidence to show that the Inuit traded with fur traders.
BQEND
You still haven't understood the fallacy your argument relies upon. You can't debunk the ""myth"" that the Inuit were self-sufficient at some point in time (even by your own idiosyncratic ""raising a drop of oil"" definition - which further undermines your argument) merely by showing that for a limited period in history they engaged in trade with fur traders. You have to show that throughout the entire period during which this cultural practice developed, they were not self sufficient under whatever definition of self-sufficient you have in mind. As you appear to admit further down in your comment, you don't even know when or how this practice developed.
BQSTART
If polar bears were the normal source of food for the Inuit they would be much shyer around people...
BQEND
Firstly, I don't know anyone who says polar bears were the normal source of food, so that's a red herring. Perhaps you meant ""a normal source"".
Even then, it doesn't necessarily follow that a culture that hunts polar bears results in polar bears being shy of people, especially if successful hunts weren't all that common, or (as I seem to recall you suggesting elsewhere) if polar bears are rather difficult to hunt with traditional hunting equipment, or (as you suggest further down in your comment) polar bears see humans as a food source.
BQSTART
...how is that significant in hunting Polar bear...
BQEND
You appear to have rapidly forgotten that it was your own claim that it was a myth that the Inuit hunted polar bears with weapons such as bows and arrows, a claim that you disparaged on the basis of, and I quote:
BQSTART
[were [sic] would they get the wood from?]
BQEND
I pointed out that your incredulity (a) betrayed a lack of easily obtainable knowledge which indicates that your opinions are not well grounded in evidence, and (b) doesn't contribute to the attempt to debunk the myth because they had access to wood.
BQSTART
Accusing someone of not knowing anything without any evidence proving them wrong is hardly a reasoned argument...
BQEND
The evidence of a low level of understanding (not your misquote of ""not knowing anything"") is in my earlier comment, and elaborated upon in this one (e.g. in my previous paragraph). I'm not sure how much more I can do to help you grok it.
BQSTART
I believe we are approaching this from an entirely different angle.
BQEND
That seems likely. Your issue appears to have changed from the culture practice of polar bear hunting to some other concern, and your communications about the issue don't seem all that coherent, at least when you try to apply it to justify disapproval of polar bear hunts.

Wrong. Many fisheries have recovered once restrictions were put in place after governments (or the EU) listened to scientists rather than to industry lobbyists. E.g. North Sea cod and herring.
Newfoundland cod was recovering from 2014 until the lobbyists got the quotas raised in 2017. That would be fishing lobbyists, not seals.
BQSTART
Last year, before the 2017 cod quotas were announced, Dr. Rowe and a colleague published an opinion piece in the journal Nature that implored policymakers not to “derail cod’s comeback in Canada.” It went on to discourage stepping up the fishery for 2017 and warned that “data indicate that the cod’s comeback may have stalled.” 
Days after it was published, policymakers increased quota for the 2017 season.

Another silly statement which is nothing to do with your original claims. They take all relevant credible research into account to give a likely range. Nobody knows the exact figure but that's got nothing to do with your original claim.

The energy studies are not credible so the claim is therefore low ecs is unlikely, they could equally say less likely it is high ........ so they don`t know either but funding for study of ""low"" sensitivity is less likely. You know a bit of laterial thinking would not go astray.
BQENDLike the rest of your post this makes no sense. If the most credible research stating low sensitivity is found to be less credible then of course a lower figure becomes less likely. As for the rest well lateral thinking unfortunately means conspiritoral thinking in your world.

Once again debunking the myth of a culture coexisting with nature as part of an ecologically functioning comunity, benefiting ecosystem biodiversity by control of Ursus maritimus in a predator/prey relationship. 
The romantic notion by many commentators that the modern Inuit are an ecologically sustainable lifestyle is erroneous, the motive for supporting a sudden & unexplained reversal of species population decreases of many trophy species is clear.

Many Inuit believe the polar bear population is increasing, and restrictions on commercial sport-hunting are likely to lead to a loss of income to their communities.

Besides, there could be another ice age right around the corner. Don't you watch the movies?
BQEND
The movies are not a reliable source on scientific issues.
Glacial inception requires summer temperatures in the northern hemisphere to be low enough for snow to build up year on year, starting mainly on north-facing slopes of mountain ranges.
It also requires CO2 levels to be quite low - in all the previous glacial stages of the Pleistocene ""ice age"", CO2 was under around 230 ppm.
This interesting paper -
""Determining the natural length of the current interglacial"" - Tzedakis et al, 2012
reports that the end of the current interglacial would occur within the next 1500 years, if atmospheric CO2 concentrations did not exceed 240±5 ppmv.
But CO2 was already above 240 ppm before the Industrial Revolution.
This early higher CO2 concentration may be related to the development of agriculture, which disrupted the carbon cycle.
Clearance of forests for fields meant fewer trees, so less CO2 was removed from the air.
Plus other agricultural activities, some producing CH4 (eg rice paddies)
Now with CO2 over 400 ppm, the Earth is heading into conditions not seen for a very long time - way before modern humans were around.
Those conditions are not conducive to glaciation.
So human activity has taken the Earth out of the repeated cycle of glacials and interglacials that has been going on for a couple of million years.
What is likely outcome?
A paper worth looking at is -

I don't subscribe to Crockfords claims or assertions, i think most of what she concludes is nonsense, however she must have some form of evidence to show that the Inuit traded with fur traders.

AND we insist upon a rigid definition of ""self-sufficient"" that we typically don't require elsewhere.
BQEND
My definition of self sufficient is a *sustainable living without raising/relying on a single drop of oil from the earth. It is irrelevant what we require elsewhere, because i wouldn't condone hunting apex predators for food anywhere else & would impose the same conditions. 
BQSTART
you don't seem to be aware that the Inuit and their predecessors have been living in some of those regions for well over a thousand years.
BQEND
I am most certainly aware the Inuit's ancestors have been in the region for well over a thousand years. What you seem to fail to acknowledge is the Polar Bear has probably been there for well over a Million years. If polar bears were the normal source of food for the Inuit they would be much shyer around people. eg. See the relationship between Lions & Maasai. 
BQSTART
You appear to be backing your own lack of knowledge
BQEND
So they had some access to wood from pioneer species shrubs & small trees in the form of driftwood how is that significant in hunting Polar bear they could have made weapons from bone & tusk. a small point taken out of context. Nothing suspect about it because my comments are a theory i didn't make any claims to be an expert. Its called a discussion but i see you like most, so called ""experts"" don't seem able to have reasonable civil discussions without being rude & arrogant. What I am certain of is that they did not find plywood or rifles washed up on the beach, your paper asserts most of the wood was valued as fire wood. There is no mention that the supply was enough to make shelters from it.
BQSTART
The Inuit culture has a respect for the ecosphere that you fail to account for when you assert that their culture ""doesn't meet that obligation to the natural world"".
BQEND
I believe that depends on your perspective & criteria used to measure it. when you were in Churchill did you see any motor vehicles? electricity? Commercial products? gas? Nylon Clothing? Runways? Roads? I believe we are approaching this from an entirely different angle. I have no doubt the Inuit culture has a deep respect & reverence for the natural world & how it once provided them the nutrition & warmth they required. Lets not confuse their ancient culture with how they live in 2018.
BQSTART
Again, it might be worth acquiring more knowledge before drawing inferences from a low level of understanding.
BQEND
Accusing someone of not knowing anything without any evidence proving them wrong is hardly a reasoned argument, disprove my assertions. Please provide the evidence that Polar Bears were regularly hunted by Inuit since they have inhabited the region. I ""suspect"" [note i have used this term through out] early bear kills would have resulted in human bear conflict, polar bears are predators they do see humans as prey. Most likely the bears came to the people not the other way round. I look forward to your evidence contesting this theory.
Again you have made a subjective defensive stance for the Inuit simply out of your own belief system. If ANY culture or race of people can live within the rules of the natural world, they have my deepest respect & admiration & present us all a model we should all emulate. But that requires non use of oil or modern technology. Since before man discovered fossil fuels as a source of energy we have been depleting the earths resources much faster than it can ever possibly be replenished.
*Sustainable, living a lifestyle that enables nature to replenish the ecosystem at the same rate that resources are used. there are probably only a few isolated groups of Homo sapiens that are doing so in 2018. The Sentinelese of The Andaman islands & perhaps a few unknown tribes in the Amazon. the Inuit aren't one of them. It is not racist to call these people primitive cultures its meant with the highest regard for them. The way the Inuit live is a lifestyle choice that is corrupt by modern culture & technology & as such it is not good enough to say i want to hunt wildlife because my ancestors did.

It takes Rich and two other men to roll the animal off the sled and on to the ice, while his wife and young children watch.
His sister, Natasha Pottle, who shot the bear the night before, hands her brother the plastic bags used to store liver, hair and fat samples that will be sent away for lab testing. The animal will provide valuable information for Labrador’s biologists, a small windfall for his family and meat for the community. Rich has barely begun cutting into the hide when a parade of people from the village start arriving to take pictures, offer observations or just watch respectfully.
“When you get a bear, everyone in town knows it,” Rich said.
Scenes like this are being repeated up and down the rugged, remote coast this year. Despite vanishing sea ice and shorter, milder winters, Labrador’s polar bear population is actually growing – which means a bigger harvesting quota for Inuit hunters.
There are more than 2,500 polar bears in the vast coastal area that includes Labrador and northern Quebec, according to Environment Canada – far more than was expected earlier in the millennium – and further signs the bears continue to rebound despite the impacts of climate change.
Indeed, although scientists and Inuit sometimes clash over the estimates, the polar bear population of coastal Labrador is among the healthiest in the world.
They jumped on the harp seal boom ... we're seeing them further south than in the past
“When I grew up, a polar bear was kind of this mythical creature because you didn’t see them very often. You didn’t hear tell of people seeing them,” said Jim Goudie, wildlife manager for Nunatsiavut, the regional indigenous self-government.
“This abundance of polar bears is not something my father’s generation grew up with. It’s only since the mid-80s there’s been the boom. Now there’s polar bears everywhere.”
The reason, biologists suspect, is the boom in the harp seal population. As Newfoundland’s seal fishery has collapsed under international pressure, the harp seals of the north-west Atlantic have proliferated. They now number about 7.4 million animals – more then seven times the population in the 1970s.
That has created a veritable feast for Labrador’s polar bears, who have shifted their diet from ring seals to their more southerly, promiscuous cousins.
“They jumped on the harp seal boom,” Goudie said. “They appear to have adapted for this moment in time … We’re seeing them further south than in the past.”
Labrador’s Inuit have hunted polar bears for thousands of years. But only recently have they been able to so carefully monitor and protect the population, thanks to a unique, indigenous-run conservation program managed by Nunatsiavut.
The bear shot by Pottle was one of 12 killed by Inuit hunters this season under Nunatsiavut’s quota system, which doles out bear hunting licences through a lottery. A hunter has one week to get a bear before the licence expires and is transferred to another person. Only Inuit residents can apply for a licence, and it’s illegal to sell a licence to a big game hunter who is not from the region.
In Inuit culture, a polar bear remains a deeply respected animal, called Nanuk in the Inuktitut language, and getting one is still considered the mark of a great hunter. The harvest remains such an important part of local tradition that it has its own statute in Nunatsiavut’s land claim with the federal government.
But Pottle isn’t putting on any airs. Shooting her first polar bear was a terrifying experience, she said.
“I was scared,” she said. “It was intense. We chased the tracks out on to the ice and there he was. Then our Ski-Doo stalled and he started coming toward us. That’s when I started calling for my brother.”
Her brother, carrying the rifle on his back, circled around to keep the animal at a safer distance. Then he handed the gun to Natasha and told her to shoot.
“She was crying, and I said: ‘What’s wrong?’ She said she’s never going polar bear hunting again,” he said. “I said: ‘It’s your licence. You’ve got to shoot it.’”
The bear meat will be divided up and shared among the region’s community freezer program, which provides food for the elderly and others who can’t hunt for themselves. Wasting the meat is prohibited by Nunatsiavut law. Failure to share the meat or submit samples for testing means a hunter can be banned for five years.
“Some people say it’s our right. But I’ve always viewed it as a privilege. We ask a lot of [hunters], but you’re getting something that not every Canadian has the right to go out and do,” said Goudie. “That’s why I think Nunatsiavut leads not only Canada, but also the world, when it comes to conservation management and buy-in to our system.”
Inuit hunters can sell a bear pelt for $4,000 to $5,000 to a local taxidermist, who will auction it off to buyers around the world. In previous decades, when the international market for pelts was booming, the same bearskin could fetch as much as $30,000. Under Nunatsiavut’s program, a computer chip is embedded in the pelt to prove it was harvested through a legal hunt.
Much like the coastal Inuit themselves, the polar bear’s world relies heavily on reliable, vast expanses of sea ice. As the region’s sea ice vanishes because of warming oceans and milder winters, the bear has had to adapt. The animals appear to be thriving, but winter is becoming increasingly unpredictable.
The loss of sea ice has been dramatic, according to climatologist Robert Way. He points to the Canadian Ice Service historical database, which shows Nunatsiavut’s northern region has lost about a third of its ice cover in the past decade.
Conservationists say the Nunatsiavut model is a lesson for other regions trying to manage their polar bear population. Goudie argues the Inuit, sometimes criticized by animal rights activists for allowing the bear hunt, have a vested interest in preserving the polar bears that live among them.
“For Inuit, it would be like losing an entire piece of their culture,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/24/canada-polar-bears-labrador-rigolet-seal-hunt

Water, certainly, but also tiny particles known as “aerosols”. Whether they originate from wildfires, volcanoes, sandstorms, ship emissions or power stations, aerosols alter the properties of a cloud. By providing a surface for water to condense on to, they can help water droplets to form. But exactly how aerosols alter clouds is not clear. Now a new satellite study is helping scientists to see inside a cloud.
Nicolas Bellouin, from the University of Reading, and colleagues compared ordinary satellite images of clouds with infrared images. Clouds that appear plain white in ordinary images contain different shades and patterns when viewed in infrared. From wildfires in Siberia to volcanoes erupting on the Pacific islands of Vanuatu, and the trail of smoke from power stations in northern England, Bellouin and his colleagues show that polluted clouds tend to redistribute the same amount of water over a greater number of droplets. Their findings are published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
This observation contrasts with some climate models, which indicate that increasing aerosols should help clouds to become “wetter” by increasing their capacity to hold water. The findings also suggest that climate models are overestimating the ability of aerosols to offset global warming.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/28/weatherwatch-pollution-can-make-clouds-drier

Two weeks of sunshine in my part of the world and my heart’s lifted by plentiful orange tips, small whites and brimstones, while last summer’s peacocks gamely fly on. Alongside a decent abundance of common species there’s the exciting addition of 41 chequered skippers from the continent, now enjoying the warm glades of Rockingham forest, Northamptonshire.
The chequered skippers – males and females collected in Belgium – have been reintroduced as part of the Back from the Brink project, after the species became extinct in England following the hot summer of 1976. (A similar summer would be too dry for this species’ caterpillars, which need moisture to survive.)
One swallowtail doesn’t make a summer but I’ve seen my first on Strumpshaw Fen, Norfolk. There’s some curious phenology this year, with little sign yet of milk parsley, on which the females lay their eggs. And the swallowtail’s favourite nectar, including sweet william in nearby gardens, isn’t in full flower. It could be problematic if butterflies emerge too early for their food plants.

California farmers bet on what we'll be eating in 2050,article,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/30/avocado-california-climate-change-affecting-crops-2050,0,"Chris Sayer pushed his way through avocado branches and grasped a denuded limb. It was stained black, as if someone had ladled tar over its bark. In February, the temperature had dropped below freezing for three hours, killing the limb. The thick leaves had shriveled and fallen away, exposing the green avocados, which then burned in the sun. Sayer estimated he’d lost one out of every 20 avocados on his farm in Ventura, just 50 miles north of Los Angeles, but he counts himself lucky.
“If that freeze was one degree colder, or one hour longer, we would have had major damage,” he said.
Avocado trees start to die when the temperature falls below 28F (-2C) or rises above 100F (38F). If the weather turns cold and clammy during the short period in the spring when the flowers bloom, bees won’t take to the air and fruits won’t develop. The trees also die if water runs dry, or if too many salts accumulate in the soil, or if a new pest starts chewing on its leaves. “All of which is quite possible in the next few decades, as the climate shifts,” Sayer said.
The weather had been strange lately, Sayer told me. In the past year, Californians have lived through a historic drought, a massive wildfire that blotted out the sun and a strangely warm winter followed by that unseasonable freeze. When I visited in April, his lemon trees were already loaded with ripe fruit – that usually doesn’t happen until June. “Things are screwy,” Sayer said.
The trees are totally confused
From the vineyards of the north coast to the orange groves of southern California, farmers like Sayer have been reeling from the weird weather.
“We are already suffering the effects of climate change,” said Russ Lester, who grows walnuts at Dixon Ridge Farms, east of Sacramento. “I can look out my window and see trees that don’t have a leaf on them and others that are completely leafed out.
“The trees are totally confused.”
It might feel like we’re peering into the distant future when we hear that by 2050, temperatures may very well climb four degrees, seas could rise a foot and droughts and floods will become more common. But for farmers planting trees they hope will bear fruit 25 years from now, that seemingly distant future has to be reckoned with now.
A lot of the country’s tree crops grow in California, which produces two-thirds of the fruits and nuts for the United States. The same is true of grapevines, which bear abundant fruit for about 25 years (they slow down after that, but can keep going for hundreds of years). It’s in large part because so many farmers are making these long-term gambles on orchard crops that a recent scientific paper noted: “Agricultural production in California is highly sensitive to climate change.”
Jay Famiglietti, the senior water scientist at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, goes even further: “It’s a virtual certainty that California will get drier. I don’t think it’s a climate that’s conducive to orchard crops anymore.”
In other words, for anyone trying to make money off long-lived crops, climate change is already here. And yet new saplings are pushing out of the ground all over the state.
If these farmers were planting an annual crop, like cilantro, they’d be making a bet on the weather for the next 45 days. But they’re planting trees, which means making a bet on the next 40 years.
After years of putting it off, Sayer is about to place such a four-decade bet by planting a bunch of new avocado trees. There’s no way Sayer can foresee oncoming climate disaster, if that’s what’s hurtling toward the land his family has worked for the past 130 years in Ventura. He can see just a little bit of what might be coming – as if he’s straining to glimpse signs of danger while blinkered. When I asked him how it felt, he said: “Like I’m about to cross a very busy road with my hood pulled over my head.”
When Katherine Jarvis-Shean was a doctoral candidate researching the decline of cold winters a few years back, she thought more farmers should be freaking out. “I used to think, ‘Why aren’t you guys more worried about this? It’s going to be the end of the world.’”
After all, many fruit and nut trees require a good winter chill to bear fruit. But after spending a few years as an extension agent for the University of California – working directly with farmers and translating science into techniques they can apply on the land – she understands better. It comes down to this: farmers have a ton of concerns, and the climate is just one of them.
“If you decide what to plant based on climate, but then can’t make the lease payment, that’s not sustainable,” Jarvis-Shean said.
If you are worried about water running out in 15 years, you might think it’s a good idea to cut down half the state’s almond groves – but if those almond trees are still putting money in your pockets, that wouldn’t make sense until the killer drought hits. That’s the crux of the matter for Sayer, and other farmers I interviewed. They’re concerned about the changing climate, but they always come up with ingenious plans to adapt to bad weather. It’s much harder for them to adapt to an overdrawn bank account.
They would grow in any postapocalyptic hellscape you could imagine
Sayer grows mostly lemons right now, but they’re not long for this world. “You can see these lemon trees are getting a little rangy looking,” Sayer said, gesturing toward a leafless branch. “This is going to be their last harvest, then they’ve got a date with the chipper.”
Sayer knows lemons. He knows how to coddle them in old age, how to nudge them to produce more, how to keep them alive when rains fail, how to protect them from aphids, and snails, and scale insects, and the nematodes in the ground. But this land has provided a home to a citrus orchard for 70 years, and each year more pests accumulate to suck the life from the trees. So Sayer needs to move on from lemons, and he’s settled on avocados.
From a climate perspective, the leather-skinned fruit are a risky choice. Avocado trees like their surroundings not too hot and not too cold, and they always need water. One study estimated that climate change would hurt California avocado trees so much that the state’s production could be cut in half by 2050.
As the sun burned off the marine layer of clouds over the orchard, Sayer patiently laid out the reasoning that led him to plant avocado trees. He explained that climate poses risks that are easy for outsiders to see – when you’re reading about historic droughts in the newspaper and driving past acres of withered crops, it seems crazy to plant orchards. But farmers often have to contend with other risks that outweigh the danger of bad weather. Sayers puts them into three categories: climate risk, market risk and execution risk.
If he were only worried about climate risk, Sayer said, he’d plant prickly pear. “They would grow in any postapocalyptic hellscape you could imagine,” he said. But who would buy them? Most Americans don’t put prickly pear on their shopping lists. So there’s a huge market risk.
Then there’s execution risk: the chance that Sayer screws things up. If he didn’t have to worry about that, Sayer might follow his neighbor’s lead and start growing annual crops. He pointed across the road from his farm, where orchards once stood, at a flat expanse of strawberries dotted with hustling pickers. There’s always an appetite for strawberries so they pose a low market risk. And because strawberries get planted every year, they’re not such a big gamble on the changing climate. If a freak storm kills everything growing in Ventura, for instance, Sayer’s neighbor would lose that year’s strawberry crop while Sayer would lose a 30-year avocado investment.
Smoothies, toast, ice cream, you name it – that consumption has increased sevenfold since 2000
But the execution risk of switching to strawberries – figuring out how to grow them, buying the right equipment and learning how to sell them – is too high for him. “We’re talking about years of learning,” Sayer said. “It would be like me deciding to go back to college to study medicine.” He’s 52, and not prepared to start fresh.
Sayer has one other option that would eliminate all the climate, market, and execution risks: Pave his farmland and build houses. When I visited in April, workers were constructing apartments on what used to be farmland at the end of his street. If more farmers start taking climate risks seriously, a surge of subdivisions could start sprawling across some of the most fertile farmland on the planet. But the thought of that saddens Sayer. He wants to farm.
After weighing all those risks, he decided to bet the farm on avocados. These trees are no climate savior – far from it. But Sayer been experimenting with them for decades and understands how they work. He knows he can sell avocados, because he’s tapped into a network that reserves spots for the fruit in every grocery store, and turns sunburned avocados into frozen guacamole. Also, you might have noticed the market is strong: Americans are chowing down so much avocado tonnage in new, creative ways – smoothies, toast, ice cream, you name it – that consumption has increased sevenfold since 2000.
Orchards can endure weird weather brought on by climate change, but if they don’t get any water, the trees will die. In the past, California farmers have always survived droughts by sticking deeper and deeper straws into the ground to suck up groundwater. But since 2014, the state has had a law against depleting aquifers, and farmers soon won’t be able to take out more water than goes in.
That policy alarms growers, especially since they can no longer depend on snow in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Mountains hold water – in the form of glaciers – through the colder months, then release it during the warmer months. But as the climate heats up, more of the precipitation that fell in California as snow will turn to rain. That means more floods in winter and more droughts in summer.
To adapt to this boom-and-bust cycle, a few farmers around California are letting swollen rivers spill into their orchards. If carried out on a large scale, this would slow down rushing flood waters and let them percolate into aquifers.
After four years of experimentation in almond groves, scientists have found that this inundation hasn’t hurt the trees. They’ve also identified nearly 700,000 acres under almond trees suitable for recharging groundwater, said Richard Waycott, president of the Almond Board of California. At the same time, growers continue to use less freshwater for irrigation and draw more water recycled from city drainpipes.
It looked like someone had irradiated the place with toxic chemicals
In another example of climate adaptation, farmers are developing a kind of hyper-local climate engineering, spraying clay dust over their trees to create shade and cool them down in unseasonably hot weather, according to David Zilberman, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. Elsewhere, scientists have planted a pistachio orchard where no self-respecting pistachio farmer would ever put a tree: in the middle of the southern California desert near Coachella.
Most pistachio trees grow 200 miles north, where colder winters allow them to settle into their natural cycles. But in a few decades, that traditional pistachio land could have the climate of Coachella. It’s a type of time travel; the idea is to find a version of the future that already exists.
The pistachio trees aren’t at all happy in the desert: “It’s just terrible out there,” said Craig Kallsen, another extension agent for the University of California. “It looked like someone had irradiated the place with toxic chemicals.”
All the same, a few pistachio trees are beginning to produce leaves. By growing this orchard in this analogue of the climate future, researchers like Kallsen can see which varieties stand up to heat, and then zero in on the genes that allow those trees to adapt. Using those genes, researchers hope to breed trees that can thrive in a hotter, drier world.
Sayer is also adapting by growing different varieties of avocados, but the most visible climate adaptation in the orchard was the knee-high carpet of grasses and turnip stems we waded through as we made our way among the trees.
“Back in the 1970s, bare dirt between the rows was considered clean and tidy,” Sayer said. “If you had a blade of grass sticking out, oh man, that wasn’t good.”
Letting plants grow beneath the trees seemed like a squalid, lazy, weed-spreading hazard. When he and his father first began planting between the rows in 2005, it felt taboo. Other farmers would sidle up to them at the coffee shop and ask in an undertone: “What’s going on with your orchard? Is that a cover crop?”
A cover crop protects the soil from heavy rains and helps turn it into a habitat for worms, beetles and thousands of microbes. As we walked through the dappled sunlight, the ground beneath my feet was yielding like a giant sponge.
Sayer has calculated that, since first planting the cover crop, his lemon orchard can absorb 2.5m gallons more water in a downpour. “Since every scenario I’ve seen involves water stress, better soil is going to put us in a better position, because it holds and absorbs more rain,” he said.
Better soil is going to put us in a better position
Lester, the Sacramento-area walnut grower, also plants cover crops. And he has an audacious justification for planting new trees: He hopes to reverse climate change.
Cover crops pull carbon from the air into the soil and – if we can figure it out – all of agriculture could become a giant carbon dioxide sponge. Lester powers his operation with solar panels and a walnut shell burning furnace (releasing carbon his walnut trees recently sucked out of the air), making his farm carbon negative.
“Call me optimistic, but I believe if all farmers adopted healthy soils technology, agriculture can play a huge role in stopping, slowing down, maybe even reversing climate change,” Lester said.
Not all farmers are as scientifically literate as Lester or Sayer; many shrug off climate change as just another shift in the weather. But even the ones who readily accept the science of climate change continue to plant trees. Perhaps they are overly optimistic. Perhaps they are just human: it’s not in our nature to ignore threats right in front of our face so we can focus on those in the seemingly far-off future.
Agriculture can play a huge role in stopping, slowing down, maybe even reversing climate change
After I’d spent the day with Sayer, his decision to plant more avocados made sense: It’s the choice that allows him to keep farming. He’s making preparations based on the best climate projections he can get, while also setting himself up to react to the unexpected. He can see a path to profitability, though he allows that his vision into the future – in terms of both climate and weather forecasting – is severely restricted.
If you recall, he likened planting a new round of avocado trees to crossing a busy road with a hood over his head. There was a second part to that analogy: “At least I know which way to look for the oncoming traffic.”

A survey this year found that up to 50 percent of physicians consult Wikipedia for medical information, despite a 2008 study that found certain drug pages miss vital health information about side effects. Wikipedia may also unintentionally encourage lazy or gullible students who cite it as a primary source in their papers, which leads to perennial complaints by teachers and professors.
Still, misuse of Wikipedia by readers and contributors does not diminish the encyclopedia's huge accomplishments as a crowd-sourcing experiment. Dartmouth researchers found that much of Wikipedia's success depends not only upon registered, dedicated users, but also relies upon many anonymous ""Good Samaritans"" who might contribute just once.
A 2005 study by the journal Nature found Wikipedia roughly as accurate as the Encyclopedia Britannica, and a 2008 study in the journal Reference Services Review pegged Wikipedia's accuracy rate at 80 percent compared to 95-96 percent among other sources — not bad for a free, crowd-sourced encyclopedia.
Well-sourced articles written according to Wikipedia guidelines should have citations listed at the bottom of each page, with links to other information sources. This means that savvy readers can use Wikipedia as an information hub to follow the link trail to more expert or authoritative websites, and students can likewise find useful primary sources through Wikipedia.

Deranged Authority: The Force of Culture in Climate Change, worth four academic credits, is set to be taught in the Fall 2018 semester by cultural anthropologist Jennifer Carlson.
The course description asserts that “climate denialism is on the rise,” suggesting the increase is related to the rise of “reactionary, rightwing [sic] politics in the United States, UK, and Germany.” The proposed solution to combat such denialism and assumed ignorance is “climate justice,” even though over 30,000 scientists reject global warming alarmism.
Richard Lindzen, MIT emeritus professor of meteorology and a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, found the course “an insult to the intelligence of the students.”
He clarified to Campus Reform that many scientists do not argue against slight warming of the Earth after the Little Ice Age (the unusually cool period of the Earth around the 1700s A.D.), nor do those critical of anthropogenic climate change argue that humans have made no impact on the planet, merely that the effect has been small and largely beneficial. 
“The point of such courses as are proposed for Cornell, is to replace science with belief,” Lindzen argued, adding that students are “encouraged to replace understanding with virtue signaling.”', u'recommendation_count': u'2', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1525389643000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'100361243', u'id': u'115421653', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Vlamingo', u'text': u'No one is suggesting that climate change is the sole cause of sea level changes, any more than it is solely responsible for all temperatures changes.

It stands to reason that in locations where SLR exceeds the global average (hotspots), these other effects are likely to be overwhelming the climate change component.
But this in no way decreases the importance of climate change - in fact, it makes things worse, by causing some of the impacts of climate change to manifest earlier than they would have otherwise.

“The Everglades was the only place on earth where alligators (broad snout, fresh water, darker skin) and crocodiles (pointy snout, salt water, toothy grin) lived side by side. It was the only home of the Everglades mink, Okeechobee gourd, and Big Cypress fox squirrel. It had carnivorous plants, amphibious birds, oysters that grew on trees, cacti that grew in water, lizards that changed colors, and fish that changed genders. It had 1,100 species of trees and plants, 350 birds, and 52 varieties of porcelain-smooth, candy-striped tree snails. It had bottlenose dolphins, marsh rabbits, ghost orchids, moray eels, bald eagles, and countless other species that didn't seem to belong on the same continent, much less in the same ecosystem.”

Florida’s mangroves have been forced into a hasty retreat by sea level rise and now face being drowned, imperiling coastal communities and the prized Everglades wetlands, researchers have found.
 Mangroves in south-east Florida in an area studied by the researchers have been on a “death march” inland as they edge away from the swelling ocean but have now hit a manmade levee and are likely to be submerged by water within 30 years, according to the Florida International University analysis.
“There’s nowhere left for them to go,” said Dr Randall Parkinson, a coastal geologist at FIU. “They are done. The sea will continue to rise and the question now is whether they will be replaced by open water. I think they will.
“The outlook is pretty grim. What’s mind boggling is that we are facing the inundation of south Florida this century.”
Mangroves are made up of coastal vegetation that grows in salty or brackish water. They are considered crucial buffers to storms and salt water intrusion, as well as key habitats for certain marine creatures.
Using aerial photographs, satellite imagery and sediment cores, FIU researchers found that mangroves just south of Miami were migrating westwards over marshland at a rate of about 100ft a year until they were halted by the L-31E levee, a flood barrier in Miami-Dade county, where they are now making their last stand. 
Previous research has suggested the same phenomenon has happened in other parts of south Florida, making the region more vulnerable to storms, such as Hurricane Irma, which swept up Florida last year, and land loss as the sea rises further.
Of particular concern is the future of the Everglades, the vast marsh, mangrove and pine flatwoods wilderness that provides a home to threatened species such as the manatee, American crocodile and Florida panther.
The Everglades, known as the “river of grass”, was long nourished by fresh water flowing slowly from marshes, lakes and rivers to the north. 
However, the ecosystem has shrunk by around half since a network of canals and dams were built over the past century to divert water for agriculture and to build homes. Swaths of the Everglades have been drained to accommodate a booming human population – more than 6 million people now live in south Florida.
A restoration plan to divert water back to the Everglades has been backed by Congress but the area now faces the existential problem of sea level rise, which is connected to climate change. The oceans are rising rapidly at the largely flat south Florida coastline, around three times faster than the global average. Salt water is entering the Everglades from the coast and from underground aquifers. 
“You can restore the plumbing of the Everglades but the question is whether that will be enough,” Parkinson said. “If you have a healthy patient, it will have a higher probability of survival if they are exposed to a virus. The Everglades isn’t a healthy patient, it faces a lot of threats. 
“We are at a tipping point. Sea level rise could be more than 20mm [o.79in] a year by the end of the century and there’s no way our coastal habitats will keep pace with anything more than 10mm a year.”
Dr Stephen Davis, a wetland ecologist at the Everglades Foundation who was not involved in the FIU study, said the work illustrates the problems that researchers have witnessed in south Florida in recent years.
“There will still be some mangroves in south Florida but areas will collapse into open water bodies,” he said. “Unabated sea level rise will continue to eat away at the marshes. We should do everything we can to help restore the Everglades to reduce its vulnerability.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/02/mangroves-everglades-florida-rising-sea-level

""Mains electricity"" simply means - in the UK - 240V 50hz supply, which PV can do perfectly well. I have it on my roof, and it provides ""mains electricity"". I suppose you mean 24 hour supply.

...from which I quote :""Adding a house to the grid even in a compact country such as Rwanda typically costs about $2,000, which is more than the country’s average annual income per person. The APP reckons that expanding grid power across Africa to reach almost everyone would cost $63bn a year until 2030, compared with the $8bn a year that is being spent now.""
""Rooftop solar systems usually consist of a small solar panel and a small rechargeable battery and controller which typically powers four lights, a radio and a phone charger. Most systems have a built-in connection to the mobile-phone network that allows the provider to switch it on or off remotely. Instead of shelling out $250 or so upfront for an entire system, customers can buy electricity for the equivalent of 50 cents a day using mobile money. ""
""....venture capital is pouring into an industry that now has at least half a dozen significant firms. The largest of them, M-Kopa, has electrified more than 500,000 homes and is adding almost 200,000 more a year. Across the industry as a whole perhaps a million families now have rooftop power. At current rates of expansion, the total may double every 18 months or so.""

Instead, we are telling them: due to our bad behaviour, we don't want YOU to benefit from the same. Instead, we have decided you do not need the freedom to develop affordable energy resources. We want you to be dependent on OUR charity to develop more expensive renewable energy, which will mean taking our money - with our imposed conditions - and buying the advanced technology from OUR manufacturers. We give the money, but it will come back to us, and the developing world must continue to be grateful for our money and goodwill. We will remain dominant and rich. They will remain dependent and poor. (But of course, we dress it up with patronising claims like 'climate change will affect the poorest countries first' - to make us feel better, and them dependent.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1525374179000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'our bad behaviour', u'effect': u""instead telling we do n't want you to benefit from the same""}], u'author_id': u'2595146', u'in_reply_to': u'115403498', u'id': u'115414725', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'ggm281', u'text': u'When you have hastened the deaths of two children because of the expense of their continued care, it might be a bit of a difficult sale to convince the public that they must contribute tens of billions to infrastructure development in other countries.

It is already affecting populations across the globe, and its impact will be catastrophic if left unabated.
The effects of climate change include an increase in frequency and severity of extreme weather events such as floods, droughts, extreme storms and heatwaves, which have physical and mental health impacts; the spread of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue to new locations; worsening nutrition resulting from decreased agricultural productivity and higher global food prices; rising sea levels and associated population displacement; and an exacerbation of poverty and inequalities.
Reducing and mitigating the impact of climate change requires sustained and collaborative action globally, nationally and locally. A joined up approach to tackling the threat of climate change, alongside other threats such as air pollution, is particularly important. For example, the wide use of measures such as clean air zones, or action to phase out coal-use, will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve local air quality.

There is a solution to this problem which, if implemented sensibly, provides benefits not only for the recipients, but the donors: don't give them money, give them goods and services. 
For example, by donating renewable energy generation equipment and infrastructure, and the skilled labour to install it and train local technicians to maintain it, we not only avoid the inappropriate use of cash donations, but stimulate manufacturing in donor countries and increase employment of our own workforce.
Developing countries have made ""impassioned pleas for assistance in dealing with storms, floods, droughts, sea level rises and other effects of climate change."" We have the expertise and the manufacturing capacity to help them materially, and to help ourselves at the same time - a fruitful and appropriate use of taxpayer's money where we benefit from our own largess, as I'm sure you would agree.

While taxpayer-funded finance has increased, and the private sector has stepped up with some initiatives, the amount raised could still fall short of the goal of providing $100bn a year to the developing world by 2020.
The 2015 Paris agreement on climate change re-stated the $100bn financial target, but Oxfam says the taxpayer-funded finance from rich countries in 2015-16 stood at about $48bn, or nearly half the amount promised for 2020. 
In a 28-page report published Thursday, entitled Climate Finance Shadow Report 2018: Assessing Progress Towards the $100bn Commitment, Oxfam says funding announced by donor countries involves projects and aid not directly related to climate change.
The aid organisation found that only $16-$21bn of the overseas aid commitments fell under the strict definition of climate finance – if what was counted was just assistance directed towards reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and towards adaptations for climate change effects rather than economic and social development more generally. 
Tracy Carty, senior climate-change policy adviser at Oxfam, said the money flowing to the world’s poorest and most vulnerable to tackle climate change was “sadly inadequate”. 
At the Commonwealth summit held in London in April, governments from the Caribbean and Pacific islands – which make up close to half of the Commonwealth’s members – made impassioned pleas for assistance in dealing with storms, floods, droughts, sea level rises and other effects of climate change.
Carty said: “There’s no reason why rules for calculating climate [finance] should be more lax than those for [general overseas] aid. Governments have to agree new accounting standards for climate finance under the Paris agreement. This is an opportunity to agree fair and robust standards.”
Governments from around the world are meeting in Bonn this week and next under the auspices of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change to discuss how to implement the 2015 Paris agreement in practice. 
Climate finance is a key, though contentious, subject under discussion. Rich countries say that when contributions from the private sector are taken into account the amounts of climate finance are in line with the Paris commitments. But Oxfam said there was “no common methodology” to account for the contributions.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/03/climate-change-aid-poor-nations-paris-cop21-oxfam

So what! What does it matter when you are converting something that is infinite and free. It's not like we have to conserve sunlight for future generations is it.If you wanted more energy from your house panel system then you don't try to make them more efficient (though that is happening too)- you just add a few more panels to the system.And given that the next generations of PV will be probably be sold off a roll like printed wallpaper I doubt we are going to see a shortage of hardware either.https://www.sculpteo.com/blog/2018/01/24/3d-printed-solar-panels-meet-the-renewable-energy-revolution/

The first is the substitution of Heavy Fuel Oil or Marine Fuel Oil with hydrogen, in increasing percentages, in a a (slightly modified) conventional engine. This has been successfully achieved to 100% hydrogen in a Volvo FH16 Heavy Duty truck by a UK company called ULEMCo, and is efficient. In fact, it easily has the potential (depending on the cost of hydrogen) to be more efficient than diesel. The price per kilometer with electrolysed hydrogen from renewable electricity at about €40-60/MWh is maybe 50% less than diesel. And this is with a relatively simple modification of the existing engine; they do hydrogen retrofits for all different types of vehicles, and they all run very successfully. Its a fairly new development, because the (potential) price of hydrogen has only recently got down to the €5-7/kg level recently; and it will improve further. So thats that; this is the way to decarbonise shipping; retrofit existing ship engines and have an electrolyser at the port and some storage and just do it.
The other way to decarbonise is to use a fuel cell rather than an IC engine, which is basically 2 times more efficient than an IC engine. So this is will likely be more possible for ships in a decade or so; although it will obviously be the preferred choice eventually as the savings will be very significant.
The other issue with using hydrogen in an IC engine as they are starting to do now with trucks is that you can have a part-hydrogen part-existing fuel so you can decarbonise incrementally.

You've prompted me to look it up. The new very large container ships have around 60 MW engines (the largest of all has 2 x 32 MW engines)
The largest offshore wind turbine installed so far is 8.8 MW. It would need about 7 of those to give a large contained ship similar power to today (at peak output, which, considering the forward motion of the ship, would very rarely be reached).
However, the turbines wouldn't fit on the ship. Turbines can't be too close together or they interfere with each other. And as the turbines have a tip height of 190 metres, they would cause the ship to capsize. So it might be an attractive idea, but it simply defies the laws of physics.

After a commitment last month to cut greenhouse gas emissions from shipping by at least 50% by 2050, the race is on to find new technologies that can green the 50,000-strong global shipping fleet. Wind power is one of the options being discussed.
International shipping accounts for more than 2% of global carbon dioxide emissions, roughly the same as aircraft. But the 2015 Paris agreement to fight climate change left control of the shipping industry’s emissions to the International Maritime Organisation.
While environment groups applauded the agreement to cut hard and deep by 2050, they pointed out that it falls far short what is technically achievable.
A report published just before the meeting by the International Transport Forum (ITF), a thinktank run by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), found that the industry could achieve up to 95% decarbonisation as early as 2035 using “maximum deployment of currently known technologies.”
Low-tech solutions
The good news is that easy-to-do low-tech solutions can deliver a lot. Maersk, the world’s largest container shipping line, has already discovered it can cut fuel use 30% simply by steaming more slowly.
Because of the wide availability of cheap (and often dirty) fuel, shipping has traditionally been wasteful. Most merchant ships are made of heavy steel rather than lighter aluminium, and don’t bother with obvious energy-saving measures like low-friction hull coatings or recovering waste heat.
More slender ship designs alone could cut fuel use — and hence emissions — by 10-15% at slow speeds and up to 25% at high speeds, says the ITF. But replacing the existing fleet would take time. The average age of today’s shipping fleet is 25 years. Rules of energy efficiency for new ships introduced by the IMO in 2013 will only fully come into force from 2030, meaning that any switch to slender ships would not apply to most ships at sea until mid-century or beyond.
But much could be done more quickly by retrofitting existing ships with technology to cut their fuel use and hence emissions, according to the ITF. Here are just four:
Fitting ships’ bows with a bulbous extension below the water line reduces drag enough to cut emissions 2-7%;
A technique known as air lubrication, which pumps compressed air below the hull to create a carpet of bubbles, also reduces drag and can cut emissions by a further 3%;
Replacing one propeller with two rotating in opposite directions recovers slipstream energy and can make efficiency gains of 8-15%,
Cleaning the hull and painting it with a low-friction coating can deliver gains of up to 5%.
Entirely new ships
Putting together better designs and better fuel will create entirely new kinds of ships in future. And the blueprints are already being drawn up.
The Aquarius Ecoship, a cargo ship devised by a Japanese company called Eco Marine Power, is driven by a phalanx of rigid sails and solar panels. The same system could power oil tankers, cruise ships and much else. It would not, the designers admit, entirely eliminate the need for conventional fuel: Even with large batteries to store the solar and wind energy, back-up would be needed. But it could cut emissions by 40 percent.
Going one better, the Japanese shipping line NYK boasts that its design for a 350m-long container ship, the Super Eco Ship 2030, would use LNG to make hydrogen to run fuel cells. Backed up by solar panels covering the entire ship and 4,000 square metres of sails to catch the wind, the combination could cut emissions by 70%. Or for a completely zero-carbon option, engineers at Wallenius Wilhelmsen, a Scandinavian shipping line, offer the E/S Orcelle, a lightweight cargo ship designed to transport up to 10,000 cars (electric, we trust) on eight decks.
It would be powered by electricity, half coming directly from wind, solar and wave energy, and the other half from converting some of that energy into hydrogen to power fuel cells. The company says the ship could be afloat by 2025.
Today’s ships are in many respects almost indistinguishable from those of a century ago. But the IMO decision to finally get with the global climate agenda has fired the starting gun on what is set to be a race to create a new standard for low-carbon shipping that should be the norm just a few decades from now.
Banishing conventional fuel
Some of the biggest gains will require banishing conventional petroleum-based fuel, says the Sustainable Shipping Initiative, a progressive industry ginger group whose members include cruise lines and commodities shipping lines. Innovations ranging from biofuels to liquefied natural gas (LNG), nuclear reactors to sails to catch the wind, and hydrogen to solar panels have been proposed.
Each has its benefits and drawbacks, and nobody is putting all their money on one solution. Biofuels are problematic because they take land to grow, though specially engineered crops such as algae could change that, says the ITF. While electric engines already operate on some short ferry journeys, the sheer weight and space taken up by batteries on oceangoing ships make them unviable until there are breakthroughs in lithium-ion batteries. Solar power can only augment other power sources.
One innovation already underway is converting ships to run on LNG. There are already more than a hundred LNG-fuelled ships globally. A new generation of giant cruise ships powered this way and carrying up to 7,000 passengers will be launched by MSC Cruises starting in 2022. Some LNG ships claim a reduction in CO2 emissions of 15%, though that depends crucially on keeping leakage of the greenhouse gas methane to a minimum in ships and bunkers.
The first LNG-powered cruise ship is the Viking Grace, operating between Finland and Sweden. This vessel has another claim to fame. As of this April it also boasts the first ship-based “rotor sail” to capture power from the wind. Rotor sails have a large spinning cylinder amidships. Wind hitting the rotor creates a vertical force that can be used to power the ship, a phenomenon known as the Magnus effect. The Viking Line says the extra power will reduce the ship’s CO2 emissions by 900 metric tonnes (1,000 tons) per year.

sugary drinks are not particularly healthy- do you agree?how about alcohol - do you agree a small amount of beer is fine but too much can lead to ill health?
In each case the amounts between health and ill health are small, and are made worse over time. So just a slight increase in sugary drinks over decades will lead to obesity- if you are not burning that sugar you are turning it to fat- slowly.Likewise a healthy beer consumption is has a fine line between long term health effects and health.
Just 300ml of 4% beer is fine - double it and you go well outside health recommendations- but 12 ml of alcohol is the issue, not the 288 ml of water, and doubled it is 24 ml of alcohol and 576 ml of water- you may not see the harm, and drinker will take decades to realise it but it is still there.The water is neutral, it has little effect on overal health [assuming you are not dehydrated ]- likewise 99% of the atmosphere has no effect on the greenhouse effect.

The graph is from Schwalm et al (2012).

Other measures in the literature of future agricultural drought are largely focussed on the Palmer Drought Severity Index (Wehner et al., 2011; Schwalm et al., 2012; Dai, 2013) and project ‘extreme’ drought as the normal climatological state by the end of the 21st century under the high emission scenarios in many mid-latitude locations. However, this measure of agricultural drought has been criticized as overly sensitive to increased temperatures due to a simplified soil moisture model (Hoerling et al., 2012).

Specifically, rising summertime temperatures in the hottest states will curb economic growth. And the states with the hottest summertime temperatures are all located in the South: Florida, Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, Arkansas, and Arizona. All of these states voted for Donald Trump in 2016.
This paper is consistent with a 2015 Nature study that found an optimal temperature range for economic activity. Economies thrive in regions with an average temperature of around 14°C (57°F). Developed countries like the US, Japan, and much of Europe happen to be near that ideal temperature, but continued global warming will shift their climates away from the sweet spot and slow economic growth. The question is, by how much?
The new working paper concludes that if we meet the Paris target of staying below 2°C global warming, US economic growth will only slow by about 5 to 10%. On our current path, including climate policies implemented to date (which would lead to 3–3.5°C global warming by 2100), US economic growth would slow by about 10 to 20%. In a higher carbon pollution scenario (4°C global warming by 2100), US economic growth would slow by about 12 to 25% due to hotter temperatures alone.
House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, who represents Louisiana (the second-hottest state), recently introduced a new anti-carbon tax House Resolution. Scalise introduced similar Resolutions in 2013 with 155 co-sponsors (154 Republicans and 1 Democrat) and in 2015 with 82 co-sponsors (all Republicans). The latest version currently only has one co-sponsor, but more will undoubtedly sign on. All three versions of the Resolution include text claiming, “a carbon tax will lead to less economic growth.”
As the economics research shows, failing to curb global warming will certainly lead to less economic growth. Climate policies could hamper economic growth, but legislation can be crafted to address that concern. 
For example, as Citizens’ Climate Lobby notes in its point-by-point response to the Scalise Resolution, an economic analysis of the group’s proposed revenue-neutral carbon tax policy found that it would modestly spur economic growth (increasing national GDP by $80 to 90bn per year). With this particular policy, 100% of the carbon tax revenue is returned equally to households, and for a majority of Americans, this more than offsets their increased costs. As a result, real disposable income rises, and Americans spend that money, spurring economic growth.
In short, failing to implement climate policies will certainly slow economic growth, especially in hot, red, southern states. A carbon tax, if crafted smartly, could modestly spur economic growth. Blind opposition to carbon taxes is simply bad for the economy and especially bad for Trump voters.
While the Federal Reserve paper focused on the US economy, developing countries will be made much worse off by climate change. Many third world countries are located closer to the equator, where temperatures are already hotter than the temperature sweet spot identified in the 2015 Nature study. A new paper published last week in Science Advances also found that these poorer tropical countries will experience bigger temperature swings in a hotter world. Because of this combination of hot temperatures with bigger swings in countries with fewer resources available to adapt, these poorer nations are the most vulnerable to climate change impacts.
This is a key moral and ethical dilemma posed by global warming: as an important 2011 study concluded, the countries that have contributed the least to the problem are the most vulnerable to its consequences. Meanwhile, wealthy countries are already lagging behind their promised financial aid to help poor countries deal with climate change.
When evaluating climate policies, it’s important to compare the outcomes to the correct baseline. In a world without a carbon tax or other efforts to tackle climate change, temperatures will continue to rise, which will slow economic growth. That’s the baseline against which climate policies need to be compared.
Thus, even if a carbon tax were to slow economic growth, the question is whether it would slow more or less than in the hotter world without the carbon tax. That largely depends on what the rest of the world does, since the US is just one country representing about 14% of global greenhouse gas emissions. But the rest of the world has agreed to try and limit global warming to 2°C in the Paris climate accords – the US is the only country whose leaders are stupid enough to reject that agreement.
Rejecting climate policies like a carbon tax will ensure that the world misses the Paris targets, resulting in slower economic growth. This will particularly hurt poorer countries and Trump’s base in the South. The Federal Reserve Bank paper notes that these states are already among the least developed in the US, based on the Human Development Index. This means that they already have the weakest economies in the US, and failing to take steps to slow global warming will just hamper their economic growth further yet.
In short, if Trump, Scalise, and the rest of the Republican Party want to prevent slowed economic growth in red states, they should be trying to craft an optimal carbon tax, not blindly rejecting the idea outright.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/may/07/global-warming-will-depress-economic-growth-in-trump-country

the consensus in the IPCC is slowly slowly, just like the end of of the lat glaciation.

IPCC AR5 stated: 
Based on current understanding, only the collapse of marine-based sectors of the Antarctic ice sheet, if initiated, could cause global mean sea level to rise substantially above the likely range during the 21st century. This potential additional contribution cannot be precisely quantified but there is medium confidence that it would not exceed several tenths of a meter of sea level rise during the 21st century.

are we all being a little too complacent?
BQEND
That probably depends on the definition of ""all""! But The Royal Society report assessing the science published since AR5 stated:
How might this affect the IPCC statement? With the exception of one prominent study that projects the loss of most West Antarctic ice by 2500 under even moderate warming scenarios, other recent research is still broadly consistent with the AR5 assessment that marine ice sheet instability contribution to sea level rise will “not exceed several tenths of a meter” by 2100. Thus the AR5 projections still represent current understanding, although suggestions that the contribution could be greater than was previously assessed need further evaluation. Quantitative uncertainties, reflected in the spread of results from recent studies, reinforce the need for better understanding of the processes leading to ice shelf and ice sheet retreat. It is moreover virtually certain that sea level rise will continue for many centuries. In a climate as warm as those projected in many models for 2100 and beyond under high emissions scenarios, large parts of both ice sheets would be lost over millennia, leaving sea level many metres higher than present.

The problem with dykes, sea walls and movable dams such as the UK's Thames barrier is their extreme sensitivity to the combined effects of sea level and wave height.
While sea levels are rising at a seemingly modest 3mm/year that rate of rise is itself accelerating. And all indications are that future events resulting from global warming will induce step change increases in that rate.
When a storm causes a few wave peaks to overtop a barrier, that is rarely a problem as it is only the wave tips, and only a few of them. As the mean sea level rises, and/or the wave heights rise due to increasing storm intensities, the amount and frequency by which those waves overtop those walls also rise, as does the total length of that part of each wave which overtops the wall.
Each of these factors greatly increases the total influx per unit length of sea wall. Which means that the rate of seawater influx over the wall rises dramatically,out of all proportion to the increase in sea level and/or storm intensity.

The geothermal heat flux is a critical thermal boundary condition that influences the melting, flow, and mass balance of ice sheets, but measurements of this parameter are difficult to make in ice-covered regions. We re- port the first direct measurement of geothermal heat flux into the base of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), below Subglacial Lake Whillans, determined from the thermal gradient and the thermal conductivity of sedi- ment under the lake. The heat flux at this site is 285 ± 80 mW/m2, significantly higher than the continental and regional averages estimated for this site using regional geophysical and glaciological models. Independent tem- perature measurements in the ice indicate an upward heat flux through the WAIS of 105 ± 13 mW/m2. The difference between these heat flux values could contribute to basal melting and/or be advected from Subglacial Lake Whillans by flowing water. The high geothermal heat flux may help to explain why ice streams and subglacial lakes are so abundant and dynamic in this region.

Later as a young person working in science and combining that with adventure a number of friends and colleagues spent time on various Antarctic and sub-Antarctic bases coming back with stories and beautiful photographs.
Scott's expedition was part of the British Antarctic expedition which took place from 1910 to 1913, overlapping with the Australian from 1911-1914 which was led by Australian Geologist Douglas Mawson who when on Shsckleton's 1907-09 expedition had been in the first party to climb Mt Erebus. Like the roughly concurrent British expedition Mawson's expedition made significant discoveries in geology, glaciology and terrestrial biology as well as charting 3,200 km of coastline.
A joint British, Australian (and) New Zealand Antarctic research expedition in 1929-31, also led by Mawson has been described as an ""Acquisitive exploratory expedition with Mawson making proclamations of British sovereignty over Antarctic lands at each of his five landfalls""; but it also produced 13 volumes of reports on geology, oceanography, meteorology, terrestrial magnetism, zoology and botany between 1935 and 1975. British sovereignty was later ceded to Australia. In the first half of the twentieth British and Australian sovereignty were regarded as much the same.
Mawson lobbied for the establishment of a permanent Australian Antarctic base which was established in 21958 and bears his name. My three friends spent various periods of time in Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic Islands.
One a botanist and British citizen was director of the British South Georgia base at the time they captured by the Argentine Navy and held in Buenos Aires. Amid the fervid reports of that war his comment that they were being well treated and fed good Argentine steak was welcome relief. He brought back slides of sled dogs, wonderful scenery and entire plant ecosystems minus vascular plants.
One an engineer who overwintered at the Australian base also brought back wonderful slides of dogs, scenery, wildlife and weather. He climbed Mt Erebus and undertook a long motorised overland seismic line journey.
The third, 20 years my senior had researched penguins in the early days of the Antarctic Division when Mawson was still alive.

Slowly models became 1 dimensional, and even 2 and 3 dimensional. 
But at core, they all did a really good job because of how they solve the zero or one-dimensional equations known in the 19th century when it comes to planetary accumulation of heat. 
Remember, as planet, the mean global temperature still is a zero-dimensional problem of that black body. 
Those equations can of course not solve the dynamics of space (and as such - glaciers are space as function of dynamics of incoming and outgoing solar radiation). These original models can not solve the more 3-dimentional equations of why both the ocean and atmosphere move heat from equator to the poles either. 
Fact is that models does a fantastic job in solving the energy balance of our planet - because that is a zero order problem. What models do less than fantastic is to simulate the 3 dimensional energy transport as it moves through the 4th dimension of space and interact on the way.

Incorrect.Increased ice formation in the Antarctic was predicted and has happened as recorded by many organisations globally.
Basically, melting ice shelves and land based ice produce fresh water which freezes more easily.

False No, NASA Antarctica study didn’t discredit climate change science By Amy Sherman on Monday, November 20th, 2017 at 1:22 p.m. 
The public has been misled by climate change advocates about the real reason behind the melting of Antarctica’s western ice sheet, claims the website American News.
Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially misleading, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We emailed American News but did not get a reply.
The American News story refers to a real study by NASA, but the headline falsely suggests that the study debunks climate change advocates. A NASA scientist involved in the study told us the headline is inaccurate.
Here’s the real story: On Nov. 7, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., issued a summary of the study about the heat source under West Antarctica. The paper, ""Influence of a West Antarctic mantle plume on ice sheet basal conditions,"" was published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth.
The heat source isn’t new or increasing, but may help explain why the ice sheet collapsed so rapidly in an earlier area of climate change and remains unstable.
Some 30 years ago, a scientist at the University of Colorado Denver suggested that heat from a mantle plume under Marie Byrd Land might explain regional volcanic activity and a topographic dome feature, NASA wrote. Recent seismic imaging has supported this concept.
 
""At the end of the last ice age around 11,000 years ago, the ice sheet went through a period of rapid, sustained ice loss when changes in global weather patterns and rising sea levels pushed warm water closer to the ice sheet -- just as is happening today,"" NASA said.
Erik Ivins, a scientist and the second author on the study, told PolitiFact that the study didn’t address climate change.
""The study itself is about steady state conditions that would exist at the bottom of the ice sheet for many many millions of years,"" he said. ""We think of climate change as occurring 10 years, 100 years, maybe 500 years -- our study has nothing to do with those time scales.""
The NASA study is about the bottom of the ice sheet. Climate change has had an impact on the top of the ice sheet. Warmer ocean waters intruding on the ice shelf causes the ice shelves to break up. When grounded ice sheets exit the land and go into the water that causes sea level rise
""This study doesn’t discredit that,"" he says. ""Nothing in our paper has anything to do with climate change.""

The volcanoes on Antarctica must almost all be inactive or they would have been discussed before. The other two next to Mt. Erebus are both dormant, that has been known since James Ross ""discovered them"". We are looking at volcanic activity not erupting volcanoes.

When Mawson base was established in the 1950's a breeding pack of sledge was an important part of the operation. The last Antarctic sledge dogs were removed from the continent in 1994 due to fears of Distemper spreading to Antarctic seals.

I think even deniers know that ice-ages are paced by cycles in the Earth orbit that cause small changes to how much, and at which latitudes and seasons we receive peak solar insolation here on Earth. These are marginal changes, but our internal dynamics amply it to the extent that we get sea-level changes by 10 meters per 1000 year (as average trend). 
Now, Ever since Milancowich a century ago, we have known that when we solve the equations, there is also a weak c. 400,000 harmonic going on. Mainly caused by our big planets tugging on our orbit. 
But we only had around 2.5 million years of recent ice-age signals to trace - so that provide only 6 repetitions of a harmonic - and that is not enough (also because the Plio Pleistocene also changed own harmonics internally on our planet around a million years ago) 
So - last week came results from rock cores going hundreds of millions of years back. 
And here is the scary news - that tiny tiny amount of solar energy that these almost half a million year wobbles create by the solar system is fixed in the rocks under us - so much that science can measure it. 
https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-05/teia-iar050418.php
It is important to remember that GHG gasses can at zero order be considered as external (like orbital changes) instead of internal (like El Nino variations). 
And when stuff happening hundreds of million years ago - in the age of dinosaurs pick up this orbital signal - we should be seriously conserned as we now provide change in our energy balance of several Watt per square meters - within time-scales measured in decades. 
I understand that deniers still talking about hockey-gate think that paleoclimate is there to prove the AGW hypothesis. This is wrong. Paleoclimate exists to provide long time-series and sensitivity information. 
For those who think paleoclimate is slave of models - rethink that. It is paleoclimate that has continously been telling the modellers involved in IPCC that the estimates grossly underestimate the risk of rapid degliaction (models are nowhere near to simulate what reality has shown to be facts). Models do well with steady state simulations (even last glacial maximum conditions and Eocene conditions that paleoclimate provides for them as test-bench mean conditions - but when it comes calculate transitions - they are sadly bad at that even though they are getting better. 
That they are doing bad is not the fault of bad understanding of physics - it is limited by how many Flops the biggest computers in the world can do. 
Of course a climate model from 1990 or 2010 could not predict the sub-glacial energy transfer pathways. Paleoclimate studies could not either. 
But science can know that there are some serious issues with this issue - and with the balmy 3 degree warmer planet they promise us by on purpose mixing up the feedback sensitivity of 2xCO2 with some idea that it can not be more than 3 degrees whatever we do as their private sensitivity (or giving carbon-only sensitivity). 
I have said this before, science is running after the pace of change.

The debate that is still happening despite these conditions continues to become more surreal with each passing day.
I mean the environmental progress I have observed in the last ~40 years (when many environmental issues really started to get wide public airing) has been beyond pitiful. What does this say about our dominant value systems ability to recognize and address environmental health?
It seems that many are waiting for technological/market or theological miracle instead of doing the things we know will work.
 Let's face it if we want to maintain anything even remotely resembling life-as-we-know-it we are simply going to have use a great deal less energy; anything short of this is just going to prolong the slide a little longer. 
This idea, an idea so widespread, dominant, and reinforced that it is very rarely questioned in public, that we are going to have to match (and then greatly exceed in the coming decades) the amount of energy we are now generating largely with fossil carbon with renewables is an environmental non-starter, we have lost before we are even on the field with this kind of thinking. 
If you understand the physics of energy and the flow of energy through the living world we call ecology and you are able to include cruial contextual elements of time and space (natural history/ecology/environmental history) then you understand that we are very limited when it comes to options that will actually work within the very small window of opportunity that we have left.
 I know this flies directly in the face of capitalist/consumerist/progress dogma and I know that this change is not likely to happen; how very sad. 
We can live lives in which we are happier and more content while owning less and using less, but to do so we will have to have an honest look at what things are truly most important to us and then realize that these things are being severely threatened from all sides.

We found no significant trend in the 1979–2010 ice sheet integrated SMB components, which confirms the results from Monaghan et al. [2006].

The 32‐year (1979–2010) SMB trend is depicted in Figure S1 in theauxiliary material. In coastal Adélie Land, a negative trend occurs (∼−2 to ∼−10 mm y−2), whereas a positive, but insignificant trend is found on the western side of the Atlantic Peninsula and in coastal Dronning Maud Land (∼2 to ∼10 mm y−2). These trends are only locally significant in Adélie Land, where strong interannual and multi‐annual variability is also observed [Agosta et al., 2012]... ...No significant trend in the ice sheet‐integrated SMB is found over the period 1979–2010, and only (insignificant) trends exist regionally.

When people suggest a lack of significant sea level rise in one location means global mean sea level rise (GMSLR) is following suit I offer something like the following.
Counterintuitively sea level does not rise uniformly around the world for a number of reasons.
There’s the subsidence of land like around river deltas, lift of land from glacial rebound and plate tectonics, ocean currents and winds, and the gravitational fields of the massive ice sheets.
The ice sheets have so much mass that they pull the ocean strongly towards them. As they lose mass the ocean relaxes away. So for example the loss of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet would cause 3.3m of GMSLR, but over 4m in the Northern Hemisphere with its more heavily populated coasts.

You then provide links to a University of Texas website and a NASA website both about subglacial volcanism under the Thwaites Glacier and in nearby Marie Byrd Land in West Antarctica respectively. 
You quote from the first of these sites of geothermal flux hotspots under the glacier of 100 to 200 watt per square metre. The same site puts these hotspots in context as to how much of the geothermal subglacial melting contributes to overall glacial melting.
""Knowledge of the heat distribution beneath the Thwaites Glacier is crucial information that enables ice sheet modelers to more accurately predict the response of the glacier to the presence of a warming ocean.""
It's the warming ocean which is doing most of the melting of glaciers from below around the coast of Antarctica in locations where glaciers are grounded below sea level. The sites of geothermal melting beneath the Thwaites Glacier are some distance inland and are producing meltwater streams and lakes under the ice which lubricate the glacier but are not a major contributor to overall glacial melting. Their lubrication enables the glacier to flow more quickly down the ice stream toward the warming sea which does most of the melting.
While spots of high heat flux per square metre exist below the glacier they are small in area compared to the large areas of the coastline where glaciers are in contact with the warming sea.
As the NASA site you linked to states ""The stability of an icesheet is closely related to how much water libricates it from below"". Neither of these two links is suggesting that subglacial geothermal melting makes a significant contribution to overall glacial melting, which is why the article above did not mention it in that context.

And, since the North and South Pole regions contain lots of ice, anyone who wants to see evidence of climate change can look there.
But beyond this simplistic view, things can get pretty complex. First, it’s important to recognize that the Arctic and the Antarctic are very different places. In the Arctic, almost all the ice is floating on water – there is very little land. So, we talk about ‘sea ice’ in the north, formed from frozen sea water. On the other hand, Antarctica is a massive land mass that is covered by ice formed from snowfall (called an ‘ice sheet’). There is some floating ice around the perimeter of the land, but the vast majority of Antarctic ice is on land.
This difference not only affects how these regions response to climate change, but it also impacts their importance. We know that when floating ice melts, the ocean levels will not rise, because the ice was already floating in the water. But, when land ice melts, the liquid water flows into the ocean and causes the water levels to rise. So, at least from a sea-level perspective, land ice is more important than floating ice.
There are other differences between the north and south. One feature of the south is that there is a strong current that travels around Antarctica and partially shields it from waters elsewhere in the ocean. The Nasa Jet Propulsion Laboratory provides a good summary of some of the differences between the poles.
With global warming, both of the poles are warming quite quickly, and this warming is causing ice to melt in both regions. When we think of ice melting, we may think of it melting from above, as the ice is heated from the air, from sunlight, or from infrared energy from the atmosphere. But in truth, a lot of the melting comes from below. For instance, in the Antarctic, the ice shelves extend from the land out over the water. The bottom of the ice shelf is exposed to the ocean. If the ocean warms up, it can melt the underside of the shelf and cause it to thin or break off into the ocean.
A new study, recently published in Science Advances, looked at these issues. One of the goals of this study was to better understand whether and how the waters underneath the shelf are changing. They had to deal with the buoyancy of the waters. We know that the saltier and colder water is, the denser it is. 
Around Antarctica, water at the ocean surface cools down and becomes saltier. These combined effects make the surface waters sink down to the sea floor. But as ice melt increases, fresh water flows into the ocean and interrupts this buoyancy effect. This “freshening” of the water can slow down or shut down the vertical mixing of the ocean. When this happens, the cold waters at the surface cannot sink. The deeper waters retain their heat and melt the ice from below. 
The study incorporated measurements of both temperature and salinity (saltiness) at three locations near the Dalton Iceberg Tongue on the Sabrina Coast in East Antarctica. The measurements covered approximately an entire year and gave direct evidence of seasonal variations to the buoyancy of the waters. The researchers showed that a really important component to water-flow patterns were ‘polynyas.’ These are regions of open water that are surrounded by ice, typically by land ice on one side and sea ice on the other side.
A satellite photograph of a polynya is shown below. When waters from the polynya are cold and salty, the waters sink downwards and form a cold curtain around the ice shelf. However, when the waters are not salty (because fresh water is flowing into the polynya), this protective curtain is disrupted and warm waters can intrude from outside, leading to more ice melt.
Based on this study, we may see increased ice loss in the future – sort of a feedback loop. That concerns us because it will mean more sea level rise (which is already accelerating), and more damage to coastal communities. I asked the lead author, Alesandro Silvano about this work:
We found that freshwater from melting ice shelves is already enough to stop formation of cold and salty waters in some locations around Antarctica. This process causes warming and freshening of Antarctic waters. Ocean warming increases melting of the Antarctic Ice Sheet, causing sea level to rise. Freshening of Antarctic waters weakens the currents that trap heat and carbon dioxide in the ocean, affecting the global climate. In this way local changes in Antarctica can have global implications. Multiple sources of evidence exist now to show that these changes are happening. However, what will happen in Antarctica in the next decades and centuries remains unclear and needs to be understood.
This is just another reason to take scientists seriously and act to slow down climate change before it is too late.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/may/09/global-warming-is-melting-antarctic-ice-from-below

“The Kinder Morgan pipeline carrying dirty tar sands oil would be a step backward in our efforts to solve the climate crisis,” Gore tweeted on Thursday.
He went on to say that he stands with John Horgan, the premier of British Columbia and Gregor Robertson, the mayor of Vancouver, as well as, “all of the Canadians – including the First Nations – who are fighting to stop this destructive pipeline.”
For months, Alberta and British Columbia have been locked in a standoff over plans, spearheaded by Texas-based Kinder Morgan, to expand an existing pipeline and lay nearly 1,000km of new pipe from Alberta’s oil sands to the Pacific coast. 
The $7.4bn project, which still needs to obtain numerous local permits and approvals, would nearly triple the flow of Alberta’s landlocked bitumen to the west coast.
It has been bitterly opposed by some in British Columbia, who point to the impact that a dramatic rise in tanker traffic could have on the region’s southern resident killer whales, a population already on the knife-edge of extinction, as well as the province’s multibillion dollar tourism industry.
Others point to the existing pipeline’s track record; since 1961, the Trans Mountain pipeline has reported approximately 82 spills, with around 30% of those spills occurring along the pipeline’s route.
Efforts to stop the expansion have heated up in recent weeks, with thousands of people joining indigenous-led protests in British Columbia. More than 200 people have been arrested for blocking the entrance of a facility belonging to Trans Mountain, including two federal MPs.
The political stalemate over the project catapulted into the national conversation last month after Kinder Morgan Canada announced it was halting all non-essential spending on the project and planned to walk away unless it saw a clear path to completion by the end of May.
In response, Justin Trudeau said Canada’s government was prepared to use taxpayer dollars to push forward with the proposed plans. “The Trans Mountain expansion is a vital strategic interest to Canada – it will be built,” he told reporters.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/11/al-gore-canada-kinder-morgan-oil-pipeline

In China and many developing countries, the existing coal-fired power plants are often so grossly inefficient that replacing them with new modern coal burning plants for the next thirty years yields more energy and still should result in significant cuts to CO2 and other pollutants as long as the grade of the coal used doesn't change for the worse. Also, particularly in India, but in other countries too, the lack of power in rural areas has resulted in political calls for coal-fired plants that aren't particularly farsighted yet expose the lack of western leadership in pushing the adooption of solar and wind and other renewable technologies more urgently in such countries. That said, just because over 1,600 plants are planned or under construction in those countries doesn't mean they will all be built or will all operate for as long as planned if they are built. And developed nations like the US have caused and are still causing the bulk of the damage, so we would be wise to swiftly clean up our act and help as best we can the nations still relying on coal to move to other sources of power sooner rather than later.

Overall, 1,600 coal plants are planned or under construction in 62 countries, said Urgewald, which uses data from the Global Coal Plant Tracker portal. The new plants would expand the world's coal-fired power capacity by 43 per cent.

Four former environment and climate change secretaries from three parties told the Observer they had concerns about “toothless” plans announced by the government last week, which suggested the new post-Brexit green watchdog would lack the power to take the government to court.
Senior Tory MPs are also said to have concerns about the move. It comes after a row over post-Brexit green laws between Michael Gove, the environment secretary, and the chancellor, Philip Hammond.
Gove, a leading Brexiter, has been keen for the new watchdog to have identical powers to those currently enjoyed by the European commission, which can fine governments that fail to meet their green obligations. However, the Treasury is said to have concerns about the impact on post-Brexit growth and construction.
A cross-party group of peers is planning a rebellion this week that would keep all the green protections currently in place, including the power to take legal action against the government.
Among those backing the rebellion is John Gummer, now Lord Deben, the former Tory environment secretary and current chairman of the UK committee on climate change. “The government has moved significantly on this, but the new watchdog has got to have the power that we now have as members of the European Union – to call the government to account,” he said. “There is no such power in the current consultation document.
“We wouldn’t have had any of the action that we’ve had up until now unless the EU structures had the power to hold the government to account. The government committed itself to putting into British law all the protections and commitments that we have in the EU. Unless we make these changes, you don’t do that.”
Green groups immediately spoke out after Gove’s “Green Brexit” consultation, published last week, contained no commitment to give the new watchdog power to initiate legal action. It suggested it would have the power only to issue advisory notices. However, there is still time for the watchdog’s remit to be strengthened before its formation.
Former climate change secretaries called for an urgent rethink. Labour’s Ed Miliband said: “Climate change is the biggest environmental challenge the world faces but these proposals for a weak regulator with no proper legal powers are yet more evidence of the government’s continued failure to match their rhetoric with action.
Gove’s watchdog is a toothless mutt
“Michael Gove claimed to have been deeply moved by David Attenborough’s Blue Planet. But his watchdog is about as toothless as a jellyfish.”
The Lib Dem MP Ed Davey, who served as climate change secretary under the coalition government, said the post-Brexit plans would leave Britain with “a weaker environmental regime than Trump’s America”. He added: “Before we joined the EU, we were called the dirty man of Europe. We cleaned up our act during our membership. Over time, Britain has become one of the champions of environmental legislation. This will completely damage that reputation. The threat is we will go back to being the dirty man of Europe once again.”
Chris Huhne, who also held the role under the coalition, said: “Gove’s watchdog is a toothless mutt. Basic legal principles in EU law like polluter pays and the precautionary principle have been ditched to allow a sludge brown not green Brexit.”
Amy Mount, of the Greener UK coalition, said: “The government’s plans for this toothless watchdog would leave us with weaker protections after Brexit. The power to take the government to court is a strong deterrent and then a vital last resort when the law is not being followed. This means we need more than advisory notices if our air is dangerously polluted, or wildlife under serious threat.
“It is also very troubling that the watchdog will not enforce law relating to climate change, despite ministers’ claims of global leadership on this urgent challenge. Bizarrely, this would mean that after Brexit the climate will be less protected than every other aspect of our environment.
“There is still time for the government to live up to its stated ‘world leading’ ambitions, but time is fast running out.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/12/peers-to-rebel-over-toothless-environment-watchdog-brexit

The Turnbull government published new quarterly emissions data late on Friday which reveals Australia’s climate pollution increased by 1.5% in the year to December 2017. 
The expansion in LNG exports and production is identified as the major contributor to the increase, but the data shows a jump in emissions across all sectors – including waste, agriculture and transport – except for electricity, the one area that recorded a decrease in emissions.
In particular, the department’s data shows a 10.5% increase in fugitive emissions from the production, processing, transport, storage, transmission and distribution of fossil fuels such as coal, crude oil and natural gas, driven by an increase of 17.6% in natural gas production.

It comes at a time when the government has been pressuring states and territories to lift bans on fracking for new unconventional gas development and just weeks after the Northern Territory announced it would end its ban on fracking.
Publication of the data also comes after Australia recorded its hottest and driest April in 21 years. 
Australia’s emissions levels are now higher than they were in 2012 and have climbed 3.6% since the carbon price was repealed in 2014.
Between 2007 and 2013, under the previous federal government, carbon pollution declined by more than 11%. 
The Australian Conservation Foundation said on Monday it was embarrassing that a developed country such as Australia was recording rising climate pollution, and the Turnbull government was failing on climate policy.
“This data confirms pollution is rising from transport, industry and gas production because there is no plan from Canberra to replace burning polluting coal, oil and gas with clean energy,” the ACF’s Gavan McFadzean said.
“The federal budget contained no new money to incentivise industry and landowners to clean-up their act. The Climate Change Authority will be worse off to the tune of $550,000. Yet there is money for miners: the diesel fuel rebate remains in place.”
The organisation also questioned why the government was years behind markets such as the United States and Canada in the introduction of tougher pollution standards for vehicles. 
Labor’s climate change and energy spokesman, Mark Butler, said seasonally adjusted data showed emissions jumped by 0.83% in just the last quarter alone.
“Yet, just last week, Malcolm Turnbull’s government delivered a budget which has no policy to drive down pollution and combat climate change,” he said.“Acting on climate change is not a priority – it is not even on the agenda – for this out-of-touch government.”
Blair Palese, 350.org Australia’s CEO, said “with numbers like these, Australia may as well not be signed up to Paris to act on climate because we’re making no progress at all.”
“We can blame the federal government’s inability to stand up to fossil fuel interests and its failure to give any meaningful support to renewable energy for Australia’s increasing emissions.”
Matthew Doman, director at the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (APPEA) said it was not surprising that the industry’s emissions profile had grown alongside an increase in production.
“The report highlights that the growth in emissions from gas production is less than the growth in gas production,” he said.
“This highlights that the emissions intensity of Australian gas production is declining as the industry becomes more efficient and improves its carbon performance.”
He said the industry managed fugitive emissions in a range of ways, including through the use of “green completions”, a process that captures and filters out impurities from wells instead of burning them off.

After 14 children and three adults were massacred at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, it was students – not parents, teachers or political representatives – who organised themselves to campaign for changes to US gun laws. The March for Our Lives demonstration in Washington, DC on 24 March was accompanied by sister marches around the world: millions of young people supporting each other and demanding policy reform. Lead campaigner Emma González, a high-school student who now has more than 1.5m Twitter followers, made a call to arms for her peers to: “Fight for your lives before it’s someone else’s job.”
González is one of many teenagers shattering the stereotypes of the lazy, entitled, self-obsessed millennial. More and more teenagers are noisily questioning the world they’re inheriting and demanding things work differently. Here, we meet some of the young activists whose voices are increasingly impossible to dismiss.
Last spring, I was watching the news when there was a report on girls in the UK missing school because they couldn’t afford menstrual products. Some were using toilet paper, newspaper or socks. Thinking about girls my age going through this hit me hard. The report gained attention, but I felt the government was sweeping it under the carpet and we needed to pressure them to do something. So I did what felt normal to me and went online and started a petition. It calls for free menstrual products for children on free school meals. I didn’t imagine even getting 100 signatures. But in between revising for AS exams, I emailed as many people, companies and universities as I could. I asked my parents to send it around their work. My dad was a bit reluctant at first, but he did.
There’s huge embarrassment about periods, but it’s something half the world’s population will go through for a week every month. That it’s a taboo holds us back in achieving gender equality. Within two weeks, the petition reached 2,000 signatures. Comments were divided between people being shocked that this happens and others saying it affects them or their friends. Hearing that made me want to fight harder.
When the general election was announced, I emailed the parties. The Green party and Women’s Equality party both replied and included a pledge in their manifesto. I was so frustrated I couldn’t vote. Then in December we organised a protest outside Theresa May’s bedroom; more than 1,000 people came and shouted. To date, 150,000 people have signed the petition. It’s sad when adults are surprised to hear a young person being politically vocal. Young people are angry about the state of the world and a lot of us use social media to articulate that. I get asked to speak a lot.
The other morning, a TV station sent a car to school, I left for an hour, spoke on the issue and came back to a history lesson. My parents are supportive and as surprised as me that this has taken off. My dad went with me to the Women’s March, which was cool. But sometimes my mum can get annoyed if I’m doing lots of campaign stuff with exams coming up.
If someone tells me I should be in school right now, I know that they don’t see the bigger picture. Earth’s ability to support human life is falling apart and if things don’t change in the next five to 10 years, nothing’s going to matter.
I’ll finish high school, but right now this is the most important thing I can do with my time. Myself and 20 other kids are currently suing the Trump administration for violating our constitutional rights for failure to act on climate change. We originally launched it against the Obama administration a few years ago. The US government has known the fossil fuel industry is having a negative impact on our climate, yet they have been offering them subsidies and opening up land to exploration. We have just heard that we are going to trial in October.
I’m also involved in law actions and civil disobedience to stop fracking around my hometown of Boulder. In 2012, my friends and I successfully helped push for a five-year ban.
From a young age, I was aware of my part in protecting our planet. I was three or four the first time I went on a protest, and six when I started speaking at them. I was born in Colorado and have spent a lot of time in Mexico. My entire childhood was travelling, hanging out in nature and learning about my family’s indigenous heritage. My dad taught me that we have a responsibility to protect the Earth the way that our ancestors did.
I’ve spoken at the UN about my work. I was surprised how disrespectful, disconnected and sterile it was. The delegates were on their phones, not listening. They perked up when they heard I was just 15 years old. The power of me speaking wasn’t for them but for the millions of people my speech has since reached online.
The world is seeing how powerful young people are and how things are going to change. Adults on CNN and in the United States specifically, they can argue and cover gossip about Trump and his hair and porn stars. But young people are mobilising on the streets.
There’s so much power in what’s happening within our generation. We don’t have the respect we deserve, but I think it’s coming.
I’ve been racially abused since about 12, but it was never seen as an important thing to tackle. At secondary school, white children called me disgusting things, but teachers would turn a blind eye. And not just to racism, but sexism, homophobia, transphobia. There’s also internal racism in the Eritrean community. My dad is called names because he has darker skin. It all comes from preconceived ideas that black is less, or the darker you are the lower you are in terms of income, society and politics.
Because these problems weren’t taken seriously, I normalised them. But when I moved to a sixth form where the majority of students are black girls, I was surrounded by political and social consciousness. The more educated I got, the angrier I became. Last summer, I joined an organisation called the Advocacy Academy and, with a small group of people my age, we launched a campaign challenging the image and under-representation of black people in the media. We recreated iconic posters, such as Doctor Who, Titanic and Harry Potter, and made all the characters black. The campaign is rooted in personal experiences and I’ve gone from talking about things with my friends in the lunch hall to speaking about them nationally.
The Academy has revolutionised the way I think. Back in the day I definitely upheld toxic masculine identities. I’d tell myself that I didn’t cry. Challenging gender norms wasn’t of interest to me because I wanted to fit in with my friends. But I’ve learned to let go of my ego and be vulnerable so I can say what’s on my mind. It’s allowed me to take all the cold anger I have built up over years and turn it into something good. I’ve learned to become an ally to many other issues that don’t affect me directly.
After university, I don’t just want to get a really good job, buy a big house and forget about my community. I want to change something and challenge the status quo.
Even before the war in Syria, I wanted to change society, but I knew I needed to get educated to do that. Back then, we had a normal life. We went to school every day and saw our friends. The war started when I was 11 or 12. Going to school became difficult. There were people fighting on the ground, there would be bombing, sometimes bullets. Sometimes school was just closed because of budgets. My father is a teacher and he lost his job.
We left Syria five years ago, when I was 14. I was so worried about my future and education. We went to a refugee camp in Jordan. I didn’t expect there to be a school, but I was happy to discover a caravan with a tent and some teachers. There was no electricity. We studied computing from a book. In the winter, it got so cold it was hard to focus on the teacher.
But school gave me hope. And I started to encourage other girls and boys to go, too. I would walk from tent to tent, caravan to caravan, persuading kids and parents. I met people who thought that because we are refugees, education isn’t important any more, or that they’d continue school when they returned to Syria. I encouraged people to believe in themselves and not give up. I met kids who’d never been to school, and girls who saw marriage as their profession. Some parents told me it had nothing to do with me. I fought hard for everyone to believe that we can’t do anything without knowledge and got involved with international charities who supported me.
What’s happening in my country is not of our making and it’s not our fault that we’re losing our rights. One day, we’ll be able to return, and we need to have knowledge. After three years in Jordan, my family came to the UK. Last year I became the youngest and first refugee Unicef Goodwill Ambassador. I’m now on my way to university and am doubling my activism.
I came out at 14. When you’re a young LGBTQ+ person and you come out, you’re put in this position where you are suddenly expected to educate your peers. I’d be in a lesson and someone would ask me an incredibly inappropriate question. People feel like they have permission to access all of you when you’re still figuring things out for yourself.
At the same time, someone in my class was sending me online anonymous, violent messages, telling me to kill myself. My school didn’t know what to do with it. At one point, they had contacted my parents, pushing me to come out to them, too, and it all became detrimental to my mental health.
I don’t come from a political family, but I’ve always had a strong sense of fairness. After coming out, I started making educational YouTube videos on LGBTQ+ issues and people watched them. I also worked with my school to establish support systems and visibility for LGBTQ+ pupils. I got together with teachers to set up a group. We held events and assemblies, and suddenly others wanted to join. I worked with the school to run surveys of the staff and students, so we knew the issues that needed addressing.
As part of a Stonewall youth programme, I started a YouTube series called Queeries. I invite anyone to submit questions, however inappropriate or silly, and I sit down with another LGBTQ+ person and we answer them. Part of that is creating space for difficult questions, but also to give others a platform. I am very aware of the fact that I am white, middle-class and able-bodied, and there are a lot of things I feel I can’t speak to. I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and autism, but campaigning is always something I’ve felt able to do.
I was happy to do the work with my school, and I know that education resources are stretched, but schools shouldn’t rely on pupils to affect change. That puts pressure on young people to challenge things adults should be addressing.
Many young people think they aren’t going to amount to anything because of all the headlines we read. But that’s designed to discredit our concerns about how the world’s being run. A lot of people in control are invested in the world as it currently stands; to suggest that things aren’t great the way they are scares them.
We are going to be the kids you read about in textbooks. Not because we’re going to be another statistic about mass shooting in America, but because we are going to be the last mass shooting. Just like Tinker v Des Moines, we are going to change the law. And it’s going to be due to the tireless effort of the school board, the faculty members, the family members and most of all the students. The students who are dead, the students still in the hospital, the students now suffering PTSD, the students who had panic attacks during the vigil because the helicopters would not leave us alone, hovering over the school for 24 hours a day.
If President Trump wants to tell me to my face that it was a terrible tragedy and how it should never have happened and maintain telling us how nothing is going to be done about it, I’m going to happily ask him how much money he received from the National Rifle Association.
It doesn’t matter because I already know: $30m. And divided by the number of gunshot victims in the United States in the first one and a half months of 2018 alone, that comes out to being $5,800 each. Is that how much these people are worth to you, Trump? If you don’t do anything to prevent this from continuing to occur, that number of gunshot victims will go up and the number that they are worth will go down. And we will be worthless to you.
To every politician who is taking donations from the NRA, shame on you. The people in the government who were voted into power are lying to us. And us kids seem to be the only ones who notice and call BS. Companies trying to make caricatures of the teenagers these days, saying that all we are is self-involved and trend-obsessed and they hush us into submission when our message doesn’t reach the ears of the nation, we are prepared to call BS.
Politicians who sit in their gilded House and Senate seats funded by the NRA telling us nothing could have been done to prevent this, we call BS. They say tougher guns laws do not decrease gun violence. We call BS. They say a good guy with a gun stops a bad guy with a gun. We call BS. They say guns are just tools like knives and are as dangerous as cars. We call BS. They say no laws could have prevented the hundreds of senseless tragedies that have occurred. We call BS. That us kids don’t know what we’re talking about, that we’re too young to understand how the government works. We call BS.

BQEND
So what? That's not the point.
BQEND
Incorrect.That is the point.
You've chosen to highlight an article that uses an unscientific and statistically irrelevant period.
The point of the 30 years definition for climate is to avoid the internal variables that are the ""noise"", in order to detect the underlying trend.
This is text book stuff.
BQSTART
what happens to your argument when recently those same extremes are happening while it's cooling?
BQEND
When you can demonstrate its cooling over the relevant period you might have a point.
But as your article fails to do that, and as SirMartin has pointed out starts from a high point from one of the known internal variables (ENSO/El Nino), it is a scientific failure.
BQSTART
Perhaps those so called ""extremes"" are just the usual natural variations that California always experiences.

It's your evidence free assertions vs scientific study. Who do you think is going to be impressed by that. Here is some evidence that you missed...
BQSTART
Beginning in the mid-1980s, forest wildfire activity in western US forests underwent an abrupt and sustained regional increase, with nearly two-thirds of that increase concentrated in forests of the Northern US Rocky Mountains between 42° and 50° N latitude [1]. This change in Northern US Rocky Mountain forest wildfire has been linked to climatic factors such as warmer temperatures, dry summers, below-average winter precipitation or earlier spring snowmelt [1–4]. Analyses of reconstructed paleo wildfire and climate indices have also shown similar associations between widespread Northern US Rockies fire years and warm springs combined with warm and dry summers [5,6]. Warming temperatures increase vapour pressure deficit and evapotranspiration, with effects on wildfire, other disturbance and mortality, and forest productivity [7]. 
The timing, extent and severity of wildfire in western US forests is strongly influenced by climate: over seasonal to decadal time scales antecedent climate shapes fuel characteristics such as their amount, connectivity and structure, while seasonal to interannual climate variability governs fuel flammability [8–10]. A changing climate consequently alters forest fuels characteristics across multiple time horizons.

BQSTART
Bottomline is that even if incindiary fires were the cause of 60% of acreage burned back in 1930, acreage burned due to wildfires back then would still be more than today. The data doesn't suggest what percent of acreage was burned by incindiary fires, but I would suggest 60% would be a very high number since those were controlled burns.

Hmm...denial of what? I re-stated a scientific fact (and shared a piece with a study link), and you all had a fit about it.

Thus, region 34 began 2002 near the maximum TWS capacity, and it gradually returned to average90 (−8.9 ± 1.2 Gt yr−1) with 99% of normal precipitation during the GRACE period.

Agree....but nothing you posted conclusively discredits him. As usual...with old data, there is no conclusion, just some interpretations of what likely happened, not what conclusively happened. Those I say you are both wrong. 
Bottomline is that even if incindiary fires were the cause of 60% of acreage burned back in 1930, acreage burned due to wildfires back then would still be more than today. The data doesn't suggest what percent of acreage was burned by incindiary fires, but I would suggest 60% would be a very high number since those were controlled burns. 
Lastly, this thread makes no mention of the impact of suppression on recent wildfire events (past few decades or so). 
Bottomline, the facts are that more acreage burned in the early 20th century. That is a plain fact with data supported by US Forest Service. Your only valid point to that was that we don't know how many of those acres were wildfire burned or otherwise.

None of this argues against global warming. The 1950s was the last decade cooler than the previous decade, the next five decades were all warmer on average than the decade before. Two year cooling cycles, even if they set records, are statistical noise compared to the long-term trend. Moreover, the case for global warming does not rely primarily on observed warming; it has models, historical studies and other science behind it. Another point is both February 1998 and February 2016 were peak El Niño months so the record declines are starting from high peaks—but it's also true that there have been many other peak El Niño months in the past century and none were followed by such dramatic cooling.

The scientists who made emission scenarios in the 1980s of corse knew that Asia and South America would need to increase emissions fast to catch up with us in the west. 
This is also why IPCC emission science (Done by scientists of economics and production and such social sciences) has continously suggested that global emissions will rise until minimum 2050 - and not really start to drop substantially until 2100. 
As we also know - the number of climate gasses in our atmosphere is an accumulative number - so best guess from science and economical theory and social and tech and production scientists has always predicted that we will cross year 2100 by increasing the climate forcing (everone knows that the negative emission scenarios are science fiction because humans will never spend energy to pull CO2 in diluted form out of the atmosphere - humans can not even make pulling CO2 out of high density exhaust with profit). 
The interesting part of understanding the message of climate science is that despite climate science always used models of peak emissions happening in 2030 as best - they went into denial mode. 
And worse - now they got elected people who are politicians to voice their prayer. In other words, people who are so bad at science that they think CO2 will fall if we reduce emissions in 2029. 
There are surprisingly many people that think if one reduce the amount of air blown into a balloon by 50% the balloon wil start to shrink in size. 
IPCC has of course always used the ""pathways"" coming from smart economics and technological and social science as forcing. 
We have always emitted near the top level of such ideas - because maybe scientists are so idealistic that they think that western nations would cut back fast. To allow emerging nations to emit in being built - as compensation? 
Science is naive - we choose worst case scenario. 
Plan for 1000 ppm in rapid ncrease by 2100 is the only advice one can give humans. Oil and profit wins.

 So it appears that much of the pre-1960 data were related to incendiary forest fires (per http://www.interfire.org/features/wildfires.asp, an incendiary fire is one that is set intentionally) and not to true wildfires. The post-1960 dataset that I analyzed only contained data for wildfires; the National Interagency Fire Center explicitly separates the wildfire data from the prescribed fire data. Hence, comparisons to earlier data may indeed be akin to comparing apples to oranges, as Magma cautioned earlier in their comment.

California will get the worst of all possible worlds – more flooding in the winter, less available water in the summer.
Three decades later, California has been ravaged by just this sort of weather whiplash. The state experienced its worst drought in over a millennium from 2012 to 2016, followed immediately by its wettest year on record in 2017. The consequences have been similarly extreme, including hellish record wildfires, narrowly-avoided catastrophic flooding at Oroville Dam, and deadly mudslides.
A study published last month in Nature Climate Change found that these wet and dry extremes will only worsen in California as temperatures continue to rise. As lead author Daniel Swain wrote:
most of California will likely experience a 100 – 200% increase in the frequency of very wet November-March “rainy seasons” … California will likely experience an increase of anywhere from 50% to 150% (highest in the south) in the frequency of very dry November-March periods … Since California is so dependent on precipitation during its relatively brief winter rainy season, even a single dry winter can quickly lead to adverse drought impacts upon agriculture and the environment.
Last week, the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment also published a report detailing the indicators and impacts of climate change on California.
The most dramatic impacts include wildfires that are larger and more frequent, and the most severe drought since recordkeeping began. Underlying these events is a long-term warming trend that has accelerated since the mid-1970s. In addition, spring snowmelt runoff is decreasing, sea levels are rising, glaciers are shrinking, lakes and ocean waters are warming, and plants and animals are migrating.
In short, climate change will continue to have severe consequences for California, whose economy recently surpassed that of the UK to become the fifth-largest in the world. But the state has also become a leader in trying to minimize those climate damages.
In 2006, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed the Global Warming Solutions Act into law, whose most significant component was a carbon cap and trade system. The bill required California to reduce its greenhouse gas pollution to 1990 levels by 2020, and the state is on track to meet that goal despite a growing population and thriving economy with an $8.8bn surplus. California has proved that an economy can thrive with a price on carbon pollution in place.
In 2016, California passed an update to the California Global Warming Solutions Act requiring a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas pollution by 2030 on the way to the target 80% reduction below 1990 levels by 2050. California’s annual per capita emissions (11.5 tonnes of CO2-equivalent per person) are currently on par with those of Germany and Japan, and 40% lower than the US average.
California is investing in climate change solutions, like pilot projects using farms to sequester carbon. More than half of the state’s electricity is generated by carbon-free sources (21% hydroelectric, 12% solar, 9% nuclear, 6% wind, 6% geothermal), and another 43% comes from natural gas. While California can take steps to further reduce the greenhouse gas pollution from its electric power (for example, it just became the first state to require solar panels on new homes), electricity now comprises less than 20% of the state’s greenhouse gas emissions. Transportation is the biggest culprit, now accounting for 37%.
That’s why California’s war with the EPA over vehicle fuel efficiency standards is so important. With its low-carbon power grid mix, California can achieve significant transportation emissions cuts by transitioning to electric cars. So far they comprise about 4.5% of the state’s vehicle fleet (340,000 electric cars), well above the national average of 1.1%, but with a long way to go yet. The state’s goal is to have 1.5m electric cars on the road by 2025 and 5m by 2030, with a $2.5bn initiative to install another quarter million charging stations in California to meet the growing electric vehicle infrastructure needs.
California has become a leader both in experiencing climate change impacts and taking action to mitigate them. The state has provided a perfect example that contrary to current Republican Party beliefs, climate change has serious economic and human costs, whereas economies can thrive after putting a price on carbon pollution. America needs leaders with the foresight of California’s.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/may/14/california-battered-by-global-warmings-weather-whiplash-is-fighting-to-stop-it

Funds going into renewable energy, the mainstay of the low-carbon economy, fell more than 50% in 2017, having dropped by 10% in 2016, bringing annual investment in the sector to its lowest since the financial crisis in 2008.
The environmental audit committee (EAC) said on Wednesday that the government would be unable to meet its pledges on carbon emission reductions, if the collapse continued. 
The MPs also said the government was failing to implement policies to cut emissions from transport, heating and industry, and called on ministers to consider raising a “sovereign green bond”, as other countries have done, in order to stimulate investment.
The criticisms come even as the government has boasted of a clean growth strategy, and a 25-year environmental plan that will address climate change along with other green priorities such as pollution and biodiversity. 
Mary Creagh, chair of the EAC, said: “The clean growth strategy was long on aspiration, short on detail. The government must urgently plug this policy gap and publish its plan to secure the [billions of pounds of] investment required to meet the UK’s climate change targets, and explore how a sovereign green bond could kickstart its strategy.” 
Cuts to taxpayer-funded support for renewable projects, along with planning obstacles that have effectively ruled out new onshore wind turbines across much of the country, have deterred energy companies and their financial backers. The market for energy efficiency measures, such as home insulation, has also seen a sharp decline since the government scrapped its flagship policy, and the Green Investment Bank was sold off.
Alex White, senior policy officer at the Aldersgate Group, said: “There are willing investors in the green economy, but not enough projects to invest in. Boosting the pipeline of green infrastructure projects will be critical to meet the UK’s environmental goals and should be the first priority in green finance. Policy detail is key [for investors].”
Alongside the EAC report, researchers and NGOs have called for a “greening” of the Bank of England, to meet carbon targets and encourage clean growth. Positive Money, a thinktank, called for the monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates, to have to take the risks of climate change into account in making its decisions, a controversial recommendation that would require wide reviews of how climate change could make an impact on inflation.
The report, A Green Bank of England, also suggested that the Bank of England should be given a specific remit on environmental sustainability, which would affect its decisions and advice to government, and should no longer buy bonds issued by fossil fuel companies.
Lord Deben, chairman of the Committee on Climate Change, the government’s statutory advisors, said linking the Bank of England’s work to climate change was essential, as was linking the performance of other government departments on the issue. “We have compartmentalised our reactions to climate change – we say, we have a minister for this, so the secretary of state for health or the chancellor do not think they have responsibility for it.”
He said: “The Bank of England can make a huge difference by using its own direct powers, and by influencing [others].”
He was backed up by Barry Gardiner, Labour’s shadow secretary for international trade, who said: “We have to make it clear to the Bank of England that it is given a specific remit to deal with these issues, not to limit its activity to more conventional banking activity.”
The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has repeatedly warned of the risks of climate change to the financial sector, and the need for action by companies, investors, government and regulators to ensure the necessary transition to a low-carbon economy happens beneficially, rather than by shocks to the finance system.
Sovereign green bonds, recommended by the EAC, are financial borrowing instruments issued by governments to raise cash for environmental improvement projects, with part of the return on the projects going to market investors. They enable governments to take advantage of the low interest rates on borrowing available to them, while investors are attracted by the relatively low levels of risk.
Poland made a bond issue in 2016, with Belgium following suit this year, and countries around the world from Nigeria to Indonesia have also entered the market. The Bank of England would have to take the lead in issuing such bonds in the UK.

Residents seek to preserve treasured land,article,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/18/napa-valley-wine-measure-c-agriculture,0,"The rise of Napa began with an upset. Warren Winiarski would know – his wine, a cabernet sauvignon, was a firm underdog at a legendary 1976 blind tasting in Paris, which pitted the best of France against the little-known California region.His winery, Stag’s Leap, shocked the wine world by taking top honors. “It broke the glass ceiling that France had imposed on everyone,” he recalls. “People’s aspirations were liberated.”Today Winiarski, 89, is speaking not of liberation, but of limits. A growing coalition of industry veterans and longtime residents fear that Napa has become a victim of its own success, pointing to the ecological transformation of the valley floor from dense oak woodland to a sea of vine-wrapped trellises. And they are posing a thorny question: has a unique agricultural region reached a tipping point at which agriculture itself becomes the threat?
“We’re not thinking ahead,” says Winiarski. “What’s at stake is a national treasure.”
Against this backdrop, a local environmental initiative has sparked fierce debate. The effort, known as Measure C, would cap the amount of oak woodland that could be cleared for future vineyards – in effect limiting the growth of some of the world’s most famous wine brands.
Nearly 500 wineries now call Napa County home. Many are in the valley itself, which is just 30 miles long and five miles wide and welcomes 3.5 million visitors a year. Global recognition has attracted big beverage companies. Tourists have clogged the narrow two-lane roads. Wealthy “lifestyle vintners” have scooped up second homes and attempted to build private helicopter pads. 
“With great success came great money and outsiders,” explains James Conaway, a journalist and author who has been covering Napa since the 1980s. He describes the valley of 30 years ago as egalitarian and idealistic, a mixed agricultural community that raised wine alongside livestock and fruit trees. “Now it’s monoculture with a vengeance. Hundreds of miles of steel trellising holding up the vines from one end of the valley to the next. It has an industrial sheen.”
Through the windows at Winiarski’s hilltop home, the transformation can be surveyed with ease. Vineyards stretch in all directions, rows of green as orderly as soldiers. The Silverado Trail, a famous wine tasting route, cuts a path to the west. To the east lie hills covered in oaks – trees that, Winariski points out, once carpeted the valley floor. 
Napa’s oaks have become a flashpoint in the story of wine’s takeover. Ninety-five per cent of those on the valley floor have been felled, the vasty majority replaced by grapes. Now developers are eyeing the surrounding hillsides. 
Napa county has California’s densest concentration of oak woodland, thanks to the rich foliage that still carpets the hills. While much of it is privately owned and not public land in the classic sense, the woods are regarded as a public resource – a place of recreation and biodiversity, a vital part of the valley’s watershed and a fierce point of pride. But more than a third sits on potentially agriculturally productive soil – a 2010 management plan estimated that by 2030, up to 3,065 acres of mixed woodland would be lost due to vineyard development.
“Forests are the best negative emissions technology we have,” says Jim Wilson, a former brewing quality manager at Anheuser-Busch and a leader in the band of grassroots activists behind Measure C. “Should Napa’s wine industry get a pass?”
The measure is the culmination of years-long battle – one that’s involved knocking on doors, gathering thousands of signatures, and fighting an opposition which, according to a private newsletter seen by the Guardian, plans to spend nearly $1m to defeat it. Wilson’s side, by contrast, has raised just over $160,000. The effort has consumed his life, but then, Napa is his life.
“I was born here in 1955,” Wilson says. “I raised a family on my wife’s ranch.” Their home – a patchwork of steep hills, creeks and woodlands on the county’s east side – is wild and uncultivated. During a walk beneath the oaks on a recent morning, his love for the forest is palpable. 
“When you take forest out, you negatively impact carbon sequestration,” he explains. The trees play a crucial role in capturing rain and replenishing groundwater, he said, while their root systems prevent soil erosion. 
Voters will decide on the proposal by 5 June, but the campaign has sharply divided the wine community. Veteran vintners like Winiarski have gone against the industry trade groups, who are united in their opposition. The Napa Valley Vintners, a key trade body, initially supported the measure but later pulled a surprise U-turn. Wilson and his co-organizers say pressure from powerful industry figures turned the tide. The Vintners declined to comment on the reversal, but an official statement said the majority of its members “conveyed opposition”.
“This decision does not change our longstanding commitment to promoting, protecting and enhancing the Napa Valley and to upholding its goals of advocating for the local wine industry while preserving this special place for future generations,” it added.Ryan Klobas, the policy director for the Napa Valley Farm Bureau, warns the measure is “full of unintended consequences” and calls its proposed regulation too complicated for voters to grasp. “You’re asking everyone to become a technical expert overnight. This is an issue better left to the board of supervisors.”
But longtime residents such as Ginny Simms – an environmental advocate who served on the county’s board of supervisors in the 1970s – believe corporate greed is at the root. Napa today is a multibillion-dollar industry, where global beverage companies such as Treasury Wine Estates, Gallo and Constellation – which own brands such as Corona and Svedka vodka – have acquired smaller wineries for their portfolios.
“The real issue here is power,” says Simms, 90. “Opponents want to run the county in a way that is favorable to the expansion of all wineries and wine events. Which leaves the people of Napa voiceless.”
Despite the talk of pushing back against power, some worry more regulation would actually favor the wealthy by boosting the price of the little free land that remains. Don Clark is a mid-sized grape grower and vineyard manager from Texas, who came to Napa in 1994 and was lucky to buy affordable land.
“We may have been the last generation who could come here as a young farmer,” he says. “The barriers to entry are almost impossible now.” Startup costs have soared – Clark’s last vineyard development client spent half a million dollars on various legal, consultation and county fees, as well as archeological and environmental studies, he says.
Clark and others point to a landmark 1968 ordinance known as the Agriculture Preserve – the first of its kind in the US – which deemed agriculture the “highest and best” use of Napa’s land. Measure C therefore undercuts a fundamental right to farm, these opponents argue. 
But proponents say the measure is born of love, not reproach, for the wine world, and is simply about responsible farming. “Something’s very wrong with the way we are thinking about our resources,” Winiarski says. “They are finite. And yet we go on with development as though we could do that indefinitely.”

A growing number of pension funds have backed a resolution at Shell’s AGM on Tuesday that calls on the company to set tougher carbon targets that are in line with the goals of the Paris climate deal.
The proposal has been backed by the Church of England, the Dutch pension fund Aegon and, most recently, Nest, the workplace pension scheme set up by the UK government, which has £7m invested in Shell.
Mark van Baal, the founder of Follow This, a Dutch campaign group that brought the resolution, said: “Investors have a choice: vote for Shell’s ‘whatever world’ or vote for the world of the Church of England, a world in which all companies set targets to limit climate change to well below 2C.”
The resolution has been highlighted by 60 large investors managing more $10.4tn (£7.72tn) in assets, though they stopped short of publicly backing it. 
“Regardless of the result at the Shell AGM, we strongly encourage all companies in this sector to clarify how they see their future in a low-carbon world,” the investors – who include Axa Investment Managers and Legal &amp; General Investment Management – wrote in an open letter.
It is the third year in a row that Follow This has brought a climate resolution to Shell’s AGM. Ben van Beurden, Shell’s chief executive, has admitted the resolutions played a role in convincing the firm to announce a plan to halve the carbon footprint of the energy it sells by 2050. Follow This has welcomed the move but said it is not enough.
Meanwhile, influential shareholder advisers have urged investors to oppose the CEO’s remuneration package, which rose to €8.9m (£7.79m) in 2017. 
Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) said Van Beurden’s €3m (£2.63m) bonus was not warranted, given how the firm performed on its sustainable development targets. The advisory group Pensions and Investment Research Consultants (Pirc) also recommended opposition.
A Shell spokesperson said the company “strongly disagreed” with ISS’s concerns, noting that the advisory group had supported the policy that put the bonus framework in place.
The spokesperson added: “We share the objective of Follow This for Shell to show leadership in the energy transition but we consider their resolution unnecessary as we have already outlined an approach, through our industry-leading net carbon footprint ambition, that is wider-ranging and more progressive.”
The rival oil firm BP also faces a potential challenge – over pay – during its AGM in Manchester on Monday, the first time the London-based firm has held the event outside the capital in more than a century.
The British firm said about 40% of its shareholders lived north of Birmingham, and Manchester’s location and transport links would be convenient for retail investors. 
The company’s healthy profits off higher oil prices mean the extraordinary 2016 shareholder revolt over chief executive Bob Dudley’s £14m pay package is unlikely to be repeated.
But some proxy adviser groups have urged investors to reject Dudley’s £9.5m remuneration for 2017, which Pirc said was at an “unacceptable” ratio of 48:1 compared to average employee pay.

Most nations, representing 90% of global population, would benefit economically from keeping global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the research indicates. This includes almost all the world’s poorest countries, as well as the three biggest economies – the US, China and Japan – contradicting the claim of US president, Donald Trump, that climate action is too costly.
Australia and South Africa would also benefit, with the biggest winners being Middle East nations, which are threatened with extreme heatwaves beyond the limit of human survival.
However, some cold countries – particularly Russia, Canada and Scandinavian nations – are likely to have their growth restricted if the 1.5C target is met, the study suggests. This is because a small amount of additional warming to 2C would be beneficial to their economies. The UK and Ireland could also see some restriction, though the estimates span a wide range of outcomes. 
The research, published the journal Nature, is among the first to assess the economic impact of meeting the Paris climate goals. Data from the last 50 years shows clearly that when temperatures rise, GDP and other economic measures fall in most nations, due to impacts on factors including labour productivity, agricultural output and health.
The scientists used this relationship and 40 global climate models to estimate the future economic impact of meeting the 1.5C target - a tough goal given the world has already experienced 1C of man-made warming. They also assessed the long-standing 2C target and the impact of 3C of warming, which is the level expected unless current plans for action are increased.
“By the end of the century, we find the world will be about 3% wealthier if we actually achieve the 1.5C target relative to 2C target,” said Marshall Burke, assistant professor at Stanford University in the US, who led the new work. “In dollar terms, this represents about $30tn in cumulative benefits.”
The estimated cost of meeting the 1.5C target is about $0.5tn over the next 30 years,” he said: “So our evidence suggest the benefits of meeting the targets vastly outweigh the costs.” 
“We also calculated what’s going to be the additional economic cost if we hit 3C instead of 2C. This will cost the globe an additional 5-10% of GDP, relative to 2C; that is tens of trillions of dollars. These are very large numbers,” he said.
The researchers acknowledge there are significant uncertainties in their economic modelling, but said they are confident that keeping climate change to 1.5C is very likely to benefit the vast majority of the world’s people. 
The exact size of the benefit will depend, for example, on whether new technologies are created that help societies adapt to global warming, such as clean, cheap air conditioning, or whether climate tipping points are passed, bringing more severe damage such as rapid sea level rise. “The caveats apply to both the impacts and the adaptation,” said Prof Noah Diffenbaugh, also at Stanford University.
The economic analysis did not include the impacts of climate change on areas that are harder to quantify, such as the natural ecosystems that are vital for clean air and water and fertile soils, or the health benefits of burning less fossil fuel. Including these would make the benefits of action even greater.
Prof Maximilian Auffhammer, at the University of California Berkeley, US, and not part of the research team said: “Translating the impacts of climate change into economic damages is challenging. Pinning down just how large the effects of climate will be on the long-term growth of GDP needs to be a high priority for future work.”
“I think the authors of this study are doing the best job possible, by basing their estimates on a rigorous analysis and clearly stating their assumptions,” said Prof Wolfram Schlenker, at Columbia University, US.

Government plans for a lesser 17% cut in CO2 pollution were deemed unlawful three years ago, in the first successful lawsuit against a government’s climate policy.
The case inspired a wave of climate lawsuits against governments in Belgium, Colombia, India, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Switzerland, the UK, Uganda and the US. 
But Mark Rutte’s government on Monday put the ball back in the plaintiffs’ court, arguing that judges in The Hague had overstepped their authority and were in danger of outflanking public opinion. 
Climate minister Eric Wiebes told Dutch media: “We also believe that renewable energy should be increased and CO2 emissions should be reduced, so this is really about something else: it’s about how the judge has intervened in something that’s [called] democracy, and actually democracy has been sidelined.”
After the original ruling, the Dutch government announced ambitious plans to phase out all coal plants and cut emissions by 49% by 2030, as measured against 1990 levels. 
But the plans have not yet been implemented and Urgenda, the citizens’ alliance that brought the original case, said Dutch greenhouse gas emissions were currently only 13% below 1990 levels while CO2 output was largely unchanged. 
Lawyers representing the group’s 886 Dutch plaintiffs told the court: “The Netherlands is 34th in the world when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions. But when it comes to per capita emissions the Netherlands ranks ninth – the highest of any EU country. A Dutch person emits twice as much as the global average and 1.5 times more than the average EU citizen.
 “If we are not to reduce our emissions as quickly as possible, who is?”
With Urgenda’s legal battle becoming a litmus test for the effectiveness of climate litigation, the judges’ verdict – expected on 9 October – will be closely watched. 
Christiana Figueres, the former head of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, said: “Urgenda’s bold action against the government of the Netherlands created an important new incentive for all governments to act expeditiously. 
“Governments must act boldly and urgently. The Urgenda climate case is evidence that this is not just what should be done, it’s what must be done.” 
The World Meteorological Organization reported that last month was the third warmest April on record after 2016 and 2017, while Bering Sea ice cover fell to lowest level ever and a new CO2 ppm (parts per million) record was set. 
In a sign of increased urgency in Brussels, the EU’s climate commissioner, Miguel Arias Cañete, called this month for member states “to accelerate our efforts considerably and raise our ambition”. 
A UN dialogue to begin the process of “ratcheting up” climate pledges made at the Paris climate conference is under way, and seven EU states have called for the bloc to raise its ambitions. 
The Netherlands was one of them, and Wiebes reportedly proposed a 55% cut in Europe’s planet-warming emissions by 2030, describing the Dutch government as “one of the frontrunners on climate policy”. 
Domestically though, frustration with the slow pace of climate mitigation helped the Dutch Green party to more than triple its count of MPs in elections last year.
Jesse Klaver, the Greens’ leader, told the Guardian: “The main reason for that is that citizens are fed up with a government that chooses the interests of fossil companies over the environment.
 “The Urgenda case made it possible to call the government to account. The tragedy of Dutch climate policy is that our governments always had goals, but were never able to fulfil them. The verdict showed that when they fail to act on climate change a court can tell a government: you have a responsibility to protect your people and to keep your commitments.”
Climate actions have often been hostage to the changing composition of national governments, and the Dutch parliament is currently working on a climate change bill to ensure policy continuity. 
Anne van Pinxteren, a government spokeswoman, said that while Rutte’s administration expected to cut emissions by between 19-27% by 2020, the court judges had “set a major legal precedent” in altering its plans.
“There is a chance that with current policy the emission reduction goal of the court will not be met,” she said. “If that is the case, the state will have to take additional measures which will need to have an effect in the very short term. These will most likely not be cost-effective and/or have big consequences on society.”
Environmentalists, though, counter that the cost of the toughest climate action now pales by comparison to the estimated $30tn of damages that not meeting it could bring. 
Marjan Minnesma, Urgenda co-founder and director, told the Guardian: “Today in court we showed that it would cost around 0.5% of our GDP to meet the climate measures that have been proposed. If it is necessary and we are an extremely rich country and we can avoid extremely high risks, we think it should be done.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/28/dutch-government-appeals-against-court-ruling-over-emissions-cuts

Football has always been a lot more popular. What is your point? Nevertheless the test grounds and 20/20 matches will be sold out this summer.
Not popular in Australia? The MCG is the10th biggest stadium in the World and still packed out every year.
Then you start babbling on about world powers. Very odd.
I’m presuming in all this you are American with a very skewed view of the world.
Either way the fact remains that cricket is not a niche sport in worldwide terms. All you are merely stating is that it is not popular in some territories.
Baseball is not popular in the UK. Therefore by you’re by your argument must be a niche sport.

""Americans"" don't have to be white, you know.
One criticism often aimed at cricket is that it is only played in countries which were once part of the British Empire. Cricket didn't just spring up from nowhere in India or the Caribbean - it was introduced by an immigrant minority, in this case, white Englishmen. However, the game is now popular with the ""local"" population, and is no longer the preserve of the British - you can count the white people to have represented the West Indies in the last fifty years one one hand (which has had an unfortunate sawmill accident).
What we are beginning to see is the same thing, but this time led by the Indian and Pakistani diaspora.

Have you ever watched how football in the rain is different to football in the sun?
Or how rugby in the wind is a right pain with so much kicking needing done?
I cannot believe you believe cricket as a sport is special because the ball moves differently in humid air than dry. Because the grass in NZ is different to the grass in India when all that does is make for boring tests these days or whack-whack for cash in any old place.
Ok, the ball moves though. It also moves when players tamper with the ball as they do constantly because it's the only way to win the boring tests. 
Good luck tampering with a football.
Cricket they way it has gone has a special bond with sponsiors and BS and starry eyed dreamers thinking of whites and county and they wouldn't be far removed from seeing the whole thing through the eyes similar to the eyes Faragists use to see the 1950s of butter rationing and ignoring what has actually been done to the game for money.

That is because it was no unprecedented. Let alone ""so unprecedented"", whatever that may mean.
In addition, the claims in this sport blog about something missing are also wrong. Skerrit's UN speech soliciting money did mention climate change, despite what is stated here.

Skerrit had travelled to New York from his devastated island nation, battered to bare-root nakedness by Hurricane Maria, which spat out homes and lives, leaving behind flooding, landslides and a crumpled infrastructure. The category five storm splintered the island’s ancient forests, a Unesco world heritage site, ripping away the lush canopy to reveal a broken, brown reality.
The storm also razed the island’s Windsor Park cricket stadium – and on Thursday a Rest of the World team take on the West Indies at Lord’s to raise money for its restoration, and that of James Ronald Webster Park in Anguilla, ruined by hurricane Irma just two weeks earlier.
The game is a shining example of cricket acting for the common good. It will raise much-needed funds and the tickets, which are £10 for children, are reasonable. The game is being held during the half-term holiday and will be shown on Sky. It brings together players from around the globe including Rashid Khan, Shahid Afridi, Thisara Perera, Dinesh Karthik, and Mitchell McClenaghan under the captaincy of Eoin Morgan for the Rest of the World.
But there is something missing. There has been no discussion of the reasons why the weather seems to be changing, what might be done to prevent it or why the hurricane season of 2017 was both so unprecedented and so brutal.
No one weather event can be categorically labelled as “caused by climate change”. But scientists are confident that climate change is bringing more extreme weather events, and that it increases the severity of hurricanes, like Irma and Maria, as greenhouse gases trap energy in the atmosphere driving more powerful winds. Rising temperatures have led to higher sea levels, which in turn means bigger storm surges. Higher water temperatures lead to more evaporation of water into the air, and that means more rain and therefore a higher risk of flooding.
Skerrit is in no doubt what is to blame for his island’s repeated battering. In April he spoke of the country’s plans to become the world’s first climate resilient nation. But, he asked, what of the rest of the planet?
“In the current system, those who reap the financial benefits from the emissions of greenhouse gasses are not those who carry the costs. As a result, there is an underinvestment in limiting climate change, mitigating its costs and reducing climate-related damage. That is no longer a viable situation. The time for talk, conventions and declarations is over. The time for action is now,” said Skerrit.
So what does cricket do? There is for the game both a responsibility and an opportunity in tackling climate change. Cricket, and its followers, have an emotional and physical bond with the land in a way that few other field sports do. From the dustbowls of Ahmedabad to the lush pastures of the Somerset levels, cricket is its environment. It affects the batting conditions, the way the ball moves, the choice of players on the field, the way the game is played.
A roll-call of incidents from the the last few years suggest the scale of future challenges the game will have to face, and the risks of doing nothing. Last October Irma and Maria hit the Caribbean; this February the Western Province Cricket Association cancelled all club and school cricket because of severe drought in Cape Town and the surrounding areas. 
In 2016, 13 IPL games were moved from Maharashtra as parts of the state endured their worst drought for 100 years, and the control of water became a legal issue this April when the Mumbai high court forbade the Maharashtra Cricket Association from receiving water from the Pavana dam for its matches in Pune. 
Last December, air pollution in Delhi during the India v Sri Lanka Test resulted in players vomiting on the pitch and wearing face masks. Play was repeatedly held up and oxygen cylinders were brought into the dressing rooms. In England, 10 county grounds sit in cities where pollution levels exceed WHO recommendations. In the last month, a heatwave in Karachi has killed at least 65 people. And earlier this year, a report by the Climate Coalition named cricket as the game in the UK most likely to be affected by climate change.
 “There is clear evidence that climate change has had a huge impact on the game,” said Dan Musson, the ECB’s national participation manager, “in the form of general wet weather and extreme weather events.”
Glamorgan, the sole Welsh voice in county cricket, have lost 1,300 overs of cricket since 2000 because of the weather. Their head of operations, Dan Cherry, is frank.
“Losing so much cricket is a county’s worst nightmare – it affects the club at every level,” he has said. “It’s difficult even for first-class counties to be commercially viable with such an impact.”
Steve Birks, the Trent Bridge groundsman, told the Cricket Paper only this month: “The rain is getting tropical, it is getting heavier. We’re getting thunderstorms more often when it rains – I think that’s when you can tell the difference.”
Cricket must adapt to what the World Bank calls “the new climate normal” but it must also become part of the solution. On the day of the IPL final, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) signed an agreement to promote green cricket, “greening operations and engaging cricketers and fans in green initiatives”. The following months will give us an idea of how much the BCCI really cares, and how much is greenwash.
Becoming a world leader, a shining example of good environmental practice would attract to cricket the much-desired growth audience – as well as being the right thing to do. Young people, in particular, care about the future of the planet in a way they might not care about, say, 100-ball cricket. Increasingly sponsors too are likely to look at environmental performance when calculating where to put their money.
So many things could be done quite easily – large and small – from carbon audits to sensible tour planning to reduce the number of flights, from encouraging spectators to travel to matches in sustainable ways to curbing single-use plastic use. Some grounds, Lord’s and the Oval particularly, but also Edgbaston and Cardiff, are acting unilaterally, but cricket, and sport in general, is crying out for environmental leadership – how fabulous it would be if Thursday’s match banged heads together. With 2.5bn fans worldwide, cricket has the potential to influence human behaviour in profound ways.

Shiwak cuts the engine, hops off the machine and quietly pulls out a .12 gauge shotgun. He hands the weapon to Dane, and the pair crouch behind their snowmobile. Dane fires two quick shots. Two white partridges, almost invisible in the tree line, drop dead.
Dane runs to retrieve the birds, warming his hands against their bodies to ward off the chill from the cold wind whipping in from the North Atlantic Ocean.
Shiwak is an Inuit trapper and hunter who grew up relying on the wild bounty of Labrador. He takes his son out for trips like this every week, trying to pass on generations of knowledge around living off the land: how to collect firewood, hunt and fish, and travel safely in a place where the rhythm of life is still built upon ice and snow.
But he’s running out of time.
The sea surrounding coastal Labrador is warming at an unprecedented rate, according to data from Canada’s Department of Fisheries and Oceans.
Robert Way, a climatologist based in Happy Valley-Goose Bay, said the region is a volatile place climatically, with extreme swings in the weather that can amplify – and sometimes mask – the changes that are happening. Compared to historical terms, winter is about six weeks shorter, while the region’s sea ice coverage is about a third smaller than it was a decade ago.
 “If you look at the rate of warming from the late 1980s to 2015, this is one of the fastest warming places in the world. It’s quite concerning,” said Way.
For the people of Rigolet, a former trading post that is the southernmost Inuit community in Canada, the vanishing ice and increasingly unpredictable seasons means they’re being forced to adapt in ways they never have before.
Like generations of Inuit before him, Derrick Pottle is a trapper and hunter. His diet of wild game, salmon, berries, trout and seal would have been familiar to his ancestors who were living in Hamilton Inlet around 8,000 years ago.
But Pottle worries all the skills he’s learned from older generations may soon become irrelevant. More and more, Inuit are relying on expensive, store-bought processed foods because it’s safer and easier than catching or shooting supper.
Pottle’s ancestors never experienced a time when their frozen world in northern Labrador was being altered so dramatically because of climate change. Shrinking ice packs and more severe weather has made travel increasingly difficult and dangerous, often cutting people off from other communities and traditional hunting lands.
There are no roads connecting Rigolet to other communities, so people here long ago came to rely on trails over the ice as their lifelines. But those frozen lifelines are increasingly unreliable, prone to sudden thaws, weak ice and dangerous openings.
The world may have warmed by around 1C (1.8F) over the past century but the Arctic far outstrips this global average and is warming at around twice the rate of the rest of the world.
In places, the rate of warming has been astonishing. Novembers in the Alaskan town of Utqiaġvik, formerly Barrow, are now 5.5C warmer than they were in 1979. This past winter, the warmest on record in the Arctic, saw some locations exceed 20C hotter than normal.
The Arctic is dominated by sea ice, unlike the Antarctic which is essentially a huge land-based ice sheet. As the ocean and atmosphere warm, sea ice is shrinking in extent, at around 13% a decade since 1979, according to Nasa. The bright white surface of ice, known as albedo, is giving way to the dark ocean, meaning that sunlight is being absorbed rather than reflected, amplifying the warming effect.
These “rapid and dramatic changes” are introducing a “new normal” to the Arctic, according to US government scientists in a report card last year. Storms are eroding away ice-free coastlines, summer wildfires are becoming fiercer and certain species, such as polar bears, are increasingly struggling to find food. This is all providing a major challenge to communities in the Arctic, but a boon to the shipping industry, which can navigate the area more easily. This task will get even simpler once the Arctic is ice free in summertimes, forecast as soon as 2040s.
“I’m seeing changes that impact the way that we live,” Pottle said. “The sea, the ice, the snow, it’s all changing. You can’t travel safely any more. Up and down the coast, it’s the same thing. And it’s changing right before our eyes.”
Some changes are more subtle. Summers have always been short here, and marked by tormenting swarms of black flies. But Paula McLean-Sheppard, a Nunatsiavut government employee, said she has been startled to see the insects arriving earlier and earlier in the spring.
“I was driving my truck last year and there was this big black cloud that suddenly appeared on the windshield. I had to use my wipers to clear it, I didn’t know what it was,” she said. “It was the flies. It used to be the end of June before you saw your first fly. Now they’re coming in May.”
Rigolet’s fishermen say new species are arriving in the bay, from cormorants to sharks to sea turtles, chasing warming waters and the food that comes with it. Seals, a key source of food and skin for waterproof clothes, are moving further and further up the bay as the sea ice vanishes. Others blame the decline of the region’s caribou herd on the changing climate, too.
Some of the changes are harder to see. McLean-Sheppard worries that as coastal Labrador’s sea ice becomes increasingly unreliable, it’s causing more anxiety among Inuit who feel stuck and unable to travel to catch their food. This past winter, the ice in the bay didn’t freeze up until February, months later than normal. 
“It’s especially hard on the hunters and providers because they can’t get out on the land. They feel stuck,” she said. “We’re like an island, really. We need the ice to connect us.”
Living off the land is still a big part of life in Labrador’s coastal communities. Hunters provide meat to community freezers for sharing with seniors and others who can’t catch their own food. The freezers are filled with Labrador’s wild buffet, from partridge berries and Arctic char to moose, duck and goose meat. Each year the Rigolet community is allowed to kill two polar bears, and the meat is divided up for families up and down the rugged coastline.
Scientists say the impact of climate change on the Inuit psyche is significant, and only just beginning to be understood. Social workers worry it is leading to increased rates of drugs and alcohol abuse, in a place where the suicide rate far outstrips the national.
“The land is not just the land for them. It’s family, it’s kin, it’s part of you. Every aspect of Inuit culture grows from the land,” said Ashlee Cunsolo, director of the Labrador Institute in Happy Valley-Goose Bay.
“When you’re the first generation that can’t do that any more, that can’t follow your ancestors on to the land, think about how devastating that can be from a cultural standpoint. It’s a disruption to cultural traditions that have endured for hundreds of years.”
Cunsolo is one of the leading researchers into the links between climate change and mental health. She says the rapid changes happening in coastal Labrador are causing the Inuit to feel increased feelings of anxiety, depression and grief. They sense something is being lost, she said.
“These changes are disrupting hundreds of years of knowledge and wisdom and connection to the land. That’s a scary thing for humanity,” Cunsolo said.
Many of the Inuit in Rigolet are just a generation removed from the government relocation programs of the 1960s, when families were forced to abandon their nomadic ways and settle in larger communities. They say it’s in their blood to travel out into the wilderness. Inez Shiwak, who is working to preserve local Inuit culture in Rigolet, smiles when she says getting away from the village and into the wild is “like taking your first breath when you were a baby”.
Her father Jack Shiwak, the village’s mayor, said elders have noticed that the wind whipping in from the ocean is getting more severe. It can cause blinding snowstorms, and some people have been lost on snowmobile trails because of it. The unpredictable weather is causing some Inuit to reduce trips to their remote cabins, a tradition that dates backs to the days when fur trapping was a major industry in the region, he said.
“Until five years ago, we’d hardly miss a week of going to the cabin. We haven’t been there is two years. It’s just the weather,” Shiwak said. “It’s a strange feeling. We know things are changing, but you realize you can’t stop it. The question is how we adapt.”
Back out on the frozen shoreline a few miles outside of the village, Martin Shiwak stops his snowmobile again and looks out over the bay. The sun is shining now and the hunter unzips his coat, remarking this is one of the mildest Marches he’s ever seen.
He knows this wild land intimately. But lately he’s starting to recognize it less and less. This is the first winter Shiwak couldn’t cross nearby Lake Melville to go trapping because he couldn’t trust the ice. It’s also the first winter he’s had to cancel an educational program that used to bring youth out on the ice and show them the old practices of their people.
Shiwak worries what life will be like for Dane, as the traditions of the father grow harder and harder for the son to maintain. Labrador’s youngest Inuit will have to learn new ways to live with a land that is changing all the time, he said. 
“It affects everything,” he said. “I just know it’ll be a lot different than it is now.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/30/canada-inuits-climate-change-impact-global-warming-melting-ice

But the French president was at pains to stress that France’s continued emphasis on its Pacific presence was not one antagonistic to China, saying he welcomed Beijing’s economic and geopolitical rise.
Macron – the leader of one of the last European powers with territory in the Pacific – said his country was and wanted to remain a “Pacific power”.
He will travel from Australia to New Caledonia to campaign for the territory to remain a French collectivity when it goes to an independence referendum later this year.

Macron said he wanted to create a “strong Indo-Pacific axis to build on our economic interests as well as our security interests”.
“I would very much like France, given it is the last European member of the EU being present in the Pacific after the Brexit … to be at the heart of this project,” he said at a fraternal press conference with Malcolm Turnbull. “This region is crucial for the stability of the world.”
The Australian prime minister described France as a “Pacific Ocean power”, one well-placed to work with Australia in pursuit of shared goals.
“We share the vision of a free, open and prosperous Indo-Pacific and will work closely to realise it, whether it is closer cooperation on maritime activities, support for our friends in the Pacific through humanitarian and disaster relief, or support for infrastructure in the region,” Turnbull said.
France and Australia signed several agreements on Wednesday, pledging to work together on combating cyberterrorism, on defence cooperation, on quantum computing, and on climate change adaptation and resilience. Already, the French company DCNS has been awarded the $50bn contract to build 12 state-of-the-art non-nuclear submarines for Australia. 
The growing influence of China across the Asia-Pacific – in particular its military manifestations of bases built on atolls in the South China Sea – is a growing concern for western powers.
People’s Liberation Army Navy ships challenged three Australian warships sailing through the sea last month, in a significant escalation of Chinese assertiveness in the region.
There have also been credible reports – though denied by both sides – of Chinese intentions to build a naval port in Vanuatu.
But both Macron and Turnbull said their cooperation in the Pacific was not one made in reaction or opposition to China’s growing influence. 
“There is nothing against vis-a-vis China, and in reaction to the Chinese rise,” Macron said, speaking largely in English. “I think the Chinese rise is very good news for everybody because it’s good for China itself.”
But both leaders stressed the need for all countries in the region to adhere to the “rules-based order” which had underpinned the dramatic economic growth countries such as China had enjoyed.
“That economic rise, that growth, has been enabled and made possible by a rules-based order in our region,” Turnbull said. “The peace and relevant harmony in our region has been enabled by the adherence to the rule of law.”
Riffing on a Chinese proverb often quoted by the former Singaporean prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, Turnbull said the Indo-Pacific order must not be reduced to one where “the big fish eat the small fish and the small fish eat the shrimp”.
The centrality of New Caledonia to Macron’s antipodean visit was further emphasised. “I am a big fan of shrimp,” Macron said. “Especially New Caledonian shrimp.”
Earlier, he challenged Australia to do more to tackle climate change.
During a speech at the Sydney Opera House Tuesday night, he called on Turnbull to show the “power of conviction” and display courage in confronting climate change, despite the ideological barriers he faces in his party room.
“I am fully aware of the political and economic debate surrounding this issue in your country, and I respect this,” Macron said. “But I think that actual leaders are those that can respect those existing interests, but at the same time decide to participate to something broader, to something more strategic.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/02/france-and-australia-can-be-heart-of-new-indo-pacific-axis-macron-says

Emails released to the US environment group the Sierra Club under freedom of information laws show that Matthew Freedman, a Washington consultant who describes himself as “a close personal friend” of the Australian environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, played a central role in organising Pruitt’s proposed August trip before it was cancelled when Hurricane Harvey hit the Texas gulf coast.
In the US, the emails are of interest as evidence that Pruitt relied on business figures and lobbyists to plan and justify his overseas travel. They were first published by the New York Times.
Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon 
From an Australian perspective, they give insight into Pruitt’s proposed agenda and schedule. They discuss focusing on promoting “innovation deregulation”, federal-state relations and how to counter potential disagreements with Australian officials about climate change. The EPA administrator rejects mainstream climate science and worked closely with fossil fuel companies to reduce environmental regulation when he was Oklahoma’s attorney general.
Freedman suggested that Pruitt meet several members of the Australian government including the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull (listed as “Malcomb”), the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, the trade minister, Steve Ciobo, and the then resources minister, Matt Canavan, along with Frydenberg.
He said an initial step should be to get a better sense of any US-Australian environmental agreements and whether they should be “changed or updated or cancelled and replaced with others”. There is nothing in the emails to indicate that Australian officials agreed with this agenda.
The documents include an email from the executive director of the Institute of Public Affairs, John Roskam, in which he proposes a two-hour roundtable for Pruitt with IPA-affiliated researchers who disagree with the scientific consensus on climate change. They included a James Cook University geophysicist, Prof Peter Ridd and the IPA senior fellow Jennifer Marohasy, who has accused the Bureau of Meteorology of corrupting the temperature record and whom Roskam described as “Australia’s authority on temperature and climate variability”.
“All of these people are excellent and I know Scott and his team would learn a great deal from a discussion with them,” he wrote to Freedman.
Roskam also recommended Pruitt meet Maurice Newman, a former chair of Tony Abbott’s business advisory council who has described global warming as “a delusion”, the former Productivity Commission head Gary Banks and the economist Henry Ergas.
The IPA head wrote that he had spoken to the then Minerals Council chief, Brendan Pearson, who was “working with the [US] embassy” on the trip. Pearson resigned from the council late last year after its biggest member, BHP, objected to the lobby group’s advocacy for new coal plants under his leadership.
In emails to Pruitt’s staff, Freedman described the IPA as a “very strong group for the administrator” and a potential co-host of the trip. He said Pruitt’s office had agreed invitations should be sought from the Turnbull government, the business lobby group the American Australian Council (of which Freedman is the treasurer) and Australian non-government organisations, including the IPA. 
The consultant said discussions with the government would inevitably turn to matters on which the Trump administration differed from Australia, giving the example of climate change. He said it was important to be able to say “we agree to disagree” on it. He recommended before the meetings that Pruitt get a briefing on the destruction of coral reefs by the Chinese to have as “a good talking point” when protection of the Great Barrier Reef came up in discussions with Australian officials.
Freedman recommended that Pruitt meet the Victorian Labor government so that he could say he had met “both sides”. He said visiting the state also made sense because it was “open for business” and doing creative things that could lead to US tech companies setting up headquarters there.
He said he would take advice from Frydenberg’s office on meeting the federal opposition. He had been in direct contact with the minister and had had conversations with his office and the embassy.
A spokesman for Frydenberg said the minister had invited Pruitt to Australia when they met in the US last year.
“The administrator expressed an interest and was keen to learn more about Australia’s cooperative federalism and ‘one-stop-shop’ environmental approvals process,” he said in an emailed response. “Given Mr Pruitt cancelled his trip to Australia, no meetings reached final confirmation.”
The spokesman said Frydenberg and Freedman knew each other through the Australian-American Leadership Dialogue.
Roskam said Freedman, the US embassy in Canberra and the US consulate in Melbourne had approached the IPA about Pruitt’s potential visit. He said the organisation had welcomed the chance to “work closely with the world’s leading advocate for cutting environmental red tape”.
The emails released to the Sierra Club include tourist and dinner recommendationssuch as a trip to Uluru and breakfast at the Boathouse restaurant in Sydney, which Freedman said was owned by the former trade minister Andrew Robb, whom the ex-lobbyist described as “a good friend”.
Pruitt faces 11 federal investigations in the US, including into his spending on travel and his business relationships with lobbyists. Freedman worked on national security-related issues for Trump’s transition team but was removed after using a personal email address to conduct government business.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/04/climate-sceptic-group-ipa-suggested-as-co-host-of-australian-visit-by-trumps-environment-chief

In 2017, the total ice balance was positive in Greenland
BQEND
Explained in your own link...
BQSTART
The exceptionally good snow year kicked off with the remnants of Hurricane Nicole stalling out in the North Atlantic and laying down record-setting amounts of snow in eastern Greenland. A June storm blanketed parts of the ice sheet with a fresh coat of clean, bright snow, which helped reflect the summer sun and delay the onset of significant surface melting. The finishing touch was a rare mid-August snow storm that brought the ice loss season to an early close. 
One hundred seventy-six billion tons of extra snow would be great news if that were the whole story of the ice sheet’s health. But as the Institute explains in an article on their Polar Portal Website, Greenland also loses nearly 500 billion tons of ice each year on average through its glaciers, either by icebergs calving into the ocean or through submarine melting of the glaciers where they reach the ocean. They continue…
If we subtract this from our figure of 544 Gt [Gt=gigatons, or 1 billion tons]…it would suggest Greenland gained a small amount of ice this year. However, compared to the approximately 3600 Gt of ice…that Greenland has lost since 2002 this year’s slightly positive balance does not add much extra.
Said another way, if the Greenland Ice Sheet could put on 44 billions tons of ice each year going forward, it would take 82 years to get back to its 2002 self.

“At the end of the last Ice Age, the air became warmer and carried more moisture across the continent, doubling the amount of snow dropped on the ice sheet,” Zwally said. 
The extra snowfall that began 10,000 years ago has been slowly accumulating on the ice sheet and compacting into solid ice over millennia, thickening the ice in East Antarctica and the interior of West Antarctica by an average of 0.7 inches (1.7 centimeters) per year. This small thickening, sustained over thousands of years and spread over the vast expanse of these sectors of Antarctica, corresponds to a very large gain of ice – enough to outweigh the losses from fast-flowing glaciers in other parts of the continent and reduce global sea level rise.

They were surprised, however, to discover recently that up to a quarter of the melting occurs in the depth of winter, when the average temperature is 15C below freezing. The melting is caused by a phenomenon called the föhn effect.
The föhn or foehn wind was first noted in the Alps, and occurs when a wind blowing over mountains descends on the far side. The increase in pressure at lower altitude causes the mass of air to warm up by about one degree per hundred metres. Such a wind blowing down from a high mountain range can easily rise above freezing. The Chinook wind in the Rocky Mountains is sometimes called “snow eater” for its capacity to strip snow from the slopes.
The winter Antarctic ice melt was discovered by a team led by Peter Kuipers Munneke of Utrecht University, using data from satellites and unmanned weather stations. It was presented to the European Geosciences Union in Vienna in April. The Antarctic has the highest elevation of any continent, and consequently fierce föhn winds. The new results show that these hot winds are making a significant contribution to ice melt.

Australia is either the largest or second largest coal exporter in the world (its rival is Indonesia, the figures change year by year as mines open and close, and contracts expire or are renewed) . It plans to be the largest exporter of LPG as well. 
Meanwhile despite the Paris Climate Accord we are nowhere near tackling global warming effectively. And Australia is doing nothing to save the Barrier Reef or reduce its increasing bushfire risk. But my major worry is that global warming will lead to enviro-wars. 
Come to 2050: by now the Barrier Reef is 3 quarters dead, Australia's beef industry has been replaced by Dutch laboratory grown meat, because the Dutch do take rising sea levels seriously. Australians are subject to sanctions and travel bans because our emissions are still among the worst in the world. We are banned from the Olympics and World Cup. Every World Cup. Tragically we are still in Eurovision. 
But as coal becomes as loathed as whale harpooning, Australians are subject to drone attack at home and assassination abroad because we are blamed for the immense death tolls in Bangladesh and other low-lying countries now subject to regular inundations. That has lead to an alliance of ASEAN nations blockading us, and Jihadists across South East Asia attacking us for our folly. What did we do wrong? We failed to give up our addiction to coal. We built more coal fired power stations when Abbott returned as PM in 2018, we locked ourselves in. We failed to commit to the scientific reality of global warming, we kept clearing land, and driving huge SUV's. We pretended it wasn't happening...until it was too late. Too late for the Reef, too late for the Pacific Islands, too late for the Gold Coast, too late for Calcutta. 
Sometimes the Australian insistence on no worries is the stupidest denial of all. We should be worried, and we should do as much as we can now to mitigate global warming.

But the authors of the paper, who are still good friends, had no idea about the wider impact of their work until recently.
The paper, published in 2007 in the journal Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, used contemporary data to update a widely used model for classifying the world’s climates.
Known as the Köppen Climate Classification System, the model was first published by climatologist Wladimir Köppen in 1884, but it had not been comprehensively updated for decades.
The lead author of the paper is Dr Murray Peel, a senior lecturer in the department of infrastructure engineering at the University of Melbourne, and he co-authored the updated climate map with geography professor Brian Finlayson and engineering professor Thomas McMahon, both now retired. 
“We are amazed, absolutely amazed at the number of citations,” Finlayson told Guardian Australia from his home in Melbourne. “We are not so much amazed at the fact it’s been cited as we are about the number of people who have cited it.
“It’s pleasing that research you’ve done is something other people are finding useful.” 
The trio knew their paper had an impact in academic circles and in scientific literature, with the Köppen Climate Classification System used by researchers in a range of fields including geology, sociology, public health and climatology. 
But Finlayson said they were unaware of the more widespread success until a journalist from Wired contacted them about the results of an analysis by Wikipedia of the top 10 sources by citation across every Wikipedia language. All 10 were reference books or scientific articles. The updated world map of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification boasted 2,830,341 citations, easily surpassing what came in at No 2, a paper published in the Journal of Physical Chemistry that had 21,350 citations.
Finlayson said the popularity of the paper emphasised the importance of open science, which is the concept that data and findings should be openly and freely available so that others can use and benefit from them. Wikipedia operates on a similar concept, and credible citations are crucial to the encyclopaedia’s reliability.
“The journal we originally published the paper in is free and open access, and we chose the journal for that reason,” he said. “People noticed and said, ‘Hey, we have an updated climate map, we’ll use that’, and then it spread.” 
At the time, open access journals were rare.
“I have always been a supporter of open science,” Finlayson said. “Research is no good to anyone locked in a cupboard, or published in a journal you have to pay a lot of money to access.”
He said he first began working with paper co-author McMahon in 1981, and that they got to know Murray, who is “a fair bit younger,” when he became one of their PhD students. 
“He did his PhD on global hydrology and kept working with us in that area over the years, and we are all still very good friends and kept publishing together,” Finlayson, now 73, said. “We agree on most of the serious things and then every now and then we have differences of opinion. So we talk about it, and then we set out to test who is right, and write a paper on the results.
“If you want to form an academic group of people who work together well, the fact that they’re friends helps a lot. You’re not concerned about things like someone getting more kudos than you are.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/07/wikipedia-the-most-cited-authors-revealed-to-be-three-australian-scientists

But reading about a new study that says global tourism now accounts for 8% of carbon emissions, three times more than was previously thought made me think– surely we can do better?
Whenever I hear about the impact global tourism has on the environment I experience a pang of guilt. While it’s not just the greenhouse gases churned out by planes that are the problem – the study points out it’s also what tourists do when they get to their destination – they account for a big chunk. And yet it’s a pang of guilt I never act on. It’s just too easy to ignore when it’s often cheaper to get a short-hop flight to somewhere sunny than it is to buy an off-peak return on the train to many parts of the UK.
Making consumers feel so guilty they change their behaviour – taking more holidays in the UK, forking out hundreds to get to European destinations by train – just isn’t going to work; I’m proof of that. We need firmer action. But increasing the government levies on air travel – forcing up prices to get people to fly less – isn’t the answer. This would have little impact on the most affluent travellers, while hitting the poorest in society.
Instead we should look to carbon trading schemes for inspiration. In schemes running in the EU and some areas of the US, international organisations or governments sign up to a total limit on carbon emissions. They then issue companies with permits that allow them to emit a certain amount of carbon. It’s then up to the companies to trade the permits. Companies that want to emit more can buy permits from those that manage to reduce their carbon emissions.
We could develop a similar system for flights. Everyone could be given an air mile allowance – say enough for one long-haul return flight a year, or three short-haul flights, so people with families on the other side of the world could see them once a year. If you don’t want to use your allowance, you could sell it off in a government-regulated online marketplace. If you’re keen to do a holiday a month, you’ll have to buy your allowance from someone else.
This would be far preferable to increasing tax on airline tickets. It would be redistributive: everyone gets a certain number of air miles, but if you’d rather get the thousands of pounds you could command for them on the online marketplace, you’re free to sell them. Same if you’re just not that bothered about going abroad. But if you want to go over your allowance, it will be at a cost.
Of course there would be lots of practical objections. Businesses would hate this – but they, like individuals, could be assigned a certain number of miles that they could supplement or sell, and it might encourage them to actually invest in the technology that can facilitate meetings between people continents apart. Perhaps the hardest aspect would be getting some sort of agreement on an international scale. But we’re only going to make a dent in climate change by doing something pretty radical.
Cutting global air travel may be only part of the solution but an individual cap on air travel – that people can trade with each other as they wish – could help reduce the impact flying has on our environment. It’s certainly better than the alternatives – crossing our fingers and hoping people suddenly discover an environmental conscience even if it does mean missing out on that weekend in the sun, or whacking up green taxes in a way that adversely affects less affluent families.

In our next podcast, we’ll consider the rise of veganism as a lifestyle choice – why are so many are opting to go vegan, and what are the implications for society?
Since Guardian columnist Decca Aitkenhead wrote about her own vegan experiment, and we published a long read on the topic, we have had a huge number of responses – from readers, academics, experts and others. Defying naysayers’ predictions that it was yet another hipster food fad, adopting a plant-based lifestyle is becoming a popular choice for people for many different reasons. We’ve invited Decca into the studio to host our next podcast and we’d love you, the Guardian’s supporters, to pose questions to her for the discussion. 
Have you or a family member recently adopted a vegan lifestyle? Have you been driven by ethical, health, environmental or financial factors? If the factors are environmental, are you concerned mostly with deforestation, biodiversity loss, or something that affects you more locally? If you made the choice for health reasons, have you noticed the benefits and have you found it easy to eat a balanced diet? Is it a decision you made alone or as a family? Is it something you tried but later decided against? Perhaps you are a lifelong vegan and you are relieved to see it becoming more mainstream?
Another point for discussion could focus around the role of social media in the rise of veganism. There are a number of Netflix documentaries on the subject; there are Instagram influencers and prominent academics who are becoming vegan. Perhaps it works for them, but is it for everyone? There have also been concerns that veganism provides a socially acceptable cover for disordered eating. You might want to discuss the potential issues around this surge in public curiosity. Or explore how your consumption and habits have changed in recent years. Are you sceptical about the rise of veganism, or inspired by it? How can farmers and food producers adapt to better cater to the change in demand?

Fisher spent much of his summer in 2015 flying over places such as Yellowstone, Glacier National Park and Grand Teton National Park, taking stunning pictures of retreating glaciers for a new book.
Fisher said the enormity of the loss was apparent from his plane, where he took in whole ecosystems such as the Wind River Range in Wyoming, which contains several major rivers that provide water for a large surrounding area.
“I’m completely resigned that they will all disappear; I was basically racing to see them before they are gone,” Fisher said. “There’s a bit of bleakness that our planet is going into unchartered territory.”
Glaciers, which are vast masses of snow and ice that move under their own weight, are receding at varying rates around the world due to rising global temperatures. Glacier National Park in Montana has seen some of the most dramatic recorded losses, with glaciers set to disappear from the park as early as 2030.
Globally, glaciers have lost around 400bn tons in mass a year since 1994, which is raising concerns for the millions of people and animals that rely upon glaciers for melt water. The retreat of huge glaciers in Antarctica and Greenland is also driving sea level rise.
The decline of glaciers has previously been illustrated by comparative pictures showing how the modern ice masses looked several decades previously, and more recently. But individual images of modern glaciers can also contain evidence of retreat, according to Lisa McKeon, a physical scientist at the US Geological Society.
“Pictures don’t really show the loss in ice volume but they can show the loss of area,” she said. “You can see previous moraines, which are rocks pushed by a glacier’s movement, far from the current edge of the glacier.”
McKeon has previously exhibited her own collection of comparative photos of glacier retreat at various galleries, where she left a comment book for visitors to log their thoughts.
“I’ve perused the comment book for the past two years or so, there’s a lot of sadness there,” she said. “It’s change. It evokes a sense of loss.” 
Fisher’s book contains 177 pictures, many of them taken in precarious conditions, as the wind tossed the 69-year-old Piper PA11 plane that Fisher’s grandfather refurbished after he found it in a dilapidated condition in a North Carolina barn in the 1980s.
“I learned to fly in this plane,” said Fisher, who is from New York state but has spent a lot of time in Colorado and studied Rocky Mountain National Park there. “There is no heat, the door had to be open when taking pictures so there was an ungodly cold. The plane only has 100 horsepower but when you get to 15,000ft it only has around half of that. I would just go off on my own and hope the engine didn’t fail.”
Flying over Glacier National Park, in Montana, was the most challenging because of the “most absurd terrain, the extreme wind, the concentration of grizzly bears if I did have to land – I really didn’t want to go down there,” Fisher said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/16/rocky-mountain-glaciers-melting-climate-change-photos-garrett-fisher

Republican Mo Brooks of Alabama pushed back at the notion that rising sea levels were the result of global warming in a hearing of the House Science, Space and Technology on Wednesday. 
Instead, Brooks pointed to silt deposition as well as erosion as a cause of rising sea levels. Questioning scientist Phil Duffy of the Woods Hole Research Center, Brooks postulated that silt and mud washed by rivers into the ocean caused water levels to rise as it settled on the sea floor. “Now you have got less space in those oceans because the bottom is moving up,” he said. 
He went on: “What about the White Cliffs of Dover … [and] California, where you have the waves crashing against the shorelines, and time and time again you have the cliffs crashing into the sea? All of that displaces water which forces it to rise, does it not?”
Duffy answered: “I’m pretty sure on human timescales, those are minuscule effects.”
The questioning went on as Brooks argued the Antarctic ice sheet was actually growing. A recent study reported that the ice sheet had shrunk by 1,463km from 2010 to 2016.
Duffy disagreed, noting that “we have satellite records clearly documenting a shrinkage of the Antarctic ice sheet and an acceleration of that shrinkage”, citing “the National Snow and Ice Data Center and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration” for his data.
However, Brooks insisted: “Well, I’ve got a Nasa base in my district, and apparently, they’re telling you one thing and me a different thing.”
Brooks said: “There are plenty of studies that have come that show with respect to Antarctica that the total ice sheet, particularly that above land, is increasing, not decreasing. Now, you could make a different argument if you want to talk about Greenland or the Arctic.”
Brooks, a graduate of Duke University and University of Alabama School of Law, was first elected to Congress in 2010 from his North Alabama district. In 2017, he mounted an unsuccessful bid for the US Senate vacated by attorney general Jeff Sessions. Brooks finished third in the Republican primary behind the eventual nominee Roy Moore as well as appointed incumbent Luther Strange.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/17/republican-congressman-mo-brooks-sea-level-rise-rocks

George Monbiot (The UK government wants to put a price on nature – but that will destroy it, 15 May) suggests that in efforts to save the natural world there are grave dangers in putting a “price on nature”.
Yet one reason we are failing to do what is necessary is because nature is still seen as “nice to have”, rather than essential in sustaining our health, wealth and security. Many companies, economists and governments regard environmental destruction as a regrettable but inevitable consequence of economic growth – the “price of progress”. If we don’t change this mindset, then there will be little prospect for the revolution in ideas that is needed to avoid a mass extinction event and disastrous climatic changes. 
Nature underpins our economy, society and very existence. Talking about the economic contribution of the natural world does not lead to a price on nature, but rather it helps explain its hidden values. Talking about how we rely on healthy nature does not require conservationists to abandon their love of nature, their spiritual connections with it or the moral case for action. It does, however, add one more crucial argument for the kind of changes we need to secure.Tony JuniperDirector of advocacy and campaigns, WWF
• George Monbiot says trying to account for the value of nature will inevitably lead to its commodification and destruction. But our global economic system already places economic values on the natural world – and has done so for centuries. The problem is that the price placed on ecosystems and biodiversity is effectively zero. Our economies see these things as worthless because we have failed to measure, understand and account for the true value of nature’s riches. Markets remain largely blind to these benefits, and thus we consume them to the point of destruction.
Monbiot is incorrect when he says that “price represents an expectation of payment, in accordance with market rates”. In fact, price represents the attribution of economic value. Natural capital does not prepare nature for sale; it calls attention to the worth of what is lost. We have argued that all human prosperity rests on nature, and Monbiot is correct to point out that many natural resources are irreplaceable. Unfortunately, until we place a proper value on natural capital, the global economic system will continue to merrily saw away at the branch we’re all sitting on. Decades of well-intentioned conservation have done little; a new approach is required. Properly valuing the huge, irreplaceable natural contributions that we all depend on is a good place to start.Cameron Hepburn Professor of environmental economics, Smith School, University of Oxford, and director of economics of sustainability, INET, Oxford Martin School, Alex Teytelboym Associate professor, Department of Economics, University of Oxford, Francois Cohen Senior research officer, INET Oxford Martin, Kirk Hamilton Visiting professor, Department of Geography and Environment, LSEGreen Economy Coalition 
• I would certainly agree that calculating the value of nature only in economic terms is sterile and meaningless. However, in dealing with a government that demonstrates its only values are driven by economic considerations, the Natural Capital Committee has been a consistent supporter of environmental causes and gained the support of many environmental groups such as the Woodland Trust and Green Alliance. No doubt some conservatives would want the committee to take a narrow approach to their terms of reference, but they have clearly taken as wide an approach as possible and support many of the causes that Monbiot holds dear. Using economic and financial arguments for environmental causes, as Mr Monbiot often does himself, should not be seen as a threat, but as a source of vital support.Ira UnellNottinghamshire
• George Monbiot rightly cites Michael Sandel’s excellent book What Money Can’t Buy. I have found Sandel’s analysis to be enormously helpful in my work with city leaders. After the financial crash of 2008 many advocated new laws to rein in greed and force bankers to act more responsibly. These steps are still needed. But, as Monbiot affirms, Sandel identified an even bigger challenge: “The most fateful change that unfolded during the past three decades was not an increase in greed. It was the expansion of markets, and of market values, into spheres of life where they don’t belong.” Making a stand against market values is now more important than ever.Robin HambletonEmeritus professor of city leadership, University of the West of England
• Jason W Moore in Capitalism in the Web of Life argues that appropriating “cheap nature” (raw materials, energy, food, labour, including women’s reproductive labour) is the fundamental condition allowing capital to extract its surplus from the production process. Forcing up the price of “nature” is therefore one of the best strategies for hastening the demise of capitalism, an outcome devoutly to be wished for all on the green left.
True, putting up a “This is not for sale” notice (fencing off rewilded land, leaving oil in the ground) is one of the best tactics for pushing up prices. But we still need to eat, to reproduce, and to produce the means of subsistence, and sometimes an exorbitant price (for example, on pollinating insects, on childcare or on clean water) might work better. So maybe the best approach is purely tactical: keep both critiques, incompatible as they are, in mind, and apply whichever is more likely in particular circumstances to achieve the desirable outcome.
This approach best reflects the point that actually there is no natural world separate from the sphere of human endeavour; each is the creation of the other, and both market values and intrinsic values are human constructs for us to manage as best we can.Richard MiddletonCastle Douglas, Dumfries and Galloway
• I think George Monbiot may have missed the point. What if we valued nature at replacement cost? What if we charged palm oil producers the cost of restoring the environment so that numbers of orangutans returned to former levels? What if we valued nature generally at what it would cost to regenerate the passenger pigeon, the dodo, or countless other species of animals, birds, fish and plants – and the ecology on which they would depend? In practical terms, since we have no idea how to do that, the cost and therefore the value would be infinite. Let economists put that in their models and see what happens.Robert DimmickReading, Berkshire
• If the government and conservation organisations continue to insist that monetary values be ascribed to woodland and wildlife, the risk is that a development scheme that can create value £1 in excess of the supposed worth of your local woods will be economically compelling and will inevitably go ahead, replacing “natural capital” with housing capital or retail capital. Perhaps a solution would be to say that many natural “assets” are of infinite value, being unique locally or having an indefinite past and future (if left alone). People could be encouraged to list their local meadows, riverbanks, etc as being infinitely valuable, and then it would be impossible to mount an economic argument that they should be built upon.Dominic RaynerLeeds

Recent victims of the slow down include: Dick Smith ( 2,460 jobs), Masters Home Improvement ( 6,300 jobs), Payless Shoes ( 730), Gap (200 jobs), Esprit, Topshop and Topman ( 370 jobs). All these on top of Australia's record number of businesses that went broke following the GFC.

As for your inept and grossly uniformed idea that the LNP are only for the top end of town, that is ridiculous and as I said before the ALP (Australian Liar Party) wanted tax cuts years ago. Paul Keating wanted to bring in a GST however was rejected by caucus.
The ALP (Australian Liar Party ) know that all our treading partners and major competitors have lower corporate tax rates than we currently have.
The LNP has increased spending on health, education and made significant steps on policy the ALP (Australian Liar Party) could not make even way back to Paul; Keating days especially referencing the second airport for Sydney.
Your summation that the ALP (Australian Liar Party) are concerned for the majority is so puerile and without any proof, the ALP (Australian Liar Party) and Teflon Bill Shorten are there only to appease their union bosses and the 15% of workers who belong to a union.
Your pathetic rant at the private schools further shows your envy and class driven ideology, the government (all the last governments) have given funding to private schools and also given funding to the states who primarily fund the public schools.

But the criticism by government members highlighted yet again the Liberal party’s policy of pretending to care about something while simultaneously doing everything to work against it.
Peter Dutton and Tasmanian senator Eric Abetz bought into the issue of the ABC’s coverage of the royal wedding off the back of erroneous reporting in News Corp papers suggesting the ABC had flown hosts Annabel Crabb and Jeremy Fernandez to London in business class. Abetz, who is never one to miss an opportunity to slight the ABC, echoed Dutton’s thoughts when he suggested he would “would like to see the justification for flying those two over when there is a crew permanently in London”.
It is the standard operating procedure of the Liberal party: cut funding to the ABC that in effect is designed to ensure it struggles to do a professional job, then either criticise it for not being up to scratch or, when it does something professionally, criticise it for wasting money.
It’s the cannot-win argument. Had the ABC taken the cheaper option, Abetz and his ilk would have screamed about how the ABC disrespected the monarchy and Australians by not treating the event with the appropriate level of attention.
But really, all this talk about the ABC from Abetz and Dutton is just a continuation of the long run of the Liberal party being disingenuously concerned about things it is actively against.
Take the gender ​gap in parliament. There are a lot of furrowed brows within the Liberal party at the moment after the ​ dumping of frontbencher Jane Prentice as a candidate at the next election, and challenges to Victorian senator Jane Hume and NSW MP Ann Sudmalis, have made it rather all too clear just how few women they have in the parliament.
Only 13 of the 76 Liberal party MPs are women – rather a long way from its target of having 50% of women contesting “winnable seats” by 2025.
And yet, rather than introducing a quota to achieve this target, which has been proven to work (as the ALP has done and which now has women accounting for 47% of its MPs), it has instead chosen to throw money at the problem.
Kelly O’Dwyer has established a fund to help financially support ​female candidates. And while no doubt the aim is good, even this very market-based option has been attacked by those within the Liberal party.
Demonstrating the strong inherent bias against doing anything to improve the gender gap, ​ Eric Abetz (yes, once again) suggested the fund was not “necessarily consistent with the Liberal philosophy”.
Actually the fund is very much in keeping with that philosophy – it will do nothing to overcome the systemic bias against women but it looks like they’re trying to do something about it.
We get a policy that barely looks like they’re trying to achieve something and which is designed not to achieve its aim
It’s much like their position on climate change.
Many in the Liberal party wish to do nothing about it, and those who do are mostly content to do something that looks like something while studiously avoiding the one solution that has been shown to work.
The latest greenhouse gas emissions data released by the Department of Environment last week showed that during the carbon price period emissions continually fell, and since its end they have continually risen.
And yet Malcolm Turnbull and Josh Frydenberg – in the spirit of the Liberal party philosophy – have to come up with a policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that avoids not just putting a price on carbon but even looking like doing so. Thus we get a policy that barely even looks like they’re trying to achieve something and which is clearly designed not to achieve its aim.
And of course, economic policy is not excused from the pretence of care or accompanying lack of policy.
The latest wage growth figures showed yet again that wages have not risen in real terms in the past year. This is a problem for the government because, while the Liberal party has long been a champion of keeping wages growth down in the name of “competitiveness”, its budget is very much in favour of it.
The budget’s predictions for strong income tax growth in 2020-21 and 2021-22 are based on wages growth returning to 3.5%. Were that to occur, the budget predicts real wages would grow by 1% in those years.
And yet how is this to be achieved? Right now the only wages policy is company tax cuts in the hope that increased investment will improve productivity, which will then (eventually) flow through into stronger wage growth.
But in the meantime, the Liberal party has actively sought to reduce workers’ collective bargaining power through increased intervention in union activity, cheered the removal of penalty rates, and strenuously argued against any government intervention that might see a greater increase in the minimum wage.
And add to that their long history of criticism whenever a union either seeks or achieves a decent pay raise.
Back in January 2014, the then minister for employment, Eric Abetz (yes, again), warned that unless businesses stood up to unions’ pay demands, we risked seeing a “wages explosion”. At the time, overall wages were growing at just 2.7% and not one industry had annual wages growth above 3.5%, which is now the target for all wages for three years’ time.
Should wages growth ever actually reach the optimistic levels predicted in the budget, you can bet Liberal party MPs will decry the unions destroying our competitiveness and seek to implement ever more interventionist policy to reduce what power they have left.
And no doubt, in the tradition of the cannot-win argument, they will then criticise unions for failing to deliver for their members. ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/20/all-care-no-policy-liberal-party-pretenders-exposed

You say that you're an expert, but the fact that you believe that unrelated system losses should be included in panel efficiency indicates otherwise.
BQENDI've never called myself an expert, I'm simply a PV'er that offers free advice to potential PV'ers, to help them along the way.
Perhaps you have mistaken me for an expert by comparing my knowledge to yours, but the error there is that I only appear to know 'so much' due to the low baseline. My actual knowledge, like most folk on most subjects is actually very small, it's the learning that is important.
Should I also mention how you told me 50d pitch PV was 'only' suitable for the Arctic, whereas in reality it is near perfect in the UK, having only a 1.5% loss v's 30d pitch PV, but with a 10% lower generation in summer, and a 20% higher generation in the winter, it is a far better match as regards supply and demand.
Should I mention your dozens and dozens of posts telling me that a battery wouldn't reduce my import form 1,500kWh pa down to 600kWh pa, as a battery doesn't reduce import at all. Though I suspect you realised your error on this at the very end as your last post suddenly changed import to 'net import', an unusual term that I suspect means 'consumption', and was an attempt to hide your repeated errors.

Reality they are entirely common and always have been, but you are welcome to provide the make and model of a PV GTi that has UK & MCS certification but doesn't have an MPPT, just because I've never ever heard of one, doesn't mean they don't exist somewhere, perhaps?
BQSTART
""That MPPT's cost £1,700 each."" - No, I gave a range from low to high (excluding the cheap 12/24v ones) and the last commercial (HV) MPPT I saw at a 8MWp VC investor pv farm in Devizes cost (WCP) £1700+VAT - no doubt bigger/multi channel ones cost even more.

BQSTART
C - Does your system use MPPT? 
M - Of course it does, they all do In fact my two systems have a total of 26 MMPT's.
C- Well that clinches it - you don't. You've clearly confused what a MPPT is (which cost in the range £250-£1700) with a simple 12/24v panel mount voltage regulator.
BQEND
Reality - GTi's (grid tie inverters) have one or more MPPT's. They do not cost £250-£1,700, in fact each of my PO's (power optimisers (one per panel)) has a MPPT, and they only cost about £40 retail, and that's the whole cost of the PO, not the MPPT. Going back to the early FiT days (2010(ish)) a dual MPPT inverter would cost about £50 more than a single MPPT model.
To further jog your memory, I pointed out that a 20% efficient PV panel in the UK could generate about 200kWh'sm2 pa, (I said about 206kWh) and this supported the argument that in sunnier parts of the world 400kWh's/m2 pa was entirely possible as per the Land Art stats for 2030.
You attempted to claim that the Land Art generation was incorrect and more land would be needed, then posted your generation:-
BQSTART
insolation in the southern UK provided me with a capacity factor of circa 13% last year - but it took a lot of extras (such as MPPT (intelligent panel control)) to get that figure.

To which I replied with:
BQSTART
That's excellent generation, so around 1,140kWh's/kWp, or about 230+kWh's/m2 at 20% efficiency. So better than the numbers I've been using.
BQEND
You responded to this 'revelation' by trying to deny your own figures:

That's hypothetical per day, off the panel (calculated from insolation) - real world figures will be lower due to dirt, cabling (DC is very lossy) and inverter losses..

You say that you're an expert, but the fact that you believe that unrelated system losses should be included in panel efficiency indicates otherwise.
But FYI: My system of solar+batteries and generator with auto charge control (which we have to override in specific circumstances) means that we cannot calculate a specific system cf because there are times, such as running the washer/dryer when cooking, that we have to run an 11kw generator.And as that doesn't use appreciably more fuel between 20 and 80% load, we save up and do it all at once to keep generator running to a minimum and so charge the battery banks at 120+amps and dump the solar o/p into the calorifier.Hence no simple system cf is calculable, therefore the other reason for direct panel only reading from the MPPT software, not the battery controller/inverter system metric.

The energy return and energy density for renewables is just not that good—the higher values for solar and wind do not include storage and that is likely to pull them into the 2:1 level—and possible worse.
BQEND
you would need to have link on that- [and I presume 1: invested for two out]
If we focus purely on transport then the inclusion of a battery on a like for like nature [i.e. a 300 mile range Model S with a luxury ICE] then the embedded energy [and CO2] is at most 50% more. So using CO2 as an indication of energy use [as a neat comparison]So 2 tonnes of CO2 to produce an ICV and 3 tonnes to produce an EV- in lifetimes the EV doing 100,000 miles [i.e. 10 years, the average life expectancy of both EVs and ICVs is 13] - such as a Tesla S will consume about 4,000 kWh [4 MWh] over the year, 40,000 kWh [40 MWh] over its life.
In energy/CO2 terms this from wind would be [using plumb's IPCC link] 12 grams / kWh, and for solar 40 grams/kWh [although the location varies the amount from 8 grams to 80 grams]- 12g/kWh = 1.2kg MWh x 40 is about a half a tonne, and for solar near 2 tonnes.
A petrol or diesel of that size is doing between 100g and 200g a mile x 10,000 miles meaning it is producing 1.5 tonnes a year and 15 tonnes over its life.
The g/km are based on simply the CO2 produced in combustion- However oil requires energy to extract and process so saudi oil is lower in CO2 content because it requires less energy to extract and process, Canadian tarsands is 25% more CO2 because of the processing and extraction inputs. One of the missing pieces of data is the processing cost in energy and CO2 of refining and capex.
Material requirements of renewables and batteries is not an issue yet- there is plenty of lithium, it can be recycled as can cobalt and rare [not rare] earth metals- and the auto makers are gaining energy density by reducing the material content.
And at some point non fossil fuel energy will be producing all the energy to make more wind turbines and solar panels. Steel making is a problem- recycling can be done with electric [and it is a cheaper method] but ore needing the oxygen to be stripped out will always produce CO2 and the need for CCS.
However the point I make is that oil is quickly becoming energy intense as well.On a grid level other forms of storage make sense- like pumped, batteries are great in domestic, business, and transport use, just as laptops are very useful. And it is a challenge- but I'm optimistic.

SIDEBAR: I blame the internet…the single largest source of misinformation. A while back, after reading “The Martian,” I was engaging on line to find out if the potatoes could actually be grown on Mars. I was doubtful from a thermodynamic/chemistry of the soil standpoint and asked if anyone had the answer. I am not versed in squishy biosciences. The feedback I got was just essentially an attack on how could I doubt such…and all I did was ask. I still don’t know the answer definitively.
I am here for the physics/math and hopefully to educate and learn at the same time. 
When it comes to renewables, I am all for them…but, I will always point out the limitations related to energy return/density and problems with storage. The main point is that the energy of the future is going to be more expensive and more difficult to distribute..etc. (I have a few decades of experience putting electricity on the grid.)
The most expensive electricity in Europe is in Germany and Denmark and they have the largest renewable programs. Germany’s CO2 emission have not dropped much in the last few years per capita. So, we really haven’t stepped up sufficiently yet in all energy sectors. reposting link:

In the US, there is about one million MW of installed capacity...for renewables, MIT estimates about 2 to 5 times that capacity is needed to cover the grid with reasonable availability...that is a lot of stuff. 
An additional issue is the materials requirement...such as silver for photo voltaics…lithium for batteries. Thin film requiring tellurium…a total boondoggle at high penetration levels. Neodymium and dysprosium for many wind turbines are all not going to be as plentiful as needed…etc. Recycling batteries is OK, but that is also net negative. Recycling solar panels is difficult due to the diffuse nature of their installation.

Mackay give a false impression- he implies that even maxing out renewables will not satisfy current energy demand. There is no need for the UK to provide energy for 'stuff' or imports- we rely on the the country making 'stuff' to find their own energy.Likewise the future will have to be different- we cannot even with nuclear make our own synthfuel to replace oil- that 40 kWh per person per day of oil will most likely be 10 kWh for EVs, and perhaps less if we end up with a dial a car for transport as the preferred choice.
the challenge of renewables is to provide 20 kWh per person per day [and that would include EVs] and to replace the heating element of 37 kWh current supplied with gas in the main with heat pumps that can be reduced to 10-15 kWh in electrical use.

So if 22% is wrong because it's based on shaky assumptions, what is the correct percentage?
BQEND
It could be higher although unlikely, it could be 0%.US coal production is a great example of how resources peak and actually running out is not the reason they go into decline.Back in the 90s US coal peaked, although more was burnt than ever- it peaked in energy terms. Even back in the 00s 50% of electricty came from coal they needed to burn far more of it to get the same bang for buck- simply because coal comes in various energy densities ranging from lignite up to hard anthracite I found this list ages ago and posted it up to some [delighted] consternation-
BQSTART
#1 Anthracite 30 millijoules per kilogram #2 Bituminous 18.8–29.3 millijoules per kilogram #3 Sub-bituminous 8.3–25 millijoules per kilogram #4 Lignite (brown coal) 5.5–14.3 millijoules per kilogram
BQEND

The website despite being a professional financial advisory portal to investments didn't get the measures right Mj should be MEGAjoules.
Miners being sensible mined the easy to get to high energy coal first- and then they were forced to spend more time digging out rock, and then forced to switch to lower quality coals- to the point US coal producers were making a loss on the coal they sold and went bankrupt.
Two things are saving the free market from destroying coal completely- very cheap debt and very old power stations. Most of the US has old sub critical power plants.They are cheap to run because they were paid for decades ago and they got a get out clause to allow them not to have clean up their pollution.
In China all new coal power plants are either super critical or ultra supercritical - i.e. they get more energy out of a tonne of coal than subcritical. The US is mainly old plants built before 1990 - and they are inefficient effectively burning 20% coal than they need to- which means the buyers of coal are looking to keep the price super low, and they are the only customer so they can set the price.
By 2050 most of the US coal power station fleet will need replacing.Add to this the huge debt coal mining companies carry- because the buyers have driven down the profits- debt is based on the notion that things will get better and that a return will happen.

It does not matter that MacKay issued a book—it matters whether it is correct or not.

Mackay is just correct.
The EROEI paper is not an “outlier” or old. It is one of the most comprehensive approached to energy return and only a few years old. There is no “consensus” on EROEI for solar or wind that I have seen and all of those typically published do not include storage.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1527275009000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'17680035', u'in_reply_to': u'116231931', u'id': u'116235010', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'JulesBywaterLees', u'text': u'I don't dispute that renewables do use more materials than fossil fuel power- mainly because fossil fuel power uses million year old stored energy, and nuclear uses billion year old nuclear energy.Likewise the most sensible thing would be to have public transport rather than millions of cars, or one central computer rather than millions of smart phones and pcs.
Recycling of materials only works if the energy input/cost is lower than new resource- for a lot of plastics the need for sorting, collection etc makes it energy intense.your EROI link makes for some interesting reading- but it does set a particular bar that only nuclear [and gas] can cross, and 'buffering' EROI if it is not perfectly suited to instant use.It is an outlier and quite an old one - in the same way a notorious paper took the worst of nuclear and came up with a 1:1 EROI. So I'll stick to the general consensus.As for Mackay- WOHA is an interesting book, it is just a book, it is not a paper.My criticism is more in presenting arguments- for instance if W/M2 is the best way to measure energy generation then nuclear wins. But if we looked at calories to the hectare then sugar cane would win [and no one is suggesting we survive on sugar].
It's a bit like Top Trumps of my youth- the winning card was not always the best bike or car or plane.So for w/M2 it doesn't matter if vast offshore waters are used for energy- they are not being used for much else. And they provide cheap energy [now at £65 MWh], reefs and fish protection areas [and the EROI is very good]. Likewise if a solar roof is similar in price to a tile roof why not have both the protection of a roof and energy- it is not as if the sq metres are being used for anything else.
But my biggest complaint is the final 'can we survive on renewables page' 18- where a staggering 195 kWh per person per day is presented as the challenge for renewables to meet. it includes the current petrol/diesel fuel consumption of 40 kWh [4 ltrs a day per person] air travel, imports etc etc.It may be a really good example of energy intense lifestyle but does not represent the energy generation renewables could provide or our actual needs. If it were 'can nuclear provide our energy needs ?' then 195 kWh per person would mean 300 new nuclear power stations to be built before 2050.We use about 15-20 kWh per person per day [according to Mackay in the ref] And renewables only need to provide that- still a challenge.
And the energy future is not going to be 40 kWh of personal car energy- it will be 10 kWh of EV electrical energy. And we certainly cannot sustain our leaky British homes- meaning heating needs should decline.

The criticisms that tend follow miss the point- plumb's literal interpretation that is then back up by someone else's maths that calculate twice as much space is required. Following a logical conclusion to the extreme because clearly if the super solar farm was built in one place like the Sahara then we would need new roads, towns, cities, infrastructure to run the place, a huge water supply etc etc.
but of course no one intends anything even vaguely similar- it is an illustration to make a few points- we have the tech now, we have the spare space.
The Uk is not the world- so we have a lot of wind, but saying that even with very low commercial subsidies for solar, and relatively high installation costs [compared to the low panel cost] solar for business makes economic sense.

 18 gallons of diesel at 9 kWh per litre = 70 ltrs x 10= 700kWh -correct, but a diesel engine is rubbish in energy use terms with 75% being wasted in heat etc- a 700 kWh EV battery [and 200 kW motor] is closer to 80 gallons in real use terms.
Take an average 20 tonne excavator- it uses a 90 kW diesel engine to run the hydraulics. In a long 10 hr working day the fuel consumption is around 200 litres. i.e. 2 MWh- for an EV with no conversion losses from heat etc that is just 500 kWhThe Tesla 100 kWh battery weighs just under 600 kg, so total weight is 3 tonnes
Excavators have a bucket size of about a tonne of material- and with the arm need 2 to 3 tonnes of counter weight- the engine will be a lot but they need another tonne or so of iron - i.e. simply replacing engine and weights with batteries is no problem.
cost savings are huge- 200 ltrs at 65p ltr are £130 - the recharge cost of 500 +10% max charge loss for fast charging- at 8p kWh = £40and [according to fleet operators of buses] a 40%-50% saving in maintenance.The big factor is cost- batteries are around the $200 kWh, so we need to wait another few years to see $100 kWh.

insolation in the southern UK provided me with a capacity factor of circa 13% last year - but it took a lot of extras (such as MPPT (intelligent panel control)) to get that figure.
BQENDThat's excellent generation, so around 1,140kWh's/kWp, or about 230+kWh's/m2 at 20% efficiency. So better than the numbers I've been using.
Just goes to show how accurate the PVGIS numbers are, and the many comments from fellow PV'ers that they are a bit pessimistic.
BTW, an MPPT isn't anything special when it comes to PV inverters, they are entirely standard.

The calc assumes full 1000 watt/m2 hitting the panels for 8 hours a day for 250 days out of the year. That power level is ideal at the equator at noon and not what happens even with tracking. Higher latitudes will obviously have less insolation. Here is a calculator if you want to look such:

The 16 hours a day when energy is not available and therefore would require storage--which is really not at all plausible due to the limits of such is not even mentioned.

Evaluated against these objective criteria, none of the 24 studies provides convincing evidence that these basic feasibility criteria can be met. Of a maximum possible unweighted feasibility score of seven, the highest score for any one study was four. Eight of 24 scenarios (33%) provided no form of system simulation. Twelve (50%) relied on unrealistic forecasts of energy demand. While four studies (17%; all regional) articulated transmission requirements, only two scenarios—drawn from the same study—addressed ancillary-service requirements. In addition to feasibility issues, the heavy reliance on exploitation of hydroelectricity and biomass raises concerns regarding environmental sustainability and social justice. Strong empirical evidence of feasibility must be demonstrated for any study that attempts to construct or model a low-carbon energy future based on any combination of low-carbon technology.
BQEND
So pedantically they perhaps did not say 100% was impossible- just that the meta study revealed to them - with their distinct criteria - that these studies were flawed.
i certainly think that some countries like Scotland, Wales [sadly just a principality] Portugal, Hawaii etc etc can switch to 100% renewables for electricity and EVs making a big impact on all energy use with ease. 
On a case by case study the future is optimistic- but obviously each country has its needs- Switzerland with little heavy industry can cut back with efficiencies and use a lot of hydro, where as China with a large manufacturing sector [but a very electrified economy] would have to roll out a huge amount of nuclear.
Can we- the UK do it? If we had 30 years of investment in building standards, heat pumps, public transport, EVs and offshore wind and new pumped air/hydro [which means would have to convert Welsh and Scottish reservoirs to twin lake pumped hydro] then may be. But we would also need to import French nuclear, Spanish solar etc as well [but export wind].

The best annual solar insolation in the UK is only 1100KWh per m2 per annum so again dividing by 8760 derives 125W/m2 at the very best.
BQEND
Oh boy, where to start. So the person you are trying to agree with stated that 400KWh/m2 wasn't reasonable, but you point to 125W/m2 as a starting point, which is, (please check my maths) 1,095kWh pa ....... ah, pretty much what you said, so were you trying to prove or disprove the 400kWh claim.
Next, I'll point out that the best solar generation in the UK is approx 1,100kWh's per kWp, not per m2, but again (like the other nay-sayer posters) you are using solar insolation as your argument basis, not generation, so I'll let that slide.
Now, back to reality, if you take a look at PVGIS you will see that 1,000kWh/kWp is certainly possible for a lot of the UK for south facing panels. 1kWp of panels at 20% efficiency would be approx 4.8m2, so about 208kWh's/m2.
I believe I gave a similar figure earlier. I also explained that generation of twice this is possible in sunnier areas, and that further gains can be made with single or dual axis systems.
So is 400kWh's/m2 reasonable, certainly looks so.

The calc is a bit bogus as well...the assumption of 400Kw-hrs/m^2/yr for solar panels is just not reasonable.
BQENDLooks about right to me. So a 20% efficiency solar panel of the typical sizing of 1.6m by 1m would be 330Wp. 280-315Wp panels are now relatively standard as the install choice, up from about 250Wp a few years back.
330Wp for 1.6m2 = 206Wp/m2.
In the UK you can expect approx 1,000kWh/kWp, so that's approx 206kWh pa.
Many parts of the world get 1.5 to 2 times the generation pa from PV that the UK gets, so that takes us to approx 400kWh/m2 pa. Spain as an example gets generation close to 1,700kWh/kWp pa.
Then of course we can add on single axis tracking as is popular in the States and Australia, or even double axis tracking, which can lift generation another 20-50% pa. [Checking Almeria in southern Spain I get 1,670kWh/kWp for fixed roof panels, and 2,340kWh/kWp for 2 axis tracking.]
Also consider the fact that we are close to the 20% efficiency chosen in the article already, and combined silicon/Perovskite panels aim to be in the 30's even high 30%'s in a decade.

It seems as though disputing established climate science is House Republicans’ favorite hobby. This time, it was Philip Duffy’s turn to spend two hours playing whack-a-mole with the committee Republicans’ endless supply of long-debunked climate myths.
Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) claimed that sea level rise is due to the White Cliffs of Dover tumbling into the ocean (yes, really), and his colleagues argued that scientists in the 1970s were predicting global cooling, that Earth is just returning to its “normal temperature,” that Antarctic ice is growing, and sea levels are hardly rising. 
Nice rejoinder to yesterday's silliness about rocks (and not melting ice) raising sea-level. You need an 8 mile diameter, 6 quadrillion pound rock (every year) to reproduce the observed sea-level rise. that's a really big rock! https://t.co/MQgTaYpdlq https://t.co/N8kmIgBDLh
Those last two claims originated from a Wall Street Journal (WSJ) editorial entered into the Congressional record by Chairman Lamar Smith (R-TX), written by Fred Singer. As the group Ozone Action documented, Singer has been a lifetime contrarian on virtually every scientific subject imaginable - acid rain, nuclear winter, nuclear waste, nuclear war, ozone depletion, secondhand smoke, amphibian population loss, and even minimum wage benefits. In recent decades he’s worked for a plethora of fossil fuel-funded think tanks, denying established climate science.
Singer’s WSJ editorial is difficult to follow, largely because it contradicts itself several times, saying:
there is also good data showing sea levels are in fact rising at an accelerating rate ... to keep the rate of rise constant, as observed...
Obviously if sea level rise is accelerating, it’s not increasing at a constant rate. The WSJ later “corrected” that first sentence, thus removing one of the few accurate statements in the editorial - sea level rise is indeed accelerating.
The article has been updated from “data showing sea levels are in fact rising at an accelerating rate” to “in fact rising at a constant rate”which doesn’t make it more correct.@WSJopinion @jamestaranto why the quiet update? pic.twitter.com/l9IftFNpSB
Singer’s explanation for why the accelerating sea level rise isn’t accelerating likewise contradicts itself:
the temperature of sea water has no direct effect on sea-level rise … accumulation of ice on the Antarctic continent has been offsetting the steric effect [sea level rise due to warming temperatures] for at least several centuries.
Here, Singer first claims that the basic physics of thermal expansion is wrong, or at least somehow doesn’t apply to ocean water, but then argues it is real and is merely being offset by ice growth on Antarctica. The latter claim is of course also wrong – Antarctica has been losing land ice and a recent study found that it’s responsible for 8% of sea level rise since 1993 (thermal expansion is the biggest contributor, at 42%). 
As one sea level researcher at Climate Feedback described Singer’s editorial, “If this were an essay in one of my undergraduate classes, he would fail.” The whole thing is complete nonsense, denying basic physics, and yet was published in the WSJ and entered into the congressional record. This is the material that House Republicans and their conservative media allies who reject climate science and oppose all climate policies find most compelling. That says a lot about the state of climate denial on the American right today.

Around the same time, Politico ran a story written by Jonathan Lesser, who’s an energy industry consultant with the Koch-, Mercer-, tobacco industry-, and Exxon-funded Manhattan Institute (which Politico failed to mention). It claims, based on a Manhattan Institute report written by Lesser, that “more electric cars and trucks will mean more pollution.”
This conclusion rests upon a number of shaky assumptions. First, it considers not today’s power grid mix, but rather the US Energy Information Administration (EIA)’s projections out to the year 2050. The EIA is notorious for underestimating the growth of clean energy, and projects that coal will continue to supply 22% of US electricity 32 years hence. To put this in perspective, the share of US electricity supplied by coal fell from 51% in 2008 to 31% in 2016. According to an analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists, nearly half of the remaining coal plants will likely retire or convert to natural gas in the near future. In short, the EIA is unrealistically bullish on fossil fuels.
Electricity generated by burning coal produces significant air pollution, and so using these assumptions, Lesser concludes that American electric cars will generate more air pollutants that are harmful to human health than gasoline-powered cars. But if the electricity generated to charge electric vehicles is cleaner than in his assumptions – a near-certainty – the conclusions won’t hold.
Lesser also admits that even with these conservative assumptions, carbon pollution emissions from electric cars would be at least 70% lower in 2050 than those from gasoline-powered cars. He dismisses this result by claiming “the [carbon pollution] reductions will have no impact on climate” (because it’s a small change relative to the carbon pollution from all American power generation), but this argument could apply to any individual effort to cut carbon pollution (it’s called a ‘Tragedy of the Commons’). In fact, transportation currently accounts for close to 30% of US carbon pollution, so switching to electric cars is a critically important step to tackle America’s large contribution to climate change.
The cleanliness of an electric car depends on the source of its electricity, and that varies greatly by region. The Union of Concerned Scientists created an interactive tool to check this based on US zip code. Currently, half of American electric cars are sold in California, where in many areas they achieve an equivalent of 130 miles per gallon. And about one-third of households buying electric cars today also have solar panels to charge them, producing zero-pollution fuel.
In short, yes, electric cars are green and global warming is causing sea level rise. It’s not a coincidence that arguments to the contrary are made by individuals whose paychecks and campaign donations are supplied by the fossil fuel industry.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/may/21/yes-evs-are-green-and-global-warming-is-raising-sea-levels

At least 65 people have died in Karachi in recent days according to the charitable organisation that runs the central morgue in the Pakistani port city, as volunteers handed out water to labourers and others working outside in temperatures as high as 44C.
Local media reports claimed the death toll could have exceeded 100 in the sprawling megacity of 15 million, where high temperatures are exacerbated by an absence of green space, estimated to make up just 7% of the urban area.
Authorities in Karachi have not confirmed the death toll but urged people to stay indoors and keep drinking water.
Parts of the city have also been suffering from power cuts, particularly early in the morning when more people than usual have been waking to eat before sunrise in line with Ramadan fasting rituals.
During the annual month-long rite, Muslims refrain from eating or drinking anything including water between sunrise and sunset, though children, older people, the sick and pregnant women usually do not participate.
The Edhi Foundation, which runs Karachi’s central morgue, said most of the dead in the city were working-class people from poorer neighbourhoods, including children and elderly people.
“They work around heaters and boilers in textile factories and there is eight to nine hours of [scheduled power outages] in these areas,” Faisal Edhi, the head of the foundation, told Reuters.
Fazlullah Pechuho, the health minister of Sindh province, denied that anyone had died, however, telling the Dawn newspaper: “I categorically reject that people have died due to heatstroke in Karachi.”
A heatwave in 2015 left morgues and hospitals overwhelmed and killed at least 1,200 mostly elderly, sick, and homeless people.
In 2015, the Edhi morgue ran out of freezer space after about 650 bodies were brought in the space of a few days. Ambulances left decaying corpses outside in the sweltering heat.
Extreme temperatures were also recorded in neighbouring India, with parts of Maharashtra state reaching 47C on Monday.
More than 22,000 people died in heatwaves in India between 1992 and 2005, according to government data released last year.
Authorities say that figure has fallen dramatically since as a result of public health campaigns, including training medical staff to diagnose heat-related illnesses and sending colour-coded temperature warnings through the media and WhatsApp.
Last year, about 222 Indians died because of the heat, the government says, down from 1,111 in 2016 and 2,040 the year before.
Temperatures in Karachi are expected to stay above 40C until 24 May, according to weather forecasters. High temperatures were also predicted to last another 48 hours in India.

While chief executive Ben van Beurden’s €8.9m (£7.79m) pay package for 2017 was approved, more than a quarter of shareholders voted against the firm’s remuneration report at its annual general meeting on Tuesday.
Gerard Kleisterlee, the chair of the remuneration committee, blamed the result on proxy advisers.
Influential shareholder adviser ISS had urged investors to reject the pay award because of the company’s performance on sustainable development targets and an accident in Pakistan which led to the deaths of 221 people. 
The rebellion is the latest in a series of revolts against corporate pay, including 37% of shareholders voting against or abstaining on AstroZenca’s remuneration report last week. Melrose, Inmarsat and Unilever have been hit this year with significant votes against pay packages, though Shell’s fellow oil major BP avoided one on Monday.
Shell also faced a grilling from investors over how sincere its action is on reducing carbon emissions, with about half the questions related to climate change during the four-hour AGM. 
However, the company defeated a resolution calling for it to set tougher emissions targets in line with the Paris climate deal. 
The resolution was backed by 5.54% of shareholders; a similar resolution in 2017 was backed by 6.3%. 
“Investors are sending a clear signal to Shell and all oil and gas companies, that they will not accept a goal of halving net carbon emissions by 2050 [set by Shell],” said Mark van Baal of Follow This, the group which brought the proposal. 
He noted that seven of the Netherland’s 10 biggest asset owners had supported the resolution.
Van Beurden repeatedly defended the company’s record on climate change, referring to its target to halve the carbon footprint of its products by 2050 and company scenarios showing how the world could keep temperatures below 2C.
“This ambition is truly industry-leading, nobody else comes close. It is seriously ambitious,” he told the AGM, adding that the resolution would tie the firm’s hands.
“Your company wants to lead, so let us. So follow us,” he quipped in reference to the activist shareholder group’s name.
Van Baal accused the chief executive of misleading investors that Shell’s carbon targets were aligned with a sub-2C world. “I’m not misleading shareholders,” van Beurden retorted.
The chief executive said that at some point the firm would have to grapple with how to tie its carbon targets to executive pay, without giving a timeframe for action. 
The company also faced questions over the impact of its operations in Argentina, Nigeria and the Netherlands, conditions and terms for workers, and an ongoing corruption trial in Italy.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/22/shell-climate-change-executive-pay-oil-carbon-emissions-agm

I have long felt that people keeping pets (for the person's comfort & enjoyment) plays out very much like slavery.
BQEND
We don't all have that kind of relationship with our animal friends. It is true the majority of people see their ""pets"" as property, many ""train"" them to act like compliant robots.
My relationship with my avatar is one of mutual respect. Our relationship isnt based on dominance, he is free to go in & out & pretty much allowed to do as his nature dictates. Because of society's rules & laws & modern life, there are certain things I must protect him & them against. He knows a few terms NO, Come, Leave.
I once watched a typical dog owner with 2 Labradors, they came to his recall instantly, sat on command offered each paw in turn when prompted to have their paws wiped clean with a towel, before leaping into their respective cages in the back of the estate car they came in. I was absolutely appalled at this demonstration.
I wouldn't accept the responsibility of being my best friends guardian if i couldn't give him 24/7 of my time or provide him the freedom he has, we share everything we do & i try my hardest to treat him equally to the horror of many people. As i say there are a few things Human society frowns upon that i have to stop him doing for his own safety, i only wish i didn't. 
But our relationship is based on trust & love & as such i trust him with my life, he treats me with the upmost respect & affection he has never shown any form of aggression towards me or anyone else!', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1527299228000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'17206208', u'in_reply_to': u'116183762', u'id': u'116241401', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'VinceDaFox', u'text': u'BQSTART

Make no mistake people, we've long passed the Rubicon. We have consigned a huge chuck of our biodiversity to inevitable and unavoidable extinction, and within the next century a serious chunk of humanity will follow. It's simple closed-systems equilibrium science, a fact of numbers and the laws of nature.
Societies and the people who govern them are kidding themselves that there's still a chance for a soft landing - if they're even facing the fact of collapse in the first place. There is no soft landing, there's only a hard one or a very hard one, with the choice of even harder still if we don't immediately enact emergency measures to slightly reduce the damage that's coming.

You've confused nature with individual organisms.
BQENDNo I haven’t. If individual organisms are a prodcut of nature, then so too is their concern.
BQSTART
Nature doesn't have concerns because it's not actually an entity.
BQENDThe body of nature is the universe, and nature is the sum total of everything in it. It has more of a right to call itself an entity than you do, since you are dependent on it, but nature is not dependent on you; you are a part of it, it is complete, with or without you. We are products of nature, so how can we be more than our source? “She walks an autumn ampler than the wind/ Cries up for us and colder than the frost/ Pricks in our spirits at the summer's end,/ And over the bare spaces of our skies/ She sees a barer sky that does not bend.”*
Furthermore, nature exists in consciousness, which is universal. Obviously. Where else would it exist, if not in consciousness, which operates on many levels, dreaming and waking being the most obvious example. Existence and consciousness are one and the same. An electron ‘knows’ that it's an electron, and what to do, otherwise it wouldn’t be able to do it, and you would have to invent an exterior knower which knows on its behalf - like God - which I suspect you would be reluctant to do, quite understandably. That leaves you an alternative. If it isn’t an external deity guiding the electron to behave according to nature’s laws, then it must be the electron. Nature ‘knows’ how to exist. It’s the ghost in the machine, if you like; the programme: ""What talent for the makeshift thought/ A living corpus out of odds and ends?/ What pedagogic patience taught/ Preoccupied and savage elements/ To dance into a segregated charm?/ Who showed the whirlwind how to be an arm,/ And gardened from the wilderness of space/ The sensual properties of one dear face?”* 
Some people are so literal they can only see what they can see, and take that for reality, without acknowledging that what we see remains a mystery. The sky appears to bend because those are the limitations of our perspective, and those limitations operate at the highest level of inquiry. But the literal see a body that appears separate and end up assuming that they’re separate, independent entities, which leads to anthropocentrism. Anthropocentrism, which prioritises humans above all else in the universe, has brought us to the brink of disaster, so recommending it as the best argument for our environmental future appears problematic.

You can even see this effect somewhat among families with only a few kids as opposed to larger families - and not because people don't care, it just seems to be the effect on family lifestyle.The other element I think is that culturally and economically we don't really encourage moderation. We tend to think moderation in one area is unrelated to another, but I suspect that isn't the case. While some individuals are less inclined to certain types of excess, generally the ability to be moderate can be transferred to some extent to other areas of life, it's about habit building and learning how to manage your own behaviour.

The bedrock of modern capitalism is the law of contract. Without which our society could not function.
Within this construct nature has no rights. The law is used to restrict certain aspects of what a property owner can do with the property that s/he owns. And since property has none of the attributes of human beings, (a tree cannot contest a felling order), it cannot express individual will.
So, on one level the ideas advanced in this article are daft/borderline loony. But the continuation of our species is dependent upon us protecting the earths environment and all nature.
Evolution did not stop at the development of homo sapiens. And in that sense we are no different to previous species (long since extinct) that once upon a time strutted about the planet claiming to own it.
One can imagine the dinosaurs discussing ( I stretch the point here) answers to their plight around the time of their own extinction as a species. ' Look, some of us are 100 feet long with a brain the size of a walnut!'. These guys eat a forest for breakfast!
Well of course that meeting never took place, because dinosaurs were too undeveloped to understand what was happening to themselves as a species.
And we are developed enough too. We use artificial constraints (an economic, political and legal system) which frustrates any attempt to put nature in front of the drive to amass vast profit for a few at the expense of nature which of course we are but a small segment.
And since we rely upon our environment for our survival, then I would say that the artificial systems we have created ignore natural laws of existence. Of course, this could all be changed, but not under the present order of human society.

It’s not just humans who need rights | Mari Margil,article,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/23/laws-slaves-nature-humans-rights-environment-amazon,0,"The Amazon rainforest is often called the earth’s lungs, and generates 20% of the world’s oxygen. Yet in the past half-century nearly a fifth of it has been cut down. The felling and burning of millions of trees is releasing massive amounts of carbon, in turn depleting the Amazon’s capacity to be one of the world’s largest carbon sinks – the natural systems that suck up and store carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
Recently, 25 children brought a lawsuit to end the deforestation and its devastating impacts on the environment and their own wellbeing. The case made its way to Colombia’s supreme court, which issued its decision last month. While deforestation is hardly a new issue in this region, the court’s response to the lawsuit certainly was. Commenting that environmental degradation – not only in the Amazon but worldwide – is so significant that it threatens “human existence”, the court declared the Colombian Amazon a “subject of rights”.
In 1972 the law professor Christopher Stone published a seminal article, Should Trees Have Standing?, that explored the possibility of recognising the legal rights of nature. He described how women and slaves had long been treated as rightless in law, and suggested that just as they had eventually attained rights, so trees and other nonhuman living things should also do so.
Today, environmental laws regulate the human use and destruction of nature. They legalise fracking, drilling, and even dynamiting the tops off mountains to mine coal. The consequences are proving catastrophic: the die-off crisis of the world’s coral reefs, accelerating species extinction, climate change. Finally, though, this is changing. In 2006 the first law recognising the legal rights of nature was enacted in the borough of Tamaqua, Pennsylvania, in the United States. The community sought to prevent dredging sludge laden with PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyl) being dumped in an abandoned coalmine. The organisation I work for, the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund, helped the council draft the law, transforming nature from being rightless to possessing rights to exist and flourish. It was the first such law in the world. Communities across more than 10 US states have now followed suit, including New Hampshire, Colorado and Pittsburgh.
After the decision to grant legal rights to nature in Pennsylvania, representatives of my organisation met Ecuador’s constituent assembly in 2008, which was elected to draft a new constitution. We discussed the rights of nature, and why communities all over the world find themselves unable to protect nature under laws that authorise its exploitation. The assembly’s president, Alberto Acosta, told us: “Nature is a slave.”
In 2006 the first law recognising the legal rights of nature was enacted in the borough of Tamaqua, Pennsylvania
However, that year Ecuador enshrined the rights of nature – or Pachamama (Mother Earth) – in its constitution, the first country to do so. Since then Bolivia has put in place a Law of Mother Earth. Courts in India and Colombia have similarly ruled that ecosystems possess rights. In Mexico, Pakistan, Australia and other countries, rights-of-nature frameworks are being proposed and enacted.
Colombia’s supreme court was asked to consider the climate-change impacts of Amazon deforestation in the lawsuit that led to its groundbreaking ruling. Similarly, in Nepal the Center for Economic and Social Development is working to advance rights to protect against climate change. The Himalayas – known as the world’s third pole – are experiencing warming faster than any other mountain range on earth. With the melting of ice and snow, a Sherpa told us, “the mountains are turning black”. But now a constitutional amendment has been developed that would, if adopted, recognise the rights of the Himalayas to a climate system free from global-warming pollution. It would for the first time provide a platform for Nepal to hold major climate polluters accountable for violating the rights of the mountains.
Law today divides the world into two categories: persons, capable of having rights; and property, unable to possess rights. While there is no universally agreed upon definition of “legal person”, it is generally understood to mean an entity capable of bearing rights and duties. The problem that the rights-of-nature movement is now encountering is that this definition is predictably problematic when it comes to rivers, forests or nature more broadly.
In 2017, for example, the state high court in Uttarakhand, India, ruled that in order to protect the Ganges and Yamuna rivers, they should be considered legal persons with “all corresponding rights, duties and liabilities of a living person”. In a subsequent appeal to India’s supreme court, the state government asked whether, if the rivers flood, leading to the death of a human being, a lawsuit could be filed for damages. Could the Uttarakhand chief secretary of state, named by the court as one of several officials in loco parentis, be held liable on the river’s behalf? In this case, the supreme court decided not.
Can we hold a river accountable for flooding, or a forest for burning? Of course not. Yet existing legal systems force us to think of nature in terms of human concerns rather than what concerns nature. With the past three years the warmest in recorded history, and as we face what has been called the sixth great extinction, lawmakers and judges appear increasingly to agree that it is time to secure the highest form of legal protection for nature, through the recognition of rights.
To make progress in this area, we must break away from legal strictures that were never intended to apply to nature, such as legal personhood, and establish a new structure that addresses what nature needs. Perhaps we can call this framework legal naturehood. A recent symposium at Tulane Law School, in New Orleans, brought together academics, lawyers and activists to develop a set of guidelines for recognising and enforcing legal rights of nature, known as the rights-of-nature principles.
These define the basic rights that nature needs, including rights to existence, regeneration and restoration. Further, they call for monetary damages derived from violations of these rights to be used solely to protect and restore nature to its pre-damaged state. In addition, they outline a means for nature to defend its own rights – like children unable to speak for themselves in court – by being the named “real party in interest” in administrative and court proceedings. The principles build on laws and judicial decisions that have begun to accumulate in this new area of law, laying the groundwork for what legal naturehood could look like.
As daily headlines tell us how we are tearing holes in the very fabric of life on earth, it is time to make a fundamental shift in how we govern ourselves towards nature – before, as Colombia’s constitutional court wrote, it’s too late.

A case is being pursued in the Luxembourg-based general court, Europe’s second highest, against the European parliament and the council of the European Union for allowing overly high greenhouse gas emissions to continue until 2030.
The families, including young children, claim their lives have been blighted by the policy decisions in Brussels, and that the EU’s inadequate emissions targets will cause more suffering.
The legal complaint asserts that the EU’s existing climate target to reduce domestic greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels, does not protect their fundamental rights of life, health, occupation and property.
The litigants, from Portugal, Germany, France, Italy, Romania, Kenya, Fiji, and the Swedish Sami Youth Association Sáminuorra, say the EU should define a higher reduction target.
The claim specifically targets the EU’s emission trading scheme directive, the effort sharing regulation and the land use, land use change and forestry regulation.
The plaintiffs, who are not seeking compensation for their loss, are asking the court to declare the three acts null and void, “since they violate the plaintiff’s rights and are not in line with higher ranking law”.
According to a legal summary of the complaint, to avoid a vacuum, the court will be asked to keep the acts in force until a stronger version of them has been enacted. Lawyers claim there is a case for this in article 263 of the treaty on the functioning of the EU.
In 2015, a court in The Hague ordered the Dutch government to cut its emissions by at least 25% within five years, ruling that its plans to cut emissions by 14-17% compared with 1990 levels by 2020 were unlawful, given the scale of the threat posed by climate change. The government has appealed the decision, which will be heard in The Hague on Monday.
Maurice Feschet, 72, a lavender farmer in Grignan, Provence, told the Guardianhe became involved in the action against the EU after losing 44% of his harvest in six years because of climate change.
He said: “My family has been farming here since the 1800s. I am taking this action for my 38-year-old son who lives on the farm. We want him to continue to be able to farm, but it is not going to be easy. There must be more done.”
Alfredo Sendim, 52, an organic farmer in central Portugal, said the irregularity of the climate in his area raised serious doubts about the long-term sustainability of his business. He said: “Last year we had almost the entire year without a drop of rain. Then we had two weeks and all the rain that we should have had fell.”
In Sweden, the traditional Sami way of life herding reindeer is said to be under pressure from rising temperatures that threaten the size of herds. Warmer winters mean less snow and more rain freezing into ice, making it harder for the animals to reach the plants they need to eat. 
Sanna Vannar, 22, the chair of Sáminuorra, said: “If we lose the reindeers, the Sami culture will be lost. Many of the Sami youth want to stay with their families and be reindeer herders, but they cannot see a future. This is mostly due to the threat of climate change. This must be urgently addressed for the safety of our generation and the next generations.”
Roda Verheyen, the lawyer acting on behalf of the families, said: “Climate change is already an issue for the courts in the European countries and around the world.
“The plaintiff families are putting their trust in the EU courts and legal system to protect their fundamental rights of life, health, occupation and property which are under threat of climate change. The EU courts must now listen to these families and ensure that they are protected.”
Scientists from the thinktank Climate Analytics are providing expert evidence to the families’ lawyers. The German non-governmental organisation Protect the Planet is bearing all the costs related to the legal case.
Climate Action Network (CAN), Europe’s largest NGO working on climate and energy issues, is also supporting the action.
Wendel Trio, CAN’s director in Europe, said: “This is part of a strategy to get the EU institutions to increase their targets. In 2015, as part of the Paris agreement, countries agreed to pursue efforts to limit temperature rise to 1.5°C.
“Yet, it is clear that the existing EU 2030 climate target is not enough to respect the commitments taken in the Paris agreement and should be increased. The EU needs under the agreement to confirm its target by 2020. This legal action initiated by normal families impacted by climate change is underlining the urgency and the necessity to increase it.” ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/24/families-take-eu-court-climate-change-emissions

The crunch is coming...indeed it is very close. War, poverty, starvation and disease will follow. Mass migration. Terrible scenes. It will be appalling. Perhaps had we acted decisively much earlier er might have averted this coming crisis.

At least not before it is way to late to deal with climate change which in case you missed it is the topic
We are on course to hit a peak of between 9.5 and 10 billion by mid century (some say 11) and besides wishing up a plague again you have no solution. Denying aid to other countries (strange you are not demanding funding cuts to healthcare here) won't do it however much you'd like to inflict unnecessary suffering on those who are having the least impact. Better medical care and a reduction in infant mortality actually leads to lower not higher fertility rates but either way the size and the timing of the coming peak will not be significantly affected.
I'm glad you at least concede that the priority is to reduce the impact we have (you should always lead with that!).

Bob Gelded was mistaken in his well intentioned efforts in Ethiopia. he solved nothing and only made the problem worse.
I do not suggest we carry on asked are because there is nothing we can do...not at all. I do suggest we stop resisting the inevitable reduction in numbers. What good does it achieve to rid certain parts of the world of malaria, dysentery, cholera and high infant mortality only to see the human population explode and engage in wars over dwindling resources.
Humans are not sacred. 
I would urge you to look at the facts concerning the decimation of the wilderness that supports the wider ecosystem. That is what needs urgent protection. Not the human race. 
The actions we take ourselves to reduce our impact are essential and vital. And we must stop the rape of the Amazon Basin, the African Wilderness, the Asian reefs and forests. Will people suffer? Certainly. That is unavoidable.
When the population us substantially reduced, assuming the planet is not damaged beyond repair by that point, it will be possible to improve human development while not ravaging the earth.
We have a choice. And no choice. Destroying the ecosystem, as we are doing, will come back to bite us. Already is.

On the issue of farmers starting uncontrolled fires, especially via stubbleburns, all that I can tell you is that in my fire district (covering west centralVictoria) this is extremely rare.

PROMINENT agriculture and climate campaigner Josh Gilbert has resigned as NSW Young Farmers chairman after alleging his philosophical disagreement on land clearing reform earned him threats of personal attacks. 
Mr Gilbert, 24, Nabiac near Foster, announced on social media on Tuesday he would stand down immediately from the position he has held for three years, citing a long-running philosophical rift over the NSW Farmers’ lobbying for an overhaul of the NSW Biodiversity Act, which manages native vegetation clearing. 
Mr Gilbert alleged he had also been contacted by a high-ranking non-staff member from NSW Farmers who warned that opposing the reforms would result in personal attacks. 
The association has campaigned for many years on the issue and is currently negotiating with state government to develop a policy to repeal the current laws. 
But Mr Gilbert – who represented Australia at the COP21 talks at Paris in November – said he felt the legislation would have negative ramifications for agriculture. 
“Unfortunately, due to some policy that is about to be released and the way in which this has been handled, it has become further apparent that my personal views no longer align with the broader association,” Mr Gilbert’s statement said. 
“This has been further influenced by a member stating they and others would personally attack me if I was to speak out against this issue and voice my concerns.”
Mr Schoen said he was sad to see Mr Gilbert step down. 
“It’s disappointing to see Josh resign from the position - he’s done a lot of hard work,” Mr Schoen said. 
“But if his ‘philosophy is diametrically opposed to the association’s then perhaps this is the best way forward for him.”
BQEND
Mr Gilbert helped drive a motion to rewrite NSW Farmers’ climate change policy at the organisation’s July AGM, which received worldwide publicity.
Mr Gilbert said he had the backing of his committee and was confident he would have been re-elected.

The most egegious outcomes of the Plan has been Australian tax payers, paying landowners hundreds of thousands of dollars, for these land owners to promise not to clear native forests from their land. The catch is, that these landowners could not afford to clear this land anyway, or had no intention of clearing the land because they could not afford to develop the land with crops or livestock. Yet then, by paying these landowners hundreds of thousands of tax payer dollars, these landowners COULD then afford to clear the land they promised NOT to clear, and so they DID then clear the land, albeit illegally.
In effect, tax payers have paid farmers to clear their land, that the farmers could not, without tax payer dollars, afford to clear.
So the Direct Action Plan has in fact, funded increasing emissions, eroding of native forests, and extinction of vital species, using tax payer dollars that are supposedly to be used to reduce emissions and improve Australia's environmental resilience to climate change.
Since the LNP came to power Australia has been going backwards with regard to carbon emissions. But the LNP rationalise that when a Labor government finally comes to power, it will, like the Rudd/Gillard government did, do all the heavy lifting to ensure Australia meets its Paris commitments, while the LNP will pillory the Labor Party every day in question time about how their carbon emissions reduction strategies are killing the Australian economy.
First we had Howard who didn't just undermine the negotiation of the Kyoto Protocol at the Kyoto Conference, but then used tax payer money to send his Ministers all over the world trying to get other countries to withdraw from the Protocol, after the Kyoto Protocol had been agreed to. Then, even though Australia had negotiated for the ONLY deal for any advanced country to continue to emit increasing carbon emissions, and carved out every special concession they wanted, that no other country received, in the Kyoto Protocol, Howard then refused to sign it.
Rudd and Gillard then tried to do the best they could to put Australia on a path to reducing the necessary emissions, to help keep global warming below 2 degrees celcius. Abbott and the LNP gave them hell for doing the right thing. It worked - not only did Rudd back off and try to introduce a pathetic plan that had been watered down to suit the LNP, but as a result of Gillard's strong policy that did pass the Senate, and that was NEVER ever a carbon tax, Abbott's constant 'Juliar' accusations resonated with an ignorant Australian public and undermined her government to the point where Rudd took over again. The Labor Party never recovered, despite them having done the right thing. The liar, was in fact, Abbott, not Gillard, yet he was elected as PM. Both Abbott and Peta Credlin, made up the whole 'carbon tax' label, and the media and ignorant Australian people fell for it.
Then the LNP took over again, and undid every good emissions policy introduced by the Gillard government.
Australia has the highest carbon emissions per capita of any country in the world. We may only emit 1.5% of all current world emissions, but so do numerous other countries. If the emissions of all countries that only account for 0.5% - 1.5% of all world carbon emissions never reduce their emissions, based on the LNP logic that 1.5% of emissions is negligible, then 25% of all carbon emission will never be reduced and will keep growing as a percentage of world emissions. To keep global warming to below 2 degrees, the world cannot have 25% of all carbon emissions not being reduced. And why should countries whose emissions are only 0.5% of world carbon emissions, reduce their emissions when Australia's emissions are higher than theirs, and Australia, far from reducing emissions, is currently increasing emissions?
So if every country in the world adopted the LNP logic, the Earth will end up burning itself and all life on it, to death!

 The $2.55bn emissions reduction fund pays landowners and companies to avoid emissions or store carbon dioxide using a reverse auction – the cheapest credible bids win. The government says it has signed contracts to prevent 124m tonnes of emissions through vegetation projects – mostly repairing degraded habitat, planting trees and ensuring existing forest on private land is not cleared. 
Based on the average price paid by the government for a tonne of carbon dioxide, the projects will receive about $1.48bn from taxpayers as they deliver their cuts over the next decade.
Meanwhile, forest-clearing elsewhere in the country has released more than 160m tonnes of carbon dioxide since the emissions reduction fund began in 2015. Emissions projections data estimates another 60.3m tonnes will be emitted this year – equivalent to more than 10% of national emissions.
An analysis by the Wilderness Society suggests the official figures underestimate the rate of land-clearing, and in reality the projects paid for from the Direct Action emissions reductions fund would have had their work nullified in even less time.
The Wilderness Society climate campaign manager, Glenn Walker, said other data sources suggested the projections data was almost certainly an underestimate.
He said the government’s forest-clearing emissions counted areas felled for farming, mining and other industry, but not those from native forest logging for timber, which are absorbed into another category. Australian National University scientists have estimated native forest logging may contribute another 38m tonnes a year.
Walker said the official forest-clearing figures also underplayed the amount of mostly agricultural land-clearing in Queensland. State data showed that 395,000 hectares were felled in 2015-16, releasing 45m tonnes of emissions from that state alone.
The Wilderness Society estimates suggest 600,000ha of land were cleared across the country in 2016, an area equivalent to about half of greater suburban Sydney, and the most in a decade.
Walker said the government had shown it wanted mass land-clearing to continue, pointing to evidence that federal environment department notices asking Queensland landholders to explain suspected illegal clear-felling on their land had been withdrawn after lobbying by Liberal National MPs and senators.
“It’s a disgrace that there is a massive public investment going into tree planting while the government sits back and not only watches but encourages the mass destruction of forests,” Walker said.
The environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, did not directly respond to questions about how the rate of land-clearing squared with the government’s emissions goals. He said a departmental review of climate policies last year confirmed that Australia had a comprehensive set of emissions reduction policies, and that the emissions reduction fund was internationally recognised as one of the world’s largest domestic carbon offset markets.
Land-clearing spiked in Queensland after the former Liberal National premier Campbell Newman relaxed laws preventing mass deforestation. The Palaszczuk Labor government has repealed the changes to restore earlier protections but legacy clearing permits remain for about 115,000ha.
The federal government is resisting calls that it should use national environmental laws to stop land-clearing that threatens endangered species, saying it is a state responsibility. Frydenberg is currently considering a draft department of environment recommendation that a Queensland farmer be allowed to clear most of a 2000ha block of Cape York forest that is home to endangered species. Scientific advice suggests allowing it would likely increase sediment runoff on to the Great Barrier Reef.
The government is also facing calls that it make changes to the emissions fund. It has committed $2.28bn on what it says is 191m tonnes of abatement, but questions remain over whether some types of projects backed by the fund – such as capturing methane from decomposing rubbish at landfill sites to convert into electricity – are actually limiting emissions or just being rewarded for what they would have done anyway. “Avoided deforestation” projects – paying farmers to not clear land – are also contentious.
Habitat restoration and tree-planting projects have broader support. In a recent paper in the journal Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability, University of Queensland research fellow Dr Megan Evans found that well-designed incentives could encourage landowners to back reforestation on otherwise agricultural land, with broad benefits for the environment and community.
But she found that Australia’s reforestation program was being undermined by land-clearing elsewhere on the continent. 
She said people were likely being held back from signing up for reforestation projects by inconsistent messages from government.
“If, as a society, we have a goal to reduce emissions, we need to ideally point all the policy messages towards that goal,” she said. “Unfortunately this hasn’t been happening.”
Australia’s total national emissions continue to rise. The most recent national greenhouse accounts showed a 1.5% increase last year. The government has pledged to cut emissions by 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2030.
Emissions from what is known as “land use, land use change and forestry” – a vast category that takes in forest-clearing, native logging, tree planting and the natural impact of and recovery from disasters such as fire, flood and drought – rose by 0.5%. The 60m tonnes from forest-clearing cancelled out what would have otherwise been an emissions sink.
The next emissions reduction fund auction is scheduled for 6 and 7 June.

I supplied a list of Hansen's predictions. There are many other failed predictions by climate scientists.
BQSTART
It takes 30 years to measure the temperature of the global climate
BQEND
Not according to Hansen, and not according to those who leap upon every hot day/year. Hansen was confident enough to make dire short term warming predictions. Yet he co-authored papers on global cooling theory in the 1970s.
BQSTART
the latter is measured over the 30 years leading up to that year and including that year for example 1989-2018 or 1987-2016
BQEND
Many scientists dispute there has been a rise at all, or if they acknowledge it, dispute it as significant, statistically or environmentally.
BQSTART
During La Nina and neutral years heat moves from the atmosphere to the oceans resulting in a cooler gobal temperature compared to a preceding El Nino year.
BQEND
There have been other La Nina cycles that have not resulted in the same scale of temperature drop.
BQSTART
The global climate is getting hotter as the level of atmospheric CO2 increases
BQEND
That may be so. I don't dismiss the possibility that we are having an effect, even possibly the majority of the effect.  I don't know. But as I understand it, there is no way to adequately separate cause from correlation. The temperature might have already been going up. It all depends on scale. It all depends on what you use as your baseline. Anybody having studied EIA knows this is the deepest problem: what is the base state in a constantly shifting environment? How do you isolate cause and effect in complex, constantly moving multivariable environments? How do you explain the fact that CO2 rises have always followed global temperature rises?
From the same 2001 IPPC report: https://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/tar/wg1/501.htm
 which was forecasting dangerous global warming:
""The climate system is a coupled non-linear chaotic system, and therefore the long-term prediction of future climate states IS NOT POSSIBLE"" Huh? What? Read that again.
Now, this incredible statement might have meant to suggest that they cannot predict how badAGW will be. I'm just guessing that's what they meant. But that presumes an a priori, deterministic assumption that AGW  is occurring and what the effects will be. That is NOT how science is supposed to work! In reality, that statement simply points to what other scientists have been saying all along. That the models are wrong, and that some circumspection is needed. As a parent, do I prefer circumspection and scepticism to the 'We're all fucked' scenario? Yes. Gee, I wonder why? And what about time scales again? As 99% of all species that have ever existed are extinct, are we sure that we are actually in control? That if we created the perfect climate and Utopia, earth wouldn't just shrug us all off anyway?
From my reading, this is the state of the climate debate. One end of the scale says we are facing catastrophic global cooling; in the middle there are the moderates who say we are facing either some cooling, or some warming, but no big deal; then at the other end, we have the global warming catastrophists. The extremes at either end agree on catastrophic climate change with a sort of religious ecstasy. Ah, judgement day! Then there's all of us; the little people, trying to get on with our small little lives. Most people say they agree with AGW, and agree 'Yes! Isn't it terrible. We must do something about it'. We have a generation of anxious young people (why are they cutting themselves?) who just get told about how generally vile humans are, about gloom and doom and global annihilation every day.

Which models or predictions have failed miserably?
""Global temperatures dropped between 2016 and 2108"" (you meant to type 2018).
The global warming climate models predict changes in the temperature of the global climate. It takes 30 years to measure the temperature of the global climate. The change in the yearly global temperature is not the same thing as the change in the global climate temperature. The first is measured over one year for example over 2016 or 2018, the latter is measured over the 30 years leading up to that year and including that year for example 1989-2018 or 1987-2016.
The yearly global temperature varies largely in response to the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) which changes phase around the middle of each calendar year. 2015-16 was an extreme El Nino, 2016-17 was on the borderline between neutral and La Nina while 2017-18 has been a weak La Nina. These ENSO phase changes have caused global yearly temperatures to drop over the last few years. Global climate temperature represents the long term trend which reflects.
Increasing levels of CO2 mean more heat is retrained each year but only 6% to 7% of that extra heat goes to warm the atmosphere resulting in the the global climate temperatures we see. During La nina and neutral years heat moves from the atmosphere to the oceans resulting in a cooler gobal temperature compared to a preceding El Nino year. This is what happened from 2015-16 through 2016-17 to 2017-18.
Is the temperature of the global climate changing? To measure global climate you need to measure successive overlapping 30 year periods of global temperatures.

So when other scientists question CAGW claims they are shouted down as 'deniers'. Yet when the same scientists doubt their own claims, they are...?
Some of his earlier predictions:1982  “If there were slow growth in the use of hydrocarbon fuels, the world in the middle of the next century would be as warm as it was 125,000 years ago, when lions, elephants and other tropical animals roamed a balmy southern England.”The climate in the middle of the 21st century: “would approach the warmth of the age of the dinosaurs.”
1986 “The average U.S. temperature had risen from one to two degrees since 1958 and is predicted to increase an additional 3 or 4 degrees sometime between 2010 and 2020.”
 “Within 15 years, global temperatures will rise to a level which hasn’t existed on earth for 100,000 years.”
2006“We have at most ten years—not ten years to decide upon action, but ten years to alter fundamentally the trajectory of global greenhouse emissions,” 
2009""The dangerous threshold of greenhouse gases is actually lower than what we told you a few years ago. Sorry about that mistake. It does not always work that way. Sometimes our estimates are off in the other direction, and the problem is not as bad as we thought. Not this time"".

Anything that anybody does, artist or not, that at least ameliorates our current situation is to be welcomed. Of course it's only action at state level that will seriously make a difference, but there has to be a public visibility of the demands for that action - if only to show sympathetic members of the public that they're not being unreasonable when they see artists, musicians, writers, film-makers demanding the same thing. That there's a broad coalition of all members of the public that want the same thing... I know of at least a dozen people who have given up eating meat because of the film ""Cowspiracy"" , I know of students (because of feedback from their teachers) who have taken environmental issues to heart, and are becoming active on these issues in their schools, because of my talks to them about my street art on the subject. Governments have known about the issue of CO2 and global warming since 1965 and virtually bugger all has been done to address the issue seriously since. Now we're approaching the point where it actually might be too late to avert serious warming. Waiting for governments to get with the plan is not enough. The demand has to be in their faces on a daily basis and artists can be part of that.

Sadly that's about all that most artists
can do to move beyond their personal contribution to climate change. I'm lucky, living and working in Brittany, that there seems to be more support to campaign on these issues. All my street work now is around the subject of climate change and addressing the audience to at least get up and demand action from the politicos. I am vegetarian, I do grow as much of my own food as I can, I have stopped all air travel, minimise private vehicle use, shop locally, attend any protests etc that are appropriate and talk to local school students on the subject of climate change (in their english lessons - to save them my butchery of the french language). I do what I can, and for most people that is all we can do. I have no executive political power but I can make choices about who does have it - and I do. My politics have been green/anarchist since the 80s but now I realise that I don't have the luxury of making the decision not to vote. We have to live and work within the system we have (howevere f*cked up it is) and we have to do it fast. This is an existential crisis; everyone can play their part through lifestyle choices and active political participation. If you're a woking artist you have the added advantage of reinforcing that message to your audience. I don't care if all that is done is placard painting.

It was fitting considering the topic of the exhibition, Indicators: Artists on Climate Change, which features over a dozen artists who tap into climate change “and hopefully, take action to help curb its advances”, explains the curator, Nora Lawrence.
While Storm King started out as an environmental initiative in 1960, this exhibition feels as timely as ever considering the state of the world: temperatures rising, arctic ice melting and polluted air affecting millions around the globe.
“I think it’s always urgent, but we have been seeing the effects of climate change on our own site for years,” says Lawrence. “We’ve also seen how artists have been dealing with these issues, so it was something we thought made sense for us to address.”
Instead of deploying terrifying statistics, protest placards and scientific arguments, this exhibition takes a different approach to activism. “What I’ve seen is that artists are able to touch people in ways that not everyone can,” says Lawrence. “Artists can zero in on a topic that asks people to consider their surroundings anew.”
One highlight is the work of the New York artist Justin Brice Guariglia, who shows a solar-powered LED highway message sign that reads “We Are the Asteroid”. It’s a phrase from eco-philosopher Timothy Morton, who calls out the human effect on the planet.
“It’s to bring attention to the issue from another angle, to look at what humans are doing to provoke climate change,” says Lawrence. “When we think of asteroids, we think of something that will doom the earth, but in this case, it’s actually coming from our own human activity.”
Another piece is by the protest art group Dear Climate, who have created 20 banners around the site. They’ve called it General Assembly and have fashioned the flags to match the circle of world flags outside the United Nations Headquarters in New York City.
One flag says “Say hello to hurricanes”, while others read “See the sea levels”, “Give me luxury or give me breath” and “Heed your greens”.
“They’re meant to be both serious and funny, but to ask people to think about the issue,” says Lawrence. “Most of their works are downloadable from their website, so they can be distributed beyond an art center like us.” 
The exhibition is not necessarily didactic; it’s meant to offer a variety of opinions and outlooks. “We wanted to make this an artist-forward exhibition,” says Lawrence. “Climate change isn’t one thing with one way of looking at the world. We wanted to look at climate change like a syndrome with different factors that taps into something larger, because not every artist is approaching it from the same angle.” 
Along the stunning landscape of Storm King – about 60 miles north of New York City – one thing stands out: the palm trees, of all things. They were planted there by artist Mary Mattingly for her artwork Along the Lines of Displacement: A Tropical Food Forest. There is a set of three tropical fruit trees, including coconut palms and a ponytail palm, which were shipped from Florida. Since an expected temperature rise of 4C is expected across the globe in the years to come, could residents ever harvest a palm tree in upstate New York?
“This piece asks us: ‘What are the opportunities that climate change could bring our way? And how can we be ready?’” asks Lawrence. “Are there ways we might be able to harvest certain crops in the future? And in a place like Alaska, if we are dealing with climate change, what kind of opportunities will there be to harvest if the ice is melted?”
Another piece is by Tavares Strachan, who shows a neon-lit blue wall piece, which reads: Sometimes Lies Are Prettier. It taps into our own misleading thoughts about climate change. “It might be more pleasant to be inside of air conditioning than think about its affect,” says Lawrence. “It’s easier to think about nature [as something] that is always there for us than something we need to tend to.”
One artwork is more like a treasure hunt. Permanent Field Observations, by David Brooks, puts art enthusiasts on a mission to find his 30 bronze sculptures, each of which look stunningly real, amid Storm King’s forested area.
“David spent time finding moments in the woods that aren’t permanent, moments he wanted to cast into bronze; a stick with a bunch of mushrooms on it, leaves, a stone, branches,” says Lawrence. “The bronze piece will outlast the original works of nature, so the artist asks people to imagine they’re on a scientific expedition and to think like a scientist.”
The exhibition is not to only ponder climate change, but also to consider our actions. “It’s to find new ways to think about our environment and climate change and our own place in all of that,” says Lawrence. “Art asks us to change the way we look at the world, where we are in life and what our responsibilities are.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/may/30/climate-change-exhbition-storm-king-new-york

The price of carbon in the bloc’s emissions trading scheme reached €18 (£16) per tonne on Monday, triple the level a year ago.
About 12,000 factories and power stations have to pay for every tonne of carbon they emit under the scheme, but for years an oversupply of permits has meant the cost has languished at about €5 per tonne. That is too low to spur companies to lower emissions.
However, observers said the carbon price rises and further anticipated increases would begin to hurt coal operators’ profit margins and influence investment decisions.
Phil MacDonald, the head of communications at Sandbag, a group that monitors the carbon market, said: “It will already be cutting into coal profits … Renewables get a big win from this and so does nuclear.”
Mark Lewis, the head of research at the Carbon Tracker thinktank, said although coal plant owners were bearing the brunt of the higher carbon price, they would pass it straight through to consumers.
The price of carbon would need to go much higher, to as much as €30 (£27) per tonne, to trigger large-scale switches from coal to gas and renewables, he argued. “I don’t think we are at the stage yet where the carbon price will have a major effect.” 
Sandrine Ferrand, a market analyst at Engie Global Markets, said the extra cost would be significant for coal, at about €11-12 extra per megawatt hour. But the incentive to switch fuels would be limited because gas prices had also increased, alongside oil prices.
“So far, the carbon price is not high enough to trigger a large switch from coal-fired power generation to less polluting gas-fired power generation,” she said.
Coal companies are also insulated temporarily as they hedge when buying carbon permits and have benefited from recent increases in wholesale power prices.
The dramatic increase in the carbon price has been driven up partly by European commission reforms to cut the supply of carbon permits from January. The heatwave affecting large parts of Europe this summer is also seen as having a bullish effect. 
The hot weather bolstered fossil fuel burning as people turned to fans and air conditioning to keep cool, while generation from hydro and windfarms has been down because of low river levels and wind speeds.
Continued growth in the carbon price would strengthen progressive members of Germany’s newly formed “coal exit commission”, which is due to issue a plan this year.
One wild card is Brexit and whether the UK quits the carbon market if and when it leaves the EU. Chris Piabiatek, a carbon trader at Vertis Environmental Finance, which expects a tonne of carbon to cost just under €19 next year, said a no-deal Brexit that involves the UK crashing out of the carbon market would be “super bearish” for carbon prices.
… we can’t turn away from climate change. For The Guardian, reporting on the environment is a  priority.  We give climate, nature and pollution stories the prominence they deserve, stories which often go unreported by others in the mainstream media. At this critical time for our species and our planet, we are determined to inform readers about threats, consequences and solutions based on scientific facts, not political prejudice or business interests. But we need your support to grow our coverage, to travel to the remote frontlines of change and to cover vital conferences that affect us all.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as $1 – and it only takes a minute.

The whole purpose of the modelling is an exercise in political persuasion. 
This modelling is trying to walk a very fine line — it’s meant to give just enough evidence to progressive state governments that implementing the NEG is better than doing nothing and just enough evidence to the Coalition backbenchers that coal will continue to be king for the next decade.
If you take the results of the modelling at face value and don’t question any of the underpinning assumptions, the ESB and Acil Allen achieve their task reasonably well (maybe).

If you believe the Energy Security Board (ESB) and Acil Allen’s new modelling released yesterday on the National Energy Guarantee (NEG), you are believing in a fairytale. 
This modelling suggests that in a time of unprecedented disruption and technological change in global energy markets, Australia’s electricity system will basically stand still for eight years from 2021/2022-2030. That the only changes are those that are currently planned -- closures of two coal-fired power stations -- Liddell and Gladstone, the building of Snowy 2.0 and the onward, unstoppable march of rooftop solar.

He has Victoria, Queensland and the ACT all dubious about the NEG being not ambitious enough on emissions reduction. Tony Abbott is on 2GB saying we should pull out of the Paris Agreement. Barnaby Joyce has said he won’t support the NEG if higher emissions reductions pressure is placed on agriculture. The ACCC is recommending that renewable energy subsidies should cease. The AEMO is reporting that renewables are the least cost plan for our energy future. Backbenchers Tony Pasin, John Williams, Ken O’Dowd, Craig Kelly and George Christensen say the report is biased and have criticised the head of the AEMO personally. The Minerals Council has sent George Christensen and Craig Kelly over to Japan to deliver a letter from Matt Canavan to order some new coal-fired power stations. George says on Facebook that he ordered one and Craig says he ordered three. Meanwhile, emissions keep rising. Good luck sorting that out.

In this spirit I humbly submit thw following to our PM.
Dear Mr prime Minister,
Firstly I state that I am not a charity, that is I don’t actually give anything to anyone. I think it is important that I clearly state this.
Recently it seems that you have a process where a non-process is the process and I offer myself as someone who also has non-process and would like to accept on behalf of myself the fruits of your non-process. 
The other day you gave approximately $0.5B to a charity whose members are senior business figures and Business Council members from the fossil-fuel and banking sectors to look after the Great Barrier Reef and they didn’t even ask for it – my sort of non-process indeed! At the meeting were the chairman John Schubert - former Commonwealth Bank chair - and Malcolm Turnbull and Josh Frydenberg, but no other representatives from groups that are actually working to save the reef or even have knowledge of the science surrounding the problems with the reef – again my sort of non-process; why ask those who know?
Now just in case you think I want to set myself up as a charity to get some money I assure you I don’t. Again, there’s no need. I recall that Foxtel qualified for an unsolicited and unexplained $30M gift from your government – actually this one was probably asked for but the bit I liked is the non-process process and as part of my point that I qualify for your non-process, Foxtell isn’t a charity either. And in the lead-up to the latest round of by-elections you gave a council in Tasy an unsolicited, and no application required, via another non-process a grant of several $M.
So ,in fellowship with these groups I humbly, (and I say humbly, as you said after the by-elections humility is a key part of assessing policy and making changes to reflect the people’s thoughts and so the fact that ~70% of people think big business tax cuts are a bad idea you are humbly pushing ahead with them) I put myself forward for an unsolicited, non-process process of you giving me a few million. No need for paperwork, I am suitably lacking in expertise and this isn’t an application, rather just flagging that I’m here, hands open and a simple 30 second phone-call will do – you don’t even need to bring Josh or Jim, no he useful, he was a singer, I meant Scott.
Yours sincerely

The Commonwealth's request and AEMO's assessment of a reliability gap represent the type of challenge that the National Energy Guarantee is intended to solve. A market approach that allows multiple other participants to compete to invest in a variety of resources that can address the reliability deficit to produce the best overall outcome for consumers. These resources can include new supply, demand-based resources, efficiency gains and transmission investment that increases import capability and better utilises resources in other regions./blockquote>

But emissions will also rise over the life of the scheme before pollution falls again towards the end of the decade to 2030.
The Energy Security Board on Wednesday circulated its final advice to state and territory energy ministers on the Neg, complete with a summary of the modelling underpinning the policy.
In an unusually strongly worded recommendation from an official, the ESB’s chair, Kerry Schott, pointedly warned the wavering members of the Coag energy council that delaying agreement on the Neg will “prolong the current investment uncertainty, and deny customers more affordable energy”.
The summary of the modelling provided to the jurisdictions by the ESB says the Neg will increase the share of renewable generation in the national electricity market from 17% in 2017-18 to 36% by 2029-30. Coal will account for more than 60% of all generation in 2029-30.
The modelling forecasts the Neg will drive a further commitment of 1,000MW of renewable generation.
Those increases compare to a “no policy” scenario.
In that scenario, the renewable share of generation would increase from 17% in 2017-18 to 34% by 2029-30, with the coal share still at 60%.
That head-to-head comparison suggests the Turnbull government’s policy will do almost nothing, in and of itself, to boost renewables in the system.
A graphical representation of the emissions trajectory during the decade of the Neg suggests carbon equivalent pollution drops in the first year of the scheme – reflecting a significant build of renewable energy under the existing renewable energy target – then it climbs again from 2022-23 through to 2028-29 before falling in the final year of the scheme.
The forecast says the Neg will lead to wholesale electricity prices being more than 20% lower, on average, between 2020-21 and 2029-30 than if the policy wasn’t implemented. The modelling assumes contracting increases under the Neg, which drives a significant reduction in spot prices, which causes contract prices and then wholesale electricity prices to drop.
While the Turnbull government has resisted calls for a higher emissions reduction target, largely because that would fracture the Coalition, the modelling summary also makes it clear the target could be increased by a future government without the higher pollution target affecting the operation of the scheme.
“The strong disincentives against non-compliance, including a penalty of up to $100m, allow the design to accommodate higher targets and ensure that market participants respond effectively to the investment signals provided by the guarantee,” the document says.
The modelling summary says if no policy was put in place, emissions would fall, then flatten out and rise towards the end of the decade to 2030 as forecast demand increases, then dip again in 2029-30.
If the Neg wasn’t implemented, the material says the national electricity market would “fall short of the emissions reduction target of 26% below 2005 levels”.
Energy experts have been calling for the release of the modelling to allow for more comprehensive examination of the scheme before the states are required to say yes or no at an upcoming meeting of the Coag energy council.
Dylan McConnell, a researcher at the climate and energy college at the University of Melbourne – one of a group who called for the full modelling to be released earlier this week – said the material circulated by the ESB on Wednesday was not a modelling document.
“It is impossible for researchers to validate the modelling on the back of this summary,” McConnell said. “The changes to the national electricity market are too significant to wave this through without proper examination. Researchers need the full modelling and access to the modelling team to conduct a peer review.”
With key states still on the fence, Schott has redoubled efforts to secure an agreement on the policy when the Coag energy council meets this month. She noted that 15 years of climate policy uncertainty had impeded investment, affected the security and reliability of the power system, and increased prices for households and businesses.
“The national energy guarantee can give the energy sector the confidence it needs to plan, source and invest over the longer-term in dispatchable, low emissions energy generation and demand-side energy resources in a transforming market,” she said.
“Once implemented, the guarantee will produce a clear investment signal so the cleanest, cheapest and most reliable generation can get built in the right place at the right time.”
The policy requires a sign-off from all members of the Coag energy council before it can be adopted. Victoria, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory are yet to endorse the scheme, and have concerns the emissions reduction target is too low to allow Australia to meet its commitments under the Paris agreement.
Queensland and Victoria have raised concerns about the states being expected to give in-principle approval to the Neg before all the Coalition party room processes in Canberra are exhausted.
In an effort to keep the states at the table, the federal energy minister Josh Frydenberg has offered state ministers a 2024 review of the target, and a two-step process before sign-off.
The Coag energy council will meet on 10 August to consider the mechanism, and then there will be a second conversation on 14 August, where Frydenberg will show his counterparts the federal legislation giving effect to the emissions reduction components of the scheme after the package clears the Coalition party room.
The process the commonwealth envisages is in-principle agreement at the first meeting, conditional on the states having no concerns on 14 August.

This condition, which was keeping her from engaging in “real action”, began in November 2016, when Donald Trump won the US presidential election. “I continue to be outraged by this administration’s treatment of Latinos, Native Americans, Muslims, LGBT folks, women and so many others,” she wrote. “But I’m struggling to summon a response.”
“I have no doubt that many people can relate to your letter. I can relate to it,” began the response from the columnist, Roxane Gay. “It is damn hard to expand the limits of our empathy when our emotional attention is already stretched too thin.”
This seems to be an increasingly common condition. Glance at Twitter or Facebook, and you’ll probably see someone say, “I’m so tired”. There is so much bad news that it feels like we’re running out of emotions. I can relate to Apathetic Idealist, too. For the past several months, I have experienced a creeping psychic exhaustion. “I’m in a numb period,” I tell my friends when they send me frantic texts about the day’s events or ask me how I’m holding up.
It wasn’t always like this. In the months after Trump’s election, my husband, John, printed out the phone numbers of our government representatives in Colorado, where we live, and stuck them on the fridge. We started calling them weekly, demanding, even begging them to fight on our behalf – to defend the Americans with Disabilities Act, to fight the attacks on minorities and immigrants and trans people, to fight for gun control. They were supposed to be working for us, weren’t they? My heart would beat faster as I made these calls, trying to translate my anger and fear into something coherent.
Sometimes the public outcry seemed to work. A rushed Republican bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act – a flawed but important step toward universal healthcare, established under Barack Obama – failed to find support. It felt like a victory. But a few months later, those same senators cut billions from government healthcare programmes under the guise of “tax reform”. I made a number of calls to my representatives about the tax plan, but it didn’t help; this time, the Republicans in Congress had enough votes to pass their plan into law.
I haven’t called my senators in months. It was starting to feel like a waste of time and energy. On most occasions, our Republican senator’s office doesn’t even answer the phone. Most of the time, outrage itself feels largely useless. Stay mad, social media activists like to say. How hard is it to stay mad, I remember thinking last year – just watch 20 seconds of any news clip. But it did, in fact, get hard to stay mad. The news is still horrifying, at home and around the world; I know this intellectually, but the physical feeling of horror is gone.
There’s a clinical name for what Apathetic Idealist and many of us are feeling: it’s called compassion fatigue. Psychologist Charles Figley defines compassion fatigue as “a state of exhaustion and dysfunction, biologically, physiologically and emotionally, as a result of prolonged exposure to compassion stress”. Symptoms include behavioural changes (becoming easily startled, a reduced ability to remain objective), physical changes (exhaustion, anxiety and cardiac symptoms) and emotional changes (numbness, depression, “decreased sense of purpose”). It is an important framework in professions such as nursing, where over-exposure to trauma can lead to health problems for the nurses and worsened outcomes for patients. But it can and has been applied to the general population, too, especially when we are saturated with pleas for attention.
Though the term is relatively new, the idea of compassion fatigue has been around for centuries. As historian Samuel Moyn recently put it: “Compassion fatigue is as old as compassion.” And the anxieties that come with our awareness of compassion fatigue go back just as far. According to Moyn, the 18th-century philosophers and moralists who “rooted ethics in sentiment and sympathy” were simultaneously troubled that “devoting oneself to an ethic of exposure and sensitivity to others’ suffering (or of engagement and action to relieve it) might lead to a numbed ethical sense”. It was partly this worry that emotional fatigue could undermine our morals that led Immanuel Kant to abandon sentimentalism for an ethics based in reason – a more objectivealternative, at least in theory.
The debate around the value of compassion has continued into the 21st century. There are those who argue, following Kant, that a subjective experience of empathy should not be required for moral action, and those who go further, contending that empathy actually gets in the way of morality. But the more commonly held view today seems to be that empathy is vitally necessary, not just for direct human interaction, but as a spur to solve the world’s most pressing problems. Why would we come to the aid of people who are suffering, the thinking goes, if we don’t on some level feel their suffering, too?
If it is true that empathy is a necessary motivator for making the world a better place, what happens when we feel bombarded every day with the details of local and global disasters, with every shocking crime, political scandal and climate calamity here and abroad? The war in Syria. Refugee crises. Melting sea ice. Professionals on the frontlines of trauma are trained to watch for signs of “compassion fatigue”, but lately it feels as if everyone is at risk. After a year of news addiction that left me with insomnia and heart palpitations, I’m starting to detach. Is there any way around it? What happens when the world wants more empathy than we can give?
The term “compassion fatigue” first appeared in print in a 1992 article by the writer and historian Carla Joinson. While observing nurses in emergency departments, Joinson noticed “a unique form of burnout that affects people in the caregiving profession”. A nurse named Jackie had recently lost her favourite patient, despite “desperate efforts” to save her. Afterwards, Jackie had complained of “lingering feelings of helplessness and anger”. Likewise, a surgical nurse named Marian reported going through a period of “despair and frustration” that almost drove her to leave the profession – until she started to practise a kind of strategic remove.
Before it had an official name, something similar to compassion fatigue had been recognised in medical literature. By 1980, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders claimed “knowing of others’ traumas can be traumatising”. Though it was not yet well defined, there was a sense that proximity to trauma could itself be damaging, like secondhand smoke.
In the early 90s, Figley explored these ideas further. He identified how professionals providing “empathic support” to people with post-traumatic stress disorder can themselves begin to exhibit some of the same symptoms as their patients, such as anxiety and other emotional changes. According to Figley, trauma spreads to people who work in areas such as healthcare – not only because they are more likely to be exposed to those who are traumatised, but because caring is often inherent to their sense of self: empathy as a liability. Figley, who had served in Vietnam, went on to adopt and popularise Joinson’s term, and became a major advocate for compassion fatigue awareness.
If you have ever cared for a sick parent, or child, you might recognise the symptoms of increased stress: the bad sleep, bad moods, bad stomach. I have experienced compassion fatigue as a caregiver myself. My husband has a chronic illness, and when he started getting ill, several years ago, we didn’t know what was wrong. He would be struck with sudden vertigo and trapped on the couch, panicked, for hours. On other days, he was too dizzy to drive, or too unsteady to walk without a cane. Even more worryingly, his hearing started fluctuating, the levels changing from day to day, sometimes better in one ear and worse in the other. This made his work particularly difficult – he was teaching at a university at the time. Throughout it all, he had roaring tinnitus, which he compared to hair dryers, vacuum cleaners, jet engines, sirens, and on one occasion, a UFO landing. Some days he could barely hear anything, and it seemed that any day, he might wake up with no hearing at all, unable to work or communicate, even with me. John was in his 30s.
Because he couldn’t reliably drive or talk on the phone, I became John’s assistant, ferrying him to class when he was well enough to teach, cancelling his classes when he couldn’t leave the house, calling doctors and insurance companies, driving to appointments. I still had a full-time job, too. I hated these new and sudden demands on my time and energy, but I hated even more how easily frustrated I would get. If he asked for help when I was busy, I would snap at him, then feel awful about it. Many nights we stayed up late, exhausted; we lay in the dark side by side, worrying and arguing.
“Stress” doesn’t quite capture this era in our marriage; we felt terror and despair. I was afraid for John, yes, but I also felt alone, starved of compassion. I remember thinking (and maybe saying, shamefully) that I wanted someone to take care of me. I was pouring all my emotional resources toward John, and it seemed that he was hoarding his, spending all his feeling on himself. (And wasn’t that natural? Aren’t there times when we deserve to collect, rather than pay out, sympathy?) Studies have shown that stress, anxiety and uncertainty can reduce our levels of empathy. But it felt more like my empathy was being used up faster, due to greater demand.
The effects of compassion fatigue on healthcare workers are real and documented. Left untreated, it leads to reduced quality of care, an increase in clinical errors, and high employee turnover. Caregivers take these symptoms home, as well, harming their relationships with friends and family. Accordingly, caregivers are instructed to monitor themselves for signs of compassion fatigue. A textbook authored by Figley includes self-assessments to test your “ego resiliency”, “self-compassion” and “post-traumatic growth” – that is, the “positive changes that some trauma survivors report as a result of the struggle to cope with traumatic events”. In the US, there seems to be a fixation on these positive narratives; thus, after a terrorist attack or similar disaster, some will claim it has made them “stronger than ever” – the Hollywood ending for real-world trauma.
Caregivers are coached to follow various established guidelines of self-carein order to ward off compassion fatigue, or to recover if it has already struck. These include physical, psychologicaland social commitments such as maintaining healthy eating and sleeping habits, making time for relaxation and meditation, and building a social support network, including at least two people who can be counted on to be “highly supportive”. If trauma is communicable, one hopes those supporters have a support network of their own.
“On any given workday, I’m interacting with many people who are literally having the worst days of their lives,” says an acquaintance of mine who works as a hospice nurse. But she is conscious of the risk of giving any one patient or family too much of her attention and energy. “I don’t try to put myself in my patients’ shoes or try to feel what they’re feeling – although this sometimes happens anyway,” she told me. “I need to maintain my emotional endurance by not using it all up in my first years of being a nurse.”
My day job is nowhere near that harrowing; I work in marketing. But when I try to keep up the work of an informed citizen, I too feel that my emotional endurance is being tested. There’s a sticky note on the wall by my desk that says: “BE AN ACTIVIST.” It has been there so long that I hardly see it anymore. I worry sometimes that I haven’t paced my outrage.
Not long after compassion fatigue emerged as a concept in healthcare, a similar concept began to appear in media studies – the idea that overexposure to horrific images, from news reports in particular, could cause viewers to shut down emotionally, rejecting information instead of responding to it. In her 1999 book Compassion Fatigue: How the Media Sell Disease, Famine, War and Death, the journalist and scholar Susan Moeller explored this idea at length. “It seems as if the media careen from one trauma to another, in a breathless tour of poverty, disease and death,” she wrote. “The troubles blur. Crises become one crisis.” The volume of bad news drives the public to “collapse into a compassion fatigue stupor”.
Susan Sontag grappled with similar questions in her short book Regarding the Pain of Others, published in 2003. By “regarding”she meant not just “with regard to”, but looking at: “Flooded with images of the sort that once used to shock and arouse indignation, we are losing our capacity to react. Compassion, stretched to its limits, is going numb. So runs the familiar diagnosis.” She implies that the idea was already tired: media overload dulls our sensitivity to suffering. Whose fault is that – ours or the media’s? And what are we supposed to do about it?
By Moeller’s account, compassion fatigue is a vicious cycle. When war and famine are constant, they become boring – we’ve seen it all before. The only way to break through your audience’s boredom is to make each disaster feel worse than the last. When it comes to world news, the events must be “more dramatic and violent” to compete with more local stories, as a 1995 study of international media coverage by the Pew Research Center in Washington found.
Advert-supported media channels survive on attention, and this leads to sensationalism and images meant to shock: starving, bloated children, cities ravaged by war. But these images, by design, are upsetting, and eventually we turn away – a form of self-preservation. And when a story isn’t hot any more – that often meant low newspaper sales in the 90s; now it would be judged by a lack of clicks – the media tends to move on. As Tom Kent, a former international editor with the Associated Press, tells Moeller: “We cover things until there’s not much new to say.” In other words, crises often get boring before they get better.
In 1991, Moeller says, Americans focused more on cyclones and earthquakes than other, slower global crises, such as famine in Africa, because they saw the natural disasters as “one-shot problems with specific solutions”. There were clear ways to help, finite amounts of aid that would make a substantial difference. Famine, on the other hand, had been going on for years, despite it being a cause célèbre in the 80s, when benefit concerts and charity records had raised tens of millions of dollars of humanitarian aid. For many people, it had probably come to seem like an intractable crisis.
The fact that coverage of slowly unfolding, complex disasters tends to be limited is a problem; that the public aren’t interested is another. But there may be a good reason for both, beyond moral decrepitude. Numbness or indifference to real atrocity may, from the outside, seem callous. But as Figley has argued, compassion fatigue, in the medical sense, stems from a desire to help. There is no compassion fatigue without compassion: the caregivers at risk see somebody suffering, and they want to reduce that suffering. But they can’t always succeed. Compassion fatigue, then, is stymied compassion.
If caregivers are at risk because they give care to the traumatised, then empathetic news consumers are at risk because they consume the news. Just opening Twitter on your phone, or looking at the TV in a bar, exposes you to enormous problems you can’t possibly solve. Perhaps you can help, but the difference that an individual contribution makes – placing a call, voting, going to a protest – often feels imperceptible.
Compassion is generally seen as pure virtue, but is it always selfless? In The Science of Evil, psychologist Simon Baron-Cohen cites multiple studies that reveal an “empathy circuit” in the brain. These are the parts of the brain that usually activate when, for example, we look at a needle piercing someone else’s hand – the psychology-experiment version of watching the scene in Un Chien Andalou, Luis Buñuel’s surrealist film in which a man appears to slice through a woman’s eyeball with a razor. (It’s actually a sheep’s eye.) I cringe and look away because on some automatic level I imagine it happening to me. In some sense, having empathy is a way of feeling compassion for myself.
Human propensity to empathy, Baron-Cohen claims, much like height and other traits, follows a normal distribution, the so-called bell curve. This means that a select few people have extraordinarily high levels of empathy – he offers anti-apartheid activist Desmond Tutu as an example – while some at the other end of the curve have zero empathy, including people with narcissistic personality disorder and psychopaths. (My mother once told me she had read that the two professions that test highest for psychopathy are surgeons and Buddhist monks – presumably because both require detachment. It sounds like dubious science, but does suggestanother way in which empathy can be a liability: a barrier to objectivity or enlightenment.) The fact that most people are in the middle of the curve, Baron-Cohen writes, suggests that “moderate empathy levels are most adaptive”. Most adaptive for what, we might ask – proliferation of the species, or good ethics? And are policies that favour local proliferation actively harmful to populations farther away?
Average empathy will fail some of the time; we will fail to feel what others are feeling, as the hospice nurse I know put it, even if we try. And this may be a rational response, whether consciousor automatic. Empathy, like any bodily process, has a cost. Hunger would be meaningless if it didn’t make you eat. What good is compassion if it doesn’t translate into concrete, external action? Perhaps it is rational to cut off the supply of emotion if it amounts to wasted energy.
Can compassion fatigue be avoided, given our unprecedented access to appalling events around the world at every moment? Searching for solutions to apathy in the age of daily mass shootings, I found an article by a family therapist, written in November 2017:
“Can I be honest? When I read that [many of] the victims of the mass shooting at a church in Sutherland Springs in Texas were children, I paused, then turned the page, disgusted and angry. Not just at the shooter, but at the people who died as well. It’s awful to admit this, but I can’t shake the thought that people died because they refused to listen to social scientists who kept telling them that guns cause gun violence.”
The therapist identifies his victim-blaming reaction as a classic case of compassion fatigue, then outlines some solutions to the syndrome. First, the therapist suggests it is necessary to “personalise the tragedy”. “Read the stories of each of the dead and connect with them as people, not nameless victims. This simple act of reading their stories can maintain compassion and protect us from apathy.” (Can it, I wonder? This could be effective for any given mass shooting, but if we read up on the victims of every mass shooting, won’t the hundreds of details begin to blur together?) Secondly: “Be outraged … Don’t give into the desire to withdraw.” (This seems like telling someone the solution to cancer is “don’t have cancer”.) And third: “If you are still feeling burnt out emotionally, look for a tragedy closer to home.”
This last tip struck me as particularly inane, as though compassion were an end in itself. Shouldn’t we fight compassion fatigue because we worry that paralysis and apathy will make the world worse? I don’t hope to increase my empathy for its own sake, especially by way of nearby tragedies. In any case, the tragedies are there – my husband’s condition has been diagnosed, but that’s what he would call a pyrrhic victory; the condition is deteriorating and has no known cure. I have a friend whose wife is dying of cancer; he has had to pay for her treatment through crowdfunding campaigns. This isn’t unusual. Everyone has their own local tragedy.
Moeller claims compassion fatigue is not inevitable, and that the media can fight it by providing coverage that is neither formulaic nor sensationalised. “More graphic is not better,” she writes. Sontag, for her part, believed fatigue was a reasonable response to a barrage of terrible images: “Someone who is perennially surprised that depravity exists, who continues to feel disillusioned (even incredulous) when confronted with evidence of what humans are capable of inflicting in the way of gruesome, hands-on cruelties upon other humans, has not reached moral or psychological adulthood.” In this view, compassion fatigue is a coming of age.
On the other hand, if we feel entitled to apathy, or even self-righteous about our apathy, it can become an easy excuse for moral laziness. In 2000, the New Yorker published a cartoon that showed two men in suits walking past a disgruntled-looking homeless man asking for money. One suit says to the other: “Here I was, all this time, worrying that maybe I’m a selfish person, and now it turns out I’ve been suffering from compassion fatigue.”
I have reached the point where being shocked feels normal; it is a fact I hold in my mind but don’t feel in my body. I would like to follow the guidelines of self-care, to preserve my “emotional endurance”, not as a professional caregiver, just as a regular person who cares about the world. So I take breaks and try to reduce my stress. I go out with friends, I watch old poker tournaments on YouTube. But my breaks are getting longer. They feel dangerously close to avoidance.
That distance is better, I suppose, than feeling hopelessly enraged. But what is my responsibility? How much am I supposed to know about global suffering, and what can I really do with that knowledge? Social media, 24-hour news, alerts on my phone – the demands on our compassion are much higher than a caveman or Kant had to contend with. It is overwhelming, even paralysing, and very likely makes me less effectual in the local spaces where I might actually be able to do some good. Whether or not I keep up with everything happening everywhere, all the time, I know that the information exists; that awareness alone is fatiguing. It’s very easy to succumb to fatalism, which is perhaps the logical extension of compassion fatigue – believing that we’re screwed no matter what we do is mysteriously tempting.
Do we need to feel bad in order to do good? The psychologist Paul Bloom, who wrote a book called Against Empathy, argues – or perhaps hopes – that we can be moral without depending on empathy, which is biased and unreliable. We shouldn’t dole out aid in accordance with the amount of sympathy we feel for people; we should help the people who need the most help. The answer, in Bloom’s mind, is not to dial up our sympathy for everyoneto unsustainable levels, but dial it down so we can approach problems more logically. Even Baron-Cohen, who equates “empathy erosion” with evil, concedes that there are people with zero empathy who are also rigidly moral; they do it by systematising right and wrong. This seems to prove that good ethics don’t depend on the feeling of empathy. However, most of us are not that systematic. 
On New Year’s Day in 2017, John and I invited an activist we know over for dinner, an older man with much more experience in organising than us. While they talked and planned, I cooked and drank wine and grew maudlin. “Stop despairing!” our friend snapped at me. “That’s not a strategy.”
The next time I saw him, a couple of months later, he apologised for having raised his voice and conceded that there are many forms of activism. “Maybe writing can be yours,” he said. I had skipped several public protests in the interim, feeling I had too much other work to do. But I was heartened that people I knew attended. I liked the photos they posted on social media – I felt inspired by the size of the crowds, knowing others had the time and energy to march in the streets for what we all believed.
It is comforting to think that when we’re too fatigued to fight, someone else will take the lead. It is, perhaps, too comforting.

As climate change helps push up the number of wildfires in the western US, communities face losing lives and properties to the flames. But another threat also looms large – dangerous exposure to wildfire smoke.
Huge wildfires in California have killed at least six people and razed hundreds of homes. A pall of smoke has shrouded much of California and has wafted eastwards, with Nasa satellites showing fingers of smoke billowing as far as Salt Lake City, Utah. 
Much of the smoke from the two fires – near the city of Redding and another close to Yosemite national park - has remained close to ground level, prompting air quality warnings.
“A big wildfire event not only impacts local communities but also people hundreds of miles away,” said Richard Peltier, assistant professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Massachusetts. “Even if your home isn’t being destroyed and you think ‘this isn’t my problem’ you could suffer serious health effects.”
Once a forest turns into a roaring fire, plumes of sooty smoke containing gases and microscopic particles are released. This can cause a range of symptoms such as coughing, burning eyes and shortness of breath.
More seriously, the smoke can trigger asthma attacks or, more chronically, lead to heart problems and has even been linked to the development of cancer. As summers become longer, warmer and drier in the US west, forests are being transformed into perfect staging grounds for repeated wildfires of increasing ferocity. 
In the 1980s, there was an average of 140 wildfires that burned through 1,000 acres or more each year – this number grew to 250 wildfires a year between 2000 and 2012. 
There is evidence that the increase in wildfires is already taking a toll on Americans’ health. While overall air quality has improved in the US over the past 30 years, wildfire-prone states in the northwest are a glaring exception and are actually getting worse, new research has found.
Researchers at the University of Washington looked through data on the very worst bad air days, totaling roughly a week each year, across the country since 1988. While the rest of the country has experienced a sharp improvement in air quality, a sprawling patch that includes parts of Idaho, Wyoming and Montana, much of Utah and Nevada, and parts of California, Oregon and Washington has got significantly worse.
“There’s a big red bullseye over that northern Rockies area where they are getting the big wildfires,” said Dan Jaffe, a co-author of the study. “There’s been a big improvement in air quality in the US but wildfires like the ones we are seeing in California are eating away at those gains. In some cases the smoke is bringing very bad air quality.”
Wildfire smoke can be identified as a culprit because air samples from the west show high levels of organic materials in the particulate matter. Samples taken near industrial sources such as coal power plants typically show more sulphur.
The link between the smoke and illness or death is sometimes complicated, however, by the fact it exacerbates a range of conditions that cause the sickness. No death certificate cites “air pollution” as the cause of death. 
Researchers also complain there is a lack of data to link specific fires with illnesses in nearby communities. But the overall trend is clear – warmer, drier weather will lead to more wildfires which will spill more smoke into vulnerable lungs.
“Wildfires are a growing problem and climate change is making them worse,” said Peltier. “When you expose people to higher levels of pollution, they are more likely to become ill. We know more wildfires will mean more deaths. Almost every place in the US, apart from maybe Hawaii, could be impacted by upwind smoke.
“There have been a lot of predictions that if we don’t get ahead of climate change that crazy things will happen. Well, crazy things are happening. This is what climate change looks like.” ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/02/wildfire-events-air-quality-health-issues-in-western-us

As an environmental activist, Barrett represents marginalized voices at international conferences and has addressed the United Nations General Assembly on the topic of youth involvement in its sustainable development goals. Barrett, 19, attends University of Wisconsin-Madison on a full scholarship and intends to pursue a career in politics. Her essays have been published in educational magazines and websites and on Medium.
Last month, a young environmentalist, someone like me, tried to hold you accountable for your actions, as we should with all public servants. At a town hall meeting, Rose Strauss, a Sunrise Movement activist, asked you why you accept fossil fuel campaign donations when we know climate change is going to harm young people at an unjust rate.
But, instead of doing your duty as a politician and being transparent with your actions, you responded by calling her “young and naive”. Later, Rose wrote in an op-ed about that moment: “I felt a pang in my heart. I felt belittled. Insignificant. I wanted to scream.” Mr Wagner, you spoke without forethought or care and made a young person trying to think of solutions to big problems feel small.
You call us young, but we will be disproportionately affected by climate change. You will be gone, but your children, your grandchildren, your great-grandchildren – we will pay for your mistakes.
You call us young, as if our shorter time on earth means we can’t see the suffering that exists because profit is put over lives, stories and experiences. As if our shorter time on earth means we can’t see what is right and what is wrong. 
You call us young, but we just want to be considered. We’re tired of the complacency we know is no longer an option. The greed of you and like-minded individuals holds back entire generations, and I don’t like faceless people controlling my future. 
And you call us naive. But we’ve been born into a world already headed towards climate disaster, with no other option than to fight to protect this planet which you and your fellow politicians have willingly put at risk with your apathy. 
You call us naive, as if climate change is happening in a far away future in a far away place. But it’s happening now, and it’s happening everywhere, and it’s happening to all of us. Wildfires rage on the west coast, uprooting and taking lives. Record high temperatures have developed new diseases for farmers in Central America. Coastlines all over the world continue to erode as sea levels continue to rise. 
You call us naive as we try to pick up the pieces of a breaking world so that we have the opportunity to build something when we get the chance. But instead you could be supporting our voices, considering our position as the future proprietors of the society your generation of lawmakers is molding.
My understanding is that to be naive is to show a lack of experience, a lack of judgment and a lack of information. You are the naive one. 
You don’t have the experience to imagine a life harmed by your decisions to cater to fossil fuel interest, you don’t have the judgment to consider people you choose not to see and you ignore the information necessary for you to make the right choice.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/02/climate-youth-activism-scott-wagner-naive

""The theory that better fits is that the Earth's climate simply changes naturally over time. There is strong evidence for this and we've seen the Earth warm and cool both within recorded human history and over longer periods from ice cores and other sources.""
Ok, a few comments on this - firstly 'earth's climate simply changes naturally over time' isn't true - it does change naturally over time but not for no reason -- there is always a mechanism (changes in orbit, solar activity etc) - no naturally occurring mechanism has been put forward that explains the climate changing that we have seen, none.
Secondly, the argument that 'the climate has changed naturally before therefore it can't be humans doing it now is the same as arguing ancient Egyptians got cancer therefore smoking doesn't cause cancer - the same outcome can have multiple causes (in the pst climate changing has been caused by natural events and mechanism - which no one has denied, that does not mean that human activity can't cause climate change now)
Just like in the past a forest fire occurred because of lightning strikes doesn't mean a forest fire can't be caused by an arsonist.

Pretty much any opportunity: BBC national radio, BBC TV, Channel 4, Sky – I’ve done them all over the years, for good or ill. Even when, as is not infrequently the case, the deck is somewhat stacked against me, or the timing inadequate for anything more than a soundbite, or the question up for debate less than ideal.
But this Wednesday, when I was rung up by BBC Radio Cambridgeshire and asked to come on air to debate with a climate change denier, something in me broke, and rebelled. Really? I thought. This summer, of all times?
So, for almost the first time in my life, I turned it down. I told it that I will no longer be part of such charades. I said that the BBC should be ashamed of its nonsensical idea of “balance”, when the scientific debate is as settled as the “debate” about whether smoking causes cancer. By giving climate change deniers a full platform, producers make their position seem infinitely more reasonable than it is. (This contributes to the spread of misinformation and miseducation around climate change that fuels the inaction producing the long emergency we are facing.)
From a public service broadcaster, this is simply not good enough.
What makes it so frustrating is that there are important debates to be had around climate change. And so I told the Beeb that I would be very happy to come on and take part in a different debate. For example, we should be debating whether the Paris climate accord is going to be enough, or if we need to do more. Or discussing just how radically our society needs to change to meet the challenges of the climate crisis, and how we should rethink our activism.
But I will no longer put up with the absurd notion that a straight debate about the science can be justified, especially given the fundamental truth that we’ve known for decades: that even if there were any real room for doubt about the science, we should still take radical action to safeguard a liveable climate, on the basis of the Precautionary Principle. This principle of international law states that even the absence of certainty about the risk of widespread and catastrophic harm to the environment or public health ought not to stop us from taking preventive action to head off such potentially ruinous harms.
BBC Cambridgeshire is based in Cambridge, the science capital of the UK. I expected better from it, especially after the well-publicised ruling this year that the way that the BBC has been promoting climate change deniers on air is no longer acceptable.
In the end, the broadcast went ahead without me. Much of it wasn’t bad. The scientists interviewed were excellent. But the framing of the debate was awful, and framing is everything, so far as the message that most listeners receive is concerned. The presenter introduced the segment by asking, “Is climate change real?” The journalist doing vox pops bombarded ordinary people with canards such as, “Maybe it’s just a natural cycle?” And, of course, a climate change denier was given a huge and undeserved platform on an equal basis to his opponent.
In August 2018, this is unacceptable and it seems that quite a lot of people agree with me.
However, here’s the exciting thing. If we get more momentum behind the idea of refusing to participate, it will force a change of coverage methods by the BBC, which experts have been calling for for years. For if we all refuse to debate with the climate change deniers on public platforms, and press the BBC to catch up with the 21st century, it will be forced to change its ways, because the BBC cannot defend the practice of allowing a climate change denier to speak unopposed. If we truly want to see change on this issue, we need to be willing to let it know exactly how we feel. So, now I’m going to get on with filing my official complaint to the BBC …

The concept that global warming is being caused by human activity has - like other scientific paradigms - :

Coherence - a theory that coherently explains the multiple observed lines of empirical evidence across multiple aspects of the climate system.
Consilience - the predicted and projected changes being confirmed across multiple scientific disciplines observing the multiple aspects of the climate system.
Consensus - agreement amongst scientific researchers from many different academic disciplines that the first two C's are correct, and that no alternate theory can adequately explain this.
Climate change (AGW) is therefore a scientific paradigm, so well-established that it sits alongside other paradigms as plate tectonics and evolution.
The idea of paradigms is very useful when we are dealing with over-arching concepts that are of this type, based on evidence from a range of scientific fields.

About 500 million years ago, there were no icecaps and ocean surface temperatures of 31°C. It produced an evolutionary spurt. Some 50,000 years ago, the Brazilian rain forest was a fraction of what it is now, but the atmosphere held its oxygen. 140 million years ago, plate tectonics brought us the ice caps and are the most likely cause of dinosaur extinction. The world settled down and produced a further evolutionary spurt of higher animals.

15 years ago you would have coruscated for mentioning denier fantasies such as the milankovich cycles.
BQEND
What? Milankovich's work was published in 1941 and was relatively quickly accepted because it both explains in broad terms the observed glacial/interglacial pattern and is mathematically plausible. Of course, there are a lot of details that needed working out: the change in insolation is far too small to produce the observed cycles and the dominant cycle - 100k years for the last 800 ka - is the smallest. A lot of work has been and still is being done in this area but without wishing to give away the ending CO2 and internal ice sheet dynamics play starring roles. (So far: I can never absolutely rule out the invisible pink unicorns beloved of people like you but we haven't them yet (and you are too busy shouting about how it must be them to go out and look for them))

Cloud seeding from Cosmic rays, ferociously denied by the AGW zealots for years now seems to be de rigour. Solar cycles affecting the jet stream and controlling weather patterns will be probably be next as this is becomes more apparent during the current, successive, deep Solar minimum.
BQEND
Do provide some direct evidence from these zealots of their ferocious denials, won't you? The last couple of decades have seen some really interesting work on cloud formation and cosmic rays but none of it has changed the broader understanding of climate - at least, not yet and do feel free to provide evidence of that too. Similarly with the solar cycles, and however often you describe the current one as ""deep"" they remain relatively small in effect. 
As you would expect given the regularity of the Milankovich-driven changes: if less predictable changes such as cosmic rays and solar cycles could provoke changes on that scale we'd expect to see a much more random pattern.

I think you mean father and son Luis and Walter? Their theory (K-T asteroid impact) was first proposed in 1980 and was always, as far as I can see, well received. Of course it took time and evidence to become better established, and there is still some question not as to whether there was an impact but as to whether it was the primary cause of the K-T extinction or possibly the knockout blow coming on top of stresses from other sources. That's science: we don't have absolute certainty, just different levels of confidence.

BQEND
A good case study. He was indeed mocked by geologists in the 1920s but slowly and painstakingly evidence was accrued, the post WW2 ocean floor mapping by submarines really providing the tipping point. Back in 1915 he had no more than a wild hypothesis based on a coincidence in the coastlines and fossil remains, by 1965 the plate matches were clear, there was a mechanism (plate tectonics) that fitted the hypothesis and new data such as palæomagnetic observations were also supporting it. A slow and steady accumulation of evidence, you will note, not a whingfest in Daily Mail op-eds about how the world was conspiring against him. 
Do you think everyone should have just gone ""oh what a good idea here's a prize and we'll teach nothing else from now on""? Personally I think it's a good thing to require evidence.

Yet another lie that you will signally fail either to retract or correct.
As for your railing against the science of climate change:You are, I suppose, unaware that for much of the last 2 centuries those who applied atmospheric physics to the study and prediction of climate change were denigrated by the then scientific establishment, no less than were Alfred Wegener and others (although Einstein's grasp on Relativity was rather quickly confirmed as being inspired and correct). By your book, therefore, the work on climate change should be dead right, as was that of Alvarez and, indeed, of Gallileo.
However, as with Galileo, the forces ranged against the new science were not so much from the scientific community as from the vested non-scientific interests. In Galileo's case the Vatican. In the case of Climate Change it has been the fossil fuel industries, for whom you, with your incoherent babblings, are just one of many useful idiots or fellow travellers.
What you fail to acknowledge is that new ideas are bound to be challenged and should be rigorously tested - by others properly equipped to dig into the matter. Which excludes people like you who lie whenever the facts don't suit their argument, who talk scientific nonsense which no 16yr old with an interest in science would swallow, who bleat and cry foul when exposed for their cynical dishonesty, who insult those who do understand the science, who seem to have no interest in real science except to waste the time of those who care enough for truth to respond to them.', u'recommendation_count': u'5', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1533649251000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'14769888', u'in_reply_to': u'119174652', u'id': u'119180265', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Damian Scott', u'text': u'“You don’t appear to have understood either the article or the context”The article is fluff designed to obfuscate.Arctic ice is trending upwards and AGW theorists have chosen to hang their hat on Arctic ice being a bell weather for global temperatures, now that Arctic ice is not behaving according to predictions, attention has to be distracted from this fact in order to maintain the polemic.I am not saying that the current state of Arctic ice falsifies climate science, it is irrelevant.

“So we have a delicate energy balance...It is a delicate balance” There is nothing delicate about the atmospheric system, it has a history of violent changes and has still managed to support a diverse biosphere for hundreds of millions of years. A minuscule increase in a trace gas, that is at the lowest level it has been throughout history, could never upset this balance. The Earth has been ice free and significantly warmer with Co2 varying from 200 to 9000ppm and there was no greenhouse catastrophe.
BQEND
The last 2.6M years has seen periodic glacials and interglacials with co2 varying in a narrow range of 180-280 ppm. Milankovich cycles have driven changes amplified by the out gassing of co2 from the oceans. We’ve increased co2 by nearly 50% to levels not seen in 3M years or more. 
The biosphere will of course continue, and a hothouse earth will be teeming with life and have significantly higher sea levels. One day intelligent life may emerge that will wonder at the evidence of anoxia, rapid changes in isotopic compositions, mass extinction and other traces left in the rocks. Maybe they’ll even detect that there was a race that believed itself intelligent and yet, despite knowing what was happening, still couldn’t bring itself to stop the self-destructive behaviour.

Long ago, scientists predicted it would warm quicker than other parts of the planet, and they were right. Currently, the Arctic is among the fastest-warming places on the planet. Part of the reason is that as the Arctic warms, ice melts and ocean water is uncovered. The ocean is darker than ice so it in turn absorbs more sunlight and increases its warming. This is a feedback loop.
Another reason is that the Arctic doesn’t get that much sunlight so increased energy from the atmosphere has a bigger influence there than it would have elsewhere.
Scientists have looked to the Arctic for clues and hints of human climate change over the past decades. The fact that the Arctic is warming has led to a 70% reduction in the volume of summer sea ice – an enormous loss of ice. 
A recent paper just published in the Journal of Climate by the American Meteorological Society takes an in-depth look at how fast the Arctic ice is melting and why. According to the paper, the authors completed a detection and attribution study of Arctic sea ice decline from 1953 to 2012. That is 60 years of data that tell the picture of climate change. The “detection” part of this study was about detecting what long-term trends are apparent over these six decades. The “attribution” part of the study is figuring out what is the cause of the trends.
Why six decades? Well the authors wanted to go back as far as they could while still accessing high-quality records of the ice extent. They used three different sets of data that record the extent of ice in the region. 
In terms of attribution, the authors looked for “fingerprints” of human activity. Humans emit greenhouse gases that trap heat. We know that and we have known that for a long time. Greenhouse gases make the Arctic warmer. But, other things are happening too. There are natural changes to the Arctic. There are also other human pollutants that affect the ice. For instance, humans emit small particles called “aerosols” that can get into the atmosphere and block sunlight. So, these human aerosol emissions can actually cause cooling. 
The authors concluded that the combined cooling effect from human aerosols was detected in all three datasets of ice. That means, it didn’t matter whose measurements you used – the effect of aerosol cooling was present. 
So how much of an effect do aerosols have? It turns out 23% of the warming caused by greenhouse gases was offset by the cooling from aerosols. Unfortunately, this isn’t good news. It means that if/when humans reduce our aerosol pollution, the warming in the Arctic and the ice loss there will be worse. 
This puts us into a Faustian bargain. We want to reduce airborne pollution, like sulfur aerosols. But, if we do that, it makes the effects of greenhouse gas pollution worse. 
The cooling effect of aerosols has been known for a long time. We see it when certain volcanoes erupt. Some volcanoes inject tons of aerosols into the stratosphere which temporarily block some sunlight for a few years. Human aerosols work in much the same way. They stay airborne for a few years, reflecting sunlight, before they are cleaned out of the atmosphere. This process has led some people to speculate that we could reverse global warming by just injecting pollution into the atmosphere. This short-sighted geo-engineering is replete with unintended risks.
So we know that these aerosols have hidden some of the effects of greenhouse gases in the Arctic. What does this mean long term (aside from geo-engineering nonsense)? I asked Arctic writer Neven Curlin what his thoughts were. He maintains the go-to site for updated news on the Arctic and its ice. He told me, 
Arctic sea ice loss is already bad news, and this research comes on top of it. It’s amazing to think that the loss could’ve been even faster, if it hadn’t been for this dampening effect. If reducing the emissions of aerosols leads to an even faster warming of the Arctic, this will only further decrease the temperature gradient between the pole and the equator, likely adding to the destabilisation of Northern Hemisphere weather patterns. Never mind the longer term risks tied to sea level rise, methane release and changes to ocean currents. Not reducing aerosols isn’t an option, either, and so we find ourselves in quite a predicament. Hopefully future research will show that the number is actually lower. 
He also reiterated the importance of this topic. He told me that we need more young minds to study the cryosphere; we need more data to help us understand the long-term trends. To gather that data, we need more and better equipment. This is a great example of how a small investment now can pay huge dividends in the future. 
So, that give us some context about whether aerosol pollution is good or bad for us. Regardless, the “canary in the mine” is speaking and we should be listening.

It was meant to be a week of roaming the hills, learning about local species like fence lizards and sagebrush. Instead, they looked at pictures of these species while staying inside with all the windows firmly shut.
Klamath Falls kids have been spending a lot of time inside this summer – days and days indoors, sweating and playing with Lego and watching TV. The outdoor pool has been closed. Our baseball team, the Klamath Falls Gems, cancelled the rest of the season.
This year’s fire season in the west started out early and is on pace to be one of the worst ever. For those in the path of the flames, it is a major emergency, a life-altering, even life-threatening disaster. For a much larger group of westerners, these fires inflict a lesser but chronic cost. We are smoked in.
This isn’t a one-time occurrence. We had a “smoke wave” like this last summer too. There have been so many wildfires in our area in recent years that smoke is officially becoming the season after summer and before what-happened-to-fall.
There are dozens of major fires currently burning across the west, including the Carr fire in and near Redding, California, which is over 150,000 acres. On Sunday this and other blazes in the state prompted Donald Trump to declare a disaster. Eight major fires are also burning in southern Oregon, and the governor declared a statewide emergency in mid-July.
The Environmental Protection Agency has a color-coded system to communicate how bad the smoke is. It ranges from green, for clear, to red, which is unhealthy for everyone, and purple, meaning “very unhealthy”. There’s even a worse category called “hazardous,” which is a kind of a muddy crimson I’ve come to associate with the apocalypse. In Klamath Falls, we’ve hit “red” for at least part of every day for the last 16 days, and “purple” for 12 of those days. Friday was hazardous.
Humanity has known about climate change for decades, and we have done next to nothing to stop it
This increase isn’t random. It is at least partly because of climate change. The west is simply hotter. And hotter weather means drier vegetation. One study from 2016 suggests that climate change has doubled the acreage of forest fires since 1984. And it will get worse. Another 2016 paper predicts that climate change will cause 60% more frequent and 30% more intense “smoke waves” across much of the western US by 2050.
As the Sacramento Bee wrote about the fires: “This is climate change, for real and in real time. We were warned that the atmospheric build-up of man-made greenhouse gas would eventually be an existential threat.”
We were warned. And yet here we are.
High levels of wildfire smoke are bad for everyone’s health. But they are especially bad for elderly people, pregnant women, and children. The very fine particles of burnt matter in the smoke cause sore threats, irritated eyes, headaches, heart attacks, and dangerous acute breathing problems like asthma attacks and bronchitis. In the longer term, they could be linked to an increased chance of developing asthma or other lung diseases, though studies are in short supply.
I am an environmental journalist. I try to maintain a certain emotional detachment from my beat. If I really felt all the things we humans have done to our planet, I might not be able to keep reporting on it month after month. But every so often my detachment fails.
Dropping my kids off for the first day of a “wild camp” that had to be completely moved indoors because of the smoke, I lost it. I was filled with a howling anger. Humanity has known about climate change for decades, and we have done next to nothing to stop it. We’ve been too greedy, too selfish, too short-sighted. And now, my kids can’t even go outside without choking on the result. It isn’t their fault, but they are paying for it. And they’ll be paying for it the rest of their lives.
One of my neighbors, Mark Neupert, an archeologist at the Oregon Institute of Technology, was eating outside with his wife and kids on an orange day, trying to get a little relief from the smoke quarantine, and he found himself thinking of the Anasazi, ancestors of today’s Hopi and Zuni. They left their previous homeland in today’s Four Corners region, in the south-western US, in the late-13th century because of an extended drought. He wondered: who was the first to leave?
I asked Jia Coco Liu, the scientist behind the “smoke wave” paper, if she would move away if she lived in one of the counties her model predicts will have the worst smoke. She told me that if she had the option to send her kids away during the summer, or if she could afford an air filter, she’d stay. But “if I can find a better job elsewhere that is smoke-wave-free”, she’d consider moving. 
As of now, I have no plans to move. I am considering putting solar-powered air conditioning in our house, which hasn’t needed it since it was built in 1929. I realize I am extremely fortunate to be able to afford air conditioning. This is one way climate change will magnify the growing inequality in our country. 
Many people will have it much worse than I do. People are already dying in fires, floods, and heat waves. Their livelihoods are taking a hit and some will see their whole way of life crumble. Forests and reefs will die. Glaciers will disappear. 
Among these huge, sweeping harms there will be small, sad ones: childhood summers spent trapped inside in stifling heat or the filtered chill of air-conditioning, instead of outside climbing trees and catching bugs.

""A very interesting article Mr. Orchison, however your bias is showing, irrespective of the salient points that you have made.
There is more to this argument than meets the eye, other than carbon renewable pricing or Renewable Energy Targets, all constructed for big business and the polluters to boot!
This CO2 argument has been a known factor for the past 20 years, and for 20 years the never ending politicking by businesses, lobbyists and relevant industry organizations have castigated the argument for their own purposes. So which is it, being right for the sake of being right, or actually doing something that required each and everyone to be bigger than the self? So far it’s been the former, and if we had had the foresight and intelligence to put the longer term before the more immediate, we could have made quite many inroads into the science, technology and other mainstream improvements into Manufacturing. How many R & D inventors and developers left Australia in the 1980’s for USA and made fortunes with innovative technology? When is this country going to learn anything other than she’ll be right mate?
Has anyone even bothered to calculate what losing a Manufacturing base has cost this country on a cumulative basis economically? I remember understanding that if we did not have a manufacturing base, we did not have any savings with which to invest in infrastructure; economics 101.

Amplified warming of droughts in southern United States in observations and model simulations
BQSTART
Abstract 
During droughts, low surface moisture may translate surface heating into warming, since excess energy will be converted into sensible heat instead of evaporating as latent heat. Recent concurrent occurrences of droughts and heatwaves have caused compounding ecosystem and societal stresses, which prompted our investigation of whether there has been a shift in temperatures under meteorological drought conditions in the United States. Using historical observations, we detect that droughts have been warming faster than the average climate in the southern and northeastern United States. Climate model projections also show a pronounced warming shift in southern states between the late 20th and 21st centuries. We argue that concurrent changes in vapor pressure deficit and relative humidity influence the amplified warming, modifying interactions between the land surface and the atmosphere. We anticipate that the magnified shift in temperatures will bring more concurrent extremes in the future, exacerbating individual impacts from high temperatures and droughts.

There's a pop-sci article about it here too:
 Climate change-driven droughts are getting hotter, UCI study finds
BQSTART
In a study published today in Science Advances, researchers at the University of California, Irvine report that temperatures during droughts have been rising faster than in average climates in recent decades, and they point to concurrent changes in atmospheric water vapor as a driver of the surge.

Reinsurers getting out of coal. In more bad news for the coal industry, two of the world’s biggest reinsurers say they will no longer accept risks from companies with a big role in the industry. Munich Re is the world’s biggest reinsurer (that’s an insurance company that insurers the risks that insurance companies can’t handle or want protection against) and has just announced the company will no longer accept risks involving companies who get 30% or more of their revenues from coal-related businesses. 
“In the individual risk business, where we can see the risks exactly, we will in future in principle no longer insure new coal-fired power plants or mines in industrial countries,” CEO Joachim Wenning wrote in a German newspaper yesterday. Swiss Re, the world number two reinsurer by market value, announced last month it would not reinsure any company for which thermal coal (used to power generation, as opposed to metallurgical coal) represents more than 30% of its business, following French reinsurer Scor.
That leaves the colossal Berkshire Hathaway reinsurance group, controlled by Warren Buffett.

David Littleproud made the comment on the ABC’s Q&amp;A program on Monday, which was filmed in Lismore in the northern rivers region of New South Wales. His comment was booed by the audience.
The northern rivers region, like most of NSW, southern Queensland, South Australia, southern Western Australia and parts of Victoria, has been affected by severe drought. 
Some regions of western NSW have experienced their driest 16 months on record, according to the Bureau of Meteorology, and Australia as a whole experienced its driest July since 2002. 
On Sunday the federal government announced $190m in urgent drought relief funding, including an increase of the Farm Household Allowance by up to $12,000 for eligible households, in response to what both Littleproud and prime minister Malcolm Turnbull have called one of the worst droughts in the century.

Littleproud told Q&amp;A host Tony Jones that his electorate of Maranoa, which spans south-western Queensland, had been in a drought for eight years, saying: “There’s no silver bullet to this apart from rain.” 
Asked by Jones if he believed the drought was linked to human-induced climate change, Littleproud said: “Look, that’s a big call.
“I don’t give a rats if it’s man-made or not,” he added, saying that people were already under financial pressure and could not afford higher power bills.
“We can’t do it at the moment,” he said. “We have to be able to turn the lights on, turn the pumps on.”
What is your plan, after this drought to ensure farmers livelihoods are secure for the future? @fitzhunter @D_LittleproudMP &amp; @afsnsw respond #QandA pic.twitter.com/ENk1rzpRH6
He said significantly increasing the proportion of Australia’s electricity generated from renewable energy was “a great aspiration” but “it has to be affordable and reliable and sustainable”.
Littleproud criticised state and territory governments for allegedly placing environmental concerns above the livelihood of farmers, alluding to the vexed issue of environmental water flows. 
“Every time we go to build something [in water infrastructure], the states finds a reason not to and find some frog that wouldn’t like the temperature of the dam or a butterfly that may not like it,” he said. “You’ve got to make a decision about do you want an agricultural sector or do you want to have ‘kumbaya’ and live like that.”
The opposition agriculture spokesman, Joel Fitzgibbon, said Littleproud sounded like his predecessor, former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce.
“Don’t embrace Barnaby Joyce’s language, David,” Fitzgibbon said. “It does you no good.”
Joyce’s electorate of New England is one of the areas worst affected by the drought. He criticised the ABC’s decision to host Q&amp;A’s drought discussion in Lismore, a popular tree-change destination that is often characterised as being “green” but nonetheless lists agriculture as one of its key industries. 
“Next week a sequel of #QandA on drought from another rural centre, Nimbin,” Joyce tweeted.

Fitzgibbon said carbon sequestration would have a bigger impact on farmers’ bottom line than building more large dams. 
“The reason no one has built a big catchment dam in recent decades is because the economics don’t stack up,” he said. 
“We can improve our soils more quickly and cheaper than we can build dams … If we increase the carbon in our soils by 1%, by a hectare of land, we hold back the equivalent of 10% of an Olympic swimming pool. That’s a smarter way of doing it.”

The Andrews government, after a cabinet deliberation on Monday, has now set four concrete conditions it says it wants met, which if insisted upon, could torpedo the national energy guarantee.
Victoria says emissions reduction targets can be only allowed to increase over time “and never go backwards”; future targets will need to be set by regulation; the targets will need to be set every three years, three years in advance; and it wants a the emissions registry to be fully transparent.
As the Victorian government settled its final negotiating position in the lead-up to a meeting of the Coag energy council this Friday, the ACT’s climate change minister, Shane Rattenbury, wrote to the federal energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, outlining a possible way forward on the current fight over the emissions reduction target.
In the letter to Frydenberg seen by Guardian Australia, Rattenbury acknowledges that the federal minister can’t offer the states a higher target than the 26% the Turnbull government is pursuing.
“Recognising that you do not wish to increase this target, I would like to suggest another option for your consideration,” the ACT minister tells his federal counterpart.
“My suggestion is that the target is reviewed no later than 2024, and that the final design of the Neg includes a mechanism to initiate a review immediately should electricity sector emissions reach a 24% reduction on 2005 levels.”
“I believe this is a position that can address concerns of some stakeholders and I am happy to discuss this with you further.”
At the moment, the stand-off between the commonwealth and the states relates to the current 26% target being too low to see Australia meet its commitments under the Paris agreement.
The states are pushing Frydenberg to agree to a mechanism that would make it easier for a future government to scale the target up – a campaign the federal energy minister is resisting on the argument that targets are set by the national government of the day, not by the states.
Frydenberg has offered the states an olive branch on process, flagging a review of the target in 2024, but Rattenbury’s proposal would have the review take place two years earlier, given the Energy Security Board predicts electricity emissions will be 24% lower in 2021.
A range of business and energy stakeholders have called on the states to get behind the Neg.
But while cajoling the states to get on board, the groups also counselled the federal government to be flexible in landing a final policy position, including on the ultimate resolution of the target.
The joint statement from groups including the National Farmers Federation, the Ai Group, and the big energy players noted that “given current deep political disagreement over targets, compromise will be needed from all sides to deliver the greatest achievable certainty”.
“Success will likely require a flexible approach, with a pathway for governments to amend targets subject to an adequate notice period and proper process,” the joint statement said.
“Together with Coag agreement on the guarantee mechanism, such a compromise would sharply reduce policy uncertainty and help the electricity sector deliver affordable, reliable and clean energy”.
The policy will be discussed by the Coag energy council on Friday before Frydenberg attempts to achieve Coalition party room sign off on the legislation giving effect to the emissions reduction components next Tuesday. Internal government critics of the Neg have publicly warned Frydenberg will encounter turbulence next week.
If the states ultimately agree to the Neg, the political fight over the target will return to Canberra, with federal Labor signalling it will move to increase the emissions reduction objective to 45%.
It is unclear whether the ALP will have the numbers to amend the government legislation in the Senate, but it looks possible on current indications.
The Greens have signalled they want to push the level of ambition beyond 45%, and argue Labor should pursue an electricity target of at least 60%, but the Greens climate spokesman, Adam Bandt, said “we will consider supporting amendments that will meaningfully help cut pollution”.
The Centre Alliance’s Rex Patrick told Guardian Australia he was “open” to considering an amendment increasing the electricity target to 45% “but the effect of going to 45% needs to be spelled out”.
“We are very interested in achieving clean energy but foremost in our minds are the people suffering high prices – we can’t ignore that,” Patrick said.
The South Australian independent Tim Storer said he thought the Turnbull government should not seek to “handcuff” future governments to decisions of the current parliament. “I am attracted to the idea of automatic escalation of the emissions reduction target beyond 26% being entrenched in the legislation.”
If Labor, the Greens, Centre Alliance and Storer ultimately coalesce around a higher target, that would leave the group one vote short of amending the government legislation in the Senate – putting the Victorian crossbencher Derryn Hinch in the box seat.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/aug/08/victoria-toughens-negotiating-stance-on-national-energy-guarantee

Patients are being treated in corridors, and queues of ambulances are building up outside A&amp;E units in what hospital bosses say are unprecedented scenes for the summerwhich is usually the quietest time of year for the NHS.
Large numbers of people are falling ill with heatstroke, dehydration, exhaustion and breathing problems, as well as experiencing falls – incidents all linked to the record-breaking temperatures since June. The health service was having the busiest summer on record, said hospital chiefs and senior doctors.
Hospitals are being forced to lay on extra beds to admit people needing to be treated as emergencies, while many GP surgeries and ambulance crews are also facing an unusually high demand for their services.
Malcolm Tunnicliff, an A&amp;E consultant at King’s College hospital in London, said: “It’s the busiest summer we’ve ever had. Usually the summer is the NHS’s quieter time, but not this year. There’s been no respite this year.
“At 10pm on Tuesday we had a queue of ambulances outside the A&amp;E that was the same length as we would get in February, and lots of people waiting to get into a bed. We’re seeing a lot of older people who have become dehydrated because they weren’t drinking enough or because their diuretic drugs [which increase urination] are making them dehydrated. Dehydration is also leading to mainly older people having faints, collapses and also becoming more prone to infections.” 
Many hospitals, including those in central London near the pubs and clubs in the West End, have also been dealing with larger than usual numbers of intoxicated people. “Some are just very drunk, others have fallen over and hurt themselves. This is happening seven days a week, not just at the weekend,” said Tunnicliff.
A number of hospitals have been treating higher than usual numbers of older people living in care homes who have become dehydrated, many of whom need inpatient care.
Paramedics last week set up drips and looked after patients on trolleys in the corridor of one of London’s biggest hospitals, while hospitals in the north-west and west Midlands also had to temporarily divert emergency patients to nearby A&amp;E units.
The number of people visiting a family doctor in England in recent weeks because of heatstroke has reached the highest level for five years, according to figures collated by the Royal College of GPs’ research and surveillance centre.
Richard Mitchell, chief executive of Sherwood Forest NHS trust, in the East Midlands, said the organisation had experienced “a record-breaking summer for emergency care attendances”. He added: “Our increase has been particularly from patients presenting with minor injuries and illnesses, and conditions such as respiratory problems, which are linked to the long periods of hot weather.”
So far in August the trust hastreated an average of 435 patients a day, 11% more than the 388 a day it had during August 2017. Similarly, its average of 463 daily attendances in July was 8% up on the 426 it recorded in the same month a year earlier; in June there was a 5% year-on-year rise, from 417 to 440.
“Talking to colleagues, this position is replicated across the NHS,” Mitchell added. Demand for care had been so great that, for the first time, his trust had to keep using the extra beds it opened last winter to cope with the pressures of the cold months. Those beds would normally have been kept aside over the quiet summer months.
Another trust chief executive, who asked not to be named, said, comparing the situation to the pressure of the worst winter months: “To be honest, I didn’t think it could get any worse.”
Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts, said: “The increased pressure we’ve seen in many places over the summer is a symptom of the health and care system running at boiling point all year round. The NHS is struggling to cope and that shows just how important it will be to invest the right amount of extra NHS funding in frontline services like A&amp;E capacity”.
Kevin Brandstatter, lead officer for health at the GMB union, which represents 35,000 NHS staff, said: “The NHS is in a summer crisis very nearly as serious as the winter crisis.”
Shelagh Smith, chief operating officer at the Barking, Havering and Redbridge NHS trust, north-east London, said: “We are certainly busier than usual with higher numbers of patients than usual for this time of year. We’re seeing a whole range of heat-related conditions, including sunstroke and heat exhaustion. Of particular concern are those older patients who are dehydrated and delirious. We have been admitting high numbers.”
Helen Stokes-Lampard, professor and chair of the RCGP, said: “With British summers only expected to get hotter it is crucial that the NHS is better prepared for heatwaves in the future so that we don’t find ourselves facing two seasonal crises a year, one of which already threatens to destabilise the entire health service each winter.”
The Association of Ambulance Chief Executives said that while some of England’s 10 regional NHS ambulance trusts had had “slightly higher demand than they would usually expect during an average British summer”, in general the association had not seen “significant strain” on the ambulance serviceas a whole.
A spokesperson for NHS England said: “This summer has been exceptionally hot with NHS staff doing an excellent job to respond and meet demand during the heatwave. 
“NHS England has written to local health providers to remind them of the action they should be taking in line with the national heatwave plan, published in June, and local NHS services are taking these steps as well as issuing guidance to the public as appropriate.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/aug/08/record-breaking-heatwave-pushing-hospitals-into-emergency-measures

By examining the effects of volcanic eruptions on agriculture – which has a similar effect to proposed artificial methods of scattering solar radiation through aerosols – scientists have concluded that such methods could have unintended consequences.
“[The research was to] find a way to examine the side effects of geoengineering without experimenting on the climate,” said Jonathan Proctor of University of California, Berkeley, lead author of the paper published in the peer review journal Nature. “[We found] potential adverse effect on agricultural production.”
But he said there could be other positive effects that were less easy to capture.
The findings deal another blow to proposals to use geoengineering to reduce or delay global warming, which some scientists think may be necessary to stave off the worst effects of rising greenhouse gas emissions.
Spraying or injecting tiny airborne particles into the stratosphere has been regarded as one of the prime possibilities for geoengineering, by reflecting some of the sun’s rays back into space before they can warm the Earth.
The scientists studied the eruption of El Chichón in Mexico in 1982 and the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, both of which caused large quantities of sulphate particles to enter the stratosphere. This created a “veil” which reduced the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth’s surface.
In the study, the researchers examined the aerosol levels, solar radiation and crop yields. The deflection of sunlight had a negative effect on the yields of many staple crops, including rice, wheat and maize. They concluded that the impacts on crops of sending particles deliberately into the stratosphere would probably be similar, and that the beneficial effects on crop yields from the resulting cooling would be “essentially negated” by the loss in crops due to the reduction in sunlight, failing to remove the threat climate change poses to agriculture and food security.
Hugh Hunt, reader in engineering at Cambridge University, who was not involved in the research, said solar radiation management [SRM] was “no magic bullet”, but the effects should be compared with doing nothing. “We may well decide to use SRM to slow or reverse the melting of Arctic sea ice and to preserve the Greenland ice sheet. We will then be glad to have saved valuable land and the homes of millions of people from rising sea levels. Moreover, in an SRM world, agriculture will be sustained by a more stable and predictable climate,” he told the Guardian. 
“SRM, rather like chemotherapy, is not something one would wish on a healthy planet. The Earth is sick and it is likely that any cure such as SRM will have unpleasant side effects. What we really ought to be doing is to halt the rise of atmospheric greenhouse gases, not just sometime in the future but now.”
Matthew Watson, of the school of Earth sciences at Bristol University, added: “It’s worth noting that this research only states that SRM would not necessarily improve crop yields and that there are other potential co-benefits and risks that must be carefully considered.”
Previous research has shown that the use of aerosols for geoengineering could have a substantial impact on weather patterns, for instance on the frequency and intensity of hurricanes, or could cause changes in rainfall such as droughts in vulnerable regions.
In the UK, the Spice (stratospheric particle injection for climate engineering) project was set up as a government-funded university collaboration in 2010 to examine the possibilities of aerosol-based geoengineering. It ended in 2015 and is understood to have queried the potential positive impacts of geoengineering, though findings have not yet been published. An experiment to mimic the effects of such a programme was abandoned.
Durwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development in the US, who was not involved in the research, pointed out that the effects of sulphate particles can already be seen, as many coal plants which emit sulphates have been closed down. Cutting sulphates can produce a short-term warming effect, because the sulphates can deflect the sun’s rays, while cutting carbon dioxide emissions takes longer to have an effect.
He said: “There are other strategies for managing short-lived climate pollutants we should start with [including] cutting black carbon [soot, from fossil fuel burning], methane and HFC refrigerants. We need to think of climate change mitigation like a staggered race, where short-lived pollutants get a fast start and CO2 reductions eventually catch up and provide more and more cooling.” If these measures were taken, it could reduce temperature rises by up to 0.6C by 2050 and by 1.2C by the end of this century.
The research showed, he concluded, that “maybe we can keep geoengineering on the bench a bit longer while we figure out how to manage it safely”.
Stephen Salter, emeritus professor of engineering design at Edinburgh University, and an advocate of an alternative geoengineering method spraying the air to whiten clouds and increase their reflectivity, said: “The message is that we should not expect great agricultural improvements from stratospheric sulphur but negative results will be moderate. People who are hostile to geoengineering – there are lots of them – will argue that we are stuck with the results of stratospheric sulphur for a year or more and that there might be another Pinatubo or even something like the 1815 Tambora event, which gave the year without a summer.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/08/reflecting-suns-rays-would-cause-crops-to-fail-scientists-warn

Thankfully no lives were lost. This is one of a host of wildfires that have broken out this year around the world. Excessive temperatures and high wind speeds were contributory factors in these fires, both consequences of climate change.
In the UK we’re experiencing an unprecedented hot spell, with adverse impact on our own farmers of lack of rain for crops and reduced yields. The heat has affected the frail and elderly, with the NHS being under stress in a way normally experienced only during winter.
Experts are now suggesting that these events are a taster of full-blown climate change, bringing extreme weather conditions, pressure on public utilities, unreliable rainfall patterns, reduced agricultural crops, and increased deaths from heat and humidity. We also face a range of other environmental concerns, including pesticide run-off poisoning our rivers and the frightening prospect of the eradication of soil fertility within the next years. These are just two of the environmental timebombs waiting to go off alongside man-made climate change.
As parents, we are well aware that the time spent writing this letter might instead have been spent writing a eulogy for our son, had circumstances been only slightly different, and we don’t want other parents to go through this experience. If we don’t act now, the world we are passing on will be one that is suffering climate breakdown; whichever direction we look in, we see we are creating a massive problem for our children. We need a holistic non-party-political debate about how to protect our planet and our children’s future, and we need action now.
We therefore call on our government to play its part, alongside other countries that are experiencing the early stages of climate change. We want action now to halt climate change; not in five, 10 or 20 years’ time but today. We must reduce CO2 emissions before it is too late (if it isn’t already) and addressimmediately the industrial and agricultural pollution of our environment. If we don’t, we should be ashamed of ourselves.Kim and Nick HoareHalesworth, Suffolk
• While one can understand the urgency with which the sea defences need to be fixed (New £27m sea walls protecting Blackpool already damaged, 7 August), the debate over what has gone wrong at Anchorsholme should not detract from the need for a wider, and much deeper, debate as to how we deal with rising sea levels and potential future increases in maritime storminess around the UK coastline.
Of course there are places where only hard defences will do, but we need a more sophisticated, integrated discussion of zoning (to avoid building in high-risk zones), building codes (to ensure buildings can withstand forces during extreme events), early warning systems and crisis management planning (to ensure people can get out of high risk areas) and, not least, how the natural coastal protection afforded by the presence of intertidal ecosystems can be factored into shoreline planning. “Pour more concrete” cannot be the only long-term answer, particularly given the eye-watering costs involved.Professor Tom Spencer Department of Geography, University of Cambridge

Michael Myer, of the Myer family, was a member of the reef foundation’s board from 2001 to 2004 until he became concerned at what he called the growing “corporatist” direction of the organisation.
Myer, a conservation activist who endorsed Richard Di Natale before the last federal election, said he had deep concerns the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and Frydenberg, had offered such a large sum of money to “an organisation that is really not set up to manage that kind of money”.
“What is shocking to me is that without any due diligence half a billion of taxpayers’ money has been given to what is still a small charity,” he said. “It’s unheard of.”
In an interview with the radio station 2GB on Thursday, Frydenberg was pushed on whose idea it was to award the grant to the foundation: his office, the prime minister’s, or the environment and energy department. 
Frydenberg would not say where the idea originated, saying “it is the government’s idea,” and then “it was a good idea and it was the government’s idea”. 
Asked again, he said: “There’s nothing to hide here.”
The comments come as environment groups say they are concerned the agreement for the controversial grant contains no mention of climate change or its effect on the reef.
Although the foundation has said climate change is the biggest threat to the future of the reef, the agreement between the government’s reef trust and the foundation does not use the words once in more than 90 pages.
The document states that expected outcomes from the grant partnership are improved management of the Great Barrier Reef world heritage area, protection of attributes that contribute to the value of the world heritage area, and “management of key threats to the Great Barrier Reef World heritage area, including poor water quality and crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks”.
The outcomes are linked to the government’s Reef 2050 plan, which identifies climate change as the greatest threat to the reef but has been criticised by conservationists for failing to prioritise climate-related work and policy.
The agreement states that activities required under the grant include water quality activities, crown-of-thorns starfish control, “reef restoration and adaptation science activities”, Indigenous and community reef protection work, and reef monitoring and reporting activities.
“The outcomes in the grant agreement are explicitly linked to the government’s Reef 2050 plan outcomes, which don’t include addressing climate change,” said Matt Rose, economics program manager at the Australian Conservation Foundation.
“The best way to protect the Great Barrier Reef is to reduce climate pollution, yet the Reef 2050 plan and this grant agreement fails to direct funding to work on this issue.”
Glen Klatovsky, a campaign strategist at 350.org, said the agreement was a “catastrophic government failure”.
“We have a big problem with the Reef 2050 plan in that it largely ignores climate change and therefore this agreement largely ignores climate change,” he said. “Crown-of-thorns and water quality issues such as run-off are referred to time and time again. They are consequential and important but very subsidiary to climate change, which is the primary risk.”
Klatovsky said the agreement was a symptom of broader failure in Australian climate policy “as a whole” and said the organisation supported calls by Labor earlier this week for the grant money to be returned.
A spokeswoman for the foundation said Myer had not been involved with them for 14 years “so it’s not surprising that he may not be familiar with our work and processes to protect the reef”.
She said the grant agreement was a legal document and its partnership with the reef trust would “build on the Australian and Queensland governments’ Reef 2050 plan, which is based on the best available science and recognises climate change as a threat to the reef”.
“And the foundation has also been clear and consistent in expressing our view that climate change is the most significant threat to the reef,” she said.
“But we also need mitigation measures because scientists tell us the best way to protect and restore the reef is to match global efforts to tackle climate change with projects to reduce other threats such as water quality and crown-of-thorns starfish.”
On Wednesday the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said the government’s decision to award the grant without a tender process was “an ongoing scandal” and was an example of the need for a national integrity commission.
“Now we don’t have a national integrity commission until Labor gets elected but, in the meantime, I can only hope that the prime minister makes a proper and detailed explanation of this whole process,” he said.
“And it’s certainly the case that when parliament resumes next week, Labor will endeavour to get a full and proper explanation of this process.”
The government has defended the grant process as transparent and thorough and says it was considered by cabinet’s expenditure review committee before it was offered to the foundation.
A spokeswoman for the Department of Environment and Energy said the grant agreement outlined specific outcomes the foundation was expected to deliver toward the Reef 2050 plan.
She said schedule five of the agreement “details how the foundation has to deliver on reef restoration and adaptation science”.
Schedule five of the agreement suggests projects could include “newly developed and innovative activities to repair reef damage and build the Great Barrier Reef’s social, ecological and economic resilience” and projects that “drive innovation and explore and advance new technologies and approaches to reef restoration”, building on design work already undertaken by other government agencies.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/09/great-barrier-reef-former-board-member-describes-444m-grant-as-unthinkable

How frightened should we be about moving from a greenhouse to a hothouse?
The mechanism by which atmospheric gases warm the planet has been well understood since the 19th century. High CO2 levels early in the Earth’s history, wrote the geologist Thomas Sterry Hunt in 1867, had created the sort of climate that would have resulted if we “had covered the Earth with an immense dome of glass, had transformed it into a great orchid house”. The term “greenhouse effect” was coined in 1907.
But a “hothouse” sounds far more intense. From the 16th century, a hothouse was a bathhouse or a brothel, or a heated room for drying linen, and then a heated greenhouse for cultivating exotic species, metaphorically extended to an environment in which anything (including minds) grows very quickly. Its products are often said to be highly delicate, if not sickly. We are already wilting like hothouse flowers this summer, and there might be no way to smash the glass.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/09/greenhouse-hothouse-verbal-climate-change-irreversible-global-warming-scientists

We must deal with it now, 7 August). However, it presupposes that such jobs will themselves be enabled by the new technology, and that enough of them can be created. Both are debatable points.
An additional strategy is to support moves into good-quality jobs that depend less, if at all, on technology. An example is food production. In France, pioneering efforts at Bec Hellouin have proved that intensive cultivation of vegetables and fruit with well-designed hand tools can be as productive and profitable per hour worked as large-scale mechanised farming. Crucially, and counterintuitively, these results get better as the cultivated area per person gets smaller. Judging from the pioneers, such work is conducive to physical and mental health, soil health, family life, and time for activities outside work. This is not a return to peasantry.
Such “super-efficient market gardening” (my phrase) could make our country self-sufficient in vegetables and fruit, including most exotics, year round. I calculate that this would require at least 400,000 jobs but only 0.6% of our presently cultivated land area, thanks to its intensity. This calculation uses historical as well as modern statistics: it’s been done before, so we can do it again.
This raises other desirable possibilities, such as: towns and cities being supplied mainly from their own and surrounding areas, greatly reducing food miles; repopulation of the countryside and hence lower housing pressures in towns; large-scale sequestration of carbon in living soils.
Although half a million new horticultural jobs would absorb nowhere near those lost to automation, they do illustrate the additional strategy: society at all levels should identify and support any work which is more productive with human effort.
For example, support in market gardening might include co-operatives to acquire land, buy supplies and distribute produce – and it could start today!Malcolm FowlesReading
• Kim and Nick Hoare’s heartfelt call for a cross-party action programme for tackling climate change is crucial (Letters, 9 August).
Yet there is a way that the UK could contribute to substantially reducing its domestic carbon emissions while addressing the other serious threat of rapid and ubiquitous automation raised by Yvette Cooper.
There are two major labour-intensive sources of local jobs: face-to-face caring in the public and private sector, and infrastructural provision and improvements. Both are difficult to automate and can’t be relocated abroad. There is much discussion of the former, but far too little of the latter, which is crucial to tackling climate change. This would include prioritising energy efficiency and the increased use of renewables in constructing and refurbishing every UK building. In transport the emphasis would be on increased provision of interconnected road and rail services in every community, encouragement of electric vehicles for private use and for example using plastic waste in resurfacing roads and mending potholes.
Aside from the obvious advantages of improving social conditions and protecting the environment, this programme will have two further very politically attractive effects. The majority of this work will take place in every constituency and will require a wide range of skills for work that will last decades. In addition it would also inevitably help improve conditions and job opportunities for the “left behind” communities in the UK.Colin HinesConvener, UK Green New Deal Group 
• Just because some jobs can be replaced, why must that happen (Millions fear being replaced by machines, study finds, 9 August)? In my local supermarket, the many self-service tills are frequently empty while we customers choose to queue to be served by a real person.
The investment in this under-used equipment could have been used to pay staff who could then earn money to spend in the shop – and so the economy goes round.
And where is all the power going to come from to run this new machine economy? Perhaps the newly unemployed could work treadmills to generate it – truly a circular economy.Susannah EveringtonMarshwood, Dorset

The young T’boli woman was standing silently in a noisy crowd when we reached the village of Datal Bonglangon, deep within the conflict-riven island of Mindanao, in the Philippines.
The 28-year-old was so diminutive that I thought at first she was a teenager, but there was an intensity in her gaze and a strength in her handshake that suggested she had something extraordinary to relate.
It was not until two days later, when she felt fully able to trust us, that she revealed how her husband, father and two brothers had been killed in a single attack by the Philippine army. She had then pieced together her loved ones’ bodies, buried them, and was now carrying on their campaign to regain ancestral land from a coffee plantation.
Danyan’s story – quietly told at night over a chorus of insects and frogs – was among the most harrowing I have heard in 22 years as a journalist. But it might never have emerged if the Guardian had not embarked on a unique project to record and report on the deaths of land and environmental defenders across the world.
Over the past year, the Guardian has collaborated with the watchdog group Global Witness to keep a tally of the dead, name the victims and – where possible – to publish their pictures and tell their stories. In 2017, a record 207 people were killed. So far this year another 66 have been added to the toll.
In any conflict, the last thing a dominant power wants is for the outside world to know the cost of their victory. They criminalise and dehumanise their opposition, downplay the importance of the struggle, and obscure the number of victims.
This is particularly true of the battle for the global environment, which often goes unreported because it takes place in remote regions that are expensive or dangerous to reach. If disputes are covered at all, they are usually portrayed as disparate, distant, low-intensity challenges to “development” and the establishment.
By gathering these individual stories together, the Defenders project highlights the global trends behind these struggles: the growing appetite of humankind, the increasingly violent competition for food and minerals, the capitalist devaluing of nature, and the rise of dictatorial politicians supported by extractive industries.
To mark the anniversary of this project, we are raising the profile a step further by staging a month-long exhibition of portraits by the photographer Thom Pierce of 10 activists who are defending forests, rivers, coastlines and wildlife in the Coral Triangle, Sierra Madre, Pondoland, Anatolia, Mindanao, Tamil Nadu, the Brazilian Amazon and the Ugandan savanna.
These are faces of courage, anxiety, tragedy and determination. All had experienced threats or seen colleagues killed. Although their campaigns were peaceful, most lived with an almost daily risk of assassination. Two needed bodyguards. Many had to be photographed or interviewed in safe houses.
But they are also faces of inspiration. Each of these individuals is risking their lives for their land and our Earth.
Danyan did not choose her struggle; she inherited it. Up until the army attack last December, she had been mostly identified by her traditional roles as a mother, a wife, a sister and a daughter. But she was also respected as the first person in her village to graduate from high school. Now she could become the first female chieftain, replacing her dead father. She vowed to use the law and the media to continue his campaign.
The other stories are similarly compelling: Birhan Erkutlu and Tuğba Günal, the Turkish artists who became accidental hi-tech activists; Robert Chan, who leads an eco-vigilante group disarming illegal fishermen and loggers; Samuel Loware, a Ugandan ranger who survived being shot by poachers; Maria do Socorro Silva, a descendant of rebel slaves now battling the world’s biggest alumina refinery in the Amazon; Nonhle Mbuthuma, the Amadiba campaigner against a titanium mine on South Africa’s Wild Coast; Fatima Babu, the Indian anti-pollution activist who helped to close down a giant copper smelter after the massacre of more than a dozen protesters; Isela González, the former nurse who devotes herself to indigenous land rights in Mexico; and Ramón Bedoya, a 19-year-old Colombian campesino who wants to create a biodiversity zone on the edge of a palm oil plantation.
It was not always easy to interview and photograph them. Chan no longer dares to leave his organisation’s headquarters because of the dangers of assassination. Bedoya is at such high risk that he has been assigned two armed bodyguards and a bulletproof car by the Colombian authorities. González was unable to visit the communities she represents because of the threats to her life. Babu was reluctant to be photographed near the smelter because police might recognise and harass her. For journalists, such anxiety is a temporary inconvenience. For the subjects, it is a fact of everyday life. As Mbuthuma said: “I thank God each morning that I am still alive.”
None of them set out to be activists, let alone pin-ups for the environment. In many cases, they – like Danyan – inherited their struggles or became caught up in disputes when outsiders threatened their homes. But they also see the global pressures behind their local conflicts and want their stories to be told more widely so others can learn, follow and help.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2018/aug/09/defenders-activists-earth-risking-lives-protect-environment

It's unfortunate that the conservative desire to ""win"" against the Left is preventing serious action against climate change.
BQEND
It is more unfortunate that the environment has become a stock attack line against conservatives, the Left made this into a battleground issue.
Although as we can see in Britain, the Tories have been trying to win votes by going green for well over a decade. This is because in Britain environmentalism isnt threatening.
British cities are small enough to not need cars to get around in even its biggest cities, inter-city travel by rail is commonplace and it doesn't usually get hot enough to need air con. That and despite North Sea oil we dont consider ourselves to be a major mining or fossil fuel extracting country.
As such the effect of green issues on the left/right divide isn't so severe.
In countries like the US, Canada and Australia environmentalism would put the brakes on absolutely essential and profitable sections of the mining and fossil fuel economy. It would also hurt people in their everyday lives because air con usage, cars and domestic aviation are also absolutely essential.
Telling people to fly less in the US means telling them to spend a week travelling to the other side of the country. Telling people in Oz to use less air con would seem like madness in the height of their summer and telling Canadians to not make the most of tar sands sounds like economic sabotage.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1533895480000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'in britain environmentalism is nt threatening', u'effect': u'this is'}, {u'cause': u'air con usage are also absolutely essential', u'effect': u'it would also hurt people in their everyday lives'}], u'author_id': u'3855647', u'in_reply_to': u'119262942', u'id': u'119267042', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'PossumBilly', u'text': u''IMO' says a lot about the way a huge number of banner headline analysts determine the world they believe they live in.

We have to hand a number of scientific sites, written by scientists , that help decipher and explain the underlying mehodology in jargon free English.
Be careful were your draw your informnation an underlying data from and question everyting. This includes scientific papers where scientists use the 'NULL' hypothesis to test their findings by trying to disprove them, part of the scientific process.
 If the first sentence of the post above dismissing the impact of 'climatic forcing"" a critical part of trend analysis should ring warning bells. This is a critical component of AGW and IS known, recognised and measured.

Reading the IPCC papers themselves can make interesting reading. Remember the IPCC is a repository of scientific evidence, not conjecture.

“In absolute values, emissions caused by smartphones will jump from 17 to 125 megatons of CO2 equivalent per year (Mt-CO2e/yr) or a 730 per cent growth.
The lion’s share of this footprint (85 to 95 per cent) will be caused not by the use of the device, but rather by its production. That includes, in addition to the manufacturing energy, the energy for material mining for gold and the so-called rare-earth elements like yttrium, lanthanium and several others that today are almost exclusively available only from China.
On the infrastructure side, we predict the combined footprint of data centres and communications networks will grow from 215 megatons of C02 equivalent a year (Mt-CO2e/yr) in 2007 to 764 MtCO2-e/yr by 2020, with data centres accounting for about two thirds of the total contribution.
For comparison purposes, the entire carbon footprint of Canada was about 730 MtCO2-e in 2016 and is expected to decrease by 2020.
The growth in smartphones and data centres aren’t unrelated.
Indeed, it’s the dizzying growth in mobile communications that’s largely driving the pace for data centres. For every text message, video download, photo exchange, email or chat, there’s a 24/7 power-hungry server in some data centre that’s making it happen.

With 2C warming – an unlikely best-case scenario at this point, scientists were quoted as saying – the planet faces “long-term disaster”. With 3C warming, we are looking at “the loss of most coastal cities”. The possibility that the Earth might warm by 5C, wrote the author, Nathaniel Rich, had prompted some of the world’s leading scientists to warn of the end of human civilisation.
The premise of the article was to examine the decade after 1979, when all of this might have been avoided, and there has been some discussion in the US media as to whether it downplayed the villainy of the fossil fuels industry and previous Republican administrations.
There has also been some chatter about whether its gloomy prediction that it’s all too late and we’re doomed, Captain Mainwaring, doomed, is an irresponsible piece of editorialising that will encourage already disengaged people to give up and leave the house with every light burning. (Almost certainly, personal energy consumption makes no difference at this point; on the other hand, neither do individual votes, but we still cast them.)
I was having lunch with friends in Brooklyn on Sunday, in a low-lying area that will be under water when all of this comes to pass and, political analysis aside, all we could focus on was: what on earth are we going to do? More specifically, how to ensure the survival of our children, and should it involve buying a compound in some remote part of Canada?
The difficulty is knowing how to recognise the klaxon call when it comes. Is this, the summer of forest fires and record heatwaves, the climate disaster equivalent to Kristallnacht? Or can we safely not think about it for another 10 years?
No one had any answers. One friend averred that, shabby as this line of thinking is, one had to assume that when climate change posed an imminent threat to national security, the entire US defence budget would be ploughed into technology to reverse it, and we would be saved in the nick of time.
This seems to me optimistic, like the disaster movie in which a meteorite hurtling towards Earth is blown off course by a magic missile. “Perhaps,” I countered, “the answer is to raise our children to be really likable, so they can talk their way on to the lifeboats?” (I’d had half a gin and tonic, which is when I get my best ideas.)
Eventually, we came back to the question of Canada. (Or in the UK, Scotland.) Assessments by climate scientists have suggested cities around the Great Lakes are viable – and, until everyone else panics, affordable!
Denver, for reasons I forget; the Pacific north-west, if you’re willing to take your chances with the earthquakes. Meanwhile, the property investment implications of climate change seem, obscurely, to be part of how we got here in the first place. Peter Thiel and his fellow billionaires are, of course, developing survival strategies that include the creation of manmade archipelagos in international waters. Whenever I feel lassitude about long-term planning, I picture the future of humanity in the form of Thiel, smug on his island, and am almost – but not quite – irritated into action.

The mathematical calculations underpinning their estimations have recently shown to be fatally flawed. A paper is to be published soon. There seems to be agreement that CO2 causes some warming (around 1 degree), but that it plateaus. There isn't a linear relationship between CO2 and temperature. Stephen Schneider, a key early global warming figure, (who previously believed the world was cooling) actually argued exactly that in 1971 in a peer reviewed paper! That there isn't a linear correlation between increasing CO2 and temperature. 
"" It is found that, although the addition of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere does increase the surface temperature, the rate of temperature increase diminishes with increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.""

You might also be interested in the same Stephen Schneider's words. Schneider was a lead author in early IPCC reports, and was an adherent of 'post normal science'. https://principia-scientific.org/what-is-post-normal-science/
“On the one hand, as scientists we are ethically bound to the scientific method, on the other hand, we are not just scientists, but human beings as well.... we need to get some broad-based support, to capture the public’s imagination. That, of course, entails getting loads of media coverage. So we have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified, dramatic statements, and make little mention of the doubts we might have. Each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest.

Go and look at the historical relationship between CO2 and temperature. CO2 rises occur AFTER temperature rises cause CO2 to be released from oceans. In some parts of the record, there is an inverse correlation between CO2 levels and temperature. During the Ordovician CO2 levels were 1,100%  higher than they are today, during a glaciation. The excuse is that solar radiation was 3.3% lower. Do the maths. If CO2 is such a potent greenhouse gas.... Apparently, the sun is simultaneously NOT a major effect on climate (when it suits alarmists to claim that CO2 is the main driver) , and it IS a major effect on the climate (when it suits alarmists to claim that the other factors are overriding CO2).

Variants of that sentiment appeared all over social media when Coles decided against phasing out plastic bags on the basis that shoppers needed “more time to make the transition”. 
Then came the special climate edition of the New York Times Magazine putting essentially the same argument, albeit on a much grander scale. 
In a long and fascinating essay, Nathaniel Rich explains that the key breakthroughs in climate science are not new. By the 1980s, scientists already understood how global warming worked – and how to stop it. 
Today, so much carbon has been pumped into the atmosphere that, for Rich, “long-term disaster is now the best-case scenario”. But climate change could have been nipped in the bud. “Almost nothing stood in our way,” he explains, “except ourselves.”
The problem, in other words, was the populace. 
The masses craved comfort, irrespective of the consequences. They insisted on their gas-guzzling cars and their air conditioning and their plastic Coles bags, even as increasingly desperate experts begged them to change their ways.
As a result, we are where we are, with, for instance, a new report suggesting that climate change might well render many parts of the planet uninhabitable.
But what’s the basis for this confident assertion of the population’s indifference to the planet? 
“Human beings,” Rich says, “whether in global organisations, democracies, industries, political parties or as individuals, are incapable of sacrificing present convenience to forestall a penalty imposed on future generations.”
That sounds like a fact but it’s actually an argument, one associated with some fundamental controversies in political economy. As Shannon Osaka points out, Rich echoes Garrett Hardin’s “The tragedy of the commons”, an essay that argued that overpopulation and individual self-interest inevitably result in the despoliation of shared resources. 
But Hardin’s thesis by no means constitutes the knock-down blow its proponents claim. The Marxist geographer David Harvey notes that the supposed impossibility of the commons only became an “irrefutable argument for the superior efficiency of private property rights” because rightwingers generalised from specific historical conditions into supposedly immutable laws. 
Consumer-led campaigns make most sense to those in positions of relative privilege
In reality, though, as Elinor Ostrom demonstrated in her Nobel prize-winning research, many real-world communities boast long track records of the cooperative preservation of shared resources and common property, in precisely the way that Hardin declares impossible.
That’s something of which Australians, in particular, should be aware, with important books by Bruce Pascoe, Bill Gammage and others chronicling how Indigenous people sustained “the biggest estate on Earth” for some 60,000 years.
More generally, by blaming human nature, Rich’s piece naturalises and essentialises the specific political and economic conditions that made climate action so difficult in the 1980s. 
“[O]ne could scarcely imagine,” writes Naomi Klein, in a powerful response, “a more inopportune moment in human evolution for our species to come face to face with the hard truth that the conveniences of modern consumer capitalism were steadily eroding the habitability of the planet. Why? Because the late 80s was the absolute zenith of the neoliberal crusade, a moment of peak ideological ascendency for the economic and social project that deliberately set out to vilify collective action in the name of liberating ‘free markets’ in every aspect of life.”
This was, after all, the era in which the right and the left embraced the market as both inevitable and desirable, an institution of almost miraculous efficiency that needed to be forcibly introduced into every aspect of human behaviour. In came privatisation, deregulation and “user pays”; out went public ownership and planning. In the new environment, collective institutions – political parties, trade unions, community groups and even sporting clubs – inevitably withered, incompatible with a society of atomised individuals dealing with each other only through the nexus of the cash register.
Under such conditions, we can scarcely blame Joe and Jane Public for their failure to prioritise the future over the present. The whole point of neoliberalism was to universalise what economists call “rational profit maximisation”. We became a society of winners and losers, in which you grabbed what you could – or got trampled in the dust. 
In any case, with the decline of traditional mechanisms of politics, ordinary people possessed almost no power to exert their will. The unions, parties and parliaments that once exerted at least some influence over the market became themselves increasingly marketised, with private consumption re-interpreted as the a more legitimate expression of preference than the ballot. 
We can see the effects in Australia today – and the struggle over supermarket bags offers a prime example.
It shouldn’t be difficult to end the grotesque proliferation of plastic waste. As I’ve noted previously, American manufacturers adopted single-use packing after the second world war because of the enormous profits it facilitated. They then fought tooth and nail to accustom an initially hostile public to the resultant pollution. 
A government serious about curtailing the epidemic of toxic microplastics could, fairly obviously, tax those who produce and sell goods coated in the stuff. Punitive taxation would both dissuade single-use packaging and fund programs to rehabilitate the already degraded ecosystems.
Instead, the debate about shopping bags places the onus on individual shoppers. The responsibility for stamping out plastic rests not with governments or multinationals or institutions with real power but rather the harried parent trying to sort out the family meal on the way home from work.
By their nature, consumer-led campaigns make most sense to those in positions of relative privilege. If you’re in possession of a healthy disposable income, you’re probably already accustomed to picking and choosing what you buy, and so not at all discomforted by bringing your own recycled bag. 
If, on the other hand, you’re barely getting by from week to week, even a tiny extra fee can feel like an insult added to an injury. A giant supermarket, whose executives draw salaries you barely imagine and whose entire business model rests on enticing consumers to buy more plastic-wrapped goods, sanctimoniously implying that, despite your total lack of social power, you’re actually responsible for killing all the turtles: it’s not hard to grasp how that might rankle.
Almost every principle that progressives now hold sacrosanct was established by ordinary people
Should anyone be surprised, then, that the battle of the bags provided an opportunity for the culture war right to rile up sentiment against the inner-city elite and their Political Correctness Gone Mad? 
The anger that some shoppers displayed did not prove that ordinary Australians were grotesque monsters indifferent to the fate of the oceans. On the contrary, it showed how a particular kind of environmental strategy – one that targeted consumers rather than the institutions that shaped their consumption – could foster conditions for a rightwing backlash.
Yet here’s the thing. Coles might have claimed that customers drove its reversion to plastic bags. But an internal memo obtained by Fairfax tells a different story. 
Whatever it said in its press release, the supermarket explained to its store managers that the backflip stemmed from the need to corral shoppers through the checkouts more quickly. You see, Coles wanted to capitalise on the success of its Little Shop toy promotion, a program in which, as Fairfax put it, “customers receive small plastic-wrapped plastic replicas of everyday supermarket products”. 
In other words, the reversion to the old policy was always about profit – and not about people at all.
And that matters.
If we attribute the ruination of the planet to human nature, we’re essentially giving up. Likewise, if we blame everyone, we’re letting the real culprits of the hook, eliding the difference between the multinational pumping industrial quantities of pollutants into the atmosphere and the pensioner who simply forgets his recycled bag. 
In a grim political climate, progressives can feel isolated. It’s easy to huddle in the spaces where leftwing ideas retain some purchase and bemoan the backwardness all around. Many liberals have, in fact, internalised rightwing ideas about the conservatism of the masses. They see the public as as a dark reservoir of racism, sexism and bigotry; they present progressive politics, first and foremost, as a way of preventing the populace vomiting up their supposedly hateful prejudices. 
Yet almost every principle that progressives now hold sacrosanct was established by ordinary people, usually in the context of fierce opposition from the wealthy, the educated and the powerful. Again and again – from the green bans to the Franklin River blockade to the Jabiluka protests – we’ve seen that when campaigners offer a meaningful way to take action for the environment Australians show just how much they care for the natural world.
People aren’t the worst. They’re the only hope for the planet – and it’s time that was recognised.

Most others were warming, usually associated with CO2 emissions from an LIP. The end-Ordovician is usually ascribed to a glaciation (cooling), but recent careful dating and isotopic work suggests it was a double-punch. Initial cooling caused by aerosols from the LIP, followed by rapid warming as the aerosols rained out and the much-longer-lasting CO2 took over. The cold-tolerant ones survived the first blow, then the survivors were hit by the one thing they couldn't tolerate. Only those who could survive or adapt to both rapid cooling and rapid heating survived.
Interestingly, the end-Permian Great Dying was mostly warming, but there has been some recent evidence for a short return to the glacial conditions of the early Permian. So it too may be an LIP-induced aerosol-CO2 double-punch.

Tuatara are the sister taxon to the Squamata (including lizards and snakes) and are regarded as the most distinctive surviving reptilian genus. They are currently inhabits on offshore islands around New Zealand and have been recognized as a species in need of active conservation management. In this study, we report a total number of five nearly complete mitochondrial genomes, which were sequenced by Sanger and Next Generation DNA sequencing methods. Our phylogenomic analysis revealed distinct clustering of tuatara populations from the north and south islands of New Zealand.
BQEND
So perhaps the tuatara's rapid genomic evolution is because it has small populations living on isolated islands, like Galapagos tortoises and Darwin's finches.

Between 2014 and 2017, the world’s reefs endured the worst coral bleaching event in history, as the cyclical El Niño climate event combined with anthropogenic warming to cause unprecedented increases in water temperature. 
But the June survey, funded by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen’s family foundation, found the Sulawesi reefs were surprisingly healthy. 
In fact the reefs hadn’t appeared to decline significantly in condition than when they were originally surveyed in 2014 - a surprise for British scientist Dr Emma Kennedy, who led the research team.
 “After several depressing years as a coral reef scientist, witnessing the worst-ever global coral bleaching event, it is unbelievably encouraging to experience reefs such as these,” she said. “It means we still have time to save some coral reefs through the science-based targeting of conservation action.”
Indonesia is situated in the heart of the Coral Triangle - home to the greatest levels of marine biodiversity on the planet. There are reefs here that contain more species than the entire Caribbean, which is why the bioregion is of particular interest to scientists looking into reef resilience. 
 A combination of 360-degree imaging tech and Artificial Intelligence (AI) allowed scientists to gather and analyse more than 56,000 images of shallow water reefs. Over the course of a six-week voyage, the team deployed underwater scooters fitted with 360 degree cameras that allowed them to photograph up to 1.5 miles of reef per dive, covering a total of 1487 square miles in total. 
Researchers at the University of Queensland in Australia then used cutting edge AI software to handle the normally laborious process of identifying and cataloguing the reef imagery. Using the latest Deep Learning tech, they ‘taught’ the AI how to detect patterns in the complex contours and textures of the reef imagery and thus recognise different types of coral and other reef invertebrates. 
 Once the AI had shown between 400 and 600 images, it was able to process images autonomously. Says Dr Kennedy, “the use of AI to rapidly analyse photographs of coral has vastly improved the efficiency of what we do — what would take a coral reef scientist 10 to 15 minutes now takes the machine a few seconds.” 
The broad scientific consensus is that coral reef ecosystems worldwide risk collapse by as early as 2050, if CO2 emissions continue at the current rate. This sobering reality has catalysed a range of actions aimed at quickly assessing the health of reef ecosystems worldwide. 
The Sulawesi research is part of the 50 Reefs Initiative, one of the key projects focused on gathering and analysing baseline data. Established last year with support from Bloomberg Philanthropies, the Tiffany Co. Foundation and Paul G Allen Philanthropies, 50 Reefs’ goal is to establish a portfolio of key reef ecosystems that are, in the words of the initiative’s chief scientist Professor Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, “most likely to survive until global warming is brought under control.”
“Technology is now allowing us to do just this,” he adds. “It is very exciting.”
Coral reefs provide food security to half a billion people and contribute around US$375 billion per year to the global economy. If they collapse globally, the ocean fishing industry will collapse with them.
The hope is that if key reefs can be protected from other stressors such as plastic pollution and overfishing, they can ride out the worst impacts of climate change and replenish adversely affected reefs once ocean temperatures stabilise.
 The findings of the Sulawesi survey will help scientists and conservationists target coral conservation programmes elsewhere in the world. With perhaps three decades left to rescue a vital global ecosystem from extinction, it is progress that’s sorely needed.

In fact the reefs hadn’t declined significantly since 2014.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/the-coral-triangle/2018/aug/13/ai-identifies-heat-resistant-coral-reefs-in-indonesia

The pavements are empty, the parks quiet, entire neighbourhoods appear uninhabited. Nobody with a choice ventures outside during daylight hours. Only at night do the denizens emerge, HG Wells-style, into the streets – though, in temperatures that high, even darkness no longer provides relief. Uncooled air is treated like effluent: to be flushed as quickly as possible.
School playgrounds are silent as pupils shelter inside. In the hottest hours of the day, working outdoors is banned. The only people in sight are those who do not have access to air conditioning, who have no escape from the blanket of heat: the poor, the homeless, undocumented labourers. Society is divided into the cool haves and the hot have-nots.
Those without the option of sheltering indoors can rely only on shade, or perhaps a water-soaked sheet hung in front of a fan. Construction workers, motor-rickshaw drivers and street hawkers cover up head to toe to stay cool. The wealthy, meanwhile, go from one climate-conditioned environment to another: homes, cars, offices, gymnasiums, malls.
Asphalt heats up 10-20C higher than the air. You really could fry an egg on the pavement. A dog’s paws would blister on a short walk, so pets are kept behind closed doors. There are fewer animals overall; many species of mammals and birds have migrated to cooler environments, perhaps at a higher altitude – or perished. Reptiles, unable to regulate their body temperatures or dramatically expand their range, are worst placed to adapt. Even insects suffer.
Maybe in the beginning, when it was just a hot spell, there was a boom in spending as delighted consumers snapped up sunglasses, bathing suits, BBQs, garden furniture and beer. But the novelty quickly faded when relentless sunshine became the norm. Consumers became more selective. Power grids are overloaded by cooling units. The heat is now a problem.
The temperature is recalibrating behaviour. Appetites tend to fade as the body avoids the thermal effect of food and tempers are quicker to flare – along, perhaps, with crime and social unrest. But eventually lethargy sets in as the body shuts down and any prolonged period spent outdoors becomes dangerous.
You could see the physical change. Road surfaces started to melt …
Hospitals see a surge in admissions for heat stress, respiratory problems and other illnesses exacerbated by high temperatures. Some set up specialist wards. The elderly, the obese and the sick are most at risk. Deaths rise.
At 50C – halfway to water’s boiling point and more than 10C above a healthy body temperature – heat becomes toxic. Human cells start to cook, blood thickens, muscles lock around the lungs and the brain is choked of oxygen. In dry conditions, sweat – the body’s in-built cooling system – can lessen the impact. But this protection weakens if there is already moisture in the air.
A so-called “wet-bulb temperature” (which factors in humidity) of just 35C can be fatal after a few hours to even the fittest person, and scientists warn climate change will make such conditions increasingly common in India, Pakistan, south-east Asia and parts of China. Even under the most optimistic predictions for emissions reductions, experts say almost half the world’s population will be exposed to potentially deadly heat for 20 days a year by 2100.
Not long ago, 50C was considered an anomaly, but it is increasingly widespread. Earlier this year, the 1.1 million residents of Nawabshah, Pakistan, endured the hottest April ever recorded on Earth, as temperatures hit 50.2C. In neighbouring India two years earlier, the town of Phalodi sweltered in 51C – the country’s hottest ever day.
Dev Niyogi, professor at Purdue University, Indiana, and chair of the Urban Environment department at the American Meteorological Society, witnessed how cities were affected by extreme heat on a research trip to New Delhi and Pune during that 2015 heatwave in India, which killed more than 2,000 people.
“You could see the physical change. Road surfaces started to melt, neighbourhoods went quiet because people didn’t go out and water vapour rose off the ground like a desert mirage,” he recalls.
“We must hope that we don’t see 50C. That would be uncharted territory. Infrastructure would be crippled and ecosystem services would start to break down, with long-term consequences.”
Several cities in the Gulf are getting increasingly accustomed to such heat. Basra – population 2.1 million – registered 53.9C two years ago. Kuwait City and Doha have experienced 50C or more in the past decade. At Quriyat, on the coast of Oman, overnight temperatures earlier this summer remained above 42.6C, which is believed to be the highest “low” temperature ever recorded in the world.
At Mecca, the two million hajj pilgrims who visit each year need ever more sophisticated support to beat the heat. On current trends, it is only a matter of time before temperatures exceed the record 51.3C reached in 2012. Last year, traditionalists were irked by plans to install what are reportedly the world’s biggest retractable umbrellas to provide shade on the courtyards and roof of the Great Mosque. Air conditioners weighing 25 tonnes have been brought in to ventilate four of the biggest tents. Thousands of fans already cool the marble floors and carpets, while police on horseback spray the crowds with water.
The blast of furnace-like heat ... literally feels life-threatening and apocalyptic
Football supporters probably cannot expect such treatment at the Qatar World Cup in 2022, and many may add to the risks of hyperthermia and dehydration by taking off their shirts and drinking alcohol. Fifa is so concerned about conditions that it has moved the final from summer to a week before Christmas. Heat is also why Japanese politicians are now debating whether to introduce daylight saving time for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics so that marathon and racewalk athletes can start at what is currently 5am and avoid mid-afternoon temperatures that recently started to pass 40C with humidity of more than 80%.
At the Australian open in Melbourne this year – when ambient temperatures reached 40C – players were staggering around like “punch-drunk boxers” due to heatstroke. Even walking outside can feel oppressive at higher temperatures. “The blast of furnace-like heat ... literally feels life-threatening and apocalyptic,” says Nigel Tapper, professor of environmental science at Melbourne’s Monash University, of the 48C recorded in parts of the city. “You cannot move outside for more than a few minutes.”
The feeling of foreboding is amplified by the increased threat of bush and forest fires, he adds. “You cannot help but ask, ‘How can this city operate under these conditions? What can we do to ensure that the city continues to provide important services for these conditions? What can we do to reduce temperatures in the city?’”
Those places already struggling with extreme heat are doing what they can. In Ahmedabad, in Gujarat, hospitals have opened specialist heat wards. Australian cities have made swimming pools accessible to the homeless when the heat creeps above 40C, and instructed schools to cancel playground time. In Kuwait, outside work is forbidden between noon and 4pm when temperatures soar.
But many regulations are ignored, and companies and individuals underestimate the risks. In almost all countries, hospital admissions and death rates tend to rise when temperatures pass 35C – which is happening more often, in more places. Currently, 354 major cities experience average summer temperatures in excess of 35C; by 2050, climate change will push this to 970, according to the recent “Future We Don’t Want” study by the C40 alliance of the world’s biggest metropolises. In the same period, it predicts the number of urban dwellers exposed to this level of extreme heat will increase eightfold, to 1.6 billion.
As baselines shift across the globe, 50C is also uncomfortably near for tens of millions more people. This year, Chino, 50km (30 miles) from Los Angeles, hit a record of 48.9C, Sydney saw 47C, and Madrid and Lisbon also experienced temperatures in the mid-40s. New studies suggest France “could easily exceed” 50C by the end of the century while Australian cities are forecast to reach this point even earlier. Kuwait, meanwhile, could sizzle towards an uninhabitable 60C.
How to cool dense populations is now high on the political and academic agenda, says Niyogi, who last week co-chaired an urban climate symposium in New York. Cities can be modified to deplete heat through measures to conserve water, create shade and deflect heat. In many places around the world, these steps are already under way.
The city at 50C could be more tolerable with lush green spaces on and around buildings; towers with smart shades that follow the movement of the sun; roofs and pavements painted with high-albedo surfaces; fog capture and renewable energy fields to provide cooling power without adding to the greenhouse effect.
But with extremes creeping up faster than baselines, Niyogi says this adapting will require changes not just to the design of cities, but how they are organised and how we live in them. First, though, we have to see what is coming – which might not hit with the fury of a flood or typhoon but can be even more destructive.
“Heat is different,” says Niyogi. “You don’t see the temperature creep up to 50C. It can take people unawares.”

Instead, he said the fires were worsened because of limits on logging.
“America is better than letting these radical groups control the dialogue about climate change,” Zinke told KCRA, a TV station in northern California, on Sunday. “Extreme environmentalists have shut down public access. They talk about habitat and yet they are willing to burn it up.”
His remarks come on the heels of a USA Today op-ed, published last week, where he held environmentalists partly responsible for the fires because of a stance some have taken against logging. Zinke described it as a responsible means of forest management and called for an increase in timber harvesting, adding that this would also be a boon for the economy.
“This is not a debate about climate change,” he said on a trip to the affected area, the Sacramento Bee reported. “There’s no doubt the [fire] season is getting longer, the temperatures are getting hotter.”
California wildfires are being magnified &amp; made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which aren’t allowing massive amounts of readily available water to be properly utilized. It is being diverted into the Pacific Ocean. Must also tree clear to stop fire from spreading!
Zinke’s statements echoed sentiments expressed by President Trump – a 5 August tweet suggested the fires were “made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which aren’t allowing massive amounts of readily available water to be properly utilized”. The claim, referencing decades-long disputes over California water rights, was met with immediate backlash and confusion because firefighters are not struggling with a water shortage. The White House has yet to offer a response or explanation.
More than 1,000 square miles (2,590 sq km) have burned across California in the 2018 fire season and at least eight people have been killed in what is now considered the most destructive fire season on record for the state – several months ahead of when fire season is expected to end.
The Ranch Fire, which continues to scorch swaths of land in northern California has officially taken the record as the largest ever observed in the state, burning close to 469 sq miles (1,214 sq km) alone.
Governor Jerry Brown has called the devastating situation “the new normal” as dry conditions and rising temperatures have elongated the fire season, and has joined climate scientists who attribute the shift to climate change.
Writing in the Guardian last week, climate scientists Daniel Swain, Crystal Kolden and John Abatzoglou said California had entered an “era of megafires” that is linked to “the long-term warming trend”.
Researchers do attribute the recent fires in part to forest management strategies, and moves to inhibit naturally occurring wildfires that previously helped maintain an ecological balance in forests. Fire suppression has left forests dense, dry and primed to burn. Such policies, Swain and his colleagues write, were put in place to protect the timber industry.
Kristina Dahl, a senior climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the science showing a link between worsening wildfires and rising temperatures is well established. “Specifically for the western states,” she said, “we know that the wildfire activity in recent decades – at least half of it – is attributable to human-caused climate change.”
“This is a reality that we have created and that we are living with, but this is an evolving situation. Where we are right now is just one point on a trajectory that is headed in a worsening direction.”

You don’t “adapt” to a raging fire, do you? You have to stop it. And the first thing you need to do is stop pouring fuel on it.
Leading scientists worldwide now agree that the main cause of the climate crisis is the burning of fossil fuels, and leading economists agree that the solution is to price fossil fuels out of the market. Until that happens, we will be paying – with our health, our lives and our children’s future.
Why don’t we hear more about this? Two main reasons, perhaps: our economy is largely run on fossil fuels, and those on low incomes suffer most from higher energy prices. Yet there’s a solution.
It’s over six years since the leading scientist Dr James Hansen – in a historic TED talk on climate change, which laid out how his warnings had been suppressed in his 30-year tenure as director of Nasa’s Goddard Institute – memorably declared that “the greatest tragedy is that it would be so easy to stop it”.
What is needed, he said, is a substantial, rising fee on fossil fuels, imposed at the source (oil well, coal pit, port of entry) – with the revenue not kept by the government but returned to every citizen in equal shares.
This would not only ease the transition for those on low incomes but promote every kind of green behaviour, as well as incentivising the development and deployment of alternative energy sources. It’s an elegant solution – easy to implement, transparent in its operation, immediate in its effect, and fair.
We should spread the word that there is a solution. Telling our friends and writing our MPs are actions we can take today. And we may still have a tomorrow.Judy HindleyCitizens Climate Lobby UK
• Concerns about 50C cities are timely given that gas escapes from previously frozen deposits could easily outweigh reductions from human activities, so overall levels will still rise. Geoengineering like solar radiation management is risky but possible, yet suppose such measures were rejected or ineffective – what would happen in hotter countries, especially to the less well-off? The question of who will take climate change refugees needs urgent discussion, especially given attitudes in Europe, the US, Australia and some other wealthy countries.Iain ClimieWhitchurch, Hampshire

And for clarity the IPCC quotes 1 in 40 chance of > 6C in the language that they use. They state that they downgraded this risk in AR5 because of the ""hiatus"" in 2012 which has been smashed since. And that is without ESS. See the BGS addendum.
BQEND
The lower bound for ECS was reduced in AR5 to 1.5C, compared to 2C in AR4, due to inclusion of papers based upon the observational record which subsequently have been cast under substantial doubt. There has been some fluctuation over time, but the range has remained fundamentally unchanged since the Charney Report in 1979 (1.5 - 4.5C). 
https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo3017
There is detailed discussion in chapters 10 and 12 of AR5:
http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_Chapter10_FINAL.pdf
http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_Chapter12_FINAL.pdf
ECS is positive, extremely unlikely less than 1°C (high confidence), and very unlikely greater than 6°C (medium confidence). The upper limit of the likely range is unchanged compared to AR4. The lower limit of the likely range of 1.5°C is less than the lower limit of 2°C in AR4. This change reflects the evidence from new studies of observed temperature change, using the extended records in atmosphere and ocean. 
(Box 12.2)
And more recently in the Royal Society Report:
How might this affect the IPCC statement?
Growing understanding of the complex, non-linear factors determining climate sensitivity is leading to improvements in methodologies for estimating it. A value below 2°C for the lower end of the likely range of equilibrium climate sensitivity now seems less plausible.
https://royalsociety.org/~/media/policy/Publications/2017/27-11-2017-Climate-change-updates-report.pdf
AR6 will be devoting a single chapter to the subject.
(ESS (Earth System Sensitivity) is the final state once all long feedbacks have played out over millenial timescales, so less irrelevant on a societal basis, though important as it tells us where we will end up eventually. However forcing will change over that timescale, thus it could be considered unobtainable. And ECS is fundamentally dependent upon the initial state and sensitivity to that state.)

We are on pace for one meter per century of sea level rise from the ice sheets and glaciers and thermal expansion but the paleoclimate record suggests that if we get a half degree warmer like during the Eemian but maybe not even half a degree warmer, maybe we're already there, sea level is going to be 6 to 9 meters higher.

BQSTART
Two studies published this week conclude that a section of the West Antarctic ice sheet has reached a point of inevitable collapse, an event that would eventually raise sea levels more than a meter (three-plus feet).
BQEND
Ummm, your original assertion was that ""we've already destabilized around 6m worth of sea level rise equivalent of ice"".
The ""has reached"" covers the ""already"" bit, but ""more than a meter"" is a lot less than your claimed SIX meters.
Let's keep reading in the hope of uncovering those missing 5 meters ...
BQSTART
Both studies conclude that the Amundsen Sea segment of the ice sheet has begun an irreversible decline that will result in its loss, possibly as soon as the next few hundred years.
BQEND
OK, ""has begun"" reconfirms the ""already"" bit ... pity the melting isn't going to occur by the (default / assumed by most people when talking about ""the worst impacts of climate change"") year 2100.

BQSTART
Called the weak underbelly of the West Antarctic ice sheet, the Amundsen Sea region contains several fast-moving glaciers, including Pine Island, Thwaites, Haynes, Pope, Smith, and Kohler. Many Antarctic glaciers have offshore ice shelves that hold them in place like a dam. But there is very little fixed, offshore ice in the Amundsen Sea, so the glaciers flow freely. These rivers of ice drain one third of the West Antarctic ice sheet.
BQEND
So both studies concentrate on a region particularly susceptible to ice loss ""tipping points"". Neither can be generalised to all of the WAIS, let alone all of Antarctica.

BQSTART
The glaciers in the Amundsen Sea region have entered this vicious cycle, and there seems to be nothing to slow or stop the melt.
BQEND
Another confirmation of ""already"", but still nothing about the missing 5 (five) meters.
Also, in the ""next few hundred years"" it is supposed to take to melt even the ""more than a meter"" SLR equivalent claimed by NASA, isn't it possible that humans will see what's happening and stop burning all the coal needed to follow RCP 8.5 ?

BQSTART
These three things—the accelerating melt rate, the retreating grounding lines, and no speed bumps—all point to the eventual collapse of the Amundsen Sea portion of the West Antarctic ice sheet. That conclusion is supported by Joughin’s modeling study, which found that the Thwaites glacier is on pace to collapse in as little as 100 to 200 years ( some scenarios give the glacier as many as 1,000 years). This segment of the ice sheet contains enough ice to raise sea levels by 1.2 meters (4 feet).
BQEND

BQEND
Risk management is a combination of likelihood and impact.
From my engineering degree, I am well aware that very high impact events such as the entire chemical plant exploding are often attributed a risk of > 1,000,000 to 1.
Even with no mechanism that you can think of which would initiate the plant to explode you still have to include it in the design. For example ensuring that it is built a mile from the nearest house.
Climate change is currently happening and is higher in impact than almost any other event contemplated.
From risk management we don't know how bad 2C would be to the ecosystem, meaning layered risk. From risk management we have to do everything we can for a scenario which is better than the best case scenario from our current CO2 levels.
Risk management studies for what happens when the house catches fire when the house is already on fire is not the correct response.
And for clarity the IPCC quotes 1 in 40 chance of > 6C in the language that they use. They state that they downgraded this risk in AR5 because of the ""hiatus"" in 2012 which has been smashed since.

CO2 has driven many of the changes in Earth's climate over time.
At least one mass extinction is associated with lots of CO2 being formed by burning fossil fuel, and there is a NCIE* in the geochemical record confirming it.
It was volcanic action that burned coal then, in Siberia.
There are a number of papers on that such as:
""Initial pulse of Siberian Traps sills as the trigger of the end-Permian mass extinction"" - Burgess et al, 2017

The changes result in global-scale warming [global trend (70°S–80°N, 1979–2016) = 0.174°C decade−1], ~30% larger than our previous version of the dataset [global trend (70°S–80°N, 1979–2016) = 0.134°C decade−1]. This change is primarily due to the changes in the adjustment for drifting local measurement time. The new dataset shows more warming than most similar datasets constructed from satellites or radiosonde data. However, comparisons with total column water vapor over the oceans suggest that the new dataset may not show enough warming in the tropics.

3.71wm2 is the ipcc estimate for climate sensitivity based on co2 change vs temp increase since industrialisation.
BQEND
While TTSB can be a little ... what's the right word ? ... ""forthright"" (?) in their criticism I agree that there is a valid point regarding this particular phrase at least.
You appear to be mixing up several different concepts here.
1) 3.71 (+/- 0.4) W/m2 is the IPCC estimate for the amount of radiative forcing that would result from a doubling of CO2 levels (often quoted as the calculation from 280ppm to 560ppm).
2) The IPCC (AR5, WG1 report, 2013, SPM, page 11) says that ""The total anthropogenic RF for 2011 relative to 1750 is 2.29 [1.13 to 3.33] W m^−2"" and that ""Emissions of CO2 alone have caused an RF of 1.68 [1.33 to 2.03] W m^–2 (see Figure SPM.5)"".NB : "" ... relative to 1750"" is equivalent to your ""... since industrialisation"".
3) The IPCC says about (Equilibrium) Climate Sensitivity (ECS), on page 14 of the same report :
BQSTART
The equilibrium climate sensitivity quantifies the response of the climate system to constant radiative forcing on multi-century time scales. It is defined as the change in global mean surface temperature at equilibrium that is caused by a doubling of the atmospheric CO2 concentration. Equilibrium climate sensitivity is likely in the range 1.5°C to 4.5°C ( high confidence), extremely unlikely less than 1°C ( high confidence), and very unlikely greater than 6°C ( medium confidence).
BQEND
The 3.71 (+/- 0.4 W/m2) value is widely accepted. Note that the ""error range"" is just over +/- 10%.

The attention is justified because the paper paints a very grim picture of the climate and what humans may be doing to it. In particular, the authors of this study tried to determine the trajectory that the Earth is on so we can predict what the future climate will be.
There are many really important insights from this paper. The authors wanted to know how feedbacks in the Earth’s climate will play a role in shaping the climate in the future. By feedbacks, we mean a change in one part of the climate that then causes another change, which in turn may cause another change, and so on, potentially setting up chain reactions.
Feedbacks are really important because they are changes that the natural system makes without being caused directly by humans.
For example, melting ice is one feedback, particularly in the Arctic. Humans have emitted greenhouse gases that have caused the Earth to warm. As the Earth warms, ice melts; as ice melts, it means there is less white reflective cover on the Earth surface. In fact, a lot of this ice melting is happening in the Arctic. Instead of having a white surface that reflects sunlight, we have open ocean water that absorbs sunlight. Consequently, melting of ice leads to more absorbed sunlight which then leads to more melting of ice – a reinforcing cycle, as illustrated below.
Activating one of these cycles is bad news for a few reasons. First, it takes away a lot of control of the Earth’s climate from us. Right now, humans control the climate through our emissions of greenhouse gases. But once these cycles get activated, the Earth’s climate will partially control itself. That means it will be harder to stop the warming process.
The second reason this is bad news is that many of the cycles are linked together. For instance, the feedback cycle shown above might be strong enough to activate another cycle (for example, melting of permafrost and release of trapped methane). So, you can’t look at these feedbacks in isolation. You have to consider how they behave as a group.
The image below is taken from the paper. It shows 15 different feedback cycles. They are colored by the temperature at which they will be triggered. For instance, the authors believe the Greenland ice sheet will be activated when temperatures rise 1–3°C. The East Antarctic ice sheet however, shown at the bottom, will be activated once temperatures rise by 5°C or more. 
The various feedbacks also have connecting arrows to show how they are interrelated. For instance, there is an arrow connecting the Greenland Ice Sheet and Arctic summer sea ice. This means the two feedbacks affect each other. 
This image is really important for understanding why scientists are so worried. Consider the summer Arctic sea ice. We know that it has decreased by about 70% in volume and perhaps 50% or so in area. Loss of Arctic sea ice will affect the Greenland Ice Sheet. That in turn will affect the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. 
It doesn’t stop there; both of these affect the thermohaline circulation which would be activated at a higher temperature threshold. Finally, all of these (Greenland, West Antarctica, and the thermohaline circulation) affect the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. Melting of that ice sheet would be devastating to the entire globe. We see how a change that started with Arctic ice has spread, through these interconnections, to the South Pole.
A couple of things to note. First, we don’t actually know when these various feedbacks will be “tipped.” Scientists have educated guesses, but we really are not certain. Also, we don’t know how long they will take to tip. As an example, let’s say we pass the tipping point for a collapse of the Amazon Rainforest. That doesn’t mean it will die off immediately, but it means its death is likely or certain. But how long will it take? Years? Decades? We can make estimates, but that is what they are – estimates. We know that some feedbacks will take a long time to complete, even after we pass the point of no return. For example, the East Antarctica Ice Sheet will take centuries to melt.
But with these caveats, it just means humans should be more focused on taking action now to avoid triggering the tipping points. We don’t know where they are so let’s be safe and stay far away. The problem is, humans collectively are not doing enough. My country specifically is the world’s worst when it comes to pushing us over these tipping points. There still is time to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. But, it is far too late to avoid all climate change – it is already here.

The vehicle, already overloaded with passengers, was caught in gridlocked traffic and sat static for nearly an hour. There was a heatwave, with a temperature of about 38C (100F) outside; inside the bus it was 42C (108F). “At a specific moment, I just snapped,” remembered Ayari. “I got out in the middle of traffic to finally breathe.” Since then, he has been inclined to panic attacks if in confined, crowded spaces during hot weather.
A month earlier, approximately 2,000 km (1300 miles) away in Bristol, UK, Adam Corner was on a bus with his partner and their new baby, heading across the city to visit friends. The bus was held up in traffic – not for long, but long enough. “It became a kind of inferno,” said Dr Corner, research director at Climate Outreach; their baby, barely a month old, started screaming in a way Corner had never heard before. “We had a little insight into this immediate, visceral risk – you see it through the eyes of your newborn child.” He pulled the bus’s emergency cord and they jumped off into traffic.
This tale of two bus journeys tells a story of rising temperatures and the pressure they are putting on cities and the people who live in them. Asked by Guardian Cities to share their experiences for a week-long series on urban heat, readers from countries as disparate as Hawaii, the Netherlands, Australia, Denmark, Japan, France, Malaysia, Romania, South Korea and Canada expressed concern about the impacts already being felt.
“When I moved here many years ago, we used to joke: ‘This summer happened on a Wednesday in Paris’,” wrote Mariann Gyorke. “That’s not the case anymore.” In an effort to preserve the cooler temperatures inside her family’s top-floor apartment, she had been cooking only cold dishes and shielding the windows with makeshift shutters made of cardboard.
Around the world, people altered their behaviour and adapted their schedules to cope with the heatwave. In order to sleep, Michele Howie of Sydney soaked her nightwear in water and lay on a towel in front of two fans. Anna Mastersson in Mariehamn, of Finland’s Åland Islands, said her relative had been forced to buy a new car with air conditioning and a roof window: “In this weather and having to drive two small kids, she had no choice.” In her neighbourhood, dogs were being taken out later at night, for shorter walks. In Montreal, Frederic Hore had noticed people lingering in pedestrian passageways of the metro station to catch the pulse of cool air created by passing trains.
It’s wonderful not moaning about the weather
Outside, green spaces dried up, with follow-on effects for agriculture and often the economy. Inge Kersten wrote of Nijmegen, this year’s European Green Capital, “Leaves are falling in our lovely green city”. On her family’s organic farm near Aarhus, Denmark, Jessica Tamminga had watched fields turn from green to brown: “The trees are turning yellow like it’s fall”. But for the impact on her business, she said, the heat was “rather pleasant – except for the disconcerting feeling that this California summer doesn’t belong in Scandinavia.”
Britons, in particular, seemed more ready to take the warmer temperatures at face value. “We’re all enjoying a real summer at last,” wrote Regan Armitage. “Everyone seems uncharacteristically happy in Leeds.” Frank Holt in Brighton described the summer as “luxuriating, joyful, a little alcoholic, a summer you don’t need to go away for”. “It’s wonderful not moaning about the weather,” he wrote, adding that the Guardian’s call-out had seem “designed to gain negative replies”.
Holt expanded to Guardian Cities by phone that, though he was concerned by climbing temperatures, he felt the onus was on scientists and the media to persuade politicians to act, he said; in the meantime, the warmer weather “did have some enjoyable aspects”. “I think things sometimes should be enjoyed for what they are. This summer has been very good for Brighton.”
If it gets much hotter I don’t see how the place will be survivable in summer
And not all life was suffering in the heat. Jellyfish numbers had increased in the tropical seas around Jeju Island, wrote In-Gyum Kim from Seogwipo, its second-largest city. Helena in Columbia, South Carolina, said that judgin gby how often she was bitten, ticks and mosquitoes seemed to be thriving, as were “our famous Palmetto bugs” – cockroaches. In Kuala Lumpur, a bumper crop of the prized durian fruit saw prices come down to RM5 (£1) per kilo – but that had its own, unusual effect.
The fruit is understood to raise the body’s temperature, said Vanessa Ting, a student in the Malaysian capital. “I ate three pieces and spent the rest of the day sweaty and uncomfortable, despite taking six showers.” At the pharmacy where she works part time, more customers had been reporting fevers, sore throats and coughs, attributed variously to the weather and durian. And she’d observed more retirees opting to meet at the McDonald’s where she regularly studied, rather than in more traditional coffee shops without air conditioning. 
 Cody Winchester had noticed more air conditioners being installed on more buildings in Honolulu. “People used to just open their windows and the fresh tropical breeze would pass through and cool the home. Now it’s unbearable to live in town without AC.” But many could not afford it, he added, as Hawaii has the most expensive electricity in the entire US.
Many found their homes simply not built to cope with extreme temperatures. Adina wrote of Timisoara, Romania, that given its reliance on concrete and tarmac “the city becomes a frying pan in the heat”. Clive Warner, in Monterrey in northern Mexico, was opting to move 25km south to Santiago, Nuevo Leon, a greener area that is, on average, 5C cooler. “Having cardiac problems, I can’t tolerate it any longer,” he said of the 34-37C (93-99F) maximum shade temperature in Monterrey. “If it gets much hotter I don’t see how the place will be survivable in summer.”
The electricity already sometimes fails in 39C (102F) heat, he added. “If that happens, I get in the car and drive to a shopping mall.”
Humidity was a complicating factor, with one Istanbul resident saying it was hard even to breathe, even at night. Humid hot days in Washington DC, once rare from the first week of September, are now lasting well into the month, wrote Cara, contributing to insidious black mould with entire metro cars reeking of damp. Walk through Hong Kong for more than five minutes, said Ellison Tsang, “and it looks as though you’ve just passed through a shower with all your clothes on”. With 90% humidity, even 25C (77F) “feels like being brushed in salt-sweat soup,” echoed Eric Crawford from Beijing.
Air conditioning brought relief, but to a point that seemed drastically, even dangerously, at odds with ecology, said Tim Kelly in Naha, Japan. “Stores leave their front doors wide open, people enter and exit rooms without closing the door behind them – all the while blasting their air conditioning.” People even napped in their parked cars with the engines running.
Not only was this dependance on air conditioning damaging to the environment, but moving regularly between radically different climes causes temperature shock, said Kelly. “Their bodies lose the ability to cope with the natural environment.” Johanna MacGregor said summer colds were common in Tokyo because shops, restaurants and the subway were often too cool, “while places like schools or community halls often have no aircon whatsoever – it’s one or the other.”
It was in stark contrast to the picture painted by Patrycja Lickiewicz of Castalla in Alicante, Spain, as a society “in tacit compliance with nature”. There it is the norm to restrict activities to before 8.30am and after 8pm; and to drink water, dress appropriately, and stick to the shade at all other hours. “No matter the temperatures people always behave the same way,” said Lickiewicz. “We do not complain, we just follow the same simple routines. When common sense prevails we keep ourselves and the environment in check.”
We should be using this heat to our advantage and convert all our power to solar source
But adapting is not simply a case of being sun-smart, Lickiewicz conceded, when at least the oldest buildings in Castalla are built of stone, with internal air flow directed through courtyards and shutters – which manages heat without the need for air conditioning.
If cities are to cope with more extreme heat more frequently, there needs to be structural change across the board: building codes to ensure future housing stock is not only warm, but cool; infrastructure that can cope; and regulation to enforce safe behaviours. Harry May, in Fukuoka, Japan, wanted to see work shut down when the mercury climbs past 34C (“Think on that, the UK”); Monica Garcia-Galvan was in favour of introducing a water tax in Montreal to encourage people not to let taps run for minutes at a time (“if English people saw how Canadians wash dishes, they would faint”). Adina, in Timisoara, Romania, said authorities needed to enforce health and safety laws relating to working in unsafe temperatures: “We have them but no one respects them.” Alice Browning of Friedrichshafen, southern Germany, spoke for many with her desperate plea for more trees: “We really don’t want to be cooped up inside all day.”
In many cities steps have already been taken. In Nantes, Patrick Brown said, boulevards cleared for cars were being redesigned to include plenty of green space, and art installations with water features had given people places in which to cool off in summer. The De Bastei centre operated a scheme in Nijmegen and elsewhere in the Netherlands where residents could swap tiles or stones from their garden for plants.
Others saw opportunities to be grasped by tackling the rising temperatures. David Fraire said nothing could be done to ease the issue of heat in Chandler, Arizona. “This is Phoenix, valley of the sun – it comes with the territory.” But it could be better harnessed: “We should be using this heat to our advantage and convert all our power to solar source.” Frank Holt suggested that Britain could build its new, post-Brexit identity through investment in renewables.
It’s very much not a problem for the next generation – we need to be thinking about how we get to grips with it
But even in amongst optimism there was a feeling of powerlessness, even fatalism. Washington DC residents would cope with the heat as they had done for decades, said Cara – but related issues, for example surrounding health problems and food insecurity, were a bigger unknown. “We’re already putting in more green, solar, or light-coloured roofs. We’re committed to keeping and increasing the tree canopy, too, to help lower temperatures.”
But without greater commitment to addressing the root causes from regional authorities – for example, by shutting down the coal-fired power plants along the Potomac – Cara continued: “there is very little we can do”. Charlie in Redding, California, urged that the US “stop with the knuckle dragging” and return to the Paris climate accord and “thinking people” at once – if it was not already too late. The day he wrote, it was nearly 43C (109F): “Think that life as we have known it forever is on a collision course with a destiny that’s not beneficial for mankind!”
Dr Adam Corner of Climate Outreach said adapting to climate change meant seeing its influence in every facet of life – not just the environment, and not just in high-profile periods of extreme weather. “It’s a really complex set of questions, but those tangible things are more relatable to people than ‘global temperatures are going to change by 2C’,” he said. “There are so many ways that climate change is with us now. It’s very much not a problem for the next generation – we need to be thinking about how we get to grips with it.”
The effects and implications of rising temperatures need to be considered by doctors, urban planners, architects; those working in business, transport, agriculture and food security. Yet even news stories about climate change were illustrated with photographs of polar bears and melting ice caps, or renderings of future cities. “It’s the human story of our generation, but you wouldn’t know it, from the way we visualise and present it. Where are the people in this?”
In Nabeul, said Ayari, they were mostly indoors, sheltering in the air conditioning. Traffic had become unbearable and it was too hot even to go to the beach. His twin sister has a respiratory condition exacerbated by the heat and had been advised to stay indoors: “The doctors say it’s like an allergy to the weather,” said Ayari. “People are actually getting scared of going out and being confronted by the sun. You have empty streets in the daytime and huge crowds at night.
“This heatwave we are witnessing is making me more and more concerned about our future in the city ... We have to talk more about the seriousness of this issue.”

An appeals court in Washington DC ruled on Friday that the Environmental Protection Agency could not delay the enforcement of a chemical safety rule drawn up by the Obama administration. The EPA’s attempt to impose a two-year delay on the rule was “arbitrary and capricious”, the court ruled, with judges criticizing the agency for making a “mockery” of the Clean Air Act.
The rule, which came in the wake of a 2013 chemical explosion that killed 15 people in West, near Dallas, set stricter standards for operators’ risk management plans.
Plant operators complained the rule was too burdensome, a view shared by the former EPA head Scott Pruitt, who announced the delay in June last year. A total of 11 states allied with environmental groups to successfully challenge this rollback.
“Again and again, the Trump EPA has tried to push through policies that jeopardize our health and fly in the face of the law – and again and again, we’ve taken them to court and won,” said Barbara Underwood, attorney general of New York, a state that has fought the EPA on the chemical rule and a host of other environmental issues.
“This is a victory first and foremost for the neighborhoods most susceptible to dangerous and toxic chemical releases,” said Andrew Rosenberg, director of the center for science and democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “Families who live under the shadows of chemical facilities deserve safer practices to prevent future disasters.”
The loss for the Trump administration’s EPA is the third such setback for the agency in a week. On Thursday, a judge ruled that the administration had improperly attempted to delay clean water protections that Trump had called “horrible”.
This followed another defeat in which the EPA was ordered properly to address the dangers posed by chlorpyrifos, a toxic pesticide linked to brain damage in children.
EPA scientists had recommended a ban on the chemical, only to be overruled by Pruitt a few weeks after he met with Dow Chemical, the world’s largest manufacturer of chlorpyrifos. District judge Jed Rakoff said there “remains no justification for the EPA’s continued failure to respond to the pressing health concerns presented by chlorpyrifos”.
The state department has also fallen foul of the courts in its attempt to implement Trump’s agenda of sweeping away environmental rules and backing major fossil fuel projects. This week, a federal court ruled that the state department must conduct a more thorough environmental impact assessment in order to justify the construction of the controversial cross-border Canadian-US Keystone oil pipeline.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/17/epa-setback-court-chemical-safety-environment

As far as population goes, thankfully the EU still predominantly biases funding in female tertiary education despite every EU country except Germany having higher rates of female than male education. Why would they do that, apart from blind obedience to a false ideology? Probably population control. In UK 50% of women say they wouldn't date a man that earns less than them. Considering women are more highly educated than men, and in UK up to the age of 30 (just before child birth at 32 on average) women earn more than men, this means that most educated women either chose men that are poorer and less educated, or they remain unmarried/childless. A huge bias towards women in education and wealth is one of the best ways to control reproduction in both developing and developed countries, and you can see with native Swedes (where 2/3rds of graduates are women, yet somehow women haven't yet gained equality apparently) birth rates have crashed. Indeed Europe is depending on immigration, particularly populations from countries where female education is poor, to sustain populations...

Reality, that science study is not known to care about political ideology. 
It is a deep sorrow that the denial groups have made this question political (as if climate or the universe care about how free markeds are). 
I really want both the ""left"" and ""right"" of politics to help getting this issue under control. 
To accuse the ""left"" for being alone in providing ""leftist"" solutions is not an argument. The reason why the ""progressive"" is alone with solutions is just because the ""right/conservatives"", for obvious reasons, can not present solutions to stuff they do not acknowledge. 
Here is the thing - by 2050, the west (we who got rich by burning for centuries) should be zero emission (we have to give new states a bit longer to transit from third to first world - albeit not as long as we spent) 
So - what is the conservative/right policy to fix this problem of physical laws that came into existence almost 14 billion years earlier than modern political ideologies was invented? 
The only sollution I see these days is to deny the problem. That is not good enough. 
If the right wing ideology can not handle and respond to reality - we must sooner or later ask if it is needed. 
I think conservatism and ""right"" solutions can provide solutions to the challenge of going ""post-carbon"". But as the decades pass, the ideology seems to become ever more reactionary. In comparison Nixon and Reagen is looking like progressives in comparison with present. 
Some follower of the ""right"" ideology must think long and hard on how to reintroduce reality with the rooted ideology again. 
The right-wingers are very happy to talk about ""political correctness"". 
Any chance for someone speaking the science of AGW (the reality of physics and chemistry) to be elected leader on the right side now? Or is that not ""politically correct"" over at that side?

Science is expensive. So first scientists come together, usually in large groups. Then one outline the theoretical framework for their hypothesis. And they present even some empirical data in support of their idea. Based on what these scientists, being leading in their field, know. 
Then, these applications, being hundreds of pages long, filled with science, budgets, time-lines, analyses of expected findings and spin-offs are sent to national or international research funds - in direct competition with all the other applications from similar qualified research groups. Everyone knowing that at the high-end one have a 5-10% chance of getting the funding after 6-12 months of expert evaluation. 
This is brutal and free marked competition - heavily defined by the text defining what the funds want for the year. And the history of the involved scientists CVs and past project portfolios and impacts on the subject. 
All you have to do now is to get your PhD in magnetosphere physics - and get together with great scientists on stratospheric dynamics, and write out some dozens of peer reviewed and influential research papers demonstrating that the current earth-science understanding of solar wind/magnetic field/climate dynamics is seriously lacking in our understanding of how the global energy balance work.

This is the legal certification of genocide since Adani mining entails the destruction of cultural lands and their stories significant to the Wangan and Jagalingou Traditional Owners. This decision comes against a background of myriad failures of compliance to legal responsibilities throughout the globe by the Adani company, many of environmental contamination and reckless disregard for the consequences/impacts of their operations upon local communities. 
Should the Adani mine get the full go-ahead it will be a significant contributor to the climate change nightmare, acting as it does as a forerunner to other coal mining operations planned from Clive Palmer and Gina Rinehart. The Galilee Basin as a coal option future, a la Liberals of a Conservative Persuasion, would be one more if not the final nail in the coffin for global warming.

It’s notoriously hard to get the mainstream engaged by changes in the concentration of an atmospheric gas, even if they’re life-or-death matters. So hats off to the crack team of Earth scientists, led by climate change professor Will Steffen, whose peer-reviewed report on how emissions are driving the Earth into an irreversible hothouse state has been downloaded more than 270,000 times to date.
Wow. Academics are on holiday, so this means that people are probably reading this stuff on the beach. At this rate, the report could make the Altmetric Top 100. This is the list of the most discussed journal articles of the year and is usually dominated by research on grabby subjects such as the possibility of life on other planets, but definitely not emissions-generated feedback loops. Until now.
In a nutshell, the findings suggest that emissions drive climate changes that trigger abrupt changes to Earth systems when they cross certain thresholds. Ten of these feedback loops are identified in the report, including the release of methane trapped in Siberian permafrost and the impact of melting ice in Greenland on the Antarctic. They essentially switch from “friends” that store carbon to “foes” that belch more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and raise the temperature. The researchers describe these “tipping elements” as falling dominoes, a chaotic cascade that flips the Earth into a new way of operating that is not predictable.
Not only is this complex science, but it’s scary as hell. And it goes against received wisdom about climate change communication – that you must dress up like a clown to talk about it or put stuff into animations and make everything super-relatable and friendly to attract people.
Apparently, we can handle a frightening degree of complexity. So why not go the whole hog? Let’s talk about the real title of the report (barely mentioned) – Trajectories of the Earth System in the Anthropocene. OK, on first reading, it’s a little dry, but what we’re talking here is the fact that we’ve exerted such an impact on planetary processes that we humans have become a geological force in our own right. We’ve propelled ourselves out of the Holocene, where we experienced friendly conditions for 12,000 years, and have dumped ourselves in a new geological era, the Anthropocene, where conditions are likely to be bad news.
We. Shifted. Geological. Epoch. Subjected day after day to internecine wrangling over Brexit (a smaller, human-caused transition), surely this very hard exit merits some attention?

By dumping the commitment to take emissions targets to the federal parliament the PM is signalling climate change is not real. This leaves the rest of us paying the price for another political capitulation on cleaning up our power sector.
Some parts of the government don’t believe in climate change. Their ideological ties to the coal-based power systems built 40 to 50 years ago has scuttled every attempt to develop credible climate change energy policy over the past 10 years, leaving us where we are now.
In the real world, climate change continues. We look out our windows or watch our TV screens and see droughts spreading, bushfires raging and heatwaves becoming more and more extreme.
In the boardrooms of power companies, directors see new renewable energy capacity outstripping investments in fossil fuels on a global scale. In 2017 new global capacity in solar photovoltaic (PV) alone exceeded new capacity of coal, gas and nuclear energy combined. These same investors understand that the cost of clean energy is falling dramatically. Even here in Australia, renewable energy is now the cheapest form of new power generation, despite what the coal lobby might say.
Investors are also aware that it is only Trump’s America that has threatened to withdraw from the Paris agreement on climate change. Other major emitters continue to move forward: China, India and the European Union are on track to meet their Paris commitments early and overachieve them by a significant margin.
In short, if you were a private investor in the power sector you would be sacked for spending billions of dollars on new electricity capacity under the assumption that climate change did not exist and that renewable energy was not the cheapest form of new generation.
This is what our prime minister on Monday asked power sector investors to do: to throw out good due diligence and hope that the fantasies being propagated of the hard-right rump of government become reality. Ridiculous.
As a result of Turnbull’s proposal, companies will continue to face higher financing costs for new electricity projects as investors charge them a premium to insure against changes in policy. Old, crumbling power stations will stay open longer, increasing the risk of abrupt closures and equipment malfunctions, making our power system less reliable. Power prices and pollution will be higher than they need to be.
This is not a new story. In 2007 John Howard’s support for an emissions trading scheme was informed by analysis that showed that policy uncertainty would cost consumers $2bn to $4bn due to high power prices. Similar analysis was performed as part of the development of the Gillard government’s clean energy future package. Most recently, the chief scientist’s review of energy policy last year identified that the lack of a plan to deal with climate change was costing consumers and undermining reliable electricity supply. How many times do we need to be told?
With a plan to cut emissions the national energy guarantee might have achieved the holy grail in energy and climate policy. With the right emissions target, it could unlock billions of dollars in clean energy investment. The mechanism would see energy companies forced to favour clean sources of power over dirty ones and allow investors in the power sector to plan and invest in replacing our ageing and inefficient coal fired power stations.
While it is not a perfect policy (none ever are), until Monday, it fundamentally recognised that you can’t have an energy policy without a plan to reduce emissions. No longer. As the prime minister said just a week ago we know “very well what happens when you allow ideology and idiocy to take charge of energy policy.” Well, that is what just happened (again).

Amid outcry from activists and a promise to sue from the attorney general of New York, one prominent environmentalist called the plan “a disaster for public health and the climate”.
The proposal, crafted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), dismantles Barack Obama’s signature climate change policy and replaces it with a system that relies on states to come up with ways to make power plants more efficient.
“The era of top-down, one-size-fits-all federal mandates is over,” said Andrew Wheeler, acting EPA administrator.
The new approach is expected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants by up to 1.5% by 2030, the EPA said, should all states implement effective plans.
That is well below the 32% reduction target by 2030, from 2005 levels, set by Obama’s clean power plan. The Trump administration said the reductions would be “comparable” due to changes in the energy market.
Easing the pressure on industry will bolster coal’s fortunes over the next decade, compared with the clean power plan, as well as slightly reducing electricity prices.
It will also result in the release of more soot and smog-forming chemicals that will kill up to 1,400 Americans a year by 2030, EPA documents show. It will also cause an extra 40,000 cases of worsening asthma and 60,000 lost school days by 2030.
An analysis by the EPA last year showed the clean power plan would prevent about 4,500 premature deaths a year by 2030.
Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist, said there were “very aggressive” programs to ensure Americans are not harmed by air pollution, adding that the Obama policy was an “overreach” that exceeded EPA authority.
Environmentalists immediately called the new plan the “dirty power scam”. Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, said: “Trump’s latest scheme to bail out the coal industry is a disaster for public health and the climate.”
The clean power plan set the first national US pollution limits on coal plants but has never come into force, after a coalition of states challenged it in court. In 2016, the US supreme court paused the plan ahead of legal arguments.
The plan was the centerpiece in an effort to lower emissions and help meet international climate change goals set out in the Paris agreement, which Trump has pledged to leave.
Barbara Underwood, attorney general of New York, promised to sue the federal government should the new EPA plan be enacted.
“Climate change is real, no matter how much this administration tries to deny it,” she said. “We need strong, immediate action to drastically cut climate change pollution and promote affordable, clean and sustainable energy – not foot dragging and backtracking that seeks to prop up dirty, expensive power plants.”
The new plan would put the “health of all Americans at risk, and especially those who are most vulnerable, including children, older adults and people with asthma and heart disease”, said Harold Wimmer, president of the American Lung Association.
The coal industry welcomed the move, which follows attempts by the Trump administration to pare back emissions standards for vehicles and throw open more of America’s lands and waters to mining and drilling.
Hal Quinn, president of the National Mining Association, said: “The policy put forward by the previous administration was an illegal attempt to impose a political agenda on the country’s power system.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/20/trump-coal-emissions-power-plants-rules-obama

The mechanics of neo-liberalism are privatisation, outsourcing, offshoring. All focused on turning once publicly owned entities into private owned. And the only rationale for a company to possess a public utility is to make profit out of it. So all this waffle about blaming renewables for higher prices is just that - waffle. As long as energy delivery is in the hands of the private sector prices will never drop, due to the ever increasing demand for profit, and them having a controlling monopoly over an essential utility. And since any effort by government to reign in electricity prices runs counter to their ideology of having the (rigged) markets dictate price, it invariably falls flat, resulting in greater community outrage and backlash in the polls.
Secondly, the vested interest. The LNP/IPA neo-conservatives by their nature adhere, serve and protect the existing hierarchy. And one of the most powerful hierarchys in Australia is the mining sector. And one thing the mining sector sees as a threat to it's profits is renewable energy. Why? Well, it's simple.Boiled down, there's only four reasons why you dig something out of the ground. To make something out of it. (Iron ore)The thing itself is used as a measure of value. (Gold, diamonds)To use it as a form of energy.(Oil, gas, coal, uranium)A combination of two or three of the above.All of these provide the wealth to mining companies. (A no-brainer). Accepting the science of climate change, and agreeing to lessen fossil fuel emissions by adopting renewable energy, these actions target one of the major facets of wealth creation by the mining companies.And they're not going to allow that.So, they unleash their considerable forces to ensure that a strategic energy policy for Australia remains in limbo, or moves to embrace more fossil fuel-based energy sources.Lobbyist groups (MCA, BCA, IPA, AIG, ACCI). The corporate media. Right-wing politicians (Abbott, Canavan, etc.)And they will bring down anyone who dare's threaten the prevailing status quo - and the future of the country and the environment be damned.
So while we all enjoy the farcical merry-go-round of changing PM's and governments, the fact is that until the power and influence of neo-liberal ideology and mining's vested interests are challenged, Australia's longest running political joke (climate change/energy policy) will continue to be played on us, the gullible Australian citizen.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1535428125000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'the ever increasing demand for profit', u'effect': u'as long as energy delivery is in the hands of the private sector prices will never drop and them having a controlling monopoly over an essential utility'}, {u'cause': None, u'effect': u'greater community outrage and backlash in the polls'}], u'author_id': u'17696823', u'id': u'119842411', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Dan Jugovic', u'text': u'Well you might.

It is partly a reflection on those of us who want more action to cut emissions. The political events over the last week have again reinforced the need for business and civil society to work with and strengthen the moderates in the Liberal party to deliver more effective long-term climate action.
The more conservative parts of the Coalition have made a public sport of railing against any action on climate change. Having spent time talking to the Coalition membership base, I can understand why the people in the party who want action on climate change struggle so much. The deep ideological views of some conservatives will never be bridged by any logical or rational argument. 
However, in the long-term this is not the core issue. To deliver an effective and enduring centre-right policy on climate change, we cannot simply bludgeon the more conservative parts of the Coalition into submission. We need to bring the moderate parts of the party closer to where most Australians and business have already arrived.
In June, the Lowy Institute released their annual poll on community attitudes, which found that around 60% of the population agreed that global warming is a serious problem and we should begin taking immediate action even if it involves significant costs. This number of Australians holding this view has risen over 20 percent points since 2012. Similarly, even with the Coalition’s scare campaigns on renewable energy, Lowy also found over the last year support for renewables has increased (and support for coal has decreased). 
Mainstream business also knows that investment in new coal plants in Australia, without a $25-$45 billion subsidy from the government, will not happen. Even with a subsidy on this scale, mainstream investors are unlikely to touch a new coal plant with a barge pole.
We cannot simply bludgeon the more conservative parts of the Coalition into submission
This reflects the growing mood of global capital. In 2017, global investment in renewable energy easily outstripped investment in coal, gas and nuclear power combined. Early this year, nearly 300 investors with nearly US$30tn in assets under management, began to engage with the companies they own to improve governance on climate change, curb pollution and strengthen climate-related financial disclosures. These investors manage capital equivalent to 25 times the size of the Australian economy.
Fueled by community experience of growing drought, bushfires and heatwaves it is clear that attitudes toward climate action are also changing on the ground. The recent concern about climate change and the benefits of renewable energy voiced by the farming community is already having an impact on the positioning on parts of the National Party. 
Despite all this, the majority of moderate Liberals still remain largely silent at best (though earlier in the year Josh Frydenberg did point out to his colleagues that we live in a carbon constrained world). At worst, these moderates simply mimic the language of the more conservative factions of the party.
A deep understanding of the implications of failing to address climate change has not penetrated the Liberal party. In the electricity sector the costs of inaction are acute, but it is just the tip of the iceberg. Whether it is our response to drought or other climate extremes through to the trade implications of not doing our part under the Paris agreement, climate change will impact all of our lives in a very profound way. 
Those of us who want strong climate action need to work more with the moderates so their positions better reflect what both the broader community and informed business want on this issue. 
Assuming a real generational change can occur in the Liberal party, the results of last week are an opportunity to address this. This does not mean we don’t hold them to account for weak and damaging policies, but it does also mean we need to work harder with the moderates to build their power in the party so we can have a lasting and durable approach to climate action in this country.

As Scott Morrison and his special drought envoy, Barnaby Joyce, toured south-west Queensland on Tuesday, Finlay described the former deputy prime minister and agriculture minister as the last in a long line of ministers who had “no real appetite” for national drought policy in a changing climate.
“Climate change and connectivity are the two biggest issues facing the bush. Climate change is real and we have to have a national drought policy framed on what we know about climate change – the two are interlinked,” Finlay told Guardian Australia.
“Instead of jumping in front of the cameras when a drought is on, we need them to do the grunt work on effective financial measures that allow our farmers to build up cash reserves in the good times to draw upon when the dry comes again.”
He also called on governments to start rewarding good farmers who prepare for drought rather than the “less efficient” farmers.
Finlay said politics had caused a failure of a national drought policy which should apply some structure to how farmers cope in drought and the nature of government assistance.
“I went to Labor and the Coalition in 2013 when nowhere in Australia was in drought,” Finlay said. “The Labor government had dropped the exceptional circumstances funding program and I made the comment, this is gone now, what is the national drought policy?
“Labor said they would do a policy before the 2013 election. [Former Coalition agriculture shadow spokesman] John Cobb said there would be something on drought. When Barnaby was appointed, he said it will be in the agriculture white paper. It was not there.
Building a national drought policy “always seemed too hard”, he said.
The white paper did not include climate change in its terms of reference and the NFF was not consulted on those terms.
Finlay would like to see drought treated as a new category in natural disaster arrangements to embed a structural mechanism beyond the politics of the day. Dry spells could then be monitored using data from the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology and when the outlook turned towards drought, conditional government assistance that rewarded good managers would kick in.
“Farmers acknowledge drought is a regular part of agriculture and with climate change we will potentially see more and more and that’s what we need,” he said.
“The climate is changing, you can see it in the eyes of farmers who dismissed it as rubbish eight years ago. By recognising climate change, it is empowering resources to support agriculture.”
He would like to see a permanent drought commissioner placed in the prime minister’s office to be proactive on policy development and climate monitoring. This would be a significant move, as it would place the commissioner out of the hands of the agriculture minister, who is a National party minister in any Coalition government.
“The permanent drought commissioner needs to be in PMO, we need to keep it at arms length from those politicians that feel they are directly effected. If it’s in PMO and hopefully its bipartisan, it elevates the management of the position.”
Finlay was president of the National Farmers Federation for three years from 2013, coinciding with the last months of the Gillard-Rudd Labor government and Barnaby Joyce’s first three years as agriculture minister. He was also chair of the NFF’s national drought committee.
Finlay said the government should put all ideas on the table to change the thinking on drought policy towards a model that rewarded good farm managers.
“It’s not going to make me popular to say it but unfortunately current drought assistance measures reward our less efficient farming operators at the expense of those families who’ve been better prepared for drought.
“You’ve only got to look at our current weather patterns to know that climate change is real and we should expect more extreme weather including more droughts in the future.”

Car companies have legally gamed official tests of fuel economy for many years by, for example, using very hard tyres during tests or taking out equipment to make cars lighter. The gap between test and actual performance has soared from 9% in 2000 to 42% today.
Analysts at research and campaign group Transport &amp; Environment have now calculated that this difference cost motorists in Europe €150bn (£136bn) in extra fuel between 2000 and 2017. UK drivers paid €3.5bn more in 2017 alone, and a total of €24bn since 2000.
A new more realistic lab test is now in place but the European commission uncovered new evidence in July that this was also being gamed by carmakers. This means the increases in fuel efficiency being demanded by the EU as part of its action on climate change are still being undermined and drivers will continue to use more fuel than policymakers intend.
Greg Archer, at Transport &amp; Environment, said carmakers’ claims of big improvements in fuel consumption are illusory: “Despite regulations to reduce emissions, there has been no real-world improvement in CO2 emissions for five years and just a 10% improvement since 2000 – far less than the industry like to claim. The victims are citizens that have paid out €150bn for more fuel and are also suffering the consequences of unchecked climate change.”
A spokeswoman for the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) said: “It is a matter of fact that technological improvements to new cars have resulted in major CO2 reductions in the past decades, leading to important savings for consumers.”
Until recently, all cars underwent a lab-based fuel efficiency test called NEDC. But legal loopholes allowed manufacturers to produce much lower emissions in the tests than on the road, thereby undermining an EU drive towards lower carbon emissions and more economical motoring.
Some discrepancy between a standardised test and real world driving is expected, so the Transport &amp; Environment calculations used the 9% gap in 2000 as a starting point. It then worked out how much less fuel drivers in Europe would have needed if that gap had remained constant, rather than rising to 42%. As well as costing motorists more, the gap means CO2 emissions from cars were 47m tonnes more than intended by the regulations in 2017 alone.
A new more rigorous test, called WLTP, applies to all new cars sold from September 2018 and it is far more reflective of real world driving, being longer and involving faster accelerations. It also eliminates some of the test loopholes.
However, the European commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) found evidence that car makers were still gaming the new test, although in an unexpected way – to report higher emissions. The rationale for this is that the new WLTP will be used as a baseline for the 15% CO2 reductions proposed by the commission for cars by 2025.
Tactics used were starting tests with a depleted battery, meaning more fuel was used to charge it up, and switching up gears more slowly, so the engine speed was faster for longer. These inflated the results by 4.5% on average and up to 13% for some vehicles, the JRC said. Transport &amp; Environment said the gaming could mean carmakers have to deliver just half the emissions reductions intended.
“ACEA fully agrees that CO2 values should not be artificially increased on purpose in any way that would undermine the post-2020 CO2 targets,” the spokeswoman said, adding that the issue “is not an industry-wide problem”. All companies should ensure future CO2 reductions are not delivered by optimisation of the testing procedure, she said.
A separate report from the UK’s RAC Foundation has found that tens of thousands of popular cars will be unable to use a new fuel that may be introduced to cut carbon emissions. Regular petrol already contains 5% bioethanol, which is produced from plants, but ministers are proposing to increase that to 10%.
However, 634,000 cars would be incompatible with E10 fuel by 2020, according to the analysis. Many are vintage vehicles but some are popular family cars, including 28,000 VW Golfs and 16,000 Nissan Micras. A current government consultation suggests that larger garages offering E10 in future must also offer standard E5 as well.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/29/carmakers-gaming-of-emissions-tests-costing-drivers-billions

1./ Other than by small scale exception, Lazards does not show renewables, as a group[, as cheaper than nuclear.2./ No offshore wind costs3./ LCOE does not include intermittency externalities of storage, DSM and gas or for that matter, the costs of expanding and strengthening the grid to accommodate power slews from state to state.
n.b. [i] Geothermal, like hydro is geographically dependent and so it is not an alternative other than in very specific locations.

BQENDThe video does not say what you claim.
Interesting examples of what RMI says is a good European practice-It completely ignores the France, Sweden and the UK (who are almost entirely off coal and developing renewables+nuclear.RMI's example of Germany is a country that is opening new coal plants to balance coming off coal - despite a massive build out of renewables their emissions have remained fairly static and it has no date to come off coal.Same with Spain and Denmark.
Theses are not good examples.

And the mentioned alternatives already exist, e.g. the smart charging of electrified autos and flexible demand Amory Lovins refers to..
BQENDSadly the grid does not work that way.
That's DSM (Demand Side Management) and he wafts away low capacity factors as if they are unimportant.High intermittency=storage and gas.With regard to DSM, it is a very useful tool, but any power on the demand side (distribution) side of the grid is unavailable to the rest of the grid other than as a nominal and local demand reduction ... and therefore it is of limited use.Electricity from your domestic pv or inverted from your car cannot go uphill of your street transformer other than as a demand reduction hence the necessity for supply (grid) side production and storage.
Read the small print of any proposal like Jacobson or Lovins and you'll see an awful lot of gas backup, multiple iterations of ""if"" and reams of fudged assumptions in the background.For example, which cars will provide storage at peak demand when all those cars get home and plug in to their chargers?Humans just don't operate that way - most people will want to plug in a for full charge - not to come out and find the car's lost 30% of it's stored power.
At the end of the day, the simple fact is that a grid cannot operate on averages - and with all due respects to Mr Lovins, the primary objective isn't to cut nuclear, it's to cut emissions.

That means gas backup - and the objective is to cut emissions.
You can see for yourself-Using any price you like for nuclear, which of these is cheapest to the consumer/tax payer.Sufficient nuclear for 1GW constant/dispatchable supply - OR solar (cf 10%) and wind [cf 39% ] with sufficient storage to run all the time with no gas backup other than for emergencies.

By paying for a 100% renewable source my county is moving that grid-wide mixture towards 100% renewable for everyone. There is no hype or deceit involved: that's what everyone understands it means for any one consumer (or group of consumers) to be 100% renewable -- which suppliers are getting paid by me to produce the quantity of electricity I use, regardless of how individual electrical impulses are sliced and diced across the grid.

No. Doesn't explain anything about our homeless problem.
1) Domestic violence laws may be different between the two nations. Here in California, IF police are called to a ""situation"", one of the two parties involved is going to jail. And that's usually the man. That's takes care of the immediate need for a woman and children to flee a violent relationship.2) We have a pretty good support system for battered women with shelters available for those who need to get out of a bad relationship. I've yet to see, or even hear of, a woman and children homeless in the typical sense of the word on account of a domestic violence issue.3) The homeless we often see on the street with a combination of addiction, alcoholism, mental illness, and criminality can not survive in a public housing scenario. They need to be institutionalized. And absent a conviction for a crime that puts them in jail we don't forcibly institutionalize. And while the result is messy and ugly I agree with that approach. Freedom and independence means something. Even to those without the skills and maturity to fully deserve it.4) When you've been into a ""home"" that has been occupied by addicts and observe empty beverage containers overflowing the toilet and piles of shit elsewhere in the house you'd get the picture that without outside, 3rd party, intervention to perform the basics of cleanup and hygiene there is a set of the homeless would turn housing into the a pigpen and soon be living in indoor conditions as nasty as the ones they inhabit outdoors.5) Canada has far more accessible medical services than the US. But spend a little time in downtown Vancouver and you'd soon conclude that the Vancouver homeless are in far worse shape than the Seattle homeless just three hours to the south in the land of supposedly inaccessible medical and social services. Figure that one out.6) My son who is a cop has repeatedly picked up homeless off the street in bad physical condition and transported them to emergency care. Where without question they get at least the basics of care when necessary. Not once has the hospital ever refused to treat a person delivered by police.7) the city where he works has a policy of providing free bus tickets back to the city of choice of the homeless. Few take the offer. Most say, ""I've worn out my welcome"".8) In the city I live the homeless we see are mostly white and black. Almost no Asian or Mexican. While there are any number of reasons for that anecdotal statistic, the stories I get from the Mexican community is that they mostly ""take care of their own"".

While nighttime temperatures where I live can get down to 7 degrees C almost every winter, our winters are dry and crisp and with daybreak comes warm sunshine. Our rain falls in summer and during the rainy season in the inner city suburbs of Brisbane the homeless set themselves up in roofed picnic shelters along the rainforest lined creeks. There are overnight shelters no more than a kilometre away but that shelter is often full and people are turned away.
While my partner had experience organising shelter for women and children made homeless by domestic violence and my daughter when working for the Minister for Public housing organised a Housing Department unit for a bloke who'd become a local identity while living for years in a large rainforest fig tree at a busy inner city intersection, my short experience with the homeless occurred while scoping rat control. The homeless people I met and talked to public parks were often suffering from mental health problems and sometimes self medicating to the point of addiction. They did appreciate the presence of and looked after the rat bait stations I set up near them.
One well known homeless person who lived in the inner city area was from a well off family with family that could have looked after him but chose a life on the streets for reason also probably associated with mental health. He took good care of the rat bait stations when he was living on a busy intersection. Later after being harassed he moved down the road to a local park under some large American Swamp Cypress.

Lastly, Marcott's paper doesnt resolve down to lower than 30 years as you can probably see - so variability in the modern instrument record is much greater than Marcott's Holocene reconstruction.

Absolutely amazing that so many people want agriculture to either go away, or cease to use irrigation.
I like current California law that gives water right priority to agriculture. It is the right way to deal with this issue.
Until the population gets comfortable with a waterless urinal in every restroom-we're not going to touch agriculture.

BQENDOften claimed, never substantiated.
So okay, using any price you like for nuclear, which of these is cheapest to the consumer/tax payer.Sufficient nuclear for 1GW constant/dispatchable supply - OR solar (cf 10%) and wind [cf 39% ] with sufficient storage to run all the time with no gas backup other than for emergencies.

I'm out of the office frequently and many of my clients are in areas frequented by homeless. I have homeless temporarily living in RV's along my residential street.
My son, who's a local cop, reports that about 80% of the calls for service from citizens to the police dispatch have something to do with a homeless individual.
The media want us to only hear the part about the homeless being such on account of rising rents and stagnant wages. There is truth to that. But its only a small part of the story. At least around here there are enough social services available so that no individual, homeless on account of the ""media vetted"" reasons for homelessness, actually need go without shelter.
The homeless you see here on the street are very much the product of addictions, alcoholism, mental illness, and criminality. And in many cases all of the above wrapped up in one individual.
There is a very small subset of the homeless who are retirees, and veterans who do receive monthly pension checks and have chosen to live on the street ""rent free"". They have all the money they need for food and clothing. But maybe not quite enough for rent. And they're content to live in a tent under the bridge.
Its reasonable to ask why the mentally ill are on the street. Simple: we no longer condone long-term involuntary incarceration for the mentally ill absent a criminal conviction.
Its also reasonable to ask why this subset of addicted, alcoholic, mentally ill, and criminal homeless aren't housed in shelters. There are shelters available. But I've yet to see one that didn't prohibit drug and alcohol use or weapons. Many of the homeless are unwilling to give up those few remaining things in their life. So they won't go.
A couple of andecdotes for you: Police were called by a woman concerned that her mentally ill boyfriend might harm her during his ""spell"" that led to him kicking the windows out of their car/home/hotel in the middle of a rainy night. Police ended up taking him into the hospital for a 72-hour psyc hold where he get put back on his meds. Ultimately it turned out that in addition to being mentally ill, he was a meth addict and was a registered sex offender on account of prior conviction for pedophilia. Easier to live on the street than to face the humiliation of being run out of neighborhoods and jobs on account of that criminal conviction.
Another incident involved passer-bys calling police on account of the erratic behavior of an older paranoid schizophrenic hoarder living in a tent under the bridge. It was again a case of ""going off his meds"". In the process of patting him down to ensure they didn't transport him into the hospital with weapons or dirty needles they found more than $900 in cash. He receives a monthly disability check that he cashes regularly at the nearby bank.

And yet :
More UK electricity was produced by wind and solar sources last year than by nuclear power stations, for the first time according to the latest government figures.andBritain’s heatwave has helped break several solar power-generation records, and over the weekend the renewable energy source briefly eclipsed gas power stations as the UK’s top source of electricity.
I'm not saying we don't need storage, of course. But renewables can make further inroads into fossil fuel generation before the intermittency becomes too expensive. And we can also develop smart demand management capabilities to more closely match demand to supply; we have interconnectors.... we need to use the whole mix of these tools to decarbonise our generation.

It's already the warmest it's been for hundreds of thousands of years. We passed the warmest Holocene temperature decades ago.
Do keep up!

Marcott 2013 seems to conflict with your statement below. Which one is wrong, you or Marcott 2013 ?
BQEND
Neither. If you read the entire paper and not the cherry-picked quote, or look at the pictures if that's more your level, you'll see that it's not as much a win for your side as you think. In fact it's condemnatory to your claims.
As you're no doubt aware, Marcott was so misrepresented at the time by deniers that the authors felt obliged to write a clarification and rebuttal at RealClimate. Aren't you ashamed of the company you keep? Misrepresenting honest scientists to the extent that they have to publish a rebuttal?
Still, thanks for giving me the opportunity to point out to passers-by that excellent RC resource, and to remind them of the consistent duplicity of the denialati.
From RC's intro (my bold), which I presume Marcott et al. didn't object to because it's still there above their own text.
BQSTART
Our view is that the results of the paper will stand the test of time, particularly regarding the small global temperature variations in the Holocene. If anything, early Holocene warmth might be overestimated in this study.

You should also visit the three Tamino posts referenced there. Since you appear to be having difficulty learning much from your climate science lectures, perhaps you'd do better reading rather than listening. You can repeatedly go over the parts you don't understand, a concession that the lecturer can't really allow as she has a schedule to keep.
Also, Marcott was published almost five years ago, using data to 2009, almost a decade out-of-date. Conveniently for you, within the faux ""pause"". Funny you should pick that one. Wonder why? Inconveniently for you, we have a decade's more data, which of course has blown the ""pause"" out of the water.

Now ponder why the private companies in the US that used to build reactors for the US military 50 years ago is not on the marked now to battle solar panels? 
My bet - the military making them great bombs are not paying for the reactors any longer. So you alone have to pay for the cost. 
Maybe we have to pay that cost of energy to avoid emissions as private customers. That is worth pondering with wanting zero tax that paid for them bombs and the cheap solution as a way to pay back the taxes. 
I do not think it works now. Even USA did not bomb nuclear since 1945. Nuclear is actually not competitive in the marked. And thus it is not a sollution.

Let nuclear exhale - it will save money on your energy bill.

The bill, which will need to be approved by the state senate and Governor Jerry Brown, will require a complete shift to clean energy such as solar and wind by 2045. It would also demand that electric utilities source 60% of their power from renewable sources by 2030, up from the current target of 50%.
California ridding itself entirely of carbon-intensive energy has been a politically vexed proposition for the past two years, with state Republicans arguing it was unfeasible and would drive up electricity prices.
But the state has emerged as a bastion of defiance to the Trump administration on climate change, among other issues, as it has been scorched by record wildfires and a prolonged drought. A report released this week warned that the state is on course for punishing heatwaves, thousands of additional deaths and the erosion of two thirds of its coastline due to rising temperatures, wildfires and sea level rise. 
Brown has already set out ambitious goals to expand renewables and the use of electric cars. The state legislature has already passed a law that requires newly built homes to be equipped for solar power. In July, the state announced its greenhouse gas emissions were lower than in 1990, despite a growing economy.
The bill to go 100% renewable energy was authored by state senator Kevin de Leon, who called it a “victory for clean air. It’s a victory to tackle climate change and the devastation that it’s leaving in its wake.”
Brown has yet to confirm he will sign the bill his predecessor as governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, wrote to lawmakers to back the legislation and urge them to be “undeterred by those who wish to stop our progress and move backwards”.
California becomes the second US state, after Hawaii, to call for carbon-free electricity by 2045. The clout of the Californian economy could help spur some other states, such as Massachusetts and New Jersey, to do the same.
Environmentalists hailed the vote as a landmark moment.
“This is a pivotal moment for California, for the country, and the world,” said Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club. 
“California is showing the world that moving to 100% clean energy is within our reach and what bold climate leadership looks like in the face of a Trump administration.”
California currently sources around a third of its electricity from clean sources. Opponents of the 100% renewable bill warned that electricity prices would go up if the state relied too heavily upon intermittent solar and wind before energy storage improves.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/29/california-electricity-fossil-fuels-wind-solar-vote

It is better not to assume things.
According to the elliptical variations in the Earth’s orbit (a set of cycles with overall cycle times of hundreds of thousands of years) the Earth should be in a slow cooling pattern. According to the other two Milankovitch Cycles (Axial Tilt and Precession, with cycle times of 41,000 and 22,000 years) the Earth should also be slowly cooling because we were heading into the next glaciation, and until about a hundred years ago this was the prevailing pattern.
For the six thousand years leading up to the Industrial Revolution the pattern was slow cooling at an average rate of about 0.2 degrees C per millennium. There were ups and downs due to changes in ocean currents and solar output, but at most those changes were around 0.1 degree C per century and after five or six hundred years the average global temps returned to the cooling trend. (Graph of the last 20,000 years of global temperature) 
In the last hundred years we have seen global temperatures climb just over a full degree C with the majority of that increase in the last forty years.

See, this is great. Facts again. No name-calling. No politics. Much more interesting to me.
As for myself, I've always assumed the earth has been warming since the last glacial period, and that this warming has been hastened artificially by man's CO2 contributions in recent decades. But I've never delved into the actual scientific mechanisms that are making this come to pass. I've read bits and pieces here and there (I think I read somewhere that if all the ice in the world melted, the seas would rise something like 70M and that if ALL the Greenland ice sheet were to melt at once, the seas all over the world would rise over 7M.)That's why I find comments such as yours so interesting, especially when you include links to charts and stats.
I've read how ice sheets form (seawater condenses and falls on the northern/southern land masses in the form of snow which never really melts away, though it does melt somewhat and then refreezes) but always there is presented information about something called glacial rebound which I don't understand. It seems to be something that slows down the actual rise of the oceans when glaciers melt.

So a few serious questions. Do think human beings are supernatural beings isolated from reality, and the biosphere, above the laws of physics? Do you think we're special in the world, and our actions have no impact on it and therefore us? i.e. climate change, pollution etc. Do you think that we are immune to a potential increase of emissions of chemicals which might occur due to lax regulations? Do you think the earth has infinite resources and that we can consume without any consequence or end point?

Overt and blatant disrespect for the rule of law is a fundamental fact of Trump and his enablers. Such disrespect is on daily display and impossible to miss.

I said that California would have to sue the Federal Government because the waiver was a federal regulation that the Federal EPA was now proposing to eliminate. My statement was a response to your comment which asked why would the Feds ""take California to court"" on this issue. I also provided a citation to support my statement.
I said nothing about whether this arrangement was just, right, proper, or the exact opposite. I made no claims about constitutional authority or about federal and state powers more generally. I specifically did not say anything about constitutional authority in relation to vehicle emissions regulations.
I do not have time to respond to your entire post. However, I strongly object to your statement ""The power of federal elected and appointed officials is derived from tax revenue."" To the extent that officials at every level of American government have been bought and paid for, those who purchase their services do indeed exchange money for power. Though votes, souls, and just about everything else as well may be for sale, it is my current understanding that such payments are not typically settled through taxes collected by the IRS.
But much more importantly, as a theoretical and constitutional matter, the power of the Executive Branch of the US Government is absolutely NOT derived from tax revenue. As set forth in the Preamble to the US Constitution, power in our system of government is ultimately derived from only one source:
""We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.""', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1533445037000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'the waiver was a federal regulation that the federal epa was now proposing to eliminate', u'effect': u'that california would have to sue the federal government'}], u'author_id': u'3837803', u'in_reply_to': u'119065888', u'id': u'119097336', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'jon donahue', u'text': u'In 2026... if it doesnt't get 46 mph, not in my garage.By then, we can buy a Prius at 70 mpg... or an all-electric car.why buy another piece of outdated junk?', u'recommendation_count': u'4', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1533438071000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'18071473', u'id': u'119096653', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'WillisFitnurbut', u'text': u'BQSTART

In one of its most significant efforts yet to curtail policies designed to address climate change, the Environmental Protection Agency has proposed freezing fuel efficiency standards at 2020 levels, removing the requirement that cars and light trucks be able to travel more than 46 miles per gallon of fuel by 2026. The 2020 standard would be around 32 miles per gallon. 
The reversal of an Obama-era deal with automakers in 2012 will also withdraw a waiver California has under the Clean Air Act to exceed the national standards by requiring even more efficient cars. A dozen other states and Washington DC also follow higher standards.
The EPA said it wants a “50-state fuel economy” system and has claimed the reversal will have “negligible environmental impacts on air quality” and even result in thousands fewer deaths on the roads each year. The administration’s assertion that lighter, more fuel efficient cars are more dangerous has been disputed by transport experts.
“We are delivering on President Trump’s promise to the American public that his administration would address and fix the current fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions standards,” said Andrew Wheeler, the EPA’s acting administrator. 
“Our proposal aims to strike the right regulatory balance based on the most recent information and create a 50-state solution that will enable more Americans to afford newer, safer vehicles that pollute less. More realistic standards can save lives while continuing to improve the environment.”
The rollback has provoked outcry from environmental and health groups, as well as states who are pushing for cleaner vehicle fleets. States that have followed California’s emissions standard immediately said they will sue the EPA should the new rule be finalized. 
It’s an attack on the climate, consumers, state governments and the future viability of America’s auto industry
“The administration’s proposal to weaken these rules will cause the American people to breathe dirtier air and pay higher prices at the pump,” said a joint statement from attorneys general from the states, including New York, Virginia and North Carolina. “We are prepared to go to court to put the brakes on this reckless and illegal plan.”
California’s response has been stinging. Xavier Becerra, the state’s attorney general, said the Trump administration had “launched a brazen attack” on California which he would fight in the courts.
Jerry Brown, California’s governor, said the EPA’s move was “reckless” and a “betrayal”. Brown added: “California will fight this stupidity in every conceivable way possible.”
Transport has become the largest sector source of greenhouse gas emissions in the US, as cheap fuel has encouraged Americans to buy larger vehicles such as SUVs. In announcing the new standards in 2012, the Obama administration said the stricter rules would save around 6bn tons of greenhouse gases by 2026, as well as save Americans $1.7tn in fuel costs. 
Gina McCarthy, the EPA administrator under Obama, said the reversal of these standards “run contrary to sound science and the law”.
While many carmakers have touted their development of more efficient cars, including electric vehicles, auto lobbyists were quick to get assurances from the Trump administration that the more stringent rules would be dismantled.
The Union of Concerned Scientists said the rollback is “completely unacceptable”. Its analysis shows the Trump administration’s new regime for vehicles would result in an additional 120m tons of carbon emissions by 2030 – the equivalent of running 30 coal-fired power plants for a year. 
“It’s an attack on the climate, consumers, state governments and the future viability of America’s auto industry,” said Ken Kimmell, president of UCS. “The Trump administration has decided to force America’s drivers to spend more at the gas pump, burn millions more barrels of oil, and put us on a path to greater harm from climate change.
“The administration’s proposal goes beyond a simple rollback. This is a demolition, and there’s no scientific or technological justification for it.”
Fuel efficiency standards were first introduced in 1975 and are estimated to have saved Americans more than $2tn in fuel costs since then. Some automakers and conservative critics, however, have opposed ever-increasing standards as a costly burden on industry that runs contrary to consumer demand.

Experts said that an increase in deaths is fully expected during heatwaves, but they cautioned that the provisional data requires further analysis to determine if the higher mortality is statistically significant for the summer months.
“The heatwave will have been associated with a number of excess deaths,” said Dr Adrian Boyle of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine. “The people most at risk in a heatwave are the frail elderly with heart or kidney problems.”
The UK is “woefully unprepared” for deadly heatwaves, a cross-party committee of MPs concluded in a report published on 27 July. The MPs said the government had ignored warnings from its official climate change adviser, and that without action heat-related deaths will triple to 7,000 a year by the 2040s.
The height of the heatwave was from 25 June to 9 July, according to the Met Office, a run of 15 consecutive days with temperatures above 28C. The deaths registered during the weeks covering this period were 663 higher than the average for the same weeks over the previous five years, a Guardian analysis of data from the Office of National Statistics shows. 
ONS analysis for previous years indicate hundreds of additional deaths were associated with brief periods of heatwave conditions in July 2016 and June 2017. The full toll of the 2018 heatwave could reach 1,000, according to one prediction. 
“Although the 2018 data is only preliminary, there seems to have been a concerning increase in the number of deaths,” said Dr Isobel Braithwaite, of the public health charity, Medact. “This fits in with current scientific evidence, which clearly shows that long periods of very warm weather can harm people’s health, particularly at extremes of age and in people with other pre-existing health problems.”
“While working in A&amp;E this summer, I saw patients presenting with heatstroke and other conditions that were probably exacerbated by the hot weather, and this obviously places an additional strain on our already struggling health services,” she said.
Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, said: “Some trusts have reported record numbers of people coming in to A&amp;E, with increased emergency admissions, often for respiratory problems and conditions made worse by dehydration. We have heard concerns about large numbers of people from care homes requiring treatment.”
Dr Nick Scriven, the president of the Society for Acute Medicine, which represents hospital doctors specialising in emergency care , said: “The pressure was real and felt at the frontline. I would not be surprised at all if an effect on mortality is shown. The figure of about 700 would seem very plausible.”
He said dehydration can lead to many issues, from dizziness and falls, to an increased risk of infections, heart attacks and strokes. High temperatures can increase air pollution, and some urban areas including London saw alerts issued for ozone pollution. “That can really affect those with respiratory conditions,” Scriven said.
The heat also puts NHS staff themselves under pressure, he said. “NHS staff are working in often intolerable conditions. Compounding the heat is the fact that this is prime holiday season and there is little slack in the system regarding staff numbers.”
Braithwaite said the 2018 heatwave showed that hospitals and care homes must be made ready to cope with high temperatures. “We now know that the frequency and intensity of heatwaves is set to increase significantly over the coming decades because of climate change, so we have to heed this warning call in order to protect the public’s health,” she said. “We also need to treat the underlying cause of the problem by rapidly cutting emissions.”
“The extreme heat has highlighted the shortcomings of ageing buildings, which are not designed or equipped to deal with these conditions,” said Cordery. “Staff and patients are paying the price now for past decisions to delay investment in the NHS estate.”
The ONS data records when deaths are registered, not when they occurred, but 77% of deaths are recorded within five days. Even higher levels of excess deaths are seen in the colder months, but the year-to-year variation is lower in the summer months. 
“We cannot say whether any of these [663] deaths are due to the heatwave or from other causes,” said an ONS spokeswoman. “Causes of deaths data for 2018 will be published next summer and they may provide a better understanding.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/aug/03/deaths-rose-650-above-average-during-uk-heatwave-with-older-people-most-at-risk

The lower number (87%) is from the report YOU rely on to diminish one consensus and dismiss another consensus.
Your report does not say 97% - (the accepted figure) it is an absurd lie for you to claim otherwise.

So, are you going to admit your source is unrepresentative of modern science or are you going to stick with your attacks on scientific consensus?

BQENDNo, the AAAS is just one organisation who you chose - evidently because they lower the average.
Calling the AAAS one of the ""measures of AGW acceptance."" is nonsense because they do not represent the views of all scientists - they represent only their own US membership from a broad pool from physicists to parapsychologists...such an indiscriminate selection pool may yield results you like but you cannot claim that they represent or are representative of the global consensus of all scientists on climate and solutions to AGW..
YOU quoted their survey which gave a 65% acceptance of nuclear to address AGW, the acceptance of which they gave (in their membership) as 87%

Is it?
Actually I think most people, on both the left and right, want something akin to what you are labelling ""neo feudalism"". Both want the security of the employee/employer relationship. The Left want to create good jobs, with fair conditions, a decent life beyond work, and comfortable retirement. But they are still effectively implicitly expecting a ""feudal overlord"" of some sort to provide this risk-free security. The Right want to ensure that the wealth derived from taking risks is protected, but they still want the ""freedom"" to allow the serf to aspire to become the overlord, at least in principle.
Neither would call it neo-feudalism, but what they want is not a million miles away from that.

I haven't commented on them, one way or another. I was simply showing you that there have been confirmed increases in many types of extreme weather, and that it has been linked to the influence of man.
The next time you erroneously claim there has been no increase in extremes, I will point you towards this sub-thread.

But here is a graph that I am wondering what you think of https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/styles/large/public/2016-07/heavy-precip-download2-2016.png

I think it is an index for 48 US States - which covers less than 2% of the globe. The data I posted you was global.
Additionally, it appears to show an upward trend in heavy precipitation events. From the EPA Site displaying this graph:
BQSTART
In recent years, a larger percentage of precipitation has come in the form of intense single-day events. Nine of the top 10 years for extreme one-day precipitation events have occurred since 1990... 
The prevalence of extreme single-day precipitation events remained fairly steady between 1910 and the 1980s, but has risen substantially since then. Over the entire period from 1910 to 2015, the portion of the country experiencing extreme single-day precipitation events increased at a rate of about half a percentage point per decade...
Figures 1 and 2 [the figure you posted magaman] are both consistent with other studies that have found an increase in heavy precipitation over timeframes ranging from single days to 90-day periods to whole years.

Dr. Frank C. Baxter: “Because with our present knowledge we have no idea what would happen. Even now, man may be unwittingly changing the world’s climate through the waste products of his civilization. Due to our release through factories and automobiles every year of more than six billion tons of carbon dioxide, which helps air absorb heat from the sun, our atmosphere seems to be getting warmer.""
Richard Carlson: ""This is bad?""
Dr. Frank C. Baxter: ""Well, it's been calculated a few degrees rise in the Earth’s temperature would melt the polar ice caps. And if this happens, an inland sea would fill a good portion of the Mississippi valley. Tourists in glass bottom boats would be viewing the drowned towers of Miami through 150 feet of tropical water. For in weather, we’re not only dealing with forces of a far greater variety than even the atomic physicist encounters, but with life itself.""

The consensus on AGW has been measured a dozen-ish times. Even Richard Tol admits it's in the high 90s.
BQENDIndeed - you're the one producing reports
 to support your position claiming that it's 87% not 97%.
Nobody made you do that.
BQSTART
I'm only aware of the one survey on the consensus on nuclear. If you have more you are free to cite them.
BQENDOkay, well why not produce a citation of any academic or scientific body who reject it.
The view you oppose is supported by the RAE, IMEchE, IET ICE, The Institute of Physics and the Royal Society, the UnitedNations SDSI report on this (as presented at COP21 in Paris) and the United Nations DDPP- (also IDDRI and ClimateWorks) which was set up just like the UNs IPCC to report to the Secretary-General of the UN. The DDPP is backed by 29 of the world's top universities plus the AAAS (as you mention) and recommends a mix of nuclear and renewables with gas (as a bridge fuel) ultimately with CCS - which the IPCC and UNECE also refer to as a critical technology the absence of which will put up the cost of addressing AGW by 138%
So all these people do not constitute a consensus? 
You're either really really clever to outwit them all ..... or the other thing.

You want to paint me as anti-nuclear just because I say the consensus is not as strong. Interesting.
BQENDI don't paint you as ""anti-nuclear"" - I was talking about green energy yet here you are - you routinely attack anyone who even obliquely refers to it.
Like the OfC it's become an obsession for you..
So sorry John, but you've left it a bit late to suddenly claim that you agreed with the consensus all along.

RE subsidies are falling rapidly and will never, ever come close to the amount of subsidies that FF's have received, principally thorugh unpaid externalities.
BQENDWell the unpaid externalities to RE without substantial baseload/ FFR supply are really costly Marty so I'd like to see that 100% comparison in a study.
Even ignoring the massive external cost of grid reinforcement and expansion, the price of storage (2025) is $375/kwh (£290/kwh) so the less baseload provision on the grid the greater the cost to the consumer in external systems.
For the UK, the NAO estimate this costed circa £10/MWh with a 30% renewable penetration (exc grid extensions) and up to £45/MWh for only 50% penetration - and relying on gas (without CCS) to keep it affordable misses the point..

The piece is worth reading – it’s a well-told, mostly accurate, and very informative story about a key decade in climate science and policy history. But sadly, it explicitly excuses the key players responsible for our continued failure.
Rich’s piece immediately goes off the rails in its Prologue, where he argues that the GOP isn’t responsible – at least not for the climate failures up to 1989:
Nor can the Republican Party be blamed … during the 1980s, many prominent Republicans joined Democrats in judging the climate problem to be a rare political winner: nonpartisan and of the highest possible stakes.
However, his story is peppered with examples that contradict this narrative. The world’s foremost climate scientists had published the groundbreaking National Academy of Sciences ‘Charney Report’ in 1979, concluding that a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide would most likely cause 3°C of global warming (still the consensus today), and as Rich summarizes:
The last time the world was three degrees warmer was during the Pliocene, three million years ago, when beech trees grew in Antarctica, the seas were 80 feet higher and horses galloped across the Canadian coast of the Arctic Ocean.
But Ronald Reagan was elected president the next year and came in with a stark anti-environment agenda, including an effort to eliminate the Energy Department’s carbon dioxide program. In 1983, the National Academy of Sciences published yet another major climate report. It mostly reiterated the Charney report findings, but this time the press briefing was run by Reagan appointee William Nierenberg. In a glaring omission, Rich’s story failed to note that in 1984, Nierenberg founded the fossil fuel-funded, climate-denying George C. Marshall Institute and proceeded to publish a variety of reports denying mainstream scientific findings.
The GMI put out, for example, one report, authored by N himself, arguing that global warming was caused by the sun, and another that CFCs weren't bad for ozone, and yet another claiming that secondhand smoke was fine to breathe. 9/n pic.twitter.com/oguaEnCA9P
In the key 1983 press briefing, Nierenberg basically lied about the climate report’s findings, claiming it found no urgent need for action. Nierenberg’s false summary made headlines around the world and stymied climate policy efforts for years to come. Only after 1985 when the discovery of ozone depletion captured worldwide attention was climate change able to ride its coattails back into serious policy discussions.
Rich’s story culminates with the first major global climate conference in Noordwijk, the Netherlands, in 1989. More than 60 countries were deciding whether to endorse a framework for a global climate treaty. George H.W. Bush had been elected president after promising on the campaign trail, “Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect are forgetting about the White House effect.” But once he was in the White House, Bush expressed little interest in global warming and appointed John Sununu as his chief of staff. Sununu had earned a PhD in engineering from MIT, but developed a conspiratorial view towards mainstream science:
Since World War II, he believed, conspiratorial forces had used the imprimatur of scientific knowledge to advance an “anti-growth” doctrine.
When the Swedish minister briefly emerged from a long and ongoing closed-door negotiation at Noordwijk and was asked by an American environmental activist what was going on, he answered, “Your government is fucking this thing up!” Sununu had pressured the Bush administration representative to force the conference to abandon a commitment to freeze carbon emissions, and the Noordwijk conference became the first in a long line of international climate negotiations failures, thanks largely to the Republican administration.
In his unfortunate Prologue, Rich also describes the fossil fuel industry as “a common boogeyman.” He argues that the fossil fuel industry didn’t mobilize to kill the 1989 Noordwijk negotiation. That’s true, because it didn’t have to; had the treaty even succeeded, it would have just been the very first step in global efforts to cut carbon pollution. 
Of course Exxon wasn’t running a denial campaign until the 1990s. They didn’t need to yet. The threat of policy action was remote. When action became more likely, that’s when fossil fuel companies started their lying in earnest. 6/
Immediately after the Noordwijk shot came across its bow, the fossil fuel industry launched a decades-long, many-million-dollar campaign to undermine public trust of climate science and support for climate policy. For example, the Global Climate Coalition (GCC) fossil fuel industry group formed in 1989. By the time the 1992 Rio Earth Summit rolled around, these polluter industry organizations began heavily investing in disinformation campaigns to undermine international and domestic climate policies. Speaking about the Rio summit, Bush sounded like Donald Trump, saying:
I’m not going to go to the Rio conference and make a bad deal or be a party to a bad deal.
Bill Clinton proposed an energy tax to try and meet the treaty goals anyway, but the GCC invested $1.8m in a disinformation campaign, and Congress voted it down. The GCC then spent $13m to weaken support for the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, and the Senate voted 95-0 to pre-emptively declare its opposition to the treaty. Since then, Exxon alone has given $31m to climate-denying organizations.
The fossil fuel industry is one exceptionally wealthy, influential, and powerful ‘boogeyman.’ As Rich notes in his Epilogue, it’s also been quite successful:
More carbon has been released into the atmosphere since the final day of the Noordwijk conference, Nov. 7, 1989, than in the entire history of civilization preceding it
Apparently at a private dinner the night before his piece was published, Rich described the fossil fuel industry as being “guilty of crimes against humanity.” It’s a shame that his story took on such a different tone. As Benjamin Franta, PhD student in the history of science at Stanford summarized it:
One common mistake in this NYT magazine piece is the idea that companies like Exxon somehow changed from “good” (doing research in the 1970s and ‘80s) to “bad” (promoting denial in the ‘90s and 2000s). Exxon’s own memos show that the purpose of its research program was to influence regulation, not to solve the climate problem per se. The industry-organized disinformation campaign that emerged at the end of the 1980s was in response to binding policies that were just then being proposed. If such policies were proposed earlier, it stands to reason that the industry response would have occurred earlier as well. To say that industry disinformation isn’t the whole story is to knock down a straw man: the fact remains that it is a major--and perhaps the most important--part of the story.

This grim prospect is sketched out in a journal paper that considers the combined consequences of 10 climate change processes, including the release of methane trapped in Siberian permafrost and the impact of melting ice in Greenland on the Antarctic.
The authors of the essay, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, stress their analysis is not conclusive, but warn the Paris commitment to keep warming at 2C above pre-industrial levels may not be enough to “park” the planet’s climate at a stable temperature.
They warn that the hothouse trajectory “would almost certainly flood deltaic environments, increase the risk of damage from coastal storms, and eliminate coral reefs (and all of the benefits that they provide for societies) by the end of this century or earlier.”
Fifty years ago, this would be dismissed as alarmist, but now scientists have become really worried
“I do hope we are wrong, but as scientists we have a responsibility to explore whether this is real,” said Johan Rockström, executive director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre. “We need to know now. It’s so urgent. This is one of the most existential questions in science.”
Rockström and his co-authors are among the world’s leading authorities on positive feedback loops, by which warming temperatures release new sources of greenhouse gases or destroy the Earth’s ability to absorb carbon or reflect heat.
Their new paper asks whether the planet’s temperature can stabilise at 2C or whether it will gravitate towards a more extreme state. The authors attempt to assess whether warming can be halted or whether it will tip towards a “hothouse” world that is 4C warmer than pre-industrial times and far less supportive of human life.
Katherine Richardson from the University of Copenhagen, one of the authors, said the paper showed that climate action was not just a case of turning the knob on emissions, but of understanding how various factors interact at a global level.
“We note that the Earth has never in its history had a quasi-stable state that is around 2C warmer than the preindustrial and suggest that there is substantial risk that the system, itself, will ‘want’ to continue warming because of all of these other processes – even if we stop emissions,” she said. “This implies not only reducing emissions but much more.”
New feedback loops are still being discovered. A separate paper published in PNAS reveals that increased rainfall – a symptom of climate change in some regions - is making it harder for forest soils to trap greenhouse gases such as methane.
Previous studies have shown that weakening carbon sinks will add 0.25C, forest dieback will add 0.11C, permafrost thaw will add 0.9C and increased bacterial respiration will add 0.02C. The authors of the new paper also look at the loss of methane hydrates from the ocean floor and the reduction of snow and ice cover at the poles.
Rockström says there are huge gaps in data and knowledge about how one process might amplify another. Contrary to the Gaia theory, which suggests the Earth has a self-righting tendency, he says the feedbacks could push the planet to a more extreme state.
As an example, the authors say the loss of Greenland ice could disrupt the Gulf Stream ocean current, which would raise sea levels and accumulate heat in the Southern Ocean, which would in turn accelerate ice loss from the east Antarctic. Concerns about this possibility were heightened earlier this year by reports that the Gulf Stream was at its weakest level in 1,600 years.
Currently, global average temperatures are just over 1C above pre-industrial levels and rising at 0.17C per decade. The Paris climate agreement set actions to keep warming limited to 1.5C-2C by the end of the century, but the authors warn more drastic action may be necessary.
“The heatwave we now have in Europe is not something that was expected with just 1C of warming,” Rockström said. “Several positive feedback loops are already in operation, but they are still weak. We need studies to show when they might cause a runaway effect.
Another climate scientist – who was not involved in the paper – emphasised the document aimed to raise questions rather than prove a theory. “It’s rather selective, but not outlandish,” said Prof Martin Siegert, co-director of the Grantham Institute. “Threshold and tipping points have been discussed previously, but to state that 2C is a threshold we can’t pull back from is new, I think. I’m not sure what ‘evidence’ there is for this – or indeed whether there can be until we experience it.”
Rockström said the question needed asking. “We could end up delivering the Paris agreement and keep to 2C of warming, but then face an ugly surprise if the system starts to slip away,” he said. “We don’t say this will definitely happen. We just list all the disruptive events and come up with plausible occurrences … 50 years ago, this would be dismissed as alarmist, but now scientists have become really worried.”
“In the context of the summer of 2018, this is definitely not a case of crying wolf, raising a false alarm: the wolves are now in sight,” said Dr Phil Williamson, a climate researcher at the University of East Anglia. “The authors argue that we need to be much more proactive in that regard, not just ending greenhouse gas emissions as rapidly as possible, but also building resilience in the context of complex Earth system processes that we might not fully understand until it is too late.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/06/domino-effect-of-climate-events-could-push-earth-into-a-hothouse-state

The party leader, Richard Di Natale, joined Labor in demanding the return of the huge sum given to the private foundation – which had just six full-time staff – and called for the whole process to be put to tender.
Speaking on ABC’s Radio National, Di Natale said the matter was a “massive scandal”.
“The prime minister and the energy minister have a private meeting with an individual ... this is an organisation made up of those at the big end of town ... and they give him half a billion dollars,” he told ABC’s Radio National.
“No tender process, no transparency, no examination of whether the organisation has the capacity to administer these funds.
“That money should be returned. There should be an open, transparent tender process and, if we had a national anti-corruption watchdog, this matter would be referred to it because it stinks.”
His comments came after the foundation’s managing director, Anna Marsden, said this year’s grant had come as a “complete surprise”.
Marsden defended the award, saying the foundation was the largest reef charity and the government wanted to encourage co-investment in the reef.
Asked about the fact that the foundation did not apply or complete a competitive tender for the grant, Marsden told ABC’s 7.30 it had come as a surprise.
She said 80 cents in every dollar raised was spent on reef projects, which would rise to 90 cents a dollar for the federal government grant.
Marsden identified climate change as the biggest threat to the reef, adding that efforts to protect it should “pull both levers: resilience and mitigation”. Australia “could probably be doing more” to meet its Paris targets and prevent climate change, she said.
The managing director disclosed that the foundation’s business partners included BHP, Google, Lendlease, Qantas and Rio Tinto, but said they had “no influence” on project selection or design.
Speaking again on Radio National on Wednesday she said: “We have a compelling track record … we have a phenomenal track record in delivery private and public partnership.
“Look what we have achieved with a fraction of this investment. Imagine what we can achieve with the scale up that has been promised.”
On Monday Turnbull defended the government’s “very thorough process” before the grant, explaining that both the expenditure review committee and cabinet had approved it before the money was offered.
The prime minister said the government had not put the grant out to a competitive tender because the foundation was an “outstanding” organisation and was “were clearly the best team to do it”.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/08/it-stinks-444m-grant-to-reef-foundation-is-a-scandal-greens-say

The Europe-wide heatwave has shrunk Belgium’s early crop of potatoes by about one-third compared with an average year. Without significant rainfall over the next few weeks, the key September and October harvests could be smaller still.
The heat impacts not only the yield, but the size of the potatoes and the roughness of their skins. If they are too tough, they cannot be handled by the peeling machines used by chip manufacturers.
The price of the bintje potato, the traditional variety used in creating the frite, or frieten, as people say in the Flemish-speaking north of the country where the crisis has most been felt, has already shot up. And it is likely to rise further, turning the cheap Belgian snack into a rather expensive one.
Bernard Lefèvre, the president of Unafri-Navefri, the stallowners’ association, told Politico: “It’s a subject that is at the heart of our job.
“Prices have already increased and potatoes will be smaller, but it isn’t clear yet. We are hopeful. It’s the first time Belgians are praying for more rain ...
“Frites are essential. It is vital. It is part of our culture. It’s more than a product – it’s a symbol of Belgium.”
Belgium, not noted for a lack of rain, has applied to the EU for emergency funds to deal with the drought, which has most heavily impacted the north of Flanders, in terms of the quantity and quality of potatoes.
“We can’t know if the harvest is 100% good or bad until September, but it’s true that if everything continues like it is, it’s not great for frites,” Lefèvre said.
Romain Cools, the secretary general of Belgapom, the country’s largest potato grower, said: “Drought combined with heat kills plants. This is disadvantageous, especially for the early potatoes that are harvested at this time.
“It is a disaster in the fields that the farmers could not irrigate. We record losses of around 30% ... This year, the market looks very different from last year. 
“In 2017, a tonne of potatoes was trading at €25because the supply was very substantial. Now, we are talking about €250 to €300 per tonne.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/10/the-chips-are-down-in-belgium-as-heatwave-hits-supply-of-frites

Global temperature is directly linked to CO2 content in the air. Mankind is generating 35 billion tons of Co2 a year. The sea is the largest sink for CO2 but as it warms it is less able to hold CO2 and releases it. CO2 levels have spiked in the last 100 years by more than has been seen in any other 100,000 year period.

Neither is true. Beyond electing goverments that have chosen 'austerity' over investment and carbon-taxation, the average UK lifestyle (and its carbon-footprint) has plenty of room for individual action.
'Governments & central planning' are very much part of the solution, unlike the pretense of there being 'free markets' - they can end direct and indirect subsidies on fossil-fuel extraction, change policies and regulations, redirect public and private sector investment and use incentives or nudges to change the calculus of individuals' decisions.

This paper reports on the embodied carbon emissions from the production of 14 wind turbines, rated between 50 kW and 3.4 MW. The embodied emissions were quantified from emission factors specific to each material involved in manufacture, transport to site, and installation of the turbines. The resulting trend was that higher-rated turbines had greater embodied carbon emissions with one 3 MW turbine incorporating 1046 tCO2eq compared to only 58 tCO2eq for an 80 kW turbine. However, the greater electricity output of the turbines offset these emissions more quickly with a recovery in 64 days for a 3.4 MW turbine compared to 354 days for a 100 kW one. This also resulted in lower carbon emissions per kilowatt hour of electricity generated and quicker payback as a percentage of lifetime of 0.9% for a 3.4 MW turbine compared to 4.3% and 4.9% for a 50 and 100 kW turbines, respectively. The findings of this analysis indicate that a preference for installation of higher-rated, over lower-rated, turbines should be favoured for greater environmental benefits.

While the well-heeled residents of Montreal hunkered down in blissfully air conditioned offices and houses, the city’s homeless population – not usually welcome in public areas such as shopping malls and restaurants – struggled to escape the blanket of heat.
Benedict Labre House, a day centre for homeless people, wasn’t able to secure a donated air-conditioning unit until five days into the heatwave. “You can imagine when you have 40 or 50 people in an enclosed space and it’s so hot, it’s very hard to deal with,” says Francine Nadler, clinical coordinator at the facility.
Fifty-four Montreal residents were killed by this summer’s heat. Authorities haven’t so far specified whether any homeless people were among them, but according to the regional department of public health, the majority were aged over 50, lived alone, and had underlying physical or mental health problems. None had air conditioning. Montreal coroner Jean Brochu told reporters that many of the bodies examined by his team “were in an advanced state of decay, having sometimes spent up to two days in the heat before being found”.
Dying in a heatwave is like being slowly cooked. It’s pure torture ... this heat can kill soldiers, athletes, everyone
It was the poor and isolated who quietly suffered the most in the heat – a situation echoed in overheated cities across the world. In the US, immigrant workers are three times more likely to die from heat exposure than American citizens. In India, where 24 cities are expected to reach average summertime highs of at least 35C (95F) by 2050, it is the slum dwellers who are most vulnerable. And as the global risk of prolonged exposure to deadly heat steadily rises, so do the associated risks of human catastrophe.
Last year, Hawaiian researchers projected that the share of the world’s population exposed to deadly heat for at least 20 days a year will increase from 30% now to 74% by 2100 if greenhouse gas emissions are allowed to grow. (It will rise to 48% with “drastic reductions”.) They concluded that “an increasing threat to human life from excess heat now seems almost inevitable”.
“Dying in a heatwave is like being slowly cooked,” said lead author Professor Camilo Mora at the time of publication. “It’s pure torture. The young and elderly are at particular risk, but we found that this heat can kill soldiers, athletes, everyone.”
The year 2018 is set to be among the hottest since records began, with unprecedented peak temperatures engulfing the planet, from 43C (109F) in Baku, Azerbaijan, to the low 30s across Scandinavia. In Kyoto, Japan, the mercury did not dip below 38C (100F) for a week. In the US, an unusually early and humid July heatwave saw 48.8C (120F) in Chino, inland of Los Angeles. Residents blasted their air conditioners so much they caused power shortages.
Urban areas are reaching these killer temperatures faster than those that are less populated. Cities absorb, create and radiate heat. Asphalt, brick, concrete and dark roofs act like sponges for heat during the day and emit warmth at night. Air conditioning is a lifesaver for those who can afford it, but it makes the streets even hotter for those who can’t.
“Urban heat islands, combined with an ageing population and increased urbanisation, are projected to increase the vulnerability of urban populations, especially the poor, to heat-related health impacts in the future,” a US government assessment warned.
The World Health Organisation says that 60% of people will live in cities by 2030, and the more densely populated they become, the hotter they’ll get. Considering that recent predictions warn temperatures in South Asia will exceed the limits of human survival by the end of the century, every degree counts. Even this year, 65 people have perished from nearly 44C (111F) heat in Karachi, Pakistan – a city used to extreme heat.
These problems are worse for vulnerable or low-income populations living near traffic in poor housing with no air conditioning
But the impact is not evenly distributed. For example, there is a strong correlation between an area’s green spaces and its wealth; when shade from tree canopies can lower surfaces’ peak temperature by 11–25°C, “landscape is a predictor for morbidity in heatwaves”, says Tarik Benmarhnia, public health researcher at University of California San Diego. A review paper he recently co-authored found that people living in less vegetated areas had a 5% higher risk of death from heat-related causes.
In 2017, researchers at University of California, Berkeley were able to map racial divides in the US by proximity to trees. Black people were 52% more likely than white people to live in areas of unnatural “heat risk-related land cover”, while Asians were 32% more likely and Hispanics 21%.
Air pollution is more deadly in these areas, too, as nitrous oxides generate ozone when heated by the sun, inflaming airways and increasing mortality risk. “These problems are worse,” says Benmarhnia, “for vulnerable or low-income populations living near traffic in poor housing with no air conditioning.”
But air conditioning will remain out of reach for many, even as it increasingly becomes a necessity. In 2014, Public Health England raised concerns that “the distribution of cooling systems may reflect socioeconomic inequalities unless they are heavily subsidised,” adding that rising fuel costs could further exacerbate this. And when we need to use less energy and cool the planet, not just our homes and offices, relying upon air conditioning is not a viable long-term plan – and certainly not for everyone.
Most of the research into heatwaves and public health has focused on western countries; Benmarhnia says more studies have been done on the city of Phoenix, Arizona, than the entire continent of Africa. But the problem is global, and especially pronounced across urban slums such as the ashwiyyat in Cairo, where temperatures during the city’s five-month-long summers have peaked at 46C (115F).
Traditionally Egyptians built low buildings close together, forming dense networks of shaded alleyways where people could keep cool during summer. But the rapid construction of high-rises and decreasing green spaces have made one of the fastest-growing cities in the world increasingly stifling. Subsidy cuts have brought about a rise of 18-42% in electricity costs, affecting many poor residents’ options for cooling down.
Um Hamad, 41, works as a cleaner and lives with her family in a small flat in Musturad in the city’s north. Though she considers them lucky to live on the relatively cool first floor, “in Cairo everything is suffocating”, she says. Hamad use fans and water to keep cool inside, but the water bill is becoming expensive . “There’s always that trick of sleeping on the floor, and we wear cotton clothes ,” she says. “The temperatures are harder to deal with for women who wear the hijab, so I always tell my daughters to wear only two layers and to wear bright colours.”
In a tight-knit cluster of urban dwellings in Giza, to Cairo’s south, Yassin Al-Ouqba, 42, a train maintenance worker, lives in a house built from a mixture of bricks and mud-bricks. In August, he says, it becomes “like an oven”. “I have a fan and I place it in front of a plate of ice so that it spreads cold air throughout the room. I spread cold water all over the sheets.”
In tropical Manila in the Philippines, where highs above 30C are intensified by stifling humidity, air conditioning is a luxury even for those in medical care. The Dr Jose Fabella Memorial Hospital is said to have one of the world’s busiest maternity wards, with free contraception only recently made available in the predominantly Catholic country.
An air-conditioned private room costs 650 Philippine pesos per night – less than £10, but far beyond the means of most mothers-to-be, who end up in wards reliant on fans buzzing softly on wall mounts. “These fans work nonstop 24 hours a day, so they never last a year,” says Maribel Bote, a nurse at the hospital for 28 years.
The problem is compounded by regular overcrowding: in the maternity ward, known as ground zero of the country’s overpopulation crisis, as many as five mothers have been forced to share one bed. “It gets hellish in the summer – the fans blow hot air,” says Bote. “You’ll see the mothers using paper fans to cool themselves.”
In Cambodia, which has seen devastating heatwaves and drought in recent years, surviving the heat is as much a question of status for prisoners as it is for civilians. In the early 2000s Chao Sophea, 30, spent more than two years at Phnom Penh’s Prey Sar prison after being convicted on drug charges, which she denies. At the time she was three months pregnant; Sophea’s child spent its first year in an overcrowded cell designated for pregnant women and new mothers.
We slept like smoked fish on a skewer. There was no air conditioning, not even a fan
“It was actually a steaming room,” says Sophea today. “I was using a fan made of a palm leaf to cool my baby down – that was what I could afford. There was a tiny hole in the wall, but can you imagine how much air you would absorb in such a crowded space? We made a request for an electric fan, but it never arrived.”
An environmental activist who wishes to remain anonymous says he shared a cell of about four square metres with at least 25 other men when he was held in Prey Sar’s men’s wing earlier this year. “We slept like smoked fish on a skewer. There was no air conditioning, not even a fan.”
Others may be able to secure better conditions. A 2015 report by the Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defence of Human Rights stated that “some prisons reportedly house ‘VIP cells’ for well-connected prisoners or those able to pay for single-cell accommodation,” and these are believed to be air conditioned.
Compounding the threat posed by the changing climate is the refugee crisis. The two are intimately linked, with extreme weather events often a factor in social, political and economic instability. A paper published in the journal Science in December found that if greenhouse gas emissions were not meaningfully reduced global asylum applications would increase by almost 200% by the end of the century.
On a plain north of Amman, some 80,000 Syrians live in the Za’atari refugee camp, a semi-permanent urban settlement set up six years ago and now considered Jordan’s fourth-largest city. Hamda Al-Marzouq, 27, arrived three years ago, fleeing airstrikes on her neighbourhood in the outskirts of Damascus.
Her husband had gone missing during the war, and she was desperate to save her young son and extended family. Eight of them now live in a prefabricated shelter, essentially a large metal box, which Al-Marzouq says turns into an oven during the summer.
It’s suffocating. We soak the towels and try to breathe through them
“It’s a desert area, and we’re suffering,” she says by phone from the camp. “We have different ways of coping. We wake in the early morning and soak the floor with water. Then we sprinkle water on ourselves.” There is no daytime electricity, so fans are useless. When power does arrive at night, the desert has already cooled.
Many days, her family will wait until the evening to walk outside, wrapping wet towels around their heads. But the biggest problem are sandstorms, which can arrive violently during the summer months and engulf the camp for days. “We have to close the caravan windows,” she says, adding the room then gets hotter. “It’s suffocating. We soak the towels and try to breathe through them.”
Al-Marzouq’s five-year-old son suffers respiratory problems and keeps getting infections, while asthma is rife across the camp.
Water has also been an issue, with demand in northern Jordan – one of the most water-scarce countries in the world – surging following the refugee arrivals. A Unicef-led operation will see all households connected to a water network by October, which Al-Marzouq says has been a significant help.
“We used to collect water with jerry cans and had to carry it for long distances. Now, with the water network being operational, things are much easier. We don’t have to fight in a long queue to get our share of water. Now there is equity.”
Across the board, lack of equality has been found to feed the urban furnaces. The US researchers who in 2013 uncovered the racial divide in urban heat vulnerability discovered that the more segregated a city was, the hotter it was for everyone. Rachel Morello-Frosch, one of the co-authors, told the LA Times at the time that “this pattern of racial segregation appears to increase everyone’s risk of living in a heat-prone environment”.
Treating cities as a whole, ghettos and all, is a more effective way to tackle extreme urban heat, they found. Researchers recommended planting more trees and increasing light-coloured surfaces to reduce the overall heat island effect, adding that urban planning to mitigate future extreme heat “should proactively incorporate an environmental justice perspective and address racial/ethnic disparities”.
Cities will have to rethink how we prepare for these emergencies and what we’re able to offer to all of our citizens
Working to break social isolation, says Benmarhnia, “is a win-win situation”, with the added benefit of bringing the “invisible” people most at risk – like the homeless, and illegal immigrants – back into the community, where they can be looked after.
In at least one of the world’s hottest countries, steps are starting to be taken. India recently announced that a series of common-sense public health interventions have led to an enormous reduction in heat-related deaths – from 2,040 in 2015, to a little over 200 in 2017. Successful measures included unlocking the gates to public parks during the day, distributing free water, and painting the roofs of slum communities white, knocking 5C off internal temperatures.
Montreal first implemented a similar heat action plan in 2004, reducing mortality on hot days by 2.52 deaths per day, but as the heat waves intensify, it is likely that this will need to be reassessed. Nadler says the devastating impacts of global warming are only just beginning to dawn on everyone. “Cities will have to rethink how we prepare for these emergencies and what we’re able to offer to all of our citizens – from the most affluent, to the most vulnerable.”

The UK government issues its own currency. This means that when it spends the government records numbers into assorted bank accounts stored electronically on computers and those numbers represent sterling money. The UK government cannot run out of numbers. 
The actual limitation is the availability of real resources such as skilled labour, energy, land, raw material etc. Sovereign governments spend their own currency into existence at will and then tax it back out of circulation. Government spending creates the money and taxation destroys it in a continuous flow. At a macro level the money is simply an accounting tool for measuring and allocating real resources. 
In contrast to the instant availability of money, the real wealth of goods and services that we all depend on is created by the labour and skill of the working class applied to the raw material of the planet. Everything from the food in our bellies to the clothes on our backs right up to the most sophisticated technology is made by the workers. 
Money is a claim on those material resources produced by the working class and this is where money derives its power. The capitalist system peddles the illusion that there is a shortage of money (balance the books, reduce the deficit, live within your means etc.) in order to oppress and control the labour class who are the real creators of wealth.
Money can be seen as the scoreboard of capitalism. The big capitalist class have just accumulated a large money score in their bank accounts. But ultimately in a sovereign floating currency issuing state like Britain, the government is the scorekeeper. It can change the scoreboard at any time to give itself or anyone else access to the real resources that society has produced collectively. This knowledge is toxic to the capitalist class whose power and privilege rests on having a lot of accumulated keystrokes while the majority have little.
In contrast to the parasitic capitalist class, the productive working class has produced more than enough real resources to provide everyone on the planet with proper nutrition, a decent home, healthcare, education, recreation and a job. It’s a political and ideological choice to deny people these basics. 
So following the logic, society as a whole has no requirement for and can no longer sustain a system of productive activity with the sole purpose of accumulating money. The money that the capitalists seek to accumulate is instantly available at a government/central bank level and is merely a unit of measure to allocate the real resources that society has produced collectively. While the pursuit of these money numbers is now an existential threat to the survival of our species.
Instead we need a radically different model which democratically plans its use of resources and production in order to meet human and environmental & ecological requirements. This is the sustainable future for humanity and it’s called socialism.

And you propose to do what?
BQEND
I propose to replace capitalism with a sustainable socioeconomic model which is the only effective thing we can do to prevent environmental catastrophe. Humanity is at a crossroads now and the next few decades are crucial for our civilization. Everything including socioeconomic systems are in a constant process of change. They are born, develop to a peak and then decline and eventually die. Human society changes as the productive forces (agriculture, industry, communications etc.) on which our society depends change. Everything rests on those productive forces which create the material resources which support and enhance human life. This is in reality the motor force driving human history. 
Eventually the productive capacity is developed to such a point that it becomes necessary for a new form of social system to emerge which can allow industry, technology and science etc. to develop further. 
This is when revolutions occurs and the old socioeconomic systems are replaced at the point when they can no longer develop the productive forces and become a barrier to human advancement. This is why feudalism was overthrown to make way for capitalism 300 years ago and we are at a similar juncture now. Each socioeconomic system lays the basis for its own eventual extinction and paves the way for the arrival of the next type of society.
Capitalism is fundamentally based on the exploitation of the majority working class but it has developed the productive forces to such a degree that socialism is now possible. There is now an abundance of real resources and so a more advanced form of human society can emerge where there is no exploiter and exploited class. 
But capitalism is structurally incapable of providing this path forward so it’s now in a stage of terminal decline and is an absolute brake on the advance of humanity as the billions condemned to abject poverty in a world of plenty attest to and where the 42 richest individuals on the planet now collectively hold more wealth than the poorest half of humanity. Nor is capitalism capable of addressing the existential threat of climate change and ecological meltdown as there is far more profit to be in ransacking the environment than in saving it. 
So this profit seeking system is now an absolute fetter on societal development even as it has developed the productive forces to such a point that they now threaten to overwhelm the planet if deployed only to generate ever more profit for the elite. 
Under our fiat currency systems the money which the capitalists seek to accumulate is keystroked into existence at will in central and commercial banks. So it’s a colossal absurdity to allow this pursuit of computer digits to destroy the planet on which we all depend.', u'recommendation_count': u'6', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1534261847000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'17748976', u'in_reply_to': u'119387367', u'id': u'119387548', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'RichardNYC', u'text': u'You’ll have to prove that New York consumes less proportionally than its population suggests.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1534261771000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'254561', u'in_reply_to': u'119387161', u'id': u'119387515', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'LelouchVIBrittania', u'text': u'Your comment is sociopathic.

How heat became a national US problem,article,http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/aug/14/it-cant-get-much-hotter-can-it-how-heat-became-a-national-us-problem,0,"On yet another day of roasting heat in Phoenix, elderly and homeless people scurry between shards of shade in search of respite at the Marcos De Niza Senior Center. Along with several dozen other institutions in the city, it has been set up as a cooling centre: a free public refuge, with air conditioning, chilled bottled water, boardgames and books. Last summer a record 155 people died in Phoenix from excess heat, and the city is straining to avoid a repeat.
James Sanders, an 83-year-old who goes by King, has lived in the city for 60 years and considers himself acclimatised to the baking south Arizona sun. “It does seem hotter than it used to be, though,” he says as he picks at his lunch, the temperature having climbed to 42C (107F) outside. “Maybe it’s my age. Maybe the wind isn’t blowing. It can’t get much hotter than this though. Can it?”
The heatwave that has recently swept the US has put 100 million Americans under heat warnings; caused power cuts in California where temperatures in places such as Palm Springs approached 50C (122F); and resulted in deaths from New York to the Mexican border, where people smugglers abandoned their clients in the desert. Further north, in Canada, more than 70 people perished in the Montreal area after a record burst of heat.
Record temperatures raise wrenching questions about the future viability of cities such as Phoenix, where taking a midday jog or doing a spot of gardening can pose a deadly risk. Climate change is spurring increasingly punishing heatwaves that are projected to cause tens of thousands of deaths in major US cities in the coming decades.
“There’s a point where the human body can’t cool itself, which means you are either in an air-conditioned space or you’re having serious health problems,” says Gregory Wellenius, an epidemiologist at Brown University. “Some places in the US will get to that point. The way we live, work and play will be altered by rising temperatures.”
There's a point where the human body can’t cool itself, which means you are either in an air-conditioned space or you're having serious health problems
Heat already kills more Americans than floods, hurricanes or other ecological disasters. That puts sweltering cities like Phoenix – where flights were cancelled last year because it was simply too hot – under growing pressure. But heat is rapidly becoming a national problem. 
Recent research suggests warming conditions are leading to suicides, as rising nighttime temperatures deprive Americans of sleep and respite from scorching days. A new study, released last week, predicts that a warming climate will drive thousands to emergency rooms for heat illness. The very hottest days experienced in the US could be a further 15F warmer this century if greenhouse gas emissions aren’t curbed. 
A national plan to deal with heat, however, remains a distant prospect, as the Trump administration attempts to demolish almost every measure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It has also outlined deep cuts to climate programmes, and steered federal agencies away from adapting to more frequent and more extreme weather events such as heatwaves, flooding and stronger storms. For the most part, US cities are facing burgeoning heatwaves on their own.
The Center for Disease Control states that around 650 deaths occur a year due to heat but Wellenius argues that this is too conservative, as heat isn’t always explicitly cited on death certificates; with related mortality the total swells to around 3,500. Crucially, the death toll is afflicting US cities that haven’t previously had to spend much time fretting about heat.
Research published by Wellenius and colleagues last year found the burden of these deaths is shouldered by unlikely places, far from the parched cacti and canyons of the west. The relatively cooler eastern cities of Philadelphia and Baltimore jointly have the most excess deaths due to heat in the entire US, at 37 fatalities per million people each year, the research found. July temperatures in Baltimore and Philadelphia have a long-term average of around 25C; in Phoenix it’s 34C. In all three cities, as elsewhere on the planet, the average is climbing. 
Beyond setting up the cooling centres, mainly in libraries, so far the response in Philadelphia has focused on raising public awareness, with city officials bombarding residents with advice in English and Spanish to“Stay Cool Philly!”, avoid the sun, drink water, and check on elderly neighbours.
“I think some of the other things people are in the west may be a little more attuned to the issues – like don’t jog your five miles at noon, do it at 5am,” says Dr Caroline Johnson, a senior official at the Philadelphia Department of Public Health. “Some of that may come as a surprise to people around here.”
Improvements in treating heat exhaustion and heat stroke mean that spikes in hospitalisations – around 40 people were taken to hospital in Philadelphia for heat in the first week of July – don’t necessarily lead to a surge in deaths. But older cities in the US north east, like Philadelphia, were built at a time when rapid change into a new climate was virtually unimaginable.
Much of Philadelphia’s older housing is packed tightly together in terraces, with little air circulation and no air conditioning. Roofs are still slathered in tar, rather than more expensive reflective materials, trapping more heat. “They’re like little ovens in there,” says Johnson.
Clusters of these houses, largely found in poorer, minority areas in the north and east of the city, can be as much as 4C (8F) hotter than the Philadelphia average, according to city officials. Leafier, wealthier suburbs can be as much as 7C (14F) cooler than the average. Being poor often means hotter homes, waiting in the sun at bus stops rather than sitting in air-conditioned Ubers, and being unable to escape to cooler climes on vacation.
“When it gets real hot I try to keep an eye on the older residents,” says Joann Taylor, who has lived in the largely black and Latino district of Hunting Park for 47 years. “They don’t have air conditioning, so I just tell them to keep the blinds closed. The houses could do with some updates to cope with the heat.”
We encounter this feeling … that perhaps once you’ve acclimated to the weather, you’re no longer as vulnerable. Obviously, that’s not true
Philadelphia has embarked upon a mission to slash its greenhouse gas emissions, plant hundreds of thousands of new trees, and upgrade its parks in order to provide a haven from the warmth. But the spectre of a particularly deadly summer – perhaps a repeat of July 1993 when 118 people died in Philadelphia due to heat – feels ominously close. Without a severe drop in emissions, Philadelphia will spend around 100 days a year above 32C (90F) within 30 years, double the number of hot days experienced in 2000.
“I think what scares me is that the projections are that things are only going to get worse,” says Christine Knapp, director of Philadelphia’s office of sustainability, sitting in her mercifully cool office as the city endured the latest in a string of days over 30C (86F).
“This heatwave is very emblematic of what we will likely continue to have. My aunt lives in Arizona where it’s hot all the time. They set up [Phoenix] knowing that was a desert; you go from your air-conditioned car between air-conditioned spaces. They are hotter but they’re better prepared than we are.”
But while Phoenix’s buildings are newer and largely air conditioned, any power outage can cause an emergency situation. And familiarity with the burning sun doesn’t provide any protection from it – of the 155 people who died in the Phoenix area last summer, all but three were from Arizona.
“We encounter this feeling from the populace that perhaps once you’ve acclimated to the weather here or you’ve lived here for a certain amount of time, you’re no longer really as vulnerable to the heat,” says Kate Goodin, an epidemiologist at the health department of Maricopa County, in which Phoenix sits. “Obviously, that’s not true socially or biologically.”
Phoenix is looking to create long corridors of shade-providing trees to allow people to venture out of their homes and cars during the day.
But the future warmth will be brutal and lengthy. Maricopa County will spend two-thirds of the typical year in heat of more 37C (100C) by the time today’s preschoolers are drawing a pension. Further adaption will be possible, but the ability to carve out a comfortable life in the desert is being gradually dismantled.
Those wealthy enough to move have an escape route. Disadvantaged communities face starker realities. “There’s some system changes that we need to be making so that people can live within this community if they so choose,” Goodin says.
Though the federal government is currently trying to extricate itself from the scientific reality of climate change, at some point it will have to deal with the societal implications of huge swathes of the country requiring expensive modifications to support a human populace.
“It’s only a matter of time until the west is completely insufficiently prepared for climate change,” says Brian Petersen, a climate change and planning academic at Northern Arizona University. “If we really wanted to be prepared we would be doing a lot of different things that we’re not doing.

It's use is to keep the external skin of the building cool. That's why (in Sydney) the eastern offices are chilly in the morning while the western side is stuffy. It reverses in the afternoon.
2. A residential property that requires air conditioning has been badly sited, badly designed & badly built. However just as long as the property developer makes a buck, that's OK.
3. High rise residential property costs more to build & maintain than the same number of dwellings spread as single to 3 storey low rise. And with the latter options you get added benefits like cross ventilation, a garden, privacy, enough roof for solar power for all residents, potential to harvest rainwater and so on. But this option requires population control & is less profitable for property developers & their pet politicians.

1) The urban heat island effect is merely a reaction to the energy partitioning within the urban fabric. To solve the urban heat island problem, such energy partitioning must be properly understood. 2) The urban heat island effect is not a dome of hot air over the city. The temperature at ground level shows multiple gradients, cliffs and spikes, walk slowly 100 m and you will feel it.3) An interesting fact it’s that the maximum temperature difference at ground level between locations within a city and nearby rural areas (i.e. urban heat island effect) observed all around the world is around 7°C. This is apparently the urban heat island cap.4) Indeed, urban greenery is an efficient mitigation measure against urban heat. Trees provide shade and moisture, improving thermal comfort in DRY and SUNNY cities. In a city like Singapore, where humidity is always above 70%, more moisture in the air won’t really help. Singapore’s folks know very well that humidity is the problem.2) Covering buildings with plants might provide some indoor insulation, and thus reduce air conditioning use.

Anyway, I accept that the idea of a radical change in global society in the form of planned economic shrinkage, and the concomitant global downgrades in human expectations of quality of life, will be required, I don't see how that can possibly be achieved at this point. 
We humans always play brinkmanship. And if we're to survive this episode of playing chicken, I think we need various strategies. Maybe eventually we'll get to the radical (and common sense) proposals in the video, but in the mean time we need to get from here to there, and survive. 
And it's very possible, or perhaps even likely, that we are too late to stave off extremely bad outcomes that could even spell the end the the current cycle of civilisation, and perhaps even humanity itself. 
I accept that building power stations is time consuming and costly, but nuclear, if backed to the hilt, would still be a more effective way of reducing carbon, at this point, than just renewable and fossil fuels. I think that's pretty clear. 
Bearing in mind we're not  about to change the global world order from one of growth to one of carefully managed shrinkage right now, it seems like in the mean time we need to be more serious about carbon reduction than we are, and embrace nuclear (which, if approached right, could dovetail with our crazy economic growth ideal). 
That said, the video basically makes me just think we're fucked either way, which is pretty much what I thought anyway.

Less large areas of heat absorbing glass on the outside of buildings would make a good start. In most countries round the Mediterranean houses have shutters which are kept closed during the day. Failing that, a heat reflecting film on the glass can cut out 10% or more of heat from the sun.

Look around any urban centre and you’ll see the built environment itself exacerbates summer temperatures.
Vehicles stuck in traffic emitting heat. Airconditioners pumping waste heat into the air. Concrete and asphalt across almost every surface, absorbing and radiating the sun’s rays. Urban canyons formed between tall buildings, trapping heat at the street level.
All these factors contribute towards a phenomenon called the “urban heat island” effect, which results in cities being up to 10C hotter than the surrounding countryside. How do we to tackle this?
A typical response on a hot day might be to turn up the aircon. But this fuels a vicious circle of heating the outdoors to cool the indoors, making external spaces more uncomfortable still, and at a significant cost. Airconditioning currently accounts for around one-fifth of building-related global electricity usage, or 2.5 timesthe total electricity use in Africa.
With a warming climate and rapid population growth in hotter, increasingly wealthy countries, our use of airconditioning is set to skyrocket in what the International Energy Agency calls a “looming cold crunch”. They estimate that the energy needed for cooling buildings will triple by 2050 – a growth equivalent to the current electricity demand in the USA and Germany combined.
In the US heatwaves kill more people on average than any other natural disaster
Yet our disproportionately warm cities do not simply pose an energy challenge. Ultimately, urban temperature presents us with life-or-death situations; an increase in mortality and strokes is reported when temperatures head above 25C. In the US heatwaves kill more people on average than any other natural disaster, while in the UK heat-related deaths are set to increase 257% by 2050 and 535% by 2080. And it is not just an issue in hot countries – in Moscow an estimated 11,000 people died due to a heatwave in 2010.
With the frequency and intensity of heatwaves increasing we need to urgently tackle the excess heat we face both inside our buildings, and in our cities’ outside spaces. Fortunately, there are many ways in which we can mitigate the urban heat island effect – while also creating more attractive places to live, work and play.
As is obvious to anyone who has sat under a tree on a hot day, vegetation can be a powerful tool in the fight against excessive city heat. Not only does greenery provide shade, it stimulates evapotranspiration, the process by which water evaporating from plants’ leaves reduces the adjacent air temperature.
Many cities recognise the value of parks and trees for urban cooling, not to mention residents’ psychological wellbeing, but few have embraced greenery to the extent of Singapore. The city-state embarked on its ambitious “garden city” plan in 1967 through intensive tree-planting and the creation of new parks. As the population grew and buildings got taller, the focus shifted to include skyrise greenery encompassing “skygardens”, vertical planting and green roofs.
Today Singapore accommodates 100 hectares (240 acres) of skyrise greenery, with plans to increase this to 200 ha by 2030 – an area equivalent to Regent’s Park. This growth is fuelled by building regulations such as the Landscaping for Urban Spaces and High-Rises (Lush) policy. Lush requires any new building to include areas of greenery equivalent to the size of the development site. These can be at ground level or at height, and often include luxuriantly planted balconies, shaded skygardens and vertical green walls – which can help cause temperatures to drop by 2-3ºC.
Many new buildings go far beyond the minimum required. The Oasia Hotel, designed by WOHA Architects, accommodates greenery across virtually every surface. Wrapped in a dramatic 200m-tall planted trellis, the building almost drips with vegetation, and is wildly at odds with the corporate steel and glass of many urban structures.
“We’ve almost created, in some ways, the notion of a huge tree in the city,” says Wong Mun Summ, Founding Director at WOHA. “[It’s] a device in the city that really supports a thriving eco-system three-dimensionally in a very dense environment.” The result is a building that accommodates greenery equivalent to 11 times its own footprint. As well as cooling, such abundant vegetation contributes many other benefits too – absorbing pollutants from the air, producing oxygen and creating a calming, natural setting within the hyper-dense city.
If we are to make cities cooler we must also change the materials they’re built from. Urban areas are dominated by dark and hard materials – concrete, asphalt, paving – most of which absorb, rather than reflect, solar radiation. According to Australia’s Cooperative Research Centre for Low Carbon Living, conventional paving can reach temperatures up to 67C and conventional roofs up to 50–90C on a hot day.
Such temperatures can have significant health impacts. According to Arthur Rosenfeld of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, living on the top floor of a building with a dark roof was identified as a risk factor of mortality in the 1995 heatwave in Chicago. “Government has a role to ban or phase out the use of black or dark roofs, at least in warm climates, because they pose a large negative health risk,” he said.
The best way to overcome this is to use cool coatings– typically lighter pigments in asphalt or white-coloured coatings applied to roads, roofs and facades, which reflect more solar energy away from the city.
The New York Cools Roofs initiative, for example, has seen more than 500,000m² of roof space covered in a white reflective coating, saving an estimated 2,282 tonnes of CO2 per year from cooling emissions. Cool roofs are installed at no cost in public buildings, for non-profit organisations and in affordable housing. In other buildings free labour for installation is offered by the city with the owner just paying for the materials.
It may sound simple, but the results can be significant – research by Nasa has suggested a white roof could be 23C (42F) cooler than a typical black roof on the hottest day of the New York summer.
In Los Angeles, it’s roads, not roofs, that arethe challenge. More than 10% of the city’s land area is black asphalt, which absorbs up to 95% of the sun’s energy, contributing to the urban heat island. The city is responding by painting roads in a white-coloured sealant with a high reflectivity, at a cost of $40,000 per mile. Initial measurements suggest a reduction in temperature of 10-15ºF, though one road was found to be as much as 23F cooler after painting.
Water has been used as a tool to cool cities for centuries. The 14th century palace of Alhambra, for example, housed courtyards with pools and arching fountains, stimulating the evaporation of water and cooling the hot, dry Andalusian air.
The contemporary heat-proof city could follow suit, accommodating ponds, pools, fountains, sprinklers and misting systems to cool outdoor spaces.
Chongqing is known as one of the “three furnaces” of the Yangtze River Delta, given its long hot summers. To provide moments of relief, the city is experimenting by using water misters at local bus stops. These spray clouds of water chilled to 5-7C, cooling the air as well as the waiting passengers.
Combining water with other urban cooling strategies can yield significant temperature reductions. The University of New South Wales, the CRCLCL and Sydney Water studied the urban heat island effect in western Sydney, where temperatures can often be 6–10C hotter than the coastal regions of the city little more than 15 miles away and found that adding water features and cool coatings would reduce cooling requirements by 29–43% and lower the overall average air temperature by 1.5C. Temperatures taken adjacent to water features were up to 10C lower, the study found.
One of the challenges in keeping the built environment cool is overreliance on fully-glazed facades. Many windows permit desirable natural light and views but can mean buildings trap unwanted heat in summer and don’t retain it in winter. We can easily design shading systems to protect buildings from the sun, but for the best possible results, these shading systems need to move in tune with the local weather and the path of the sun.
A radical example is in Abu Dhabi, where summer temperatures rise as high as 48C and buildings need to be shielded from the harsh desert sun. The Al Bahr Towers take inspiration from a Middle Eastern shading device known as a mashrabiya. Historically, these are wooden screens, patterned with Islamic geometry to allow for filtered light and views while protecting inhabitants from the intensity of the sun. But the modern mashrabiya in the Al Bahr Towers move to create a dramatic, adaptable façade, estimated to reduce the building’s CO2 emissions by 20%.
A building management system operates 1,049 hexagon-shaped shades, opening and closing them like flowers. Their movements follow the sun, shading the parts of the building in direct sunlight but opening up to allow for natural light as the sun moves by.
The result is a constantly changing and adapting façade, one that reflects daily and seasonal patterns of weather, climate and occupation and responds to changing needs of heat and light. Adaptable buildings and infrastructure like this one, which can morph to respond to different seasons and weather events, will be crucial in the future battle to keep cool and comfortable in a warming climate.

There was speculation that maximum temperature records could be broken, perhaps reaching 48C (118.4F) inland. But the mercury only reached a peak of 45.4C, in Évora, Portugal.
The relief from the heat was partly thanks to the arrival of a cold front, along which thunderstorms developed. 
The storms also reached into the similarly sweltering south of France, causing temperatures to drop hugely and stay closer to the seasonal average.
However, the heavy downpours brought by the thunderstorms caused severe flash flooding, requiring the evacuation of about 1,600 people from the Gard region of France, as the Ardèche and Cèze rivers burst their banks.
The devastating California wildfire season has also continued. The so-called Holy Fire forced the evacuation of more than 21,000 people around the Orange county area.

The US interior department administers over $5.5bn in funding to external organizations, mostly for research, conservation and land acquisition. At the beginning of 2018, interior secretary Ryan Zinke instated a new requirement that scientific funding above $50,000 must undergo an additional review to ensure expenditures “better align with the administration’s priorities”.
Zinke has signaled that climate change is not one of those priorities: this week, he told Breitbart News that “environmental terrorist groups” were responsible for the ongoing wildfires in northern California and, ignoring scientific research on the issue, dismissed the role of climate change.
Steve Howke, one of Zinke’s high-school football teammates, oversees this review. Howke’s highest degree is a bachelor’s in business administration. Until Zinke appointed him as an interior department senior adviser to the acting assistant secretary of policy, management and budget, Howke had spent his entire career working in credit unions. 
The department, which manages a significant portion of the US landmass, has attributed the slower pace of funding approval to efforts to reduce “waste, fraud and abuse”. Yet the policy, which has been in place for six months, is already hindering some research. One of the largest programs affected is the Climate Adaptation Science Centers, a network of eight regionally focused research centers located at “host” universities across the country.
“I think there is a real suspicion about what science is being done, and if you were going to design a way to bog things down so not much could happen, you might do it like this,” said a scientist affiliated with one of the centers who asked to remain anonymous owing to the perceived risks of speaking out. “We have voiced the challenges we have hiring staff, hiring students, with the science we can do, but I think that we’re not a priority audience.”
Initially authorized by Congress during the Bush administration, the centers have been widely viewed as a success and received strong bipartisan support.
“We really are just trying to do the best science that we can,” said Renee McPherson, a University of Oklahoma environmental researcher who is head of the center focusing on the southern-central US. It is McPherson’s job to understand how changes in climate extremes in the region can lead to such disasters as record wildfires in New Mexico in 2011 and 2012 or 2017’s Hurricane Harvey in Texas.
But due to the funding delays, McPherson said that this year she did not encourage scientists at her center to recruit new students and postdocs, and she didn’t bring on any new students for her own group. 
“It does pose problems when you’re wanting to continue your research,” she said. “[Our stakeholders] want answers sooner rather than later, especially if they’re undergoing severe drought conditions right now or they just had extensive flooding.”
Every administration brings new priorities to the cabinet departments, but in agencies that fund science, this is usually reflected in the subject areas of calls for proposals. The awarding procedures – rigorous reviews of proposals conducted by agency staff with relevant scientific expertise – stay the same. “We are not used to an additional political review on top of that,” McPherson said.
“Funneling every grant over $50,000 to a single political appointee from departments that range from the Bureau of Indian Affairs to the [US Geological Survey] to the Bureau of Reclamation suggests a political micromanagement approach,” said David Hayes, an interior deputy secretary in the Obama and Clinton administrations who now directs the State Energy and Environmental Impact Center at the NYU School of Law. He described it as “political interference” that is “both unprecedented and pernicious”.
Scientists with the US Geological Survey – the interior department agency to which the centers belong – now require approval from Washington DC before speaking to the media in any context, and have faced restrictions on attending conferences.
And earlier this year, it was revealed that political appointees at the National Park Service attempted to censor a scientific report by removing every mention of the human causes of climate change.
“It’s hard to have any conclusion other than the administration is looking to steer the science in a political direction,” Hayes said. Many scientists affiliated with the climate adaptation centers concurred.
“It feels like an effort to create obstacles to success,” said one. “My concern is, are they creating an environment that will prevent us from being successful as an excuse then to not fund us in the future?”
Dennis Ojima, a professor of ecosystem science and sustainability at Colorado State University who heads the North Central Climate Adaptation Center, complained of months-long delays.
“The uncertainty that we have is compounding with every week,” Ojima said. “For teams that are trying to initiate new research it’s difficult to get the graduate students and postdocs lined up.”
Neither Howke nor the interior department responded to a request for comment.
Senators Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Mazie Hirono of Hawaii authored a letter to Zinke in June, signed by 10 other senators, after hearing complaints from organizations that hadn’t received expected interior department funding and were forced to cancel programs as a result. The Chicago Botanic Garden, for instance, lost funding for its National Seed Strategy program, meant to guide restoration and resilience programs for landscapes affected by extreme climate events.
Scott Cameron, the deputy assistant secretary who supervises Howke, responded by citing several examples of funds that had previously been awarded inappropriately or mismanaged by awardees as justification for the policy. The letter also said the department is suffering from understaffing, the review process is “still evolving,” and that “when the focus is on getting money out quickly, waste, fraud and abuse has a higher probability of occurring”.

The Australian government had proposed using a broad energy policy, called the National Energy Guarantee, to bring in a carbon emissions reductions target in the energy sector of 26% by 2030, which would have helped Australia meet its obligations under the Paris climate agreement.
But the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, was forced into an embarrassing backdown on Monday after opposition within his Coalition government and amid mounting speculation that he could face a leadership challenge.
A group of conservative MPs threatened to vote against the legislation on the floor of Australia’s lower house, a move that would have constituted a crisis of confidence in Turnbull’s leadership.
The rebel MPs were led by Australia’s former prime minister, Tony Abbott, who Turnbull seized the leadership from in 2015. The pair have a history of bitter disagreement over emissions policy.
Abbott, who signed Australia up to the Paris climate agreement in 2014, said using energy policy to reduce emissions was “madness”.
“I am just interested in trying to ensure that Australians have the lowest possible power prices and that people’s jobs are safe ... what that means is that we stop running a power system to reduce emissions,” he said.
To placate the dissenters, Turnbull late last week moved to strip the emissions reduction target from the legislation.
That did little to assuage the concerns of Turnbull’s internal opponents. Government MPs began sounding out conservative figurehead, Peter Dutton, the home affairs minister, for a possible leadership challenge. Abbott reportedly said he would give his support to Dutton.
The Coalition held an emergency meeting on Sunday night to discuss the energy policy, and a poll published at roughly the same time showed a significant in decrease in support for the government, piling more pressure on Turnbull.
On Monday, Turnbull capitulated and announced he would not include any emissions reduction target in his National Energy Guarantee policy. He said it was clear the government, which holds only a single-seat majority in the lower house, did not have the numbers.
“Now in politics you have to focus on what you can deliver and that’s what we’ve done and will continue to do,” Turnbull said on Monday. Turnbull said he had “absolute support” of his party and Dutton.
The decisions earned him the praise of maverick Coalition MPs. One conservative, George Christensen, a Queensland senator, said of Turnbull’s decision: “We have a new energy policy thanks to a band of ‘Liberal National rebels’ who stood firm and fought for common sense.”
The debate comes as Australia deals with unusually early bushfires in the state of New South Wales. Environmental scientists have described the winter fires as “mind-bending”, and “unusual in the extreme”, and say climate change is extending the normal bushfire season.
Successive Australian governments have struggled to implement climate and energy policies. Attempts to legislate mechanisms to reduce emissions have done enormous damage to former Labor prime ministers Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard.
Rudd faced a sustained and highly effective campaign over plans to introduce an emissions trading scheme in the late 2000s, and Gillard’s carbon pricing mechanism was attacked relentlessly in the lead-up to the 2013 election, which Labor lost.
The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, seized on Turnbull’s backdown on Monday and described him as the “white flag prime minister”. “Mr Turnbull has demonstrated that he is not the leader this nation needs,” Shorten said.
“Real leadership is about fighting for the principles you believe in. Real leadership is about not always giving in to your enemies every time they disagree with you..”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/aug/20/australian-pm-dumps-key-climate-policy-to-stave-off-leadership-revolt

Rising temperatures in the Arctic have slowed the circulation of the jet stream and other giant planetary winds, says the paper, which means high and low pressure fronts are getting stuck and weather is less able to moderate itself.
The authors of the research, published in Nature Communications on Monday, warn this could lead to “very extreme extremes”, which occur when abnormally high temperatures linger for an unusually prolonged period, turning sunny days into heat waves, tinder-dry conditions into wildfires, and rains into floods.
“This summer was where we saw a very strong intensity of heatwaves. It’ll continue and that’s very worrying, especially in the mid-latitudes: the EU, US, Russia and China,” said one of the coauthors, Dim Coumou from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. “Short-term heatwaves are quite pleasant, but longer term they will have an impact on society. It’ll have an affect on agricultural production. Harvests are already down this year for many products. Heatwaves can also have a devastating impact on human health.”
Circulation stalling has long been a concern of climate scientists, though most previous studies have looked at winter patterns. The new paper reviews research on summer trends, where it says there is mounting evidence of planetary wind systems – both low-level storm tracks and higher waves in the troposphere – losing their ability to shift the weather.
One cause is a weakening of the temperature gradient between the Arctic and Equator as a result of man-made greenhouse gas emissions. The far north of the Earth is warming two to four times faster than the global average, says the paper, which means there is a declining temperature gap with the central belt of the planet. As this ramp flattens, winds struggle to build up sufficient energy and speed to push around pressure systems in the area between them.
As a result, there is less relief in the form of mild and wet air from the sea when temperatures accumulate on land, and less relief from the land when storms build up in the ocean. Last year, Hurricane Harvey had a devastating impact on Texas because it was parked an unusually long time on the coast, where it kept drawing up moisture from the sea and dumping it in the form of the greatest deluge ever recorded in the US. Scientists had previously noted that hurricanes are slowing and bringing more rain.
A separate new paper in Scientific Reports indicated that the trapping of planetary airstreams – a phenomenon known as amplified quasi-stationary waves – also contributed to the 2016 wildfires in Alberta, which took two months to extinguish and ended as the costliest disaster in Canadian history with total damages reaching 4.7bn Canadian dollars.
“Clearly, the planetary wave pattern wasn’t the only cause for the fire – yet it was an additional important factor triggering a deplorable disaster,” says lead author Vladimir Petoukhov from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. “In fact, our analysis reveals that beyond that single event, actually from the 1980s on, planetary waves were a significant factor for wildfire risks in the region.”
He said wave pattern studies will help forest managers and fire forecasters because changes can be detected ahead of their impacts.
However, scientists are also concerned that slowing circulation could produce “surprises”, by amplifying other climate changes.
“Simple warming is well understood in climate models, but scientists are trying to understand non-linearities, how climate change effects interact with one another and how feedback processes are involved,” said Coumou. “Non-linearities can rapidly change weather conditions in a given region so you get more abrupt changes.”
Scientists unconnected with the paper said it highlighted the risks of disturbing natural weather patterns.
“What happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic. By upsetting the energy balance of the planet we are changing the temperature gradient between the equator and the pole. This in turn sets in motion major reorganisations of the flow patterns of the atmosphere and ocean,” said Chris Rapley, professor of climate science at University College London. “The consequences are emerging and they are disruptive, and likely to become even more profoundly so. We are on a journey and the destination doesn’t look good.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/20/summer-weather-is-getting-stuck-due-to-arctic-warming

But it must take risks, 16 August). His suggested solution “that the world needs to wage war against climate change” misses the most important component. Climate change is driven by climate changers: you and me and 7.6 billion fellow humans, increasing by 83 million a year and with effects on much more than climate change.
Benign and non-coercive means to reverse that growth, to achieve something like the 2.5 to 3 billion that experts estimate the planet could sustainably support, are well known. They include the much wider and free provision of reproductive health services, including family planning, to all who need them, and of both general and health education especially to the large number of the world’s girls currently denied them. Richard VernonOxford
• Larry Elliott is right about much in his article, but he also demonstrates why capitalism remains a major inhibitor to addressing climate change meaningfully. He distinguishes between different types of economic growth, refusing to acknowledge that it is moderating appetites for consumption and redistributing assets and resources that are fundamental to remaining within requisite limits. That squeamishness around saying “enough” alone may prove fatal.
The massive scaling up of investment in clean technology is needed, not because the amount spent on it worldwide last year merely matched the cost of climate-related losses in the US, but because without it, and many other interventions we are writing the death sentences of billions as this century progresses.
As Elliott suggests, it wasn’t capitalism, but states funding the best brains when the need (or, in the case of the space race, the policy) required, that delivered profound innovation in the past. The motivation to act must be humanitarian, not capitalist, if there is to be any prospect of success.Dave HunterBristol
• Larry Elliott rightly recommends we learn from the Chinese model of managed and directed capitalism. He might also have mentioned the 1,000 new towns that China is planning to build or the 100 smart cities the Indian government is backing. The overwhelming need to double housing output in the UK provides an exceptional opportunity here to use the demand to rebuild our economy and overstretched local infrastructure, and reduce carbon emissions.
Here we should be learning from the rest of Europe on how to mobilise appropriate land and share the uplift in land values. A new report for the Greater London Assembly – Capital gains: a better land assembly model for London – shows what can be done, provided we join up infrastructure and development.Dr Nicholas FalkExecutive director, the Urbed Trust
• Your article (What would a heat-proof city look like? theguardian.com, 15 August) has some good and workable ideas about making roofs and roads reflect more sunlight. But the modifications to tall buildings by adding planting and “dynamic shades” are just tinkering with problems that shouldn’t be created in the first place.
Recent research in Hong Kong and London has shown that energy use increases very sharply with increasing height of buildings. British offices on 20 storeys have twice the carbon emissions of comparable offices on five storeys. The property industry assumes that tall buildings have to be air conditioned. And the popular wisdom is that building high is necessary to save land. But just look at the two Al Bahr towers in Abu Dhabi pictured in the article, surrounded by acres of open space. In fact high densities can be achieved in low-rise developments in streets or courtyards.
Traditional cities are kept cool without air conditioning by their tree-lined streets and parks and gardens providing much greater benefits than bits of token greenery wrapped around high-rises.Philip SteadmanEmeritus professor of urban and built form studies and research fellow, Energy Institute, University College London

...and when combined 
More UK electricity was produced by wind and solar sources last year than by nuclear power stations, for the first time according to the latest government figures .../... Renewables’ share of electricity generation shot up to 29 per cent, while nuclear sources accounted for around 21 per cent.
BQENDHi Loco -
That's very true on average of course but I would say that the issue raised relates to the hidden costs of externalities:-
i.e.
1./ It is not a competition between renewable and nuclear energy any more than it is a competition between wind and solar - which also have vastly different costs and levels of intermittency (capacity factors.)2./ A grid (demand) cannot be met by an average supply.
 The advantage of nuclear replacing coal and gas is that it is a direct replacement for them - no significant changes need to be made to the grid to accommodate its presence.
That is not true of intermittent supplies such as wind and solar which need a larger grid (lower density) to connect up all those disparate wind and solar farms, EFR (frequency control mechanisms) and trunk lines to shunt power from area to area (where it is windy to where it is not) and to/from energy storage - These are costs in addition to power generation and are 100% borne by the consumer - in addition to which a fairly large gas component is 'baked' into the system because every now and then storage will run empty and demand will outstrip supply.
The example of Australia is a good one.Australia is perhaps the perfect 'renewables only' platform in a developed country.Their solar output has parity with aircon demand and their wind open plains offer extremely cheap land on which to plant solar and wind farms with far lower seasonal variability then with a country like the UK.
So there is a lie being told here - the media has sold the populist lie that the necessary grid enhancements to the Australian grid (necessary for it to adopt a more intermittent supply) are not necessary, calling them 'gold plating' when in reality they are essential to keeping the grid stable.
The fact is that network costs such as expansion to solar/wind farms, cable and transformer upgrades, frequency control (EFR like the small Tesla battery in SA that everyone got so stoked about) and pumped storage are all required to transition from coal to intermittent renewables and work (spending) on this has barely begun.
So it's all perfectly possible to have a grid with an intermittent supply - but we mustn't fool ourselves that it is only the cost of that supply to be paid for.There are all the externalities, each with their own carbon footprints - and none of which produce a single Joule of energy yet it still all has to be paid for on top of generation and operator margin.

Basically everything in your post is wrong, or a lie.

But we haven't got a cheap renewable technology that will effectively replace existing fossil fuels, even if activists claim suitable technologies exist because they simply don't exist in forms that are despatchable, cheap, safe and industrial scale.
BQEND
You can't replace all fossil fuels overnight. BUT there is plenty of evidence from other countries that renewable energy, plus smart demand management, a more flexible grid and a combination of domestic and grid storage can reduce emissions very significantly.
As for cheap, according to your own government :
The Australian continent has the highest solar radiation per square metre of any continent and consequently some of the best solar energy resource in the world. 
....and since Saudi Arabia can get a 300MW solar farm built for 2.34 US cents per KwHr, why can't you ?
As for safe, surely this is a joke ? Coal plants are known to produce particulates that cause all sorts of nasty diseases and premature death. The OECD estimates that PM2.5 emissions are responsible for about 740 preventable deaths in Australia each year. How does that compare with solar or wind ?
As for industrial scale, India says it intends to launch a tender for 100 gigawatts of solar power, 10 times the size of the current largest solar tender in the world – another Indian project scheduled to open for bids next month.
It's possible to eliminate a huge proportion of the emissions from fossil fuel electricity generation very quickly indeed. Your country simply needs to have the will to do it.

Labor inherited a dream from the previous government and drove the country into debt by handing out the money liberally. Australia was sheltered from the GFC due to a variety of factors; Labor’s stimulus was only a part of that story.
BQEND
What a complete rewriting of history. The Coalition left a structural deficit. They were rated using IMF figures as the most profligate government in Australia's history. They received windfall mining revenue of over $330 billion dollars and sold off $72 billion of our assets and only left $20 billion in the kitty after they pissed the rest up the wall. 
When Labor left government we had the best performing economy in the OECD and most likely the world with the third lowest debt to GDP ratio. Swan won treasurer of the year and the IMF changed their advice to countries on the basis of the success of Labor's stimulus. Joseph Stiglitz described Labor's stimulus as 'almost perfect'. The BER provided much needed infrastructure for schools that were left to rot under Howard who only gave them flagpoles. 
Only in Australia did lying scumbag right wingers claim that they were 'the worst government ever'. Best in the world = worst. Third lowest debt to GDP ratio in the world and we had a 'debt and deficit disaster' that was about to destroy the economy. Funny that since the Coalition have doubled the debt without a GFC the problem has miraculously disappeared. Every time the Coalition get power our economic ranking in the OECD falls. Every time Labor gets in our economic ranking in the OECD rises. Nut job right wingers try to convince people that the mining boom was all the hard work of Howard and the GFC was all the fault of Labor. 
The first industry to make mass lay offs when the GFC hit was mining. After Labor brought in their stimulus, China announced their own, which benefited Australia quite a bit but without the initial stimulus the economy would have already crashed. 
The only thing the Coalition is superior at is lying. Their supporters, like yourself are hopeless liars.

Using satellite measurements, this analysis directly quantifies how much the Arctic as viewed from space has darkened in response to the recent sea ice retreat. We find that this decline has caused 6.4 ± 0.9 W/m2 of radiative heating since 1979, considerably larger than expectations from models and recent less direct estimates. Averaged globally, this albedo change is equivalent to 25% of the direct forcing from CO2 during the past 30 y. (my emphasis)

I gave myself 30 minutes because that reflects the fickle care and short-termism that has been afforded climate change in Australia in recent years. 
When I say we don’t have a climate policy, that is the literal truth. 
On Monday the prime minister (goes to check Twitter ... he’s just survived a leadership challenge), Malcolm Turnbull, removed the emissions targets – already too low – from his national energy guarantee.
Three years ago, Australia placed its national target to cut emissions by 26%-28% below 2005 levels by 2030 into the global Paris agreement.
Everyone, including those responsible for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, knows the targets offered up by Australia and other countries are too low to reach the goal of keeping global warming “well below 2C” – a guardrail which, many scientists now believe, was itself inadequate.
You can ask all those suffering worsening droughts, wildfires and rising sea levels whether they think things are going to get cheerier as the 1C of warming we’ve already had starts to feed back on to itself with the help of increasing levels of CO2 in the atmosphere.
Outside the United States you will struggle to find any major industry association or company – including the World Coal Association – that disagrees with the Paris deal.
In Australia, all the major big business groups, from the Australian Industry Group to the Business Council of Australia to the coal-boosters at the Minerals Council of Australia, thought the Neg was a good idea. They also back Australia’s Paris targets. 
What might this tell you about the Neg and its ability to move Australia away from business-as-usual to the kind of policy that would be grounded in the reality of the risks – both economic and physical – that climate change represents? It tells you that the “policy” was never about climate change. 
What does it tell you about the emissions targets? It tells you that they were inadequate when it came to causing many of those big interests to invest in real change – to start to rethink their business plans to fit into a decarbonising world. Better to lobby for the status quo.
At the heart of all of this – the putrid rotten core that’s undermined all previous attempts to pull Australia and the world out of its spiral of climate impacts – has been a denial of the science of climate change.
That rejection by some right-wingers of a falsely perceived “leftist” cause of climate change has fed the policy uncertainty. Too many politicians have stood by and allowed that denial to fester.
It’s given us phrases such as “technology neutral” and “energy poverty” when what we needed to hear were phrases such as “climate leadership” and “public safety”. 
Can the Australian voting public and any fair-minded politician seriously allow the country’s energy and climate “policy” to be dictated by a core led by Tony Abbott – who rejects the science that’s backed by every major scientific institution in the world?
No matter how many winks and screams you get from the conservative commentators, right-wing shock jocks and the alt-right, this is where we are at. Hostage to a groupthink that’s divorced from reality. Some people need to grow a backbone.

We must not offer credibility to those who deny it | Letters,article,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/26/climate-change-is-real-we-must-not-offer-credibility-to-those-who-deny-it,0,"We are no longer willing to lend our credibility to debates over whether or not climate change is real. It is real. We need to act now or the consequences will be catastrophic. In the interests of “balance”, the media often feels the need to include those who outright deny the reality of human-triggered climate change.
Balance implies equal weight. But this then creates a false equivalence between an overwhelming scientific consensus and a lobby, heavily funded by vested interests, that exists simply to sow doubt to serve those interests. Yes, of course scientific consensus should be open to challenge – but with better science, not with spin and nonsense. We urgently need to move the debate on to how we address the causes and effects of dangerous climate change – because that’s where common sense demands our attention and efforts should be.
Fringe voices will protest about “free speech”. No one should prevent them from expressing their views, whether held cynically or misguidedly. However, no one is obliged to provide them with a platform, much less to appear alongside them to give the misleading impression that there is something substantive to debate. When there is an article on smoking, newspapers and broadcasters no longer include lobbyists claiming there are no links to cancer. When there’s a round-the-world yacht race we don’t hear flat-earthers given airtime: “This is madness; they’ll sail off the edge!”
There’s a workable model for covering fringe views – which is to treat them as such. They don’t need to be ridiculed, just expected to challenge the evidence with better evidence, and otherwise ignored. As campaigners and thinkers who are led by science and the precautionary principle, and who wish to debate the real and vital issues arising from human-triggered climate change, we will not assist in creating the impression that climate denial should be taken seriously by lending credence to its proponents, by entertaining ideas that lack any basis in fact. Therefore we will no longer debate those who deny that human-caused climate change is real. There are plenty of vital debates to be had around climate chaos and what to do about it; this is simply no longer one of them. We urge broadcasters to move on, as we are doing.

Previous research has shown that many food crops become less nutritious when grown under the CO2 levels expected by 2050, with reductions of protein, iron and zinc estimated at 3–17%.
Now experts say such changes could mean that by the middle of the century about 175 million more people develop a zinc deficiency, while 122 million people who are not currently protein deficient could become so.
In addition, about 1.4 billion women of childbearing age and infants under five years old will be living in regions where there will be the highest risk of iron deficiency.
Among other problems, zinc deficiencies are linked to troubles with wound healing, infections and diarrhoea; protein deficiencies are linked to stunted growth; and iron deficiencies are tied to complications in pregnancy and childbirth.
“This is another demonstration of how higher CO2 could affect global health that may not be as well recognised,” said Dr Matthew Smith, co-author of the study from the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health. “Continuing to keep up our vigilance around reducing CO2 emissions becomes all the more important because of this research.”
Writing in the journal Nature Climate Change, Smith and co-author Samuel Myers, also from Harvard, describe how they drew on data from a host of sources, including figures from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, to explore food supply in different countries. In total Smith and Myers looked at 225 different foods including wheat, rice, maize and specific vegetables, roots and fruits.
The team also took into account regional differences in the nutrient content of crops and how diet differs with age and sex within countries, using data collated by other researchers from surveys around the world. 
The team then looked at how nutrient intake would change, assuming CO2 levels continue to rise at the current rate.
The results, which cover 151 countries, reveal that it is countries in north Africa, south and south-east Asia and the Middle East that are likely to be among the hardest hit – together with some nations in sub-Saharan Africa. In India, it is estimated that by 2050 about 50 million more people will be zinc deficient, and 38 million more protein deficient. With quality of diet linked to income, the researchers say the poorest in such countries are most likely to be at risk.
By contrast, countries including the US, France and Australia and parts of south America are expected to experience little impact
The team also note that with an estimated 662 million people already protein deficient, and 1.5bn zinc deficient, many people could be pushed into deeper deficiencies as CO2 levels rise.
However the study had limitations, including that it assumed diets would stay constant over the coming years, while it did not take into account that rising CO2 levels might increase the rate of plant growth. The authors note that even if individuals were able to eat more of the plants to get the same nutrient intake, they might end up with other issues like obesity, while climate effects such as increased temperatures and water stress could actually result in an overall decrease in crop yields.
While Smith notes many things could change between now and 2050, he said one possibility for vulnerable countries is to breed crops that are either higher in nutrients or whose nutrient content is resistant to CO2 increases, while other options include looking at fortification of foods or increasing intake of animal-sourced foods.
Dr Kai Zhu, assistant professor of environmental studies at UC Santa Cruz who was not involved in the study, said the study offered a clear message that climate change has a significant impact on human health.
“If no actions are taken, additional millions to billions of people will be nutrition deficient because of rising CO2, and the most vulnerable regions in the world will suffer the greatest impacts,” he said. “Future public health policies have to take climate change into consideration.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/aug/27/climate-change-will-make-hundreds-of-millions-more-people-nutrient-deficient

City heatwaves could lead to two to three times as many deaths by 2050, the report says. By 2100, without a reduction in emissions, the state could see a 77% increase in the average area burned by wildfires. The report also warns of erosion of up to 67% of its famous coastline, up to an 8.8F (4.9C) rise in average maximum temperatures, and billions of dollars in damages.
“These findings are profoundly serious and will continue to guide us as we confront the apocalyptic threat of irreversible climate change,” said the state’s governor, Jerry Brown, in a tweet about the report, the fourth statewide climate change assessment released since 2006.
Rising temperaturescould lead to up to 11,300 additional deaths in 2050, the report says, and the overall number of days marked by extreme heat will “increase exponentially in many areas”.
The effects of those extreme heat days will probably weigh most heavily on the state’s most vulnerable residents, including the more than 100,000 people who are homeless in California, many of whom live on the streets without reliable access to fans, air conditioners, or running water.
“The 2006 heatwave killed over 600 people, resulted in 16,000 emergency department visits, and led to nearly $5.4bn in damages,” the assessment reports. “The human cost of these events is already immense, but research suggests that mortality risk for those 65 or older could increase tenfold by the 2090s because of climate change.”
The California energy commission chairman, Robert Weisenmiller, said: “It really forces you to think through what do we do about the more elderly – the more endangered.” The commission was one of three agencies that published the report. “How do we protect them during these intense heat periods?”
As researchers point out in a summary of the findings, cooling mechanisms such as air conditioners can help mitigate the effects of intense heatwaves, but increased electrical consumption can also drive up the emissions responsible for climate change in the first place. And the double threat of wildfires and increased energy consumption can endanger a power grid vital in a crisis.
The “apocalyptic threat” the governor described would present itself in myriad ways in a state prone to extreme weather events like drought and wildfires, said Amir AghaKouchak, an associate professor at the University of California, Irvine, and a researcher who contributed to the assessment.
As climate change progresses, AghaKouchak said, overall rainfall would probably remain the same, but it would come in the form of extreme storms followed by longer periods without rain.
“There will be two consequences: one is more potentially extreme floods, and the other is problems with drought management.”
Intense rainfall after a season of wildfires could also mean more landslides similar to the deadly mudslides in Santa Barbara earlier this year, AghaKouchak said. More rain coming in short bursts was likely to aggravate water management problems in a state already stricken by drought. And drought areas – including much of California – have been shown to warm faster than others, he said.
The North Fork Mono tribe chairman, Hon Ron Goode, who also contributed to the assessment, said it was the first time the state’s native population had been included in the report, despite the fact that native Californians were among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change.
But before colonization, Goode said, the native population would not have been so vulnerable, because it was more mobile and could nimbly adapt to changes in the climate. “They knew how to move around and where to go and let something rest,” he said. “Now, it’s different. We’re locked into our reservations; rancherias; allotment lands. We can’t just run away – those are our lands and that’s it.”
The report offers some suggestions of how to mitigate the disastrous effects it predicts, Weisenmiller said, from land use planning to reducing California’s greenhouse gas emissions, just under half of which come from transportation.
“The good news is that it’s not ‘here’s the dire impact’, but ‘here’s some ways to mitigate the dire impacts’. It should give people some hope,” Weisenmiller said.
But Goode said he was not sure whether to be hopeful. “I won’t say that I’m hopeful. I would like to feel hopeful, but I don’t see it happening right now,” he said. “I don’t see the politicians stumbling over themselves to make that change.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/27/california-climate-change-report-wildfires-jerry-brown

Between your country, Australia, my country, the US and Great Britain it seems a good chunk of the English speaking world has taken leave of their senses.
BQEND
Britain is doing a hell of a lot better than AUS or US. We actually have some sensible policies which have reduced grid intensity by nearly 50% over last few years (carbon floor price, quite a lot of offshore wind and some solar build), and they stuck to building some nuclear which is also necessary in such a high-latitude country. The govt is not in complete denial about climate change - we still have the climate change act, and are (so far) on target for that. And EV support has been reasonable, along with significant rail investment and some minor support for cycling. That's all sensible. 
They are of course _also_ building more airports, doing nothing about home heating (5 times as much energy as the electrical system), failing to reset climate targets in line with Paris, still banning onshore wind and encouraging more fossil development (fracking new coal mines) and dicking about with Brexit which is a massive distraction from things that actually matter (decarbonisation).

Silence from the LNP. I remember thinking at the time, ""surely voters will respect a government-in-waiting that has put so much thought into what were a great set of policies. But no. Mr Turnbull cynically released the LNP policies in the week before the election. And the voting public fell for it - well, enough to return the LNP to power, anyway. Any respect I had for Turnbull evaporated then.So I look at politics with a jaded outlook now. The Cambridge Analytica scandal has shown how powerful forces can manipulate people into voting against their own, their fellow Australians', and the environment's best interests, and the powerful are cynically ready to do so again. I wish, Oh I wish, that Scott Morrison's Christian beliefs put him above such chicanery.

With Turnbull’s resignation about to trigger a byelection in the Sydney seat the former prime minister holds with a margin of 17.7%, the new ReachTel poll funded by the Australia Institute, with a sample size of 886 residents, suggests voters in Wentworth are focused on Morrison’s early steps on climate and energy.
While single-seat polls can be unreliable, the new survey suggests Wentworth voters are in a mood to punish the Liberals after the leadership civil war deposed their popular sitting member, with Labor polling 20%, the Greens 15% and interest in independent candidates in double digits in a poll taken on Monday night.
The disaffection evident in the ReachTel poll echoes antagonistic voter sentiment in two reliable national surveys, the Newspoll and the Guardian Essential survey. Both have picked up a significant anti-Coalition swing in the wake of the leadership debacle – a different voter reaction to previous leadership coups, which delivered the government of the day a bounce.
Three Liberals have signalled interest in running in Wentworth: the former Business Council of Australia executive director Andrew Bragg, who quit his job on Tuesday night; a former Australian ambassador to Israel, Dave Sharma; and the City of Sydney councillor Christine Forster. The ReachTel poll suggests Sharma is polling 34.6%.
Undecided voters are almost as inclined to vote for an independent in the looming contest as for a Liberal candidate. The poll found that 36.5% of undecided voters leaned towards supporting a Liberal, while 32.7% said an independent.
While Morrison is under internal pressure from some quarters in the government to dump the national energy guarantee, withdraw from the Paris agreement and pursue coal-friendly policies, the ReachTel poll suggests this would be a risky position to adopt if the Liberal party wants to hold urban seats like Wentworth.
A majority in the sample, 66.6%, believes the Neg should include an emissions reduction target, which remains a major flashpoint within the Coalition. Almost 60% of the sample thought the Paris target of a 26% to 28% reduction in emissions should be increased.
A larger group, 68.6%, said Morrison would do less to tackle climate change than the prime minister he replaced. Only 10% thought he would do more. Just over half the sample, 50.9%, said they would be less likely to vote Liberal after Morrison brought a lump of coal into question time in February 2017.
The risks of Morrison abandoning climate action extend beyond Wentworth. One of the lower house crossbenchers, Rebekha Sharkie, told Guardian Australia that if the new prime minister “decides to go down the pathway of an energy policy without an emissions reduction component, that is all but withdrawing us from Paris – and that would not sit well with my community at all”.
If the voter backlash ends up costing the Liberals Wentworth, Morrison will lose his one-seat majority in the House of Representatives, which will make the disposition of crossbenchers critically important.
Sharkie said she had spoken to Morrison on Saturday and he had pledged to stand by the government’s commitments to Mayo, made during the byelection when she defeated the Liberal Georgina Downer. She has reserved her position on confidence and supply, and lists the fate of the company tax cuts and the emissions reduction component of the Neg as issues of concern.
Senior figures have pushed back against abandoning the Paris treaty, and Morrison has appointed moderates to the portfolios of foreign affairs and trade. The retiring foreign minister Julie Bishop told reporters that Australia needed to stay the course: “When we sign a treaty, partners should be able to rely upon us.”
She said: “I was part of the party room of August 2015 that unanimously endorsed the targets for the Paris agreement. I believe that Australia has a very high standing as a nation that keeps its commitments, and is part of the overall global effort for better outcomes for the world.”
The resources minister, Matt Canavan – who is pro-coal – said a withdrawal from Paris would hurt Australia’s international reputation.
Morrison’s new ministry was sworn in on Tuesday, and the prime minister’s immediate priorities are drought relief, settling the long-running schools funding row and dealing with high power prices.
The Neg is officially on ice. The new prime minister’s decision to split the energy and environment portfolios during his weekend reshuffle suggests it will remain there.
The prime minister said after the swearing-in ceremony on Wednesday that the immediate priority was power price reductions. He was noncommittal on the fate of the Neg. “There will be continuity in our policy in this area, but there will also be new ideas in this area, to ensure that we get those prices down.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/aug/29/liberals-and-labor-neck-and-neck-in-byelection-race-for-turnbulls-seat-poll

“It is the effect of climate change we need to be aware of that makes the impacts of a drought even worse,” she told the National Press Club.
“As a community, we want to talk about it and the more discussions we have about and the more open people are in talking about it, then the less uncomfortable it becomes.
“But we absolutely have to talk about it and some of the issues that people tiptoe around because they’re worried about offending people or having a discussion about it, then it doesn’t do us any good as a community.”
Simson, a farmer on the Liverpool Plains, described agriculture as a diverse industry and she was highly critical of much of the current media drought coverage of the broken farmer dependent on handouts.
“I use those words “managing drought” deliberately because managing the drought is exactly what we are doing,” she said.
“Many farmers, including me, take offence to the betrayals of the broken-down, handout dependent farmer profile peddled by many members of the media. That simply is not us.”
She was critical of the government for allowing regional communities to cope with drought in the absence of a “comprehensive national framework to deal with drought”.
“Successive governments have had a go, but we are still without certainty that a national strategy would actually provide. In fact, agriculture in its entirety is to date without a whole-of-government national strategy for plan at all.”
In another significant shift in the NFF, Simson also described Indigenous Australians as Australia’s “first farmers” in both her opening acknowledgement of country and her address.
“May I acknowledge Australia’s first farmers, in particular the Ngunnawal people on whose land we meet today,” she said. “I pay my respects to elders past and and acknowledge their historic and continuing role in what is a great story of Australian agriculture.”
“Drought is not a new phenomenon for farmers. Since farming first started under the auspices of our First Australians, drought has been a part of the landscape and a regular part of the farm business cycle.”
Climate change has been a vexed topic for the farm lobby for the past two decades. In 2007, when then prime minister John Howard and Labor opposition leader Kevin Rudd both agreed on action, the NFF said climate change might be the “greatest threat” confronting farmers and their ability to put food on Australian table and the lobby group backed an emissions trading scheme.
After Malcolm Turnbull’s first leadership spill in 2009 over emissions policies which saw Tony Abbott win the Liberal leadership, bipartisanship on climate change ended and the NFF went quiet until Simson took the presidency. In 2017, she recognised that climate change posed a significant challenge for Australian farmers and called for cost-efficient emissions reductions.
As parts of Australia slide into their seventh year of drought and media coverage places increasing pressure on politicians, Simson’s address was the NFF’s most forthright message on climate change yet to government.
It comes less than two weeks after Coalition’s latest energy policy, the National Energy Guarantee, preceded the leadership coup against Malcolm Turnbull.
Simson said while every drought was different, this season was the worst on her farm since 1965 and had “taken many experienced and savvy farmers by surprise”.
“We are at the front line of climate change, increasingly erratic seasons, out-of-season rainfall or no rainfall at all and longer, hotter summers.”
But Simson also pushed back against the suggestion that reducing emissions required culling huge livestock numbers – a suggestion covered in major newspapers that she described as “totally histrionic”.
“I’m sure there are those out there reading that thinking it’s true when you have the peak red meat body (Meat and Livestock Australia) forecasting zero [emissions] by 2030 and a huge drop between 2005 and 15 on current modelling, so I think for me it is about having a conversation as a community,” she said",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/29/climate-change-making-drought-worse-says-farmers-federation-chief

Even if temperatures rise by as much as 4C above pre-industrial levels – in the upper range of current forecasts – the damaging effects on fishing can be reduced through improving how stocks are fished and managed.
Governments are meeting from 4 September in New York for the first round of talks on a new global treaty of the high seas, which would aim to conserve overfished stocks and make access to key fisheries more equitable. Any agreement is likely to take several years to negotiateand longer to come into force, but scientists say there is no time to be lost, given the magnitude of the threat to the world’s marine ecosystems.
Climate change is already causing the movement of some species as their traditional habitats grow warmer, and overfishing is wreaking heavy damage on stocks. However, by adapting fisheries management to a warming climate, and instituting better systems such as monitoring of fleets, the global catch can be increased despite these factors, according to the paper published on Wednesday in the journal Science Advances.
“This is a positive message amid the doom and gloom,” said Kristin Kleisner, one of the authors of the study and a senior scientist at the US Environmental Defense Fund. “We can control how we manage our fisheries. We will have severe effects [from climate change] but this shows what we can do as humans to control that.”
If temperatures were to hit 4C above pre-industrial levels, but good management was put in place, there could still be an increase of 17% of the amount of fish in oceans, compared with a decline of 5% of fish biomass if current practices continue and the world warmed by only 1C.
She noted that new technologies, such as monitoring of fishing vessels from satellites and through the internet, could make a big difference in enabling closer management. These techniques can also make fisheries management more responsive to the changing dynamics of ocean ecosystems, so that fishing can be redirected if stocks appear to be declining, for instance.
Under 2C of warming, improved management could yield even better returns, resulting in a 16% increase in the catch, amounting to 25bn servings of seafood a year, and nearly a third more fish in the sea than there are today. The finding is crucial because more than 1 billion people globally rely on fish, particularly key species such as tuna and mackerel, as their main source of protein.
Governments agreed in 2015 to take action to limit warming to no more than 2C, regarded as the threshold of safety beyond which the effects of climate change are likely to become catastrophic and irreversible.
Kleisner said the results of the study showed that governments should take prompt action to bring in modern fisheries management.
Global Fishing Watch, an international NGO, has used technological improvements to open up vast amounts of new data on fishing around the world. These include data made public earlier this year on tens of thousands of global vessels, which would have been impossible even five years ago.
Sarah Bladen, of Global Fishing Watch, said even newer techniques were being brought to bear, with results that could be “game-changing” for fisheries management and preventing illegal fishing. “Technological innovation is putting us within reach of a ‘real-time’ digital ocean. The open ocean has long been characterised as the wild west: lawless, remote and plagued by a paucity of data. However, our ability to directly detect and track fishing vessel activity globally is undergoing an extraordinary transformation.”
She called on the fishing industry to take note: “This really is, or needs to be, a wake-up call: the era of ‘secret’ fishing spots is over. To maintain the social licence to operate, fishing industries worldwide need to step up and accept, indeed embrace, levels of transparency in fishing activities that were unimaginable a decade ago.”
Prof Alex Rogers of Oxford University told the Guardian that international action and a global treaty must be brought in as soon as possible, before the current damage turns into a catastrophe. “The situation is very urgent. We need to bring our activities at sea to a sustainable level,” he said. “The status quo cannot be allowed to continue, if we want to preserve ocean health and have fish for tomorrow.”
The threats to ocean life include not only climate change, acidification and overfishing, but the pollution, including plastics and agricultural chemicals that we pour into the sea, and our industrial exploitation of the seabed, for instance for oil and gas exploration and mining. These activities have been enabled by new technology, which is not taken into account in current sea governance, which dates back to the 16th century, according to Rogers.
The governance of the high seas, which cover most of the oceans beyond national jurisdictions, had failed to keep up with this pace of change, he added: “These new activities can ramp up very quickly, and do tremendous damage in a very short time.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/29/fish-populations-could-rise-even-with-extreme-climate-change-study-shows

A cavalcade of city mayors, regional government representatives and business executives from around the world will convene in San Francisco next month for a major summit touting the role of action beyond national governments to stave off the worst impacts of climate change.
But the greenhouse gas cuts offered up by these entities are relatively modest, according to new research, placing the onus on nations to raise their ambitions even as the US, the world’s second largest emitter, looks to exit the landmark Paris climate agreement.
An evaluation of climate change pledges by nearly 6,000 cities, states and regions, representing 7% of the global population, and more than 2,000 companies that have a combined revenue comparable to the size of the US economy, found a total projected reduction of between 1.5bn to 2.2bn tons of greenhouse gases by 2030.
In some places this action will be significant, such as in the US, where shifts to cleaner energy and energy efficiency by cities and states are on track to contribute half of the emissions reductions promised by the country in the Paris agreement.
But globally these emissions cuts fall short of enabling countries to avoid breaching agreed thresholds for dangerous warming that will trigger increased heatwaves, mightier storms, rising seas and displacement of people.
“When we look at the individual pledges [by cities, regions and businesses] the impact isn’t that large so we absolutely need national governments to pull through and do a lot of the heavy lifting,” said Dr Angel Hsu, the director of Data-Driven Yale, which led the study.
“The actions of cities, companies and states aren’t insignificant but they can’t do it by themselves. This shows everyone can be doing more. The current reductions are woefully inadequate and hopefully the actions of other entities will give national governments the confidence to be more ambitious.”
The analyzed reductions, taken from nine high-emitting countries such as the US, China, India and Brazil, as well as the European Union, overlap with some national efforts that increase the total contribution of emissions cuts.
But this action isn’t sufficient to bridge a gap between the Paris agreement’s goal to avoid 2C (3.6F) of global warming, with an aspiration of avoiding a 1.5C increase, and the insufficient emissions reductions put forward by the deal’s nearly 200 national signatories.
The agenda of the Trump administration risks making this goal even more challenging. Trump has promised to withdraw the US from the Paris agreement and has unveiled a plan to weaken vehicle emissions standards that could result in more than 1bn tons of extra carbon dioxide over the next 15 years. Last week, Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency announced a watered-down climate policy for the energy sector that might even result in emissions rising from coal plants.
Even if every Paris commitment is fully implemented, the world is on track to warm by around 3.3C by the end of the century. Pledges by the likes of Berlin, the Coca-Cola company or even an economic powerhouse like California “while welcome, are not sufficient”, said John Sterman, the director of the MIT system dynamics group.
“The world is in a desperate race between accelerating climate change and the innovation needed to cut emissions before it’s too late,” said Sterman. “Cities, states, and business are in the lead, but they face stiff headwinds from weak national policies and the continued efforts of fossil fuel interests to undermine the innovation we need.”
Global greenhouse gas emissions rose slightly last year, after a short period of stasis, highlighting the looming scenario whereby as-yet unproven technology will be need to be deployed at a mass scale to suck CO2 directly from the air or capture and bury it after burning vegetation, known as biomass, for energy.
“We are already in an overshoot situation and it’s likely we are already going to have to need to remove carbon from the air,” said Klaus Lackner, the director of center for negative carbon emissions at Arizona State University. “The idea we just tighten our belt a bit isn’t going to solve the problem. We need to stop using the atmosphere as a dumping ground, abandon fossil fuels, find other sources of energy and deal with the carbon debt we already have.
“Cities getting involved is good and important but we haven’t really acknowledged how big and serious the challenge is. We are whistling in the dark.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/29/local-climate-efforts-wont-undo-trump-inaction

Increasing heat boosts both the number and appetite of insects, and researchers project they will destroy almost 50% more wheat than they do today with a 2C rise, and 30% more maize. Rice, the third key staple, is less affected as it is grown in the tropics, which are already near the optimal temperature for insects – although bugs will still eat 20% more.
Rising heat stress on crops is already expected to cut cereal yields by about 10% for 2C of warming, but the new research indicates rising pest damage will cause at least another 4-8% to be lost. With 800 million people chronically hungry today and the global population rising towards 10bn, increasing pest destruction will worsen food security.
“For many, many people in the world there is already a shortage of food, so it is not like we can afford to spare [more],” said Prof Curtis Deutsch at the University of Washington, US, who led the work. “A lot of people in the world, the most vulnerable, can’t afford to give up anything.”
The UK is the worst affected of significant wheat producers, with pest losses expected to more than double from 5% to 11%, and Canada will suffer the biggest increase in maize losses, from 6% to 10%. The world’s biggest growers will also see a major impact, with China’s wheat losses rising 50% and and US corn losses going up by a third.
The losses are likely to be underestimates as the scientists did not consider factors such as increased transmission of crop diseases carried by insects, or losses after harvest when the grain is stored. The research also did not assess the risk of population explosions of insects that can wipe out crops, due to the complexity of such events.
Action by farmers to try to avoid new pest losses is unlikely to be successful, said Prof Rosamond Naylor at Stanford University, US, and one of the research team. “Increased pesticide applications, the use of [resistant] genetically modified crops and practices such as crop rotations will help control losses from insects. But it still appears that under virtually all climate change scenarios, pest populations will be the winners.”
The research, published in the journal Science, started with well-established knowledge about how rising temperature affects insects. “Warmer temperatures increase insect metabolic rates exponentially [and] increase the reproductive rates,” said Deutsch. “You have more insects, and they’re eating more.” The team then added data on today’s pest losses and used a range of climate change models to estimate future losses – all showed significant damage.
Overall, losses were found to increase by 20-50% for 2C of warming above pre-industrial levels and 40%-100% for 4C. The latter will be reached this century if carbon emissions are not cut soon. “The overall picture is, if you’re growing a lot of food in a temperate region, you’re going to be hit hardest,” said Scott Merrill at the University of Vermont, another member of the team.
Europe’s breadbasket is among the hardest hit, with 11 nations predicted to see a rise in pest losses of 75% or more. “France will get a double whammy,” said Merrill, as it is a top five producer of both wheat and maize. Another big wheat producer, Russia, will see losses rise from 10% to 16% with 2C of warming. Across the globe, an extra 200m tonnes of grain are expected to be eaten by insects in a 2C warmer world.
The research was deliberately conservative and so did not allow population explosions of pests to take place in the computer simulations, as it’s difficult to model how these develop, but such explosions cannot be ruled out.
Deutsch noted that warmer winters have led the pine bark beetle to kill off forests across North America: “They just come out gangbusters in the spring. You can see the damage to space.”
“It is an example of what can happen when you have huge tracts of land that are essentially single crops species with one major pest,” he said. “That is similar in many respects to what agriculture has produced – miles and miles of a single plant.” He also said insect population explosions are seen in fossils from warming periods in the Earth’s past.
Markus Riegler, at Western Sydney University in Australia and not part of the research team, said the new work was the first global analysis. “The results show that insects will cause significantly increased grain loss across many regions of a warmer world,” he said. The work used data on 38 insect species but Riegler said the results should be verified for more pests in future.
“The substantial increases in pest damage forecast call for action on climate change [emissions] and adaptation,” he said. “Everyone must be involved in change: farmers, industries, policymakers and wider society.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/30/crop-losses-to-pests-will-soar-as-climate-warms-study-warns

Extended spells of frigid and baking weather seen during the winter and summer will likely increase household food bills by an estimated £7.15 a month, the Centre for Economics and Business Research (Cebr) says. 
The cold snap brought on by the Beast from the East has already been blamed for a slump in the economy at the start of the year, while some industries were adversely affected by heatwave conditions over the summer. 
The Cebr said domestic food production has been hit by weather extremes that have put “particular stress on farming costs and yields”. 
Between March and July, the wholesale “farm gate” prices of some staples rocketed by up to 80%. 
The price of wheat for bread rose by a fifth, strawberries by 28%, carrots by 41% and lettuce by 61%. 
The farm gate price of carrots rose by 80%, according to European Commission figures used by the economists. 
The Cebr said: “Summer 2018 has been one of the warmest in living memory, with above average temperatures recorded since April and dry spells lasting more than 50 days in parts of the country. 
“While this has made Britain’s weather more conducive to barbecuing, it looks set to raise the price of the food on the grill and the drink in hand.” 
The group says that wheat is a particular concern due to the nation’s appetite for derived products. 
Much of the UK’s grain is imported from Europe, where record-breaking weather has also hit production, with the harvest expected to be 5% down in 2018. 
The impact of the extreme weather is not limited to arable produce, with domestic dairy yields also hit. 
Poor grass growth saw production fall for 11 weeks in a row and the farm gate price of butter rise by just under a quarter since March. 
The heat has also seen pig fertility fall, pushing up the price of piglets by 8%. 
“The price of red meat is set to fall marginally in the short run. This is as farmers look to sell livestock earlier than normal to reduce the burden on grazing land. 
“Still, in the longer run, prices are set to rise as feed availability is affected by a weak harvest,” Cebr said.
The group also said that inclement weather in France has hit winemakers in Bordeaux, Champagne and Cognac. 
In total, the Cebr expects the extreme weather will increase costs to UK consumers by £45 million per week, although the full effects could take up to 18 months to filter through to customers. 
Freezing weather at the start of the year was blamed for a slump in growth across the UK economy, with gross domestic product falling to 0.2% in the first quarter. 
The Bank of England’s figures for the second quarter showed the economy had rebounded, however the hot weather was blamed in part for a slip in the country’s services sector in July.

Following an unprecedented 270,000 downloads of his study, Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, said he had not seen such a surge of interest since 2007, the year the Nobel prize was awarded to Al Gore and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
“I think that in future people will look back on 2018 as the year when climate reality hit,” said the veteran scientist. “This is the moment when people start to realise that global warming is not a problem for future generations, but for us now,” said the veteran scientist and outgoing director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impacts.
The heatwave has dominated headlines across the northern hemisphere this summer. New temperature records have been set in Africa and cities in Australia, Taiwan, Georgia and the west coast of US. Heat stroke or forest fires have killed at least 119 in Japan, 29 in South Korea, 91 in Greece and nine in California. There have even been freak blazes in Lapland and elsewhere in the Arctic circle, while holidaymakers and locals alike have sweltered in unusually hot weather in southern Europe.
Coming amid this climate chaos, the “hothouse Earth” paper by Schellnhuber and his co-authors struck a chord with the public by spelling out the huge and growing risk that emissions are pushing the planet’s climate off the path it has been on for 2.5m years.
Schellnhuber said the paper’s release had accidentally been delayed, but the timing proved serendipitous. “It came out at a time when temperatures in Germany reached 38C so people could personally experience a heatwave. But this is just the beginning.”
Even in the US, which president Donald Trump has vowed to pull out of the Paris accord, public opinion surveys have shown a growing acceptance of climate science. Last year’s mega-typhoons and a hot May helped 73% of the public to acknowledge the reality of climate change, including a record 60% who now recognise that the causes are manmade. With millennials overwhelmingly in favour of tougher action, several pollsters are predicting that climate could be a factor in the midterm elections in the autumn.
Schellnhuber said he was concerned about the widening gap between scientists’ increasingly alarmed descriptions of climate destruction and leaders’ weak statements of what is politically possible.
“Politicians prefer small problems that they can solve and get credit for. They don’t like big problems that, even if they succeed, leave the rewards for their successors,” he said. “But once you pile up public pressure, politicians find it hard to avoid taking responsibility.”
The hothouse paper spells out the actions that governments need to take, including carbon laws that aim to halve emissions every decade and stronger safeguards for natural sinks, such as oceans and forests that are currently being lost.
“This is very dangerous. We are not just doing wrong ourselves with emissions, we are also killing our best friends – forests and oceans – that might ease the impact,” Schellnhuber said.
He and others have drawn up a detailed action plan will be unveiled ahead of the Californian climate summit in September. It will include more ambitious targets than those outlined in the Paris accord, which aims to keep temperature rises below 2C. 49 countries’ emissions have already peaked, but overall government commitments to date are lagging so much that the world is on a course for 3C of warming, at which level the risk of reaching an irreversible tipping point gets higher.
The authors say it is economically and technologically feasible to make more drastic emissions cuts that can keep warming at 1.5C.
“What is unrealistic is to be on a trajectory towards 3C,” said Johan Falk, innovation fellow at Future Earth and Stockholm Resilience Centre. “Solutions exist, but they have to be adopted by the leadership of countries and companies.”
With the world now believed to be in an “anomalously warm” phase until at least 2022, Schellnhuber says the global public will increasingly feel the impacts of climate change and, he hopes, demand more urgency from their governments.
On 8 September, climate groups are calling for a mass mobilisation ahead of the California summit. Asked if he thinks scientists should attend, Schellnhuber has little hesitation. “There’s a time to sit down and work at your desk and there’s a time to get up and leave the area where you are comfortable. That time is now.”

That bonkers El Nino year. Breaking records like crazy. 
Many were optimistic back then (also myself). But not for long. 
Because once the temperature data rolled in, the denial machinery kicked into gear. 
(Remember? Nothing to worry about because El Nino years always are hot - of course without mentioning that ENSO-neutral years, El Nino years and La Nina years all have a trend that follows the global warming trend). 
Point with remembering this is that denial just have to give plausible reasons for the ""anomaly"" (a new record is always seen as an anomaly, right?). While doing their job - taking attention away from the underlying trends and causes. 
During the heat wave in 2003 I worked on glaciers in the Alps. 
Again people had hopes that the deaths and fires and society almost stopping up because of it were a wake-up call (this time I had not hopes for the same). 
And the second time I was right. 
Humans, even experts, are shambles when it comes to evaluate stuff and even the simplest patterns. Because our brains are the biggest interpolation calculators in existence. We simply can not be trusted. 
There is a fine irony in the science denial campaign catchphrase ""think for yourself"". Everyone who ever did the tiniest of study knows that is exactly what is not needed. 
Everyone who ever looked at an optical illusion online or offline should know. Our brains lie all the time - and it uncritically filter out data all the time (I am aware that the dancing gorilla test does not work now since half the world has seen it on YouTube, but yes - there is the problem. Do not trust your own brain. 
Best example - here in the extra tropics, temperature anomalies are much stronger in extended winter than in summer. 
But as humans ""global warming"" means ""heat"" and that is easier to make sense of (by our brains) in summer. Our brains interpolate all kinds of silly patterns. 
Climate denial companies, all them that lives not from publishing science, but to publish ""information"" for money in advertising - they know this. 
Back a couple of decades ago they tested out ""alternative facts"" for a while against science. Then, one test out spinning what science actually say - by word juggling.

Everything else has been checked and accounted for. It’s not orbital changes like the glacial cycles (they are going in the opposite direction). It’s not volcanoes that anyone can show. It’s not the sun, at least through any proven mechanism. Nothing else investigated fits.
Further more, our CO2 emissions “should” be warming the planet.
What skeptics seem to forget is that if they want to overturn accepted climate science, they not only need an alternative explanation for what’s heating the planet, but also why our CO2 emissions aren’t. And to roughly the same extent.
That might be possible, by the odds of it happening seem very remote.
So until anyone actually has something better, why not assume the most obvious and likely explanation is the real explanation, work on that and hopefully avoid some very serious problems?

Oh dear, not that again. Science is based on evidence, religions are based on folk stories.
You are suggesting adaptation to potential conditions never seen in all the time modern humans have existed.
I see you are not ken on being asked to look at papers - where else will we find useful information?
I suggest you read about some previous warming events, like the end-Permian, the PETM, the Toarcian, and the ETM2. They are seen in the geochemical record as negative carbon isotope excursions.
These NCIEs mark sudden releases of sequestered carbon, are always associated with global warming, and with extinction events of varying severity.
A paper worth looking at is -
""A human-induced hothouse climate?"" - Kidder & Worsley, 2011
At least one mass extinction is associated with lots of CO2 being formed by burning fossil fuel.
It was volcanic action that burned coal then, in Siberia.
There are a number of papers on that such as:
""Initial pulse of Siberian Traps sills as the trigger of the end-Permian mass extinction"" - Burgess et al, 2017

""Catastrophic dispersion of coal fly ash into oceans during the latest Permian extinction"" - Grasby et al, 2011.

This explains why the Eemian was a warmer time - but it's worth noting that during the Eemian, CO2 levels were similar to those before the Industrial Revolution.
Now CO2 levels are similar to the Pliocene over 3 million years ago.
Modern humans didn't exist then - there was no complex global society relying on stability for agriculture.
Global average temperatures then eventually reached 3 or 4 degrees C (5.4-7.2 degrees F) higher than today’s and as much as 10 degrees C (18 degrees F) warmer at the poles.
Sea level ranged between five and 40 metres (16 to 131 feet) higher than today.
Earth systems take time to respond to forcings.
For example, sea level can't suddenly rise on that scale, because it takes time for enough heat to be accumulated to melt enough ice.

As for the UK we are a tiny island- farmers, foresters, health workers notice that weather is extreme and over the last 30 years it is increasing- the climate is changing, the seas around the UK are warming, and I'm sure there is plenty of studies on the subject- but if there is any study that disputes that it relates to AGW then give a link- it would be interesting.', u'recommendation_count': u'8', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1533224633000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'4738374', u'in_reply_to': u'119034000', u'id': u'119035345', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'RJander', u'text': u'Not the point is it?', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1533224548000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'15758543', u'in_reply_to': u'119013708', u'id': u'119035295', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'TTauriStellarbody', u'text': u'BQSTART
What Mr McCarthy wants is to attribute present cycles in the weather to man's effect on the planet. If he is right that has yet to be shown, which may explain his shrillness.

Well, the atmospheric patterns leading to the UK heat wave do occur in the natural cycles in the weather, but they have been unusually persistent. The jet stream has weakened and got stuck to the north of the UK, with high pressure settled over the UK and Europe. In the summer such a pattern leads to dry soils, which means that if the sunny weather continues the energy of the sun is not used up in evaporating water and the temperatures rise even more.
BQEND
BQSTART
In addition, we’ve seen a background of global warming due mostly to increased atmospheric greenhouse gases, with global mean temperatures rising more than 1C above pre-industrial levels, and even more so over the northern continents. The natural cycles of weather mean that we shouldn’t expect heatwaves like this to happen every year but, when we do experience them, the warmer world means that there is an increased risk of even higher temperatures. 
In 2003 Europe also experienced a pronounced heat wave. Research led at the Met Office showed that greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere doubled the chance of the temperatures recorded in 2003 compared to what we’d expect in a pre-industrial world. This research also concluded that by the 2040’s the temperatures we saw in Europe in 2003 could be fairly normal in summer. We have updated this prediction with more recent data, and found that this prediction is still on track: the extreme temperatures we saw in the summer of 2003 can be expected to occur more regularly in Europe by the 2040s

It is not breaking a law to suggest that money influences, any more than it is to suggest that power corrupts. It's a basic maxim that a lot of people agree on. So let's not be silly. 
For eg. If large amounts of money are available to researchers in multiple fields to research ACC, with their resulting papers having a chance of being published by the IPCC, and with the resulting perceived credibility of which helping to ensure future funding, then this alone is a conflict of interests, since the goal of the IPCC is far from neutral. 
If the IPCC were skeptical and neutral then systemic bias would be far less of a risk, imho. As it stands, its very existence is predicated upon ACC existing, which is an extremely unscientific starting point.
I don't see how one can deny that bias is a very real risk. And saying as much is NOT breaking a law!

I certainly am not asking you for evidence that the earth's temperature has gone up and down in the past, since this is common knowledge and not in dispute. Nor however does it help much in what we are discussing.
‘Figures are changed’ – I don’t know what you mean by this. I think maybe you are suggesting that various adjustments to figures that have been made are wrong, and that ‘the climate scientist’ has got something wrong, and perhaps miscalculated what I understand to be called the ‘urban heat island effect’. But you then link to a blog item which says that the ‘hockey stick’ is correct, give or take tweaks, and Michael Mann is ‘exonerated’. So what actually is your point about the hockey stick?
Pre-industrial temperatures, with many thanks to rockyrex:
Ed Hawkins makes a good case for ""pre-industrial"" to mean ""1720-1800"".
On that basis ..........global temperatures likely increased by more than 0.6°C from the pre-industrial period up to 1986-2005. This means that the year 2015 was at least 1°C warmer than the pre-industrial era and 2016 was likely to be more than 1.1°C warmer.( Ed Hawkins - Climate scientist in the National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS) at the University of Reading. IPCC AR5 Contributing Author.)
Here's his piece on that:
https://www.climate-lab-book.ac.uk/2017/defining-pre-industrial/
and following from this, also thanks to rocky rex, and in response to your comment that we don’t know the warming is all man-made:
We know the overall global average temperature is rising because of human activity, because attribution studies have shown that the sum of all 'natural' climate forcings is very slightly negative.
This means that without human activity the Earth would be cooling very very slowly.
Here's an attribution study -
""Global temperature evolution 1979–2010"" - Foster & Rahmstorf, 2011
...........we list the linear trend in the signals due to ENSO, volcanic forcing and solar variation in table 3. The magnitudes of these trend contributions are quite small compared to the overall trends. In fact the net trend due to these three factors is negative for all data sets except UAH, for which it is zero. Hence these factors have not contributed to an upward trend in temperature data, rather they have contributed a very slight downward trend.
If you are disputing any of this you need to produce links which show that someone has published something (properly) that supports your opinion. Similarly, if you think the adjustments to data are ‘misleading’, a word you used in an earlier post, you will need to find a scientist who has published to this effect.
Finally, as to public opinion, I am not sure our points are similar. Scientific opinions are appropriate for scientific matters, whereas what somebody ‘down the pub’ thinks is not relevant. I can see for myself that many people like ‘big cars’, but this does not mean that scientists are ‘wrong’. Again, what is your point? People do self-destructive things? Or the general public are poorly informed or perhaps indifferent to scientific insight? Regarding this, I think that the coming decades will produce many examples of threats to public health and wellbeing which people would rather ignore but had better heed. This is not doom-mongering – I am an optimist. Technological fixes can work, but it requires a sincere and orchestrated attempt to convince people of the scientific consensus on various issues. 
What I suspect you have been influenced by is the FUD: fear, uncertainty and doubt which vested interests use to undermine the trust of the public in scientific institutions. Politics by its nature is a short term view; science is special in that it gives us a longer term, less parochial view. My aim is to promote that bigger view, so that policy anticipates problems rather than leave ordinary people at the mercy of events, and vested interests that are not general public interests.', u'recommendation_count': u'2', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1533322786000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'human activity', u'effect': u'the overall global average temperature is rising because attribution studies have shown that the sum of all forcings is'}, {u'cause': u'attribution studies have shown that the sum of all forcings is', u'effect': u'the overall global average temperature is rising because of human activity'}, {u'cause': u'volcanic forcing and solar variation in table 3', u'effect': u'we list the linear trend in the signals'}, {u'cause': u'these three factors', u'effect': u'the net trend'}], u'author_id': u'4154310', u'in_reply_to': u'119061532', u'id': u'119070667', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'bassireland', u'text': u'Not just history - physics, chemistry, you name it', u'recommendation_count': u'6', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1533321699000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'2849622', u'in_reply_to': u'119067588', u'id': u'119070266', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'bassireland', u'text': u'BQSTART

Over a map of the world which was coloured bright scarlet, the splash headline screamed: “THE WORLD’S ON FIRE”.
Britain’s biggest-selling daily newspaper was not mincing its words. The subheading on the left-hand side proclaimed “PLANET GRIPPED BY KILLER HEATWAVE”, while the right-hand one announced: “HUNDREDS DIE IN EUROPE AND JAPAN”. And if you were wondering what the cause of all this might be, the accompanying news report carried a quote – just the one – from Len Shaffrey, professor of climate science at Reading University, who said: “Global temperatures are increasing due to climate change. The global rise in temperatures means the probability that an extreme heatwave will occur is also increasing.”
I nearly choked on my KitKat when I read that. Is this really the Sun? The shoutiest outlet belonging to Rupert Murdoch, the media mogul who famously characterised climate change as “alarmist nonsense”? Is something happening here?
I think something is, and I think what the appearance of this front page in a rightwing tabloid signals is that the summer of 2018, which is throwing up extraordinary climactic extremes all over the northern hemisphere, from north Africa to the Arctic, is finally puncturing the bubble of so-called climate scepticism, at least in Britain. Let us at once say that it will take a lot more to puncture that bubble in the United States, where unabashed and brazen denial of the overwhelming scientific evidence for global warming is an article of faith not just with Donald Trump, but with the Republican party as a whole.
But still it’s a start. Because what we are witnessing now is a historic shift in the way that the threat of climate change is perceived by the world, from prediction to observation. Remember: from the first report by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in May 1990, the whole argument that global warming is a potentially disastrous danger has been based on the predictions of supercomputer models of the climate system; they were essentially the same computer models that forecast the weather up to six days in advance, but were now being tasked with forecasting the climate up to 100 years into the future. So most of the biggest climate change headlines for the last three decades have been based on prophecy, as it were, from successive IPCC reports calculating that unless we cut our greenhouse gas emissions, global average temperatures will rise by four or even six degrees celsius by 2100, and that sea levels will rise by up to a metre by the same date, and so forth. There have been five IPCC reports, and with each one the computer models have been more refined and the predictions more reliable, so the conclusions are likely to be more robust. Yet the uncertainty of predicting the future remains.
These predictions have been the scientific strength of the argument for acting to combat the warming to come, but also, its political weakness. The large degree of uncertainty they inevitably contain has provided the soil in which climate denial has sprouted and flourished, after the issue so lamentably became politically polarised between left and right. It has allowed climate action to be characterised by its rightwing opponents merely as an unnecessary and colossally expensive bet about the future, without overwhelming numbers of ordinary people – voters – disagreeing. This is because for the 30 years that ordinary people have been hearing these predictions, they have not seen anything much to worry them when they look out of their windows.
But observation is different. Seeing things happening around you cannot be gainsaid like predictions can, and in this remarkable summer of 2018, events in the real world have been starting to catch up with the climate models’ forecasts of an overheating globe. Not only has Britain sweltered in the five-week heatwave that finally ended last Friday, record-breaking heat has subjected Norway, Sweden and Finland to unheard-of temperatures – above 32C, that’s 90F, recorded 60 miles north of the Arctic Circle. Meanwhile in Ouargla, a Saharan desert city in Algeria, a temperature of 51.3C (124.2F) recorded on 5 July is thought to be the highest ever reliably measured in Africa. And so in Japan, and so in Greece, and so in Canada: all over the northern hemisphere, record-breaking heat.
The reaction to all this from the Daily Mail last week was very much the traditional and expected take from the rightwing newspaper. It strenuously avoided the term “climate change” as long as it could; on the same day as the Sun, it used the second sentence quoted above from Prof Shaffrey, but not the first one. The next day it could no longer avoid it, by reporting that the Commons environmental audit committee had forecast a trebling of heat-related deaths by 2050. But to set the balance right it wheeled out the reliable climate sceptic Christopher Booker to proclaim, in a truly feeble piece of polemic, that linking climate change to the heatwave was, as the headline put it, “Just Hot Air”.
The Sun also carried an opinion piece from Rod Liddle, which looked at first sight like a climate-sceptic rant, but wasn’t – it was a scolding of the Met Office for nanny-state advice to stay indoors. Last Friday the Sun splashed again on the story with the front-page headline “BAKE TO THE FUTURE” and once more, climate change featured prominently in the news story. It quoted the climate scientist Peter Stott blaming “human-induced climate change” for the increasing global risk of extreme heatwaves. As a sub-headline summarised: “Scorchers could go on for decades say boffins”. 
I am fascinated by the Sun’s reaction to these events, so different from the Daily Mail’s, because I think it marks the moment when someone on a rightwing populist newspaper – someone clearly possessed of sharp news antennae – recognises that the time has come when people are finally realising beyond doubt that something abnormal is happening to the global climate. Who knows? Maybe Murdoch will order a different tone to be set in the Sun next week. But I still think it marks a tipping point, when observation begins to replace prediction in the headlines, and the start of a process that will eventually throw the perverted ideology of climate denial into the dustbin of history – where it belongs.

Rosqvist, who is also head of the Tarfala research station near the mountain, has been measuring the southern peak for many years as part of climate change research. Kebnekaise, a popular tourist destination located in Sweden’s far north, has two main peaks – a southern one covered by a glacier and a northern one free of ice.
Rosqvist said the southern peak has lost four metres (13ft) of snow between 2 July and 31 July. This means an average of 14cm of snow melted every day on the glacier in July, as Sweden experienced record hot temperatures, triggering dozens of wildfires across the country, even in the Arctic Circle.
“This is happening very fast. The result of this hot summer will be a record loss in snow and ice in the mountains,” Rosqvist said.
At its latest measurement, the southern peak reached 2,097 metres above sea level, just 20cm higher than the northern tip’s 2096.8 metres. “The forecast is that as of 1 August the southern peak is going to be lower than the northern peak,” Rosqvist said.
Last year, the difference between the two peaks was two metres. The southern glacier, whose height has been measured since 1880, has been melting by one metre each year in the past two decades, according to Stockholm University.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/01/swedens-highest-point-set-to-lose-title-as-glacier-melts

Part of being human, and living in a society with other humans, is finding clever ways to express – and conceal – our feelings. From the most sophisticated diplomatic language to the baldest lie, humans find ways to deceive. Deceptions are not necessarily malign; at some level they are vital if humans are to live together with civility. As Richard Sennett has argued: “In practising social civility, you keep silent about things you know clearly but which you should not and do not say.”
Just as we can suppress some aspects of ourselves in our self-presentation to others, so we can do the same to ourselves in acknowledging or not acknowledging what we desire. Most of the time, we spare ourselves from the torture of recognising our baser yearnings. But when does this necessary private self-deception become harmful? When it becomes public dogma. In other words: when it becomes denialism.
Denialism is an expansion, an intensification, of denial. At root, denial and denialism are simply a subset of the many ways humans have developed to use language to deceive others and themselves. Denial can be as simple as refusing to accept that someone else is speaking truthfully. Denial can be as unfathomable as the multiple ways we avoid acknowledging our weaknesses and secret desires.
Denialism is more than just another manifestation of the humdrum intricacies of our deceptions and self-deceptions. It represents the transformation of the everyday practice of denial into a whole new way of seeing the world and – most important – a collective accomplishment. Denial is furtive and routine; denialism is combative and extraordinary. Denial hides from the truth, denialism builds a new and better truth.
In recent years, the term has been used to describe a number of fields of “scholarship”, whose scholars engage in audacious projects to hold back, against seemingly insurmountable odds, the findings of an avalanche of research. They argue that the Holocaust (and other genocides) never happened, that anthropogenic (human-caused) climate change is a myth, that Aids either does not exist or is unrelated to HIV, that evolution is a scientific impossibility, and that all manner of other scientific and historical orthodoxies must be rejected.
In some ways, denialism is a terrible term. No one calls themselves a “denialist”, and no one signs up to all forms of denialism. In fact, denialism is founded on the assertion that it is not denialism. In the wake of Freud (or at least the vulgarisation of Freud), no one wants to be accused of being “in denial”, and labelling people denialists seems to compound the insult by implying that they have taken the private sickness of denial and turned it into public dogma.
But denial and denialism are closely linked; what humans do on a large scale is rooted in what we do on a small scale. While everyday denial can be harmful, it is also just a mundane way for humans to respond to the incredibly difficult challenge of living in a social world in which people lie, make mistakes and have desires that cannot be openly acknowledged. Denialism is rooted in human tendencies that are neither freakish nor pathological.
All that said, there is no doubt that denialism is dangerous. In some cases, we can point to concrete examples of denialism causing actual harm. In South Africa, President Thabo Mbeki, in office between 1999 and 2008, was influenced by Aids denialists such as Peter Duesberg, who deny the link between HIV and Aids (or even HIV’s existence) and cast doubt on the effectiveness of anti-retroviral drugs. Mbeki’s reluctance to implement national treatment programmes using anti-retrovirals has been estimated to have cost the lives of 330,000 people. On a smaller scale, in early 2017 the Somali-American community in Minnesota was struck by a childhood measles outbreak, as a direct result of proponents of the discredited theory that the MMR vaccine causes autism, persuading parents not to vaccinate their children.
More commonly though, denialism’s effects are less direct but more insidious. Climate change denialists have not managed to overturn the general scientific consensus that it is occurring and caused by human activity. What they have managed to do is provide subtle and not-so-subtle support for those opposed to taking radical action to address this urgent problem. Achieving a global agreement that could underpin a transition to a post-carbon economy, and that would be capable of slowing the temperature increase, was always going to be an enormous challenge. Climate change denialism has helped to make the challenge even harder.
Denialism can also create an environment of hate and suspicion. Forms of genocide denialism are not just attempts to overthrow irrefutable historical facts; they are an assault on those who survive genocide, and their descendants. The implacable denialism that has led the Turkish state to refuse to admit that the 1915 Armenian genocide occurred is also an attack on today’s Armenians, and on any other minority that would dare to raise troubling questions about the status of minorities in Turkey. Similarly, those who deny the Holocaust are not trying to disinterestedly “correct” the historical record; they are, with varying degrees of subtlety, trying to show that Jews are pathological liars and fundamentally dangerous, as well as to rehabilitate the reputation of the Nazis.
The dangers that other forms of denialism pose may be less concrete, but they are no less serious. Denial of evolution, for example, does not have an immediately hateful payoff; rather it works to foster a distrust in science and research that feeds into other denialisms and undermines evidence-based policymaking. Even lunatic-fringe denialisms, such as flat Earth theories, while hard to take seriously, help to create an environment in which real scholarship and political attempts to engage with reality, break down in favour of an all-encompassing suspicion that nothing is what it seems.
Denialism has moved from the fringes to the centre of public discourse, helped in part by new technology. As information becomes freer to access online, as “research” has been opened to anyone with a web browser, as previously marginal voices climb on to the online soapbox, so the opportunities for countering accepted truths multiply. No one can be entirely ostracised, marginalised and dismissed as a crank anymore.
The sheer profusion of voices, the plurality of opinions, the cacophony of the controversy, are enough to make anyone doubt what they should believe.
So how do you fight denialism? Denialism offers a dystopian vision of a world unmoored, in which nothing can be taken for granted and no one can be trusted. If you believe that you are being constantly lied to, paradoxically you may be in danger of accepting the untruths of others. Denialism is a mix of corrosive doubt and corrosive credulity.
It’s perfectly understandable that denialism sparks anger and outrage, particularly in those who are directly challenged by it. If you are a Holocaust survivor, a historian, a climate scientist, a resident of a flood-plain, a geologist, an Aids researcher or someone whose child caught a preventable disease from an unvaccinated child, denialism can feel like an assault on your life’s work, your core beliefs or even your life itself. Such people do fight back. This can include, in some countries, supporting laws against denialism, as in France’s prohibition of Holocaust denial. Attempts to teach “creation science” alongside evolution in US schools are fought with tenacity. Denialists are routinely excluded from scholarly journals and academic conferences.
The most common response to denialism, though, is debunking. Just as denialists produce a large and ever-growing body of books, articles, websites, lectures and videos, so their detractors respond with a literature of their own. Denialist claims are refuted point by point, in a spiralling contest in which no argument – however ludicrous – is ever left unchallenged. Some debunkings are endlessly patient and civil, treating denialists and their claims seriously and even respectfully; others are angry and contemptuous.
Yet none of these strategies work, at least not completely. Take the libel case that the Holocaust denier David Irving brought against Deborah Lipstadt in 1996. Irving’s claim that accusing him of being a Holocaust denier and a falsifier of history was libellous were forensically demolished by Richard Evans and other eminent historians. The judgment was devastating to Irving’s reputation and unambiguous in its rejection of his claim to be a legitimate historian. The judgment bankrupted him, he was repudiated by the few remaining mainstream historians who had supported him, and in 2006 he was imprisoned in Austria for Holocaust denial.
But Irving today? He is still writing and lecturing, albeit in a more covert fashion. He still makes similar claims and his defenders see him as a heroic figure who survived the attempts of the Jewish-led establishment to silence him. Nothing really changed. Holocaust denial is still around, and its proponents find new followers. In legal and scholarly terms, Lipstadt won an absolute victory, but she didn’t beat Holocaust denial or even Irving in the long term.
There is a salutary lesson here: in democratic societies at least, denialism cannot be beaten legally, or through debunking, or through attempts to discredit its proponents. That’s because, for denialists, the existence of denialism is itself a triumph. Central to denialism is an argument that “the truth” has been suppressed by its enemies. To continue to exist is a heroic act, a victory for the forces of truth.
Of course, denialists might yearn for a more complete victory – when theories of anthropogenic climate change will be marginalised in academia and politics, when the story of how the Jews hoaxed the world will be in every history book – but, for now, every day that denialism persists is a good day. In fact, denialism can achieve more modest triumphs even without total victory. For the denialist, every day barrels of oil continue to be extracted and burned is a good day, every day a parent doesn’t vaccinate their child is a good day, every day a teenager Googling the Holocaust finds out that some people think it never happened is a good day.
Conversely, denialism’s opponents rarely have time on their side. As climate change rushes towards the point of no return, as Holocaust survivors die and can no longer give testimony, as once-vanquished diseases threaten pandemics, as the notion that there is “doubt” on settled scholarship becomes unremarkable, so the task facing the debunkers becomes both more urgent and more difficult. It’s understandable that panic can set in and that anger overwhelms some of those who battle against denialism.
A better approach to denialism is one of self-criticism. The starting point is a frank question: why did we fail? Why have those of us who abhor denialism not succeeded in halting its onward march? And why have we as a species managed to turn our everyday capacity to deny into an organised attempt to undermine our collective ability to understand the world and change it for the better?
These questions are beginning to be asked in some circles. They are often the result of a kind of despair. Campaigners against anthropogenic global warming often lament that, as the task becomes ever more urgent, so denialism continues to run rampant (along with apathy and “softer” forms of denial). It appears that nothing works in the campaign to make humanity aware of the threat it faces.
The obstinacy with which people can stick to disproved notions is attested to in the social sciences and in neuroscientific research. Humans are not only reasoning beings who disinterestedly weigh evidence and arguments. But there is a difference between the pre-conscious search for confirmation of existing views – we all engage in that to some extent – and the deliberate attempt to dress this search up as a quest for truth, as denialists do. Denialism adds extra layers of reinforcement and defence around widely shared psychological practices with the (never articulated) aim of preventing their exposure. This certainly makes changing the minds of denialists even more difficult than changing the minds of the rest of stubborn humanity.
There are multiple kinds of denialists: from those who are sceptical of all established knowledge, to those who challenge one type of knowledge; from those who actively contribute to the creation of denialist scholarship, to those who quietly consume it; from those who burn with certainty, to those who are privately sceptical about their scepticism. What they all have in common, I would argue, is a particular type of desire. This desire – for something not to be true – is the driver of denialism.
Empathy with denialists is not easy, but it is essential. Denialism is not stupidity, or ignorance, or mendacity, or psychological pathology. Nor is it the same as lying. Of course, denialists can be stupid, ignorant liars, but so can any of us. But denialists are people in a desperate predicament.
It is a very modern predicament. Denialism is a post‑enlightenment phenomenon, a reaction to the “inconvenience” of many of the findings of modern scholarship. The discovery of evolution, for example, is inconvenient to those committed to a literalist biblical account of creation. Denialism is also a reaction to the inconvenience of the moral consensus that emerged in the post-enlightenment world. In the ancient world, you could erect a monument proudly proclaiming the genocide you committed to the world. In the modern world, mass killing, mass starvation, mass environmental catastrophe can no longer be publicly legitimated.
Yet many humans still want to do the same things humans always did. We are still desiring beings. We want to murder, to steal, to destroy and to despoil. We want to preserve our ignorance and unquestioned faith. So when our desires are rendered unspeakable in the modern world, we are forced to pretend that we do not yearn for things we desire.
Denial is not enough here. As an attempt to draw awareness and attention away from something unpalatable, it is always vulnerable to challenge. Denial is a kind of high-wire act that can be unbalanced by forceful attempts to draw attention to what is being denied.
Denialism is, in part, a response to the vulnerability of denial. To be in denial is to know at some level. To be a denialist is to never have to know at all. Denialism is a systematic attempt to prevent challenge and acknowledgment; to suggest that there is nothing to acknowledge. Whereas denial is at least subject to the possibility of confrontation with reality, denialism can rarely be undermined by appeals to face the truth.
The tragedy for denialists is that they concede the argument in advance. Holocaust deniers’ attempts to deny that the Holocaust took place imply that it would not have been a good thing if it had. Climate change denialism is predicated on a similarly hidden acknowledgment that, if anthropogenic climate change were actually occurring, we would have to do something about it.
Denialism is therefore not just hard work – finding ways to discredit mountains of evidence is a tremendous labour – but also involves suppressing the expression of one’s desires. Denialists are “trapped” into byzantine modes of argument because they have few other options in pursuing their goals.
Denialism, and related phenomena, are often portrayed as a “war on science”. This is an understandable but profound misunderstanding. Certainly, denialism and other forms of pseudo-scholarship do not follow mainstream scientific methodologies. Denialism does indeed represent a perversion of the scholarly method, and the science it produces rests on profoundly erroneous assumptions, but denialism does all this in the name of science and scholarship. Denialism aims to replace one kind of science with another – it does not aim to replace science itself. In fact, denialism constitutes a tribute to the prestige of science and scholarship in the modern world. Denialists are desperate for the public validation that science affords.
While denialism has sometimes been seen as part of a post-modern assault on truth, the denialist is just as invested in notions of scientific objectivity as the most unreconstructed positivist. Even those who are genuinely committed to alternatives to western rationality and science can wield denialist rhetoric that apes precisely the kind of scientism they despise. Anti-vaxxers, for example, sometimes seem to want to have their cake and eat it: to have their critique of western medicine validated by western medicine.
The rhetoric of denialism and its critics can resemble each other in a kind of war to the death over who gets to wear the mantle of science. The term “junk science” has been applied to climate change denialism, as well as in defence of it. Mainstream science can also be dogmatic and blind to its own limitations. If the accusation that global warming is an example of politicised ideology masked as science is met with indignant assertions of the absolute objectivity of “real” science, there is a risk of blinding oneself to uncomfortable questions regarding the subtle and not-so-subtle ways in which the idea of pure truth, untrammelled by human interests, is elusive. Human interests can rarely if ever be separated from the ways we observe the world. Indeed, sociologists of science have shown how modern ideas of disinterested scientific knowledge have disguised the inextricable links between knowledge and human interests.
I do not believe that, if only one could find the key to “make them understand”, denialists would think just like me. A global warming denialist is not an environmentalist who cannot accept that he or she is really an environmentalist; a Holocaust denier is not someone who cannot face the inescapable obligation to commemorate the Holocaust; an Aids denialist is not an Aids activist who won’t acknowledge the necessity for western medicine in combating the disease; and so on. If denialists were to stop denying, we cannot assume that we would then have a shared moral foundation on which we could make progress as a species.
Denialism is not a barrier to acknowledging a common moral foundation; it is a barrier to acknowledging moral differences. An end to denialism is therefore a disturbing prospect, as it would involve these moral differences revealing themselves directly. But we need to start preparing for that eventuality, because denialism is starting to break down – and not in a good way.
On 6 November 2012, when he was already preparing the ground for his presidential run, Donald Trump sent a tweet about climate change. It said: “The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.”
At the time, this seemed to be just another example of the mainstreaming of climate change denialism on the American right. After all, the second Bush administration had done as little as possible to combat climate change, and many leading Republicans are prominent crusaders against mainstream climate science. Yet something else was happening here, too; the tweet was a harbinger of a new kind of post-denialist discourse.
Trump’s claim is not one that is regularly made by “mainstream” global warming denialists. It may have been a garbled version of the common argument on the US right that global climate treaties will unfairly weaken the US economy to the benefit of China. Like much of Trump’s discourse, the tweet was simply thrown into the world without much thought. This is not how denialism usually works. Denialists usually labour for decades to produce, often against overwhelming odds, carefully crafted simulacra of scholarship that, to non-experts at least, are indistinguishable from the real thing. They have refined alternative scholarly techniques that can cast doubt on even the most solid of truths.
Trump and the post-truthers’ “lazy” denialism rests on the security that comes from knowing that generations of denialists have created enough doubt already; all people like Trump need to do is to signal vaguely in a denialist direction. Whereas denialism explains – at great length – post-denialism asserts. Whereas denialism is painstakingly thought-through, post-denialism is instinctive. Whereas denialism is disciplined, post-denialism is anarchic.
The internet has been an important factor in this weakening of denialist self-discipline. The intemperance of the online world is pushing denialism so far that it is beginning to fall apart. The new generation of denialists aren’t creating new, alternative orthodoxies so much as obliterating the very idea of orthodoxy itself. The collective, institutional work of building a substantial bulwark against scholarly consensus gives way to a kind of free-for-all.
One example of this is the 9/11 truth movement. Because the attacks occurred in an already wired world, the denialism it spawned has never managed to institutionalise and develop an orthodoxy in the way that pre-internet denialisms did. Those who believe that the “official story” of the September 11 attacks was a lie can believe that elements in the US government had foreknowledge of the attacks but let them happen, or that the attacks were deliberately planned and carried out by the government, or that Jews/Israel/Mossad were behind it, or that shadowy forces in the “New World Order” were behind it – or some cocktail of all of these. They can believe that the towers were brought down by controlled demolition, or that no planes hit the towers, or that there were no floors in the towers, or that there were no passengers in the planes.
Post-denialism represents a freeing of the repressed desires that drive denialism. While it still based on the denial of an established truth, its methods liberate a deeper kind of desire: to remake truth itself, to remake the world, to unleash the power to reorder reality itself and stamp one’s mark on the planet. What matters in post-denialism is not the establishment of an alternative scholarly credibility, so much as giving yourself blanket permission to see the world however you like.
While post-denialism has not yet supplanted its predecessor, old-style denialism is beginning to be questioned by some of its practitioners as they take tentative steps towards a new age. This is particularly evident on the racist far right, where the dominance of Holocaust denial is beginning to erode.
Mark Weber, director of the (denialist) Institute for Historical Review, glumly concluded in an article in 2009 that Holocaust denial had become irrelevant in a world that continues to memorialise the genocide. Some Holocaust deniers have even recanted, expressing their frustration with the movement and acknowledging that many of its claims are simply untenable, as Eric Hunt, previously a producer of widely circulated online videos denying the Holocaust, did in 2016. Yet such admissions of defeat are certainly not accompanied by a retreat from antisemitism. Weber treats the failures of Holocaust denial as a consequence of the nefarious power of the Jews: “Suppose The New York Times were to report tomorrow that Israel’s Yad Vashem Holocaust centre and the US Holocaust Memorial Museum had announced that no more than 1 million Jews died during the second world war, and that no Jews were killed in gas chambers at Auschwitz. The impact on Jewish-Zionist power would surely be minimal.”
Those who were previously “forced” into Holocaust denial are starting to sense that it may be possible to publicly celebrate genocide once again, to revel in antisemitism’s finest hour. The heightened scrutiny of far-right movements in the last couple of years has unearthed statements that might once have remained unspoken, or only spoken behind closed doors. In August 2017, for example, one KKK leader told a journalist: “We killed 6 million Jews the last time. Eleven million [immigrants] is nothing.” A piece published by the Daily Stormer in advance of the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville that same month ended: “Next stop: Charlottesville, VA. Final stop: Auschwitz.”
Indeed, the Daily Stormer, one of the most prominent online publications of the resurgent far-right, demonstrates an exuberant agility in balancing denialism, post-denialism and open hatred simultaneously, using humour as a method of floating between them all. But there is no doubt what the ultimate destination is. As Andrew Anglin, who runs the site, put it in a style guide for contributors that was later leaked to the press: “The unindoctrinated should not be able to tell if we are joking or not. There should also be a conscious awareness of mocking stereotypes of hateful racists. I usually think of this as self-deprecating humour – I am a racist making fun of stereotypes of racists, because I don’t take myself super-seriously. This is obviously a ploy and I actually do want to gas kikes. But that’s neither here nor there.”
Not all denialists are taking these steps towards open acknowledgment of their desires. In some fields, the commitment to repressing desire remains strong. We are not yet at a stage when a climate change denier can come out and say, proudly, “Bangladesh will be submerged, millions will suffer as a result of anthropogenic climate change, but we must still preserve our carbon-based way of life, no matter what the cost.” Nor are anti-vaxxers ready to argue that, even though vaccines do not cause autism, the death of children from preventable diseases is a regrettable necessity if we are to be released from the clutches of Big Pharma.
Still, over time it is likely that traditional denialists will be increasingly influenced by the emerging post-denialist milieu. After all, what oil industry-funded wonk labouring to put together a policy paper suggesting that polar bear populations aren’t declining hasn’t fantasised of resorting to gleeful, Trumpian assertions?
The possibility of an epochal shift away from denialism means that there is now no avoiding a reckoning with some discomfiting issues: how do we respond to people who have radically different desires and morals from our own? How do we respond to people who delight in or are indifferent to genocide, to the suffering of millions, to venality and greed?
Denialism, and the multitude of other ways that modern humans have obfuscated their desires, prevent a true reckoning with the unsettling fact that some of us might desire things that most of us regard as morally reprehensible. I say “might” because while denialism is an attempt to covertly legitimise an unspeakable desire, the nature of the denialist’s understanding of the consequences of enacting that desire is usually unknowable.
It is hard to tell whether global warming denialists are secretly longing for the chaos and pain that global warming will bring, are simply indifferent to it, or would desperately like it not to be the case but are overwhelmed with the desire to keep things as they are. It is hard to tell whether Holocaust deniers are preparing the ground for another genocide, or want to keep a pristine image of the goodness of the Nazis and the evil of the Jews. It is hard to tell whether an Aids denialist who works to prevent Africans from having access to anti-retrovirals is getting a kick out of their power over life and death, or is on a mission to save them from the evils of the west.
If the new realm of unrestrained online discourse, and the example set by Trump, tempts more and more denialists to transition towards post-denialism and beyond, we will finally know where we stand. Instead of chasing shadows, we will be able to contemplate the stark moral choices we humans face.
Maybe we have been putting this test off for too long. The liberation of desire we are beginning to witness is forcing us all to confront some very difficult questions: who are we as a species? Do we all (the odd sociopath aside) share a common moral foundation? How do we relate to people whose desires are starkly different from our own?
Perhaps, if we can face up to the challenge presented by these new revelations, it might pave the way for a politics shorn of illusion and moral masquerade, where different visions of what it is to be human can openly contend. This might be a firmer foundation on which to rekindle some hope for human progress – based not on illusions of what we would like to be, but on an accounting of what we are.

Ecologists working on the Llyn Brianne Observatory project in mid Wales, which has been in operation for almost 40 years, have flagged up the disappearance and decline of invertebrates from the streams. 
Steve Ormerod, a professor of ecology at Cardiff University’s school of biosciences, who has personally studied the 14 streams for 34 years, characterised the loss of freshwater organisms as a “hidden tragedy”. 
He said: “Freshwater ecologists are seriously concerned at the plight of the world’s rivers, lakes and wetlands, and at the rate at which they’re losing plants and animals of many types.
“Yet, many people are unaware of this ongoing tragedy hidden beneath the water surface. Our results show that the buildup to species extinction can start in a subtle way, for example, where climate change causes numbers to decline before sudden disappearance.” 
Ormerod said that while urban rivers were becoming more healthy, with animals and birds such as Atlantic salmon and dippers returning, rural streams and rivers were not doing as well.
“We need to step up action to prevent these losses and work of this type will help to inform the best approaches while providing a timely wake-up call.”
The data that the Observatory has gathered over the decades shows the loss or sharp decline of specialist organisms such as predatory flatworms, stoneflies and caddisflies.
Their struggle does not attract the same headlines as the extinction of a spectacular mammal or bird, but their loss or decline may fundamentally change the nature of the streams they inhabit – and therefore affect other animals, such as the brown trout, that are to be found in the Llyn Brianne streams. 
One species that has been lost is the flatworm Crenobia alpina, a cool-water stream predator. The creature vanished from Llyn Brianne and much of Wales when the temperature of the streams rose, although it has recently been found again in a cold stream that emerges from a cave in the Brecon Beacons.
The project originally grew out of a scheme to protect sea trout. 
In 1973, the Llyn Brianne dam was opened at the headwaters of the river Tywi to supply water to much of south Wales. There was alarm that the dam would stop sea trout from reaching their breeding grounds, so an extravagant scheme was hatched to trap them, put them in lorries and transport them to streams on the other side of the dam.
After that, the Llyn Brianne Observatory project was launched in 1981 with its first focus on acid rain. The streams, which feed into the reservoir, were carefully chosen to represent a variety of types. Some trickle down from exposed hillside grazed by sheep, others plunge through the conifer forests, which are periodically harvested, and a few emerge from the remnants of oak woodland. 
Over the years, hundreds of scientists have visited the 14 streams to take part in many experiments. There are some ingenious innovations. For example, a stainless steel cascade runs parallel to one of the streams. 
Stream water is piped into it, allowing experiments to take place in the controlled environment of the cascade. There is no power source and if the temperature needs to be raised in the cascade researchers can pipe it through manure provided by one of the local farmers.
Despite Ormerod’s long spell studying the streams, his enthusiasm is undiminished. When he took the Guardian on a tour of the observatory, he pushed through thick undergrowth and scrambled down steep banks into streams with his net. The technique is to scrape the bottom of a stream with a boot and collect the creatures that are disturbed. A single scoop collects hundreds of organisms. 
Despite some of the data, Ormerod remains optimistic. He points out that acid rain was the big worry when the oservatory was launched, but that crisis has been tackled. “What that illustrates is that even if you are facing a major environmental problem, taking the right action can lead to solutions. That’s an incredibly hopeful message.”
He said the information the observatory was collecting would not halt climate change, but may lead to ways of adapting the landscape to mitigate the effects. 
“There’s a whole set of invisible elements at play. The changing rainfall pattern, temperature changes, recovery from the past effects of acid rain. They are made real by the information that comes out of the streams and the organisms we monitor. 
“What we are seeing is changes among rarer organisms and specialised organisms. They are starting to decline and that’s clearly consistent with the signals of climate change effect you see more broadly across the world. I think that early warning is an important one for us to see and heed,” Ormerod said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/05/welsh-river-study-reveals-troubling-decline-of-wildlife

Two-thirds of selected projects by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade achieved a modest or significant impact on climate outcomes, the evaluation said.
But despite Australia spending $599m on climate-related aid investments between 2010 and 2013, the report said that the resourcing of such projects then began to decline.
“From this time to the Paris Agreement at the end of 2015, Australia did not provide dedicated additional climate financing, with climate action subsumed into general aid programming.”
Although the report does not mention the 2013 election of the Abbott government, it says there was “a loss of climate-specific expertise from the aid program as funding and priorities changed”. It adds that programming choices were “decentralised to posts which also had to manage reductions in the broader aid program at this time”.
In some cases “climate change investments were rebranded in 2014 (for example, as food security, water security or disaster preparedness), as climate was de-emphasised in the Australian policy context”, it said.
“Staff and senior managers spent a considerable amount of time internally rebranding the work and many lost the ability to report on climate-related outcomes as these objectives and indicators were removed,” it said.
“Many other investments lost impetus and were closed early as staff incentives abated.”
The Abbott government cut foreign aid by a total of $11bn over the medium term, reducing Australia’s aid program to the lowest levels since the creation of a formal aid program more than 40 years ago.
At the Paris climate conference in December 2015, Malcolm Turnbull announced Australia would provide at least $1bn over five years to build climate change resilience and reduce emissions in developing countries.
The evaluation examined a sample of 26 projects valued at $641.2m that started between 2006 and 2014. It found that nine projects achieved or were likely to achieve “significant climate-relevant outcomes” and a further nine would achieve “modest” outcomes.
The remaining eight projects were either unlikely to or would not achieve climate outcomes or were not designed with climate outcomes in mind.
The report said the majority of investments “proved effective” but there was less evidence that the results would achieve climate outcomes because “monitoring and the subsequent reporting of climate change results was often inadequate and inconsistent”.
The department elevated climate change as a priority for aid in July 2016, but the report said its strategy and implementation plan was scheduled for completion this year.
In addition to completing this plan, the report recommended the department routinely collect information to track the effectiveness of its climate change investments and strengthen internal design and staff capacity for climate change projects.
In its response, the department said the report contained “valuable analysis and insights that can directly inform more effective climate change action”. 
“The department agrees broadly with all the evaluation’s recommendations and with its conclusions.”
The Australian Council for International Development’s development economics adviser, Amrita Malhi, said the evaluation showed that up to 2013 Dfat’s efforts on climate change action were “bearing fruit” but then climate objectives were “stripped out and investments closed down”.
“After five years, it is only now that there are early signs of recovery and climate change is being considered as a more important component of the aid program,” she said. “Compared to our allies, like the UK, we are now playing catch-up.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/aug/07/abbott-policies-reduced-effectiveness-of-foreign-office-work-on-climate-change

That is in reality all that it is down to.You want less carbon emissions, then limit what energy you use.Don't use Facebook; don't Tweet, it all consumes energy and adds to carbon emmissions! Family of four? why more that ONE television? or more that ONE car? OR more than one HOUSE? I will avoid (!) mentioning holidays and cheap air fares. As I understand it, aviation is one of the greatest contributors to problems in the upper atmosphere.
If you really want to cut carbon emissions to a reasonable level then you need a very different society and, unfortunately I doubt that Humanity is ready to accept what that requires in terms of a serious change in lifestyle. 
Plus it would require an enormous change in how economies are configured.For instance any vehicle - and electric ones are no exception - has about 30+% of its carbon footprint in its production. That is if it covers 100,000 miles. In fact electric vehicles are very dependent on what exactly is the nature of the source (Coal, renewables, Nuclear) for their power supply in order for them to be more carbon emission efficient. So, as most vehicles produced today are, if properly maintained, good for 200,000+ miles, perhaps owners should only be allowed to change their vehicles after that sort of milage has been achieved. A problem for both owners and the motor manufacturing industry and those employed by it or connected to it.
I doubt if such changes in existing society are possible and it is probably too late anyway as, in my estimation, by the time we really start to seriously discuss such things on a public level this is usually the case.

It's understandable perhaps, given our current predicament to think that in the distant past, our values were better because our environmental footprint was less grievous.

In fact, in ancient times humans hunted megafauna to extinction, denuded vast areas of their tree cover, and the incidence of inter-tribal violence was extreme. We were less civilised in so many ways. The tendency to believe in a Garden of Eden past is deeply engrained but ignorance is not bliss.
It is only now, in the last century or so, that the capacity to think a single species, and to see ourselves not as seperate from but part of a global complex of interwoven systems has developed. Until recently we had no concept of the carbon cycle, let alone its significance. We didn't understand planetary weather systems at all, let alone our influence on them. We were all prey to ideologies that allowed slavery and glorified warfare. Very many people are still locked into regressive mindsets but many human practices that were once widespread are now considered barbaric and utterly unacceptable.
So while there is a lot to be really deeply concerned about, the answers lie in the future not the past.

An excellent diagramme, and a warning we should fully heed.

The future looks fiery and dangerous. Hot on the heels of Trump, fake news and the parlous state of the Brexit negotiations, despair is in the air. Now a new scientific report makes the case that even fairly modest future carbon dioxide emissions could set off a cascade of catastrophe, with melting permafrost releasing methane to ratchet up global temperatures enough to drive much of the Amazon to die off, and so on in a chain reaction around the world that pushes Earth into a terrifying new hothouse state from which there is no return. Civilisation as we know it would surely not survive. How do we deal with such news?
As a research scientist in this field, I can give some nuance to the headlines. One common way of thinking about climate change is the lower the future carbon dioxide emissions, the less warming and the less havoc we will face as this century progresses. This is certainly true, but as the summer heatwave and the potential hothouse news remind us, the shifts in climate we will experience will not be smooth, gradual and linear changes. They may be fast, abrupt, and dangerous surprises may happen. However, an unstoppable globally enveloping cascade of catastrophe, while possible, is certainly not a probable outcome.
Yet, even without a hothouse we are on track to transform Earth this century. The world, after 30 years of warnings, has barely got to grips with reducing carbon dioxide emissions. They need to rapidly decline to zero, but after decades of increases, are, at best, flatlining, with investments in extracting new fossil fuels continuing, including last month’s scandalous announcement that fracking will be allowed in the UK. Temperatures have increased just 1C above preindustrial levels, and we are on course for another 2C or 3C on top of that. Could civilisation weather this level of warming?
The honest answer is nobody knows. Dystopia is easy to envisage: for example, Europe is not coping well with even modest numbers of migrants, and future flows look likely to increase substantially as migration itself is an adaptation to rapid climate change. How will the cooler, richer parts of the world react to tens of millions of people escaping the hotter, poorer parts? Throw into the mix long-term stagnating incomes for most people across the west and climate-induced crop failures causing massive food price spikes and we have a recipe for widespread unrest that could overload political institutions.
It is then easy to see these intersecting crises dovetailing with calls from the new far-right populists for strong authoritarian leaders to solve these problems. Inward-looking nationalists could then move further away from the internationalism needed to ensure the continuation of stable global food supplies and to manage migration humanely. And without cooperative internationalism serious carbon dioxide mitigation will not happen, meaning the underling drivers of the problems will exacerbate, leading to a lock-in of a deteriorating, isolationist, fascist future.
However, taking a step back from the gloom, we face the same three choices in response to climate change as we did before this scorching summer: reduce greenhouse gas emissions (mitigation), make changes to reduce the adverse impacts of the new conditions we create (adaptation), or suffer the consequences of what we fail to mitigate or adapt to. It is useful to come back to these three options, and settle on the formula that serious mitigation and wise adaptation means little suffering.
Despite this basic advice being decades old, we are heading for some mitigation, very little adaptation, and a lot of suffering. Why is this happening? This is because while the diagnosis of climate change being a problem is a scientific issue, the response to it is not. Leaving fossil fuels in the ground is, for example, a question of regulation, while investing in renewable energy is a policy choice, and modernising our housing stock to make it energy efficient is about overcoming the lobbying power of the building industry. Solving climate change is about power, money, and political will.
And that means talking about climate change and engaging in politics at all levels. One way to put climate change centre stage in the next general election could be to approach the candidates of key marginal seats to discuss whether they would support serious climate-related legislation. In return hundreds of supporters of climate legislation would door-knock and leaflet these constituencies to support them. A serious grassroots conversation would occur, it would become an election issue, and a large group of people outside parliament and inside it would be poised to lobby for the necessary transformative legislation on mitigation and adaptation.
Thinking about climate change as a practical political problem helps avoid despair because we know that huge political changes have happened in the past and continue to do so. The future is up to us if we act collectively and engage in politics. To quote Antonio Gramsci: “I’m a pessimist because of intelligence, but an optimist because of will.” Looked at this way, we can see the politics as a battle between a future shaped by fear versus a future shaped by hope.
That hope is built on a better story of the future and routes to enact it. The outline of this story is that given the colossal wealth and the scientific knowledge available today, we can solve many of the world’s pressing problems and all live well. Given that our environmental impacts are so long-lasting, the future is the politics we make today.

In unstable times, the brain reduces cell production to help copeby Morgan Kelly, Office of CommunicationsAug. 24, 2016 1:30 p.m.People who experience job loss, divorce, death of a loved one or any number of life’s upheavals often adopt coping mechanisms to make the situation less traumatic.
While these strategies manifest as behaviors, a Princeton University and National Institutes of Health study suggests that our response to stressful situations originates from structural changes in our brain that allow us to adapt to turmoil.
A study conducted with adult rats showed that the brains of animals faced with disruptions in their social hierarchy produced far fewer new neurons in the hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for certain types of memory and stress regulation. Rats exhibiting this lack of brain-cell growth, or neurogenesis, reacted to the surrounding upheaval by favoring the company of familiar rats over that of unknown rats, according to a paper published in The Journal of Neuroscience.
A Princeton University and National Institutes of Health study suggests that our response to stressful situations originates from structural changes in our brain that allows us to adapt to turmoil. Adult rats with disruptions in their social hierarchy produced far fewer new neurons in the hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for certain types of memory and stress regulation. They also reacted to the disruption by favoring the company of familiar rats. Their behavior manifested six weeks after social disruption, during which time brain-cell growth, or neurogenesis, had decreased by 50 percent. The photo shows adult hippocampal neurons that are less than two weeks old. (Image courtesy of Maya Opendak, New York University)
The research is among the first to show that adult neurogenesis — or the lack thereof — has an active role in shaping social behavior and adaptation, said first author Maya Opendak, who received her Ph.D. in neuroscience from Princeton in 2015 and conducted the research as a graduate student. The preference for familiar rats may be an adaptive behavior triggered by the reduction in neuron production, she said.

As the Holocene Interglacial developed the Earth warmed up slowly over several thousands of years.
The warmest phase of the Holocene ran from about 9000 years ago until about 5000 years ago, and temperatures varied a little during this time with some ups and downs. This phase is called the Mid-Holocene Climatic Optimum.
Temperatures at points in the Mid-Holocene Climatic Optimum might have been (just about) as warm as in the later 20th century, but only in the summer and only in the northern hemisphere.
Then, about 5,000 years ago, the Earth began to cool very very slowly (with some variations) - until humans began to add lots of CO2 to the air as the Industrial Revolution developed.
Then it started to warm quickly, reversing the cooling trend.

BQSTART
Now, in the early 21st century, the Earth is quite possibly warmer than any time since the Eemian interglacial over 115,000 years ago.
BQEND
I've added bold italics to that.
It is just possible that some points in the MHCO were warmer than now for brief times.
The MHCO was (like the Eemian) warmer because of higher insolation caused by astronomical cycles, the sum of which became negative around 5000 years ago.
These processes are quite well-understood.

You've picked a set of years in the middle of the last glacial stage.
You seem to think palaeoclimate data is not valid.
The last few hundred thousand years are covered by ice core data, especially from Greenland and Antarctica; for very long periods (including the PETM around 55 my ago) we have species range distributions plus isotopic data, both from ocean floor coring - the data is found in fossil shells, for example.

Once again: these are regional data and shouldn't be extrapolated to the entire planet.
I also remind you again that the IPCC states (albeit not with high confidence) that it is more likely than not that total hurricane / numbers will actually decrease with global warming.

So the MWP happened in Greenland, the UK, Indonesia, and maybe the Canary Islands. But that's it. It's all you are willing to concede.
BQEND
Warming in these areas was (a) not globally synchronous, occurring at different points over three centuries and (b) many other areas around the globe experienced cooling or no substantive changes at all which makes it a completely different event from today's globally synchronous warming where almost the entire globe has warmed considerably.
Further, net global warming over the MWP amounted to less than 0.1C over three centuries, if that, that is compared to over 1C over the last century with a current rate of 0.2C per decade. You have still refused to comment on the comparative rate and severity of the warming in each incident.
Finally I think my use of the word ""localised"" above was misleading - as I meant localised to several areas (not globally synchronous) but it can be reasonably read as localised to one specific or general area, which is not the case with the MWP.', u'recommendation_count': u'8', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1534156402000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'2484923', u'in_reply_to': u'119331466', u'id': u'119343257', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'thebowsie', u'text': u'BQSTART

But now the chic, if slightly faded, seaside resort of Knokke-Heist is, in the words of its mayor, Count Leopold Lippens, in a “fight for its life”. The Flemish government, in an attempt to limit the damage to the Belgian coast from rising sea levels, has announced plans for an artificial island of 40 hectares (99 acres) 1.2 kilometres from the sandy beach, to act as a bulwark against the waves. Belgium has, until now, been slow to respond to climate change and its coast has suffered severe damage during recent storms.
Rather than saving Knokke-Heist, however, Lippens and others claim, the plan will create a calm channel of water in front of its beach, perfect for the barges, spewing oil and waste, that travel in and out of the port of Zeebrugge. “We would be an industrial harbour with a kind of open sewer in front of us,” Lippens said. “The island is to be 1.2km from the coast, so the boats would be 330 metres [away]. No one could swim or windsurf. It would be the end of tourism in Knokke-Heist, which would be very sad. That is why we are fighting for our lives.”
Lippens, mayor since 1979, said the municipality’s tourism revenues of €700m a year would be halved should the plans be approved. “We have to beat this,” he said. The 77-year-old has hired specialist lawyers to fight his corner.
The threat of rising waters is not unappreciated by the authorities in Knokke-Heist, a favourite hideout of the Belgian king, Philippe, and popular with artists since the Belgian painters James Ensor and Alfred Verwee captured its vistas on canvas in the early 19th century. The sea is expected to rise by 30cm by 2050 and 80cm by the end of the century. In 2016, Storm Dieter brought waves around two metres high crashing onto the front. About €17m was invested in a rebuilding programme, which included the replacement of 1.2m cubic metres of sand.
Lippens says studies by the authorities in the Netherlands suggest better solutions. “It is the dredging companies who are pushing for the work to make the island because the Chinese have taken a lot of jobs away,” he said. “In Holland, where the land is much lower than in Belgium, they have studied all the systems, studied the islands, and it would be worse than just using more and more sand on the beaches. That is what they are doing and that is what we want.”
Not everyone agrees. Cathy Coudyser, who sits for the Flemish nationalist party, the N-VA, in the Flemish parliament and on the city council, said Lippens, a member of the Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams party, was playing politics before an October election.
She told the Belgian daily Het Nieuwsblad: “We have explained to Mayor Lippens the plan several times. Still, he continues to send wrong information to the world without blinking, including on the website of the municipality.
“Doing nothing is not an option for Knokke,” she added. “The coast in Knokke is a weak zone, which is severely affected by a violent storm, probably with a lot of damage and heavy flooding.
“Several other options have been studied, such as raising the sea dyke. But then the apartments would disappear behind a concrete wall. That seems to us a much worse solution.”
The Flemish government has already released €8m for the island, which is part of its 2020-26 coastal management plans.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/11/knokke-heist-belgium-rising-sea-levels-environment-tourism

The backbencher made the claim, a new spin on the wisdom of the pub test, at a media conference in Canberra on energy policy and the drought.
If people can’t afford to cook and keep warm, if you go into their kitchen and talk about the Paris agreement, you are showing no respect.
Joyce said the Paris climate agreement “means nothing to them”.
“No 1 for the area is drought and what is happening now,” the member for New England said on Monday. “The other thing is power prices.
“The issue is this: people in the Kmart, people in the local pub, they don’t care about the Paris agreement. It means nothing to them. It has no purpose.
“What matters to them is this: that they can be able to afford their power bills and they currently cannot. It’s not about power prices staying where they are. They are too high. They’ve got to go down.”

Kmart culture war is the best culture war.
Others pointed out that Kmart’s own environmental policy promises to reduce store energy use and greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020.
The 2015 Paris agreement requires Australia to cut emissions to 26% less than the 2005 level by 2030.
Tony Abbott, who signed up to the Paris agreement when he was prime minister, urged the government in July to abandon it.
Joyce said: “There is a disconnect between people who feel isolated and the major parties and we have to make sure we honour that commitment to the people on the peripheries.

Possibly because it's not basic knowledge, it's superstition. I pointed out, in my earlier post, that if cold alone caused disease, there would be no one alive north of the Arctic Circle. Well, we can say much the same of people in tropical or subtropical climes who alternate between cool a/c in enclosed spaces and the sometimes stunning heat and humidity outside.

Instead, it just reads as random whining without actually committing to any particular position.
My personal take on A/C is that it is a godsend, but that, like many godsends, it has been abused and made us lazy. I live in Texas, where it gets VERY hot. You just couldn't live here without A/C, just like your couldn't live in Wisconsin without heating. But everything is over-cooled. Wherever I have been (not just in TX) everyone has complained that offices are too cold. It's a delight to leave work and get in your car and it's 100 degrees out and you can thaw out. But then, when I went to college up North, everything was overheated, and everyone had similar complaints. Part of the problem here is that those consuming the A/C or heating typically don't have any control over it.
It also bothers me that architecture no longer takes heating issues into account. The old houses here were designed to handle the heat as well as possible. But the new houses have none of those features, because you can just throw A/C at the problem. But A/C isn't really comfortable, especially if it's running constantly. It would make much more sense to design the houses intelligently, and then supplement the passive design with A/C.
I've also found that you can get used to it being a little warm, just like you can get used to it being a little cold. Most people don't want to, and I don't want to judge them for making that choice. We all want to be as comfortable as possible. But the more we're used to not being hot or cold, the more of an imposition it seems when we are. When I was little, living in southern Europe, where it's also pretty hot (although clearly cooler than Texas), no-one had A/C and we all survived. It didn't even seem like a huge imposition. Those stone houses and good ventilation (and lots of trips to the beach) made a difference.

It included a mighty fireplace.
“How often does it get cold enough to light a fire?” I asked, as what little I knew about the city included the fact that it is mostly hot and humid. Maybe once or twice a year, she replied, but her husband came from Wisconsin. He liked a log fire. So they would turn up the air conditioning and light one.
We reached the point where a ski-slope with 'real' snow could be built in a Dubai shopping mall and air-conditioned football stadiums could be planned for the 2022 Qatar World Cup
This was climate as television, to be summoned with the twiddle of a dial, the outcome of a century which started in 1902, when Willis Carrier was simply asked to find a way to prevent heat and humidity from warping the paper at the Brooklyn printing company Sackett-Wilhelms. But the air-conditioning that he helped develop has changed buildings, and the ways they are used, more than any other invention: more than reinforced concrete, plate glass, safety elevators or steel frames. Its effects have directed the locations and shapes of cities. They have been social, cultural and geopolitical.
The shopping mall would have been inconceivable without air conditioning, as would the deep-plan and glass-walled office block, as would computer servers. The rise of Hollywood in the 1920s would have been slowed if, as previously, theatres had needed to close in hot weather. The expansion of tract housing in postwar suburban America relied on affordable domestic air conditioning units. A contemporary museum, such as Tate Modern or Moma, requires a carefully controlled climate to protect the works of art.
Cities have boomed in places where, previously, the climate would have held them back. In 1950, 28% of the population of the US lived in its sunbelt, 40% in 2000. The combined population of the Gulf cities went from less than 500,000 before 1950 to 20 million now. Neither the rise of Singapore, nor the exploding cities of China and India, would have happened in the same way if they had still relied on punkah fans, shady verandas and afternoon naps.
There are, of course, other factors, such as the presence of oil reserves in both Houston and the Gulf, but the mitigation of otherwise unbearable temperatures radically changed the way the stories of these cities played out. And so, in the 21st century, we reached the point where a ski-slope with “real” snow could be built in a Dubai shopping mall and air-conditioned football stadiums could be planned for the 2022 Qatar World Cup, epics of refrigeration whose USP was their outrageous – and hitherto unfeasible – inversion of nature.
With air conditioning goes a new kind of architecture, one in which traditional hot-climate devices such as porches, cross-ventilation or pools of water, which create both layers and permeability between inside and out, have given way to sealed boxes. Persian wind-catching towers, or the fountains of the Alhambra, or the humble dogtrot house of the southern US, in which living and cooking quarters are separated by a passage open to the breeze, all proceeded by negotiation between built fabric and the environment. Now it is a matter of technological conquest.
Building services – their heating, cooling and ventilating systems – came to eat up larger proportions of their total budgets. The people who designed them, services engineers, became influential if underacknowledged officers in the shaping of cities. By the 1980s, buildings such as Richard Rogers’ Lloyds building gave formal expression to the ducts and extracts that until then had been hidden. In the Die Hard movies they become a crucial setting of suspense and action, being large enough to accommodate the body of Bruce Willis.
The most significant architectural effect of air conditioning, however, is in the social spaces it creates. In Houston, as in most southern American cities, you can progress from your air-conditioned house to your air-conditioned garage and then in your air-conditioned car to parking garages, malls and workplaces which are all, also, air-conditioned. In the city’s downtown area, underpasses and bridges link different buildings, so that you can go from one to another without exposing yourself to the exterior. It is possible, indeed habitual, to spend whole days and weeks in controlled weather.
In the brutal climate of Doha, Qatar (or indeed in Dubai, Shenzhen or Singapore) similar spaces recur. Buildings which appear separate from the outside (for the few, that is, who choose to be outside) are internally fused, a hotel turning into a mall into a food court into a multiplex via a series of lobbies whose décor of marble, carpet and timber veneer can’t decide if it is internal or external. The hierarchies and distinctions of European cities – between buildings and streets, and between degrees of public and private space – are bypassed and dissolved.
The architect Rem Koolhaas called this phenomenon “Junkspace”, a “product of the encounter between escalator and air conditioning, conceived in an incubator of sheetrock … always interior, so extensive that you rarely perceive limits.” In the Gulf and China as in much of the US, the mall became the principal gathering place, being a zone where large numbers could comfortably pass their time, leaving streets to be occupied by air conditioning’s mechanical ally, the automobile.
Air conditioning is anti-social. It buys its owner comfort at the cost of shifting the surplus heat somewhere else
The result is a form of sensory deprivation that almost everyone now accepts without question, in which the active interplay of body and atmosphere becomes homogenised and passive. The stimuli of scent, touch, sound and sight are almost entirely at the discretion of the mall management: “a low grade purgatory”, as Koolhaas called it, “overripe and undernourishing at the same time … like being condemned to a perpetual jacuzzi with millions of your best friends.”
There is also an absence of what a European might consider public space, that is somewhere in principle available to everyone, open to activities both unprogrammed and not necessarily retail. It has been observed that the climate-controlled networks of Houston or Jakarta or Dubai can serve not only to exclude heat and humidity, but also those considered undesirable or insufficiently profitable. In such places there is a clear divide, social and often racial, between those inside the conditioned cocoon and those outside. The street becomes actively hostile, the effects of weather compounded by those of motor traffic and indifference to the needs of pedestrians. Here are the people you don’t see in the malls – the blue-uniformed migrant workers in the Gulf, the homeless and luckless in America.
Environmentally speaking, air conditioning is anti-social. It buys its owner comfort at the cost of shifting the surplus heat somewhere else, on to surrounding streets and ultimately into the atmosphere of the planet. The night-time temperature of Phoenix, Arizona, is believed to be increased by one degree or more by the heat expelled from its air conditioning. This is, you could say, the perfectly neoliberal technology, based on division and displacement. According to one theory, air conditioning helped to elect Ronald Reagan, by attracting conservatively inclined retirees to the southern states that swung in his favour.
In pointing out the shortcomings of air conditioning, it is easy to overlook its achievements, to ask, in the style of Life of Brian, what it ever did for us. Considerable reductions in the loss of life through excess heat is one answer. Increased productivity and economic activity in hot regions of the world is another. Or better-functioning hospitals and schools. Most of us would be grateful for its contribution to computing and movies. Few people who have spent time in hot and humid climates would not sometimes want the refuge of artificially cooled air.
One defence of air-conditioned cities is that they are more energy-efficient than very cold cities – Minneapolis, for example – that need to be heated up in winter, and if the statistics of energy consumption sound terrifying, they can also be put in perspective. The US expends more energy on air conditioning, for example, than the whole of Africa does on everything. Then again, it expends even more energy on hot water, which doesn’t get the same rap.
The question then is not whether to condition climate, but how. As long ago as the 1940s the Egyptian architect Hassan Fathy demonstrated, with his village of New Gourna near Luxor, how traditional techniques of orientation, ventilation, screening and shading could be revived. Many contemporary architects are following his lead – the Nigerian Kunlé Adeyemi, for example, whose new Black Rhino Academy in Tanzania tries to optimise the conditions for its users by finding the best location, environmentally speaking, on its site.
If these principles are now better known, the challenge remains to expand the village-scale achievements of an architect like Hassan Fathy to large, fast-growing cities. Addressing this challenge is the promise of high-profile, government-backed projects such as Msheireb in Qatar and Masdar City in Abu Dhabi, which boast of their combinations of old forms – shady courtyards and arcades; narrow, breezy streets – with solar panel arrays and what Masdar’s architects, Foster and Partners, call “state-of-the-art technologies”.
There has been some scepticism, about Masdar in particular, that these projects’ purposes might be more symbolic than truly environmental. But the places they create are incomparably more pleasurable than the downtowns, mechanised by cars and air-conditioning, of the cities in which they are placed. They are, at least, steps forward in what is an essential task for the 21st century: to develop new forms of public space in hot climates, not the city-scaled habitable fridges of the 20th.

The Turnbull government’s measly 26-28% reduction by 2030 would, if replicated globally, doom us to around three degrees of warming and a world quite unlike anything humans have encountered before.

Although mathematically provable, people just don't believe their world can do such a thing. It's so far outside everyday experience it doesn't compute, and they assume if it was really a risk ""The Authorities"" would be all over it and they'd hear more about it on the news. By the time enough of us realise ""The Authorities"" are doing everything possible to prevent meaningful action, we'll be deep into the next round of fascism, war and collapse.
Why? Because a King wants to remain King and pass his privilege to his heirs. King of the Majesty or King of the Ashes are still Kings. The answer is to understand how the modern aristocracy maintain their privilege. Which in turn means intimately understanding the astronomical differences between three wildly different categories of ""thing"": Money, Wealth, and Land(aka nature). It is through confusing these terms that we are manipulated into extending privilege to the modern aristocracy.

It's time for facts | Erwin Jackson,article,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/15/enough-with-the-fairy-tales-about-the-paris-agreement-its-time-for-facts,0,"The Paris climate change agreement has been in the news again recently, due to a small rump of the federal Coalition railing against the national energy guarantee. With all the noise being made by a select – and uninformed – few, it has come time to debunk some of their tallest tales.
Before we jump into fact checking, let’s remind ourselves just what the Paris agreement is. Signed in 2015, it is the first truly universal agreement among nations to tackle climate change. It’s not perfect, but the agreement has boosted the momentum to clean up economies around the world.
In response to the Paris agreement and the falling cost of zero emissions technology, more and more countries, businesses and investors are implementing policies to drive the transition to cheap and clean renewable energy. In 2017 alone, around 70% of new power generation installed globally was renewable energy, with more solar PV capacity being added in 2017 than that of coal, gas and nuclear combined.
The treaty has a number of key elements. Firstly, the objective of the agreement is not only to keep global warming “well below” 2°C above pre-industrial levels, but also to “pursue efforts” to keep warming to 1.5°C. This means global emissions must fall to zero by around 2050 – earlier in developed countries like Australia.
Secondly, the agreement requires action from all countries and, unlike previous agreements, these actions and targets need to strengthen through time. There is no room for us to go backwards.
Thirdly, the Paris agreement also involves a system of transparency and accountability where countries’ actions are reviewed by other nations.
Now to correct some of the fairy tales that appear to have embedded themselves in parliament.
The London School of Economics and Political Science reports that there are 1,500 climate laws and policies globally. Just over 20 years ago when the Kyoto protocol was signed, there were only 72.
These policies include carbon pricing (countries representing 56% of global emissions are on track to be covered soon), renewable energy schemes (179 countries have renewable energy targets) and vehicle emissions standards (nearly 80% of new light duty vehicles sold globally are subject to some kind of emissions standard), to name a few.
The Paris agreement has been ratified by 179 countries including Australia, the US, China, the EU, India and all other major emitters. US president Donald Trump has stated that the US intends to leave the agreement, but legally they cannot formally withdraw until November 2020. Trump’s America is the only country in the world to say it will renege on its commitments to the international community.
Despite Trump’s efforts, with clean technology costs falling and concerted action from US states, polluting coal plants are continuing to close and renewable energy and gas are expected to dominate the future of the US power system.
Both China and India have committed to emissions targets under the Paris agreement. China has committed to lower the carbon intensity of its economy by 60 to 65% below 2005 levels by 2030. India committed to reduce the emissions intensity of its economy by 33-35% below 2005 level over the same period.
Backed by government policies such as renewable energy support, plans to retire old coal generators, carbon pricing and energy efficiency standards, both countries are on track to achieve these targets well in advance of 2030. For example, India is projected to meet its 2030 target to get 40% of its electricity generation from non-fossil fuel sources eight years early.
The world is currently not on track to achieve the objectives of the Paris agreement. Substantial progress has been made but more will need to be done by all countries to limit warming to well below 2oC.
And we are just as culpable as any of the others. The Turnbull government’s measly 26-28% reduction by 2030 would, if replicated globally, doom us to around three degrees of warming and a world quite unlike anything humans have encountered before.
Meeting the ambition outlined in the Paris agreement is challenging but achievable. We already have the technology necessary, but we will need to use it, and fast. The main barrier to reaping the benefits of the transition to clean energy and avoiding severe climate change impacts remains political will, and this is something we can all do something about.

Off the California coast near San Diego, scientists in early August recorded all-time high seawater temperatures since daily measurements began in 1916.
“Just like we have heatwaves on land, we also have heatwaves in the ocean,” said Art Miller of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.
Between 1982 and 2016, the number of “marine heatwaves” roughly doubled, and will probably become more common and intense as the planet warms, a study released on Wednesday found. Prolonged periods of extreme heat in the oceans can damage kelp forests and coral reefs, and harm fish and other marine life.
“This trend will only further accelerate with global warming,” said Thomas Frolicher, a climate scientist at the University of Bern in Switzerland, who led the research. 
Because oceans both absorb and release heat more slowly than air, most marine heatwaves last for at least several days and some for several weeks, said Frolicher.
“We knew that average temperatures were rising. What we haven’t focused on before is that the rise in the average comes at you in clumps of very hot days a shock of several days or weeks of very high temperatures,” said Michael Oppenheimer, a Princeton University climate scientist who was not involved in the study.
Many sea creatures have evolved to survive within a fairly narrow band of temperatures compared with creatures on land, and even incremental warming can be disruptive.
Some free-swimming sea animals may shift their routines, but stationary organisms like coral reefs and kelp forests “are in real peril”, said Michael Burrows, an ecologist at the Scottish Marine Institute, who was not part of the research.
In 2016 and 2017, persistent high ocean temperatures off eastern Australia killed off as much as half of the shallow water corals of the Great Barrier Reef.
The latest study in Nature relied on satellite data and other records of sea-surface temperatures including from ships and buoys. Changes in ocean circulation associated with warmer surface waters will probably mean decreased production of phytoplankton, the experts warned.

There are three different levels of investigation of the issue that the author highlights. The first is the science is simply wrong. The second is that there are enormous amounts of evidence that show there has been corruption. The political aims underlying the genesis and promotion of the theory is on record. Statements have been made many times, by various scientists, officials, politicians. So, if, like me, you believe 1) the science is fundamentally flawed at the most basic level of logic; and 2) the corruption and politicisation of the science is undeniable, which it is, that leaves 3) the question 'Why?' I accept 1) and 2). I do not know enough about 3), except that there are a number of different actors whose interests collide, as well as the simple 'madness of crowds' pushing it all along. Clive James has written an excellent essay on the subject.
In terms of the link I provided (I hadn't read the whole paper, I was mainly interested in the geological data), I cannot really comment on some of the author's wilder claims. Certainly, the environmental/socialist aims of world governance are not a secret, nor is the involvement of banks and governments in this, who are profiting from carbon trading. Nor is the desire of key figures such as Maurice Strong, and numerous activists such as Bill McKibben, to see the collapse of industrial civilisation, and the regulation of the citizenry. I think it's irresponsible, given the horrors of the 20thC, to dismiss out of hand nefarious purposes, given that the thirst for absolute power by elites never goes away. How quickly people forget.
The statement: Santa Claus doesn't exist; is made no less true by many children believing it is true, and adults going along with the myth.

Skeptics have been arguing against linearity, and that the effect of CO2 plateaus! What was the Hockey Stick and the original graph used in An Inconvenient Truth, if not a linear relationship?
BQEND
You are horribly misinformed. Everyone but you, it seems, knows that the forcing effect of CO2 is logarithmic. Successive doublings of CO2 cause the same amount of warming - currently thought to be about 3C . Only an exponential rise in CO2 will cause linear temperature rise.
This is why the original hockey stick article related temperatures to the log of CO2 (see figure 7).
BQSTART
We're obviously looking at a different graph, if you are denying the inverse correlation between temp/CO2 during the Ordivician.
BQEND
For most of the Ordovician, CO2 was very high and it was very warm. The late glaciation event occurred when CO2 was still high by today's standards, but significantly lower than for the rest of the Ordovician.
BQSTART
you never deal with the tampered data
BQEND
Nonsense; I have posted many times on this issue. Everyone, ""sceptics"" included, agree that data need to adjusted to corrected for errors. This is done using methodologies that are freely available. If there are statistical flaws in these methods, ""sceptics"" should find them and publish a rebuttal. They've had years to do this and they cannot. In general they don't even try - the GWPF announced such a review a few years ago but it quickly fizzled out and its website has been taken down.
BQSTART
You never deal with the failed predictions, you never deal with the failed modelling, you never deal with reality. Because you are blinded by your belief in the theory
BQEND
Again, complete nonsense - I've posted on this many times, some of which were replies to you. Climate models from decades ago have done a quite respectable job in forecasting long term warming. Here is a recent article on how they have performed.
BQSTART
You never answer the fundamental point. if natural variability and 'different mechanisms' were able to override CO2 as the main driver (or even a significant driver) in the past, then why can't those same, or different, mechanisms apply today
BQEND
Of course they can! Natural variability is precisely why temperatures are not rising steadily - they wriggle around up and down. ENSO events are the most obvious example. But these natural factors are temporary, in both directions and exhibit no trend. Witness how the warming slowdown of the early 2000s (wrongly termed the ""pause"") was cancelled out completely by a subsequent speedup. These factors are not making any difference to the long term trend.
As for the different mechanism responsible for previous Ice Ages - it's still around too. But it's exceptionally slow and if anything it's in a (very) slight cooling phase now.
BQSTART
You should also know, that a paper is about to be published that shows the equation they have been using that underlies the 'theory', contains a critical error
BQEND
Yes, I see that Christopher Monckton has submitted yet another ""it's game over for AGW"" paper (is this his third or fourth such paper? I've lost count). Apparently it will claim that a doubling of CO2 will produce only about 1C of warming.

You never answer the fundamental point. if natural variability and 'different mechanisms' were able to override CO2 as the main driver (or even a significant driver) in the past, then why can't those same, or different, mechanisms apply today??!!! Why is it assumed that suddenly all other variables settle down, and that we perfectly understand the contribution and complex interactions of other factors, so that any change in the climate in the direction of warming is caused by US, and any change the other way, is 'natural variability"". If you cannot see the fundamental deceit in all of this, nobody can help you, because you don;t WANT to see it. You should also know, that a paper is about to be published that shows the equation they have been using that underlies the 'theory', contains a critical error (and nobody has been able to refute it yet). The jig is up.

This is because your hero Blair was, is and always will be a tory: £27m property portfolio among everything else say it all really. No Labour party leader should ever shame themselves, but worst still the Labour Party itself with such obscene gains whilst in office.
But ignoring this lying toads war munging for one moment, this hero and his fellow right wing mates crushed our economy by handing out PFI contracts like confetti, and continued the Thatcherite deregulation of the financial sector - ultimately leading to the financial crash, which many of our poorest and most disadvantaged have paid for, and will continue to pay for many many years to come.
Yes mate, I ain't too bad at maths OR understanding why these idiotic, incompetent tories are in power. And it wasn't and ISN'T because of Jeremy Corbyn, John McDonnell or Diane Abbott.
On current Labour Policy, you dismiss the idea of a National Investment Bank, and yet this is an idea advocated by the Labour right wing:
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/kamal-ahmed/7279452/A-state-investment-bank-It-might-just-work.html
Of course, we were looking at 2010 when New Labour were still in power, and it as Mandleson and not Corbyn and McDonnell who were supporting it. Isn't it funny how times have changed for some supposed Labour voters?
Trident, you say Labour wants to get rid of this - yet their party is committed to renewing it, albeit against the wishes of many within the party - including Jeremy Corbyn. But at the end of the day, the Labour Party comes first even if this is against the leaders wishes. Is this not a good thing? Do we want the likes of Trump to lead us?
For what it is worth, my own view is we should dump this useless piece of crap and buildour own. For if the likes of Pakistan, India and N.K can do so, then surely so can we.
Renationalisation. What has been the benefit of privatisation - please do tell me?I've worked in a decent position in finance in an outsource company for over 10 years now. And I can assure you this is a free for all on tax payers and consumers money. Carillion ISN'T a one-off. They are ALL at it. Money being syphoned of at an alarming rate, straight into the hands of shareholders and board members. Usually one and the same. Reinvestment is minimal, whilst wages for the many are crushed. No New Labour didn't create this - but they've helped sustain it. I can only assume you are one of the few beneficiaries seeing your support.

For the vast vast majority are too scared to ask for a pay rise, and bosses are more than happy to take full advantage - pocketing the difference. Unfortunately this is what is happening in the real world. Unfortunately we need unions because otherwise the economy will eventually grind to a halt as destitution rises.

My point wasn't that '1,100 is so much bigger than 3.3', and you know it
BQEND
I think it was very much your point. Here's what you said, clearly mocking the notion that a few percent drop in TSI could negate a tenfold or more increase in CO2:
BQSTART
During the Ordovician CO2 levels were 1,100% higher than they are today, during a glaciation. The excuse is that solar radiation was 3.3% lower. Do the maths
BQEND
And here's you on another occasion:
BQSTART
Skeptical Science to get around this says ""Oh but the solar levels were 4% lower"". Yes, and the CO2 levels were about 11 times higher...that's 1,100% higher!
BQEND
Real experts have already done the maths and worked out that the reduced TSI in that era raised the CO2 threshold for glaciation to 3000 ppm.
BQSTART
the supposedly HIGHLY POTENT greenhouse gas at massively high levels, and which, according to alarmists, has a linear relationship to temperature!!
BQEND
Incorrect: it's logarithmic, not linear. Each doubling of CO2 increases temperatures by the same amount. (Incidentally, this is another reason why such high CO2 levels were necessary to prevent glaciation during the Ordovician)
BQSTART
As the CO2 went up, the temperature should have gone up too, even if it was to a lesser extent due to reduced TSI
BQEND
They did go up. CO2 was very high for most of the Ordovician and as a result it was very warm. The exception - the late Ordovician glaciation - occurred when CO2 went down.
BQSTART
You never address the FACT that CO2 rises FOLLOW temperature rises
BQEND
Nonsense - I've previously replied to you on this very issue no less than three times.* The reason for it is that the warming events documented in the ice core record were initiated by an entirely different mechanism (orbital forcing) to that occurring today.

The Climategate emails are easily accessible, and Tony Heller has irrefutable evidence of data tampering, but you refuse to accept the blatant corruption, and instead simply use calls to authority to bolster your argument.

In a world where the marginal cost on production is rapidly approaching zero, Capitalism has become an anachronism, acting as a brake on human progress.
Artificial scarcity is now being actively engineered in order to ensure the ongoing survival of redundant social relations. Think about it: where would the drive be to truck and barter in a world of super abundance?
We are preoccupied with problems that no longer exist. Once the realisation becomes widespread that it's no longer inevitable that we have to compete in a dog-eat-dog competition for limited resources to ensure our individual survival, then everything changes. Space is created for us to focus on what truly constitutes the good life, which is, as you point out, the flourishing of collective human society in harmony with the planet.
The challenge we face to progress is the powerful vested interests that want to maintain their position in the established Capitalist order. Their grip is actually very tenuous, as it is only based on us continuing to accept the illusion that scarcity is still a real problem.
If you want to contribute to the transition from Capitalism to something better, then highlight to your friends and family the truly staggering productive capabilities of humanity in the 21st century and engage in a debate that will help them realise that a new way of living is now possible.

More nonsense. What contrarians mean by ""pause"" is non-statistically significant warming (which is not the same as no warming), between cherry picked dates, and using a cherry picked data set.
Even then I think you'll struggle to get to 20 years. And of course you only have to extend the period a little bit to obtain a good whack of statistically significant warming - which is rather difficult to explain if you maintain there was no warming for almost all of that time.

Have a look at this creative bit of editing:
Santer was appointed lead-author of Chapter 8 “Detection of Climate Change and Attribution of Causes” of the 1995 IPCC Report. In that position, he determined to prove humans were a factor despite no evidence. His fellow chapter authors agreed to a final draft at a meeting in Madrid. Here are the four agreed to comments
1. “None of the studies cited above has shown clear evidence that we can attribute the observed [climate] changes to the specific cause of increases in greenhouse gases.”
2. “While some of the pattern-base discussed here have claimed detection of a significant climate change, no study to date has positively attributed all or part of climate change observed to man-made causes.”
3. “Any claims of positive detection and attribution of significant climate change are likely to remain controversial until uncertainties in the total natural variability of the climate system are reduced.”
4. “While none of these studies has specifically considered the attribution issue, they often draw some attribution conclusions, for which there is little justification.”
Here are the entries that appeared after Santer rewrote them.
1. “There is evidence of an emerging pattern of climate response to forcing by greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols … from the geographical, seasonal and vertical patterns of temperature change … These results point toward a human influence on global climate.”
2. “The body of statistical evidence in chapter 8, when examined in the context of our physical understanding of the climate system, now points to a discernible human influence on the global climate.”

And I want to know, if they hate capitalism so much, why don't they all just get together, buy some land, and go off and live the dream, free from fossil fuels! And they can take all the disaffected, oppressed people that they profess to care so much about with them and set up their Utopian society.
Progressives live their entire lives with cognitive dissonance. Because they cannot resolve the gap between their actions and their words, between their competitiveness and their desire for success with their indoctrinated belief in 'equality' and 'social justice' and 'inclusivity', between their consumerism and their environmentalism, they create enemies and scapegoats of others, to project their self-loathing and guilt onto...hence they are happy to vilify 'deniers', while living their lives in exactly the same manner (or even more lavishly) as those they condemn!

Contrary to the ridiculous assertion made in this article, renewable power is expensive and will remain expensive. Renewable power requires large investments in renewable power plants, major expansions in transmission capacity, near 100% backup capacity (peaker plants), and an upper limit on the amount of unreliable renewable power in a grid. When a grid reaches the saturation point, excess power generated when not needed must be dumped by paying other grids to take the excess power. This negative energy pricing is essentially a fuel charge for renewable power. California regularly must pay other grid operators to take excess power. The only way to avoid negative energy pricing is for energy storage in dams. Massive battery storage is not viable now, nor in the foreseeable future.

But only if it takes risks | Larry Elliott,article,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/16/capitalism-climate-change-risks-profits-china,0,"This summer’s heatwave has provided a glimpse of the future, and it is not a pretty one. On current trends, the years to come will see rising temperatures, droughts, a fight to feed a growing population, and a race against time to reduce dependency on fossil fuels.
The struggle to combat climate change brings out the best and worst of capitalism. Decarbonisation of the economy requires alternatives for coal and cars that run on diesel, and that plays to capitalism’s strengths. Innovation is what capitalism is all about, and there has been staggeringly rapid progress in developing clean alternatives to coal, oil and gas. The cost of producing solar- and wind-powered electricity has collapsed. Great advances are also being made in battery technology, which is vital for the new generation of electricity-powered vehicles. Humans are endlessly creative. In the end, they will crack climate change.
But by the time they do, it could be too late. Capitalism – especially the dominant Anglo-Saxon variant of capitalism – has trouble thinking beyond the here and now. People running big corporations see their job as maximising profits in the short term, even if that means causing irreparable damage to the world’s ecosystem. What’s more, they think they should be free to get on with maximising profits without any interference from politicians, even though the fight against climate change can only be won if governments show leadership, individually and collectively.
The economist Joseph Schumpeter talked about the process known as “creative destruction” – the way in which inefficient producers are put out of business by disruptive new technologies and that, as a result, transformation happens. During wars, the best brains are employed by governments to produce more efficient killing machines.
But normally creative destruction takes time, especially if the old guard can marshall sufficient resistance to change – something the fossil fuel industry has been adept at doing. It is vital that capitalism’s Dr Jekyll emerges victorious over its Mr Hyde. More than that, it needs to be an immediate knockout blow.
In the past, politicians have only tended to focus on climate change when they think there is nothing else to worry about. Tony Blair, for example, commissioned a report from the economist Nick Stern into climate change during the years before the global financial crisis, when growth was strong and wages were rising. Margaret Thatcher only started to talk publicly about protecting the environment when the economy was booming at the end of the 1980s.
When policymakers have other things to worry about, tackling climate change drops down the list of things to do. The Paris agreement in 2015, which committed the international community to restricting global warming to well below two degrees centigrade, shows that the issue is taken more seriously than it was two or three decades ago, but that doesn’t mean that it is a top priority.
When times are tough, politicians are suckers for the argument that there is a trade-off between growth and greening the economy. There isn’t. Companies account for capital depreciation when they draw up their profit and loss accounts. If governments adopted the same principle and accounted for the depletion of natural capital when drawing up their national accounts, growth would be lower. In countries such as China and India – where the cities are dangerously polluted – it would be markedly lower.
The good news is that in Beijing and New Delhi, policymakers have woken up to the idea that green growth is better growth. China is committed to phasing out coal, in part because it is worried about climate change and in part because it sees an opportunity to be a world leader in green technology. India, although slower to act, is also starting to take advantage of collapsing prices for electricity generated by solar and wind, and has set itself demanding renewables targets.
But the bad news is that progress towards decarbonisation is still not fast enough. As things stand, fossil fuels will still account for more than 50% of energy consumption by 2050. CO2 emissions will carry on rising and global warming will continue.
Stern says technological progress has been much faster than he thought possible when his report was published in 2006, and he thinks it is quite something that all the major car-makers now accept that the era of the internal combustion engine is coming to an end.
“But the speed of action is still far too slow,” Stern warns. “Emissions have to be peaking now and turn down very sharply. We have not yet acted on the scale needed, even though the ingredients are there.”
Winning the race against time requires political leadership. It means acknowledging that the Chinese model of managed and directed capitalism might be more appropriate than the Anglo-Saxon model. A massive scaling up of investment in clean technology is needed, because the $300bn spent on decarbonisation worldwide last year merely matched the cost of the losses in the US from climate and weather-related events. It also means scaling up the lending of the World Bank and the regional development banks to help poorer countries build wind and solar capacity. And a global carbon tax set high enough so that fossil fuels remain in the ground must be implemented.
And, more than anything, it means accepting that the world needs to wage war against climate change. Powerful vested interests will say there is plenty of time to act, and they are aided by climate-change deniers who say there is nothing to worry about. These people need to be called out. They are not deniers, they are climate-change appeasers. And they are just as dangerously misguided as fascism’s appeasers in the 1930s.

there is a real risk, however small, that one or more critical parts of the Earth’s climate system will experience abrupt, unpredictable and potentially irreversible changes. Disturbingly, scientists do not know how much warming is required to trigger such changes to the climate system.
BQEND
Today, long before feeling the full effects of a rise in temperature of around 1 degree C above preindustrial temperature, due to lags in the system, we’ve been seeing numerous impacts catching many scientists by surprise with how soon they are occurring. 
In 2014 two independent teams of scientists reported that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is likely irreversibly retreating. 3.3 meters of sea level rise equivalent of ice there is being destabilized by warming oceans and energy is going into the net melting of ice all over the planet. 
The paleoclimate record indicates that increasing global temperature by just 1.5-2 degrees C above preindustrial temperature likely commits the system to an eventual 6-9m of sea level rise, a large fraction of which could arrive within the next 100 years. 1
Corals may not survive this century of warming and acidifying oceans, and droughts and floods linked to global warming—and conflict linked to those droughts—have already caused four countries to face famine.
Because of the decades to millennial long lag between a climate forcing and our feeling the effect, due to the thermal inertia of the ocean and response time of the ice sheets, the effects we are feeling now are largely just the beginning of the result of emissions from the 20th century. And emissions have been increasing steadily for decades.
We are also seeing numerous amplifying feedbacks: loss of albedo (heat reflectivity) from ice melt, permafrost melt, methane release and massive wildfires; the Earth is starting to wrest any possible further human control of the climate away.
We're about out of time on this, if not already, and leaders are not only still acting as if this is not a planetary emergency, but some are acting as if there isn’t a problem at all.

I've worked with plenty of ""left"" and ""right"" wing people and it's amazing how they often find themselves agreeing on work matters. That's because when it comes to work matters, they know what they're talking about.
The group of people who you call ""conservatisms"" and what I call ""opportunist, careerist, populist, corrupt politicians who would literally sell out their sister in a SSM debate if he saw there was a few votes in it and a bit of support from the Murdoch empire"" (ok I can see how ""right wing"" or ""conservative"" is more of a short hand way of describing these people but the problem with that is that it credits them with ideological position when in fact they are coming from a position of moral bankruptcy.).....
Anyway ""these people"" are playing a game. They're not actually interested in policy. A big part of this game is identity politics and making the narrative about ""us"" v ""them"". Because they have the Murdoch press behind them they get to control the narrative. They make it about""us"" and we respond by making it about ""them"". But that is just playing directly into their hands.
We should ignore them. Cut off their oxygen. And most importantly challenge on policy. Not their pretend ideology. Not their pretend clique. Their actual policy. If nothing else at least you'll get them to shut up.

 I have read loads of stuff about climate over the years because I find religious cult behavior fascinating...
I haven't seen anyone who has actually read the science behaving like it is a religious cult - how cultish is it to simply state that there are risks in our current pathway that are sufficiently likely to come about, thus a change in our current CO2 emissions is warranted. That's hardly a sign of someone suffering under an irrational belief system.

I note that you say you don't dispute the science. The IPCC acts as a clearinghouse for climate-related information. Much of the IPCC reports are comprised of peer-reviewed science along with some grey literature, and recommendations. So is it just the recommendations section of the IPCC Summary Reports you don't like? Otherwise, you have to criticise the... you know... science.

Its politically impossible so even if the claims about the science are correct (And I concede they might be ) the ""cure"" can never be made manifest.The only sensible thing to do in this circumstance is to put our effort, focus and money into adaption if and when we have to anything else is like performing a religious ritual , cute but of no consequence.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1534796496000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'i find religious cult behavior fascinating', u'effect': u'i have read loads of stuff about climate over the years'}, {u'cause': u'the very nature of our species', u'effect': u'i have criticized the science of said reports many time in threads like this one but the most relevant part of said reports is the impossibility'}], u'author_id': u'16787174', u'in_reply_to': u'119556955', u'id': u'119578932', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Erik Frederiksen', u'text': u'Comparing Mann to Lindzen shows just how disingenuous you are.', u'recommendation_count': u'8', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1534795892000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'15131989', u'in_reply_to': u'119578637', u'id': u'119578696', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'TTauriStellarbody', u'text': u'BQSTART

BQSTART
Any person or organization that promotes their ideology over scientifically-verified evidence is a partisan in favor of the antiscience position in the War on Science. If a position or theory is pro-science (a.k.a. ""science""), as opposed to antiscience, it will follow the scientific method, be potentially refutable, peer-reviewable, reproducible, and open to change if the position comes in conflict with observed fact. An antiscience position will violate one or more of these thresholds, in addition to likely being incoherent. In other words — ""is it science?""

""Increasingly, the science suggests that many of the impacts are occurring earlier and with greater amplitude than was predicted,"" Mann said, after considering new research since the milestone of the IPCC's Fifth Assessment, which served as the scientific basis for the Paris Agreement.

The national energy guarantee (Neg) is the latest manifestation of that denial. A third-rate complex, over-engineered policy that will most likely fail to contribute to meeting all three of its main objectives, namely increased reliability of electricity supply, lower energy prices and a long way third, reducing carbon emissions. A compromise upon compromise designed to placate the scientifically and economically illiterate Coalition right wing, which ignores the first priority of any government, to ensure the security of the people. For climate change is now the greatest threat to that security.
The party room’s rapidly disintegrating “agreement” to the Neg yet again sees the Coalition refusing to face up to this reality as we reach yet another low point in Australian government policymaking.
According to conservative Coalition voices, the Neg can only bring reliability to electricity supply by ensuring “dispatchable” power (shorthand for increased coal generation) is readily available to meet extreme demand conditions. Yet “dispatchable” is readily available today from numerous renewable energy and storage combinations.
Claims the Neg can only deliver lower energy prices by massive investment in new high-efficiency low-emission (HELE) coal-fired power stations ignore the evidence that these stations are now more expensive than renewable energy/storage options by a margin that will increase substantially in coming years.
Supposedly the Neg will enable Australia to meet our wholly inadequate, voluntary 26-28% carbon emission reductions under the 2015 Paris agreement, but the bulk of this reduction will occur before the Neg is even implemented. Even so, conservatives demand that any reductions be “backloaded” to the end of the commitment period, or that we should, aping Trump, withdraw entirely from Paris. 
Either we act with unprecedented speed or we face a bleak future
The federal government’s denial of climate risk is evident in its failure to even talk about that risk. As a result, climate and energy policy is a shambles, endlessly trying to reconcile the irreconcilable: expanding our fossil fuel-based economy, particularly coal, while pretending to address climate issues.
Excruciating contortions by conservatives to rationalise this nonsense have only highlighted the danger to Australia’s security and people of allowing scientific illiteracy to dominate decisionmaking on critical issues, particularly when the risks are the destruction of human society as we know it.
For climate change is now an existential risk to humanity. That is, a risk posing large negative consequences which will be irreversible, resulting inter alia in major reductions in global and national populations, mass species extinction, economic disruption and social chaos, unless carbon emissions are reduced far more rapidly than proposed under the Paris agreement. The risk is immediate, in that it is being locked in today by the insistence of Australian conservatives and their global kin to expand the use of fossil fuels when the carbon budget to stay below sensible temperature limits is already exhausted.
It is no longer possible to follow a gradual transition path to restore a safe climate. We have left it too late; emergency action, akin to a war footing, will eventually be accepted as inevitable. The longer that takes, the greater the damage inflicted upon humanity.
Those still sceptical of this reality only have to look at the extreme climate conditions in the northern hemisphere now, in the Arctic, Europe, Asia and North America. Such conditions of record heat and devastating bushfires, with severe impacts on crop yields, may well be replicated in Australia this summer.
Our latest report, What Lies Beneath, released on Monday, demonstrates that special precautions going well beyond conventional risk management practice are required if the increased likelihood of very large climate impacts – known as “fat tails” – are to be adequately dealt with. The potential consequences of these lower-probability, but higher-impact events would be devastating for human societies.
The bulk of climate research underplays these risks, exhibiting a preference for conservative projections and scholarly reticence, although increasing numbers of scientists have spoken out in recent years on the dangers of such an approach.
Climate policymaking and the public narrative are based around the important work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). However, IPCC reports also tend towards reticence and caution, downplaying the more extreme and damaging outcomes.
While this has been understandable historically, given the pressure exerted upon the IPCC by political and vested interests, it is now becoming dangerously misleading with the acceleration of climate impacts globally. What were lower probability, higher-impact events are now becoming more likely.
This is a particular concern with potential climatic tipping points – passing critical thresholds which result in step changes in the climate system – such as melting polar ice sheets (and hence increasing sea levels), permafrost and other carbon stores, where the impacts of global warming are nonlinear and difficult to model with current scientific knowledge.
The extreme risks which these tipping points represent justify strong precautionary risk management. Under-reporting on these issues is irresponsible, contributing to the failure of imagination that is occurring today in our understanding of, and response to, climate change.
A reframing of scientific research within an existential risk-management framework is urgently required, both in the work of the IPCC and in UN climate negotiations. Current processes will not deliver either the speed or the scale of change required.
In the foreword to What Lies Beneath, Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, one of the world’s leading climate scientists, says that the issue now “is the very survival of our civilisation, where conventional means of analysis may become useless” and that “climate change is now reaching the endgame, where very soon humanity must choose between taking unprecedented action, or accepting that it has been left too late and bear the consequences”.
Either we act with unprecedented speed or we face a bleak future. Australian politicians need to accept climate reality, set aside blinkered ideologies and start working for the people, not destroying their future.
Like an iceberg, there is great danger in “what lies beneath”.

The Swedish government this week announced five major investigations aimed at preparing the country for the kind of extreme heatwave it experienced in July, when temperatures exceeded 30C (86F) and forest fires raged inside the Arctic circle.
But it has yet to come up with any concrete measures for the country’s 4,600 Sami reindeer owners – the only people authorised to herd reindeer in Sweden – and their 250,000 semi-domesticated animals, raised for their meat, pelts and antlers.
The owners are asking for emergency funding to help pay for supplementary fodder as a replacement for winter grazing lands that could take up to 30 years to recover from the summer’s drought and fires.
“We are living with the effects of climate change,” Niila Inga, chair of the Swedish Sami Association, told the SVT news agency. “The alarm bells are ringing. We face droughts, heatwaves, fires. This is about the survival of the reindeer, and of Sami culture, which depends on them.”
The owners are warning that without help some of their herds may not survive the year. They are also concerned that some young reindeer calves may have become so weakened by the prolonged drought they would not be able to follow their mothers to new feeding grounds.
They also want a longer-term government aid programme to help them manage and adapt to the effects of climate change.
Since Sami owners do not own the land their reindeer graze on, Inga told the Local, they need laws allowing them to improve grazing land. Funding is also urgently needed to look into the growing difficulties reindeer have finding the lichen that form a key part of their diet.
Although warmer summers help lichen grow, warmer and wetter winters are increasingly leading to rainfall rather than snow during the coldest Arctic months. When temperatures fall back to below freezing, impenetrable sheets of ice form on ground that would normally be covered by a much softer crust of snow.
This leaves the reindeer, who habitually feed by digging into the snow and then grazing on the lichen beneath, unable to smell the vital food source or dig down to get to it, leading to some herds starving to death.
Scientists have held out hope of finding ways to spread lichen more readily in forests where it would be more easily accessible to the animals, but more funding was urgently needed, Inga said.
Summer temperatures in Sweden usually hover around 23C. The country had to ask for help from Italy, Germany, Norway, Denmark, Poland and France to fight this year’s blazes. Climate change is being felt disproportionately hard in the Arctic, with temperatures climbing at double the rate of the global average.
A spokeswoman said the government was supportive of the herders’ call for emergency winter aid but was waiting to receive the Sami administration’s full report on the consequences of the summer heatwave, expected in the next few weeks.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/22/sweden-reindeer-herders-risk-starvation-climate-change-arctic

This summer has seen a sharp spike in West Nile virus infections in Europe, following soaring temperatures, compared with the past four years. Until the middle of August, 400 cases of the disease, which is carried by mosquitos, were recorded in Europe, with 22 fatalities, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Countries affected include Italy, Greece, Hungary, Serbia and Romania, all of which have recorded cases of the tropical infection in the past.
The spike was due to an early start to the transmission season, caused by high temperatures followed by wet weather, conditions ideally suited to mosquito breeding, according to the World Health Organization’s regional office for Europe.
“We are all a bit taken aback about how fast these change are coming down the pipeline,” said Prof Jan Semenza, who leads on scientific assessment for the ECDC. “We are seeing more and more of these extreme weather events.” 
Semenza, who studies how climate change and other global environmental changes, such as the rise in international travel, affect public health, said higher temperatures make it easier for disease-carrying vectors, such as mosquitos, to transmit disease.
“Mosquitos and ticks are cold-blooded and are affected by higher temperatures. At higher temperatures, mosquitos replicate faster. Pathogens in the mosquito also replicate faster. Everything is speeded up and you get higher turnover, bigger populations of mosquitoes and a growing epidemic potential for viruses.”
This year, which has seen extreme weather and wildfires create havoc in Europe and beyond, has also seen increased numbers of tick-borne encephalitis in central and southern Europe. Last year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found rising temperatures, a rise in international travel and more people living near wildlife were linked to a rise in illness from mosquitos, ticks and flea bites in the US, including West Nile and dengue. 
Researchers predict the risk for transmission of dengue fever, Chikungunya and the Zika virus, could also rise in Europe as a result of climate change. All three, normally carried by Aedes aegypti mosquito, can also be transmitted by a different species,such as as the Tiger mosquito, increasingly found in European countries, including Italy and Spain and other Mediterranean nations. 
The increasing prevalence of the Tiger mosquito allows for the possibility of local infection from unknown pathogens brought into Europe by travellers.
Semenza said he was concerned about the spike of West Nile fever and its implications for local transmission of other vector-borne diseases. “We have never seen so many cases of West Nile fever so early in the season. This is a dramatic increase.”
If someone returns from abroad to Europe with a virus in their blood, the Aedes mosquito can bite them and pass it on
“What it means in public health terms is we need to become more concerned about blood safety. If someone returns from abroad to Europe and has a virus in their blood, the Aedes mosquito can bite them, take up the pathogen and then bite someone else.”
“We can test the blood supply for West Nile fever but we cannot test the blood supply for a pathogen we don’t know of. If the blood supply is contaminated with a pathogen, it can’t be used and the blood supply system could be paralysed.”
Southern France and Italy experienced an outbreak of Chikungunya in 2017. Semanza said there was concern about the rapid spread of the disease at the time, as it had happened in Rome, but the outbreak was contained.
He and his team have developed models to predict the highest risk of imported diseases like dengue and to avoid “catastrophic” events or outbreaks where they are unprepared. They found the risk is worst in August, September and October, when many people travel, and that 50% of passengers from areas where dengue is prevalent travel through Rome and Milan airports. 
Dr Diarmid Campbell-Lendrum, the WHO’s lead on climate change, said: “We wouldn’t say a particular outbreak is attributable to climate change. But we would say that climate change is making it easier to transmit these kinds of diseases.”
Asked if we may see diseases in Northern Europe that we have never seen before, Campbell Lendrum said: “It is perfectly possible, yes. That’s not to say we won’t be able to control it. But the conditions are becoming easier for transmission.”
Rachel Lowe, an assistant professor in infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who has studied the effect of climate change on disease transmission in mosquitos, has found unexpected effects.
“Mosquitos thrive in humid conditions and rainfall can increase breeding sites. But something we found is that drought conditions can also increase breeding, because of the ways people store water. We have this complicated, non-linear relationship.”

But the mountaineers who climb among the snowy peaks know that it is far from business as usual – due to a warming climate, the familiar landscape is rapidly changing.
“Global climate change has serious and directly observable consequences in high mountains,” says Vincent Neirinck from Mountain Wilderness, a campaign group that works to preserve mountain environments around the world.
One of the consequences of climate change is the ongoing retreat of glaciers.
“In the Alps, the glacier surfaces have shrunk by half between 1900 and 2012 with a strong acceleration of the melting processes since the 1980s,” says Jacques Mourey, a climber and scientist who is researching the impact of climate change on the mountains above Chamonix.
The most dramatic demonstration of glacial retreat is shown by the Mer de Glace, the biggest glacier in France and one of Chamonix’s biggest tourist hotspots which would now be unrecognisable to the Edwardian tourists who first flocked there.
“The Mer de Glace is now melting at the rate of around 40 metres a year and has lost 80m in depth over the last 20 years alone,” says glaciologist Luc Moreau.
A stark consequence of the melting Mer de Glace is that 100m of ladders have now been bolted onto the newly exposed vertical rock walls for mountaineers to climb down onto the glacier.
Another key impact of climate change in the mountains is that it is leading to an increase in the number of rockfalls; more than 550 occurred in the Mont Blanc massif alone between 2007 and 2015.
The reason, explains Mourey, is that the permafrost that lies within cracks of rocks and cements them together is now melting.
“As the permafrost melts, whole sections of rock become destabilised and more prone to collapse.”
This is what caused the destruction of the iconic Bonatti pillar, a massive column of rock and popular climbing spot that collapsed in the scorching hot summer of 2005. Significantly, climate change is happening almost twice as fast in high mountains as compared to the rest of the planet.
“Whilst there are many theories as to why this is happening, we don’t fully understand what’s going on,” says Mourey. What is not disputed, though, is that many climbing routes have been drastically altered by climate change.
“A 1970s climbing and mountaineering guidebook to the 100 best routes around Mont Blanc isn’t useable any more as most of the routes have changed and can’t be used,” he says.
The trails to the high mountain huts around Mont Blanc which are used by climbers are becoming more dangerous too, forcing the authorities to adapt and take action.
In 2012 the trail to the Conscrits hut was judged to have become too dangerous following increasing numbers of rockfalls, so a 60m Himalayan-style suspension bridge was built to make access to the hut safer.
A completely new trail, including the installation of fixed ladders, has recently had to be built to the Charpoua hut following the melting of glaciers which made the previous trail too difficult and dangerous.
Given Chamonix’s status as the cradle of modern mountaineering and alpine pursuits, the authorities are now making a determined effort to adapt to these changing conditions to ensure that climbing can continue.
“We want to support the idea that alpinism and its values are not dead and we must keep on climbing safely,” says Claude Jacot, a Chamonix councillor and head of mountain safety for the region.
But for some, the area is already becoming too dangerous.
“This year we’ve deliberately reduced our programmes on Mont Blanc due to the increased rockfall caused by higher temperatures over the last few years,” says Ed Chard from trekking operator Jagged Globe.
So what will happen to climbing around Chamonix in the coming years? Mourey is optimistic that the sport still has a future in the Alps, but future mountaineers will have to adapt.

Turnbull made the remarks at his final press conference after standing down as Liberal leader on Friday, claiming the mantle of having led a “progressive, liberal Coalition government” and issuing a warning to reactionary conservatives against using “race and division” for political gain.
Last week Turnbull gutted his signature national energy guarantee by suspending plans to legislate the emissions reduction component in an effort to satisfy conservative critics in the Liberal party and stave off an insurgency against his leadership.
Turnbull told reporters on Friday that he had always tried “to keep the party together”. “And that has meant that, from time to time, I have had to compromise and make concessions.”
Turnbull said he had learned that lesson from his first stint as leader. As opposition leader Turnbull’s support for Labor’s carbon pollution reduction scheme in 2009 divided the Liberal party, leading to a conservative push that installed Tony Abbott to kill the bipartisanship on climate change.
“In terms of energy policy and climate policy, I think the truth is that the Coalition finds it very hard to get agreement on anything to do with emissions,” Turnbull said. “I mean, the national energy guarantee was, or is, a vitally piece of economic reform. It remains the government’s policy, of course.
“The emissions issue and climate policy issues have the same problem within the Coalition of ... bitterly entrenched views that are actually sort of more ideological views than views based, as I say, in engineering and economics.”
Turnbull likened the climate change issue to same-sex marriage, in that they were both seen as an “insoluble problem” for the Coalition that his government had been “able to sort out”.
Turnbull kept Abbott’s commitment to hold a national vote on marriage equality, which led to a 61.6% vote in favour and a cross-party bill passing parliament in December 2017.
“That was a significant achievement in my time as prime minister,” he said. “As for what the future holds in terms of energy policy, again you’ll have to talk to Scott [Morrison] about that.”
Turnbull thanked the energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, who was elected deputy Liberal leader, noting he had been “a very loyal and capable minister”. 
Touching on another issue that has exposed the liberal-conservative divide, Turnbull repeated his mantra that Australia is “the most successful multicultural society in the world” and claimed to have “always defended that and advanced that as one of our greatest assets”. 
In a speech earlier in August the outgoing race discrimination commissioner, Tim Soutphommasane, accused Coalition government ministers of politicising race. 
He cited the former home affairs minister Peter Dutton’s calls for “special attention” for white South African farmers, former citizenship minister Alan Tudge’s claim that Australia is veering towards a “European separatist multicultural model” and Dutton’s suggestion Melburnians are afraid to go out to dinner due to African youth crime. 
Turnbull himself has defended these interventions, arguing it is true that there is “real concern about Sudanese gangs” in Melbourne.
But on Friday he warned “we must never allow the politics of race or division or of setting Australians against each other to become part of our political culture”.

In Dubbo on the NSW Western Plains, farmer Glen Bloink could not contain his excitement at the first downpour in months.
He stripped off – save for the obligatory Akubra – to gambol across his sodden paddocks as the rain continued to fall around him.
His partner, Min Coleman, shared his streak on Facebook with the caption: “Someone’s a bit excited.”
Coleman told the ABC they were “doing it pretty tough” on their 1000-acre property, with no crops this year to use for their cattle and sheep. But the rain had buoyed spirits and revitalised the land. 
“We can already see the little shoots of weed … coming through, which is just really encouraging.”
Significant falls were recorded across parts of NSW and Queensland over the weekend – in some parts more rain fell in two days than had in months previous – but not everywhere that needed rain received it.
Across south-east Queensland, drought-hit areas east of Charleville had as much as 50mm of rain by midday Sunday.
“Most of the rain is mainly east of about Roma, over the Darling Downs and further east,” the Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Lachlan Stoney said on Sunday.
“Areas west of Roma are quite clear at the moment and they won’t see any further rain. But they have seen that same pattern of generally 5-20mm.
“We have seen some isolated falls, in the order of 50mm.”
Northern NSW recorded significant falls over Friday and Saturday, with Coffs Harbour recording 56mm. There were showers on the central and northern NSW tablelands, and in the north-west, Bourke received 17mm.
Hail fell in several places, including Toronto on Lake Macquarie, south of Newcastle.
Strong wind warnings were issued for Sunday for the Byron and Batemans Bay coastal regions, and gale-force winds were expected across Sydney, the Illawarra and the Hunter on Monday.
The new prime minister, Scott Morrison, who has declared drought relief as a key priority of his government, was set to visit Queensland on Monday with the government’s newly appointed drought tzar, Major General Stephen Day.
“Everybody wants to try and help and do the right thing,” Morrison said. “But the frustration often in government is getting it coordinated and getting it where it needs to get.
“That’s what we’re going to do, there’ll be no shortage of effort and no shortage of resource.”
Currently, 100% of NSW is impacted by the drought. Twenty-one per cent of the state is suffering intense drought; 57.4% of Queensland is drought-declared. Conditions are most severe in the south-west.
The government has committed $1.8bn to a “drought resilience” package, mostly in the form of low-interest loans to farmers, local councils and businesses. Those loans will ultimately be required to be repaid and so do not impact the budget long-term.
While Morrison has committed to making drought relief a key priority, he came to the prime ministership in a bruising civil war within the Liberal party over energy and climate policy, especially over emissions reductions targets.
His predecessor Malcolm Turnbull’s commitment to reducing carbon emissions – and their climate consequences – was fiercely resisted by the conservative right wing of his party, and ultimately forced him into capitulating on the policy.
“Climate change is likely making drought conditions in south-west and south-east Australia worse,” the Climate Council said in a report on the impacts of climate change on Australia’s current drought.
Changing climate has shifted Australia’s weather systems southward, reducing autumn and early winter rainfall.
“Climate change is also driving an increase in the intensity and frequency of hot days and heatwaves in Australia, exacerbating drought conditions,” the report said.
“The combined effect of increasing temperatures and declining rainfall across southern Australia mean that there is high confidence that time spent in drought will increase over the course of the century in southern Australia in the future if greenhouse gas emissions are not cut deeply and rapidly.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/26/rain-brings-relief-in-nsw-and-queensland-but-drought-far-from-over

Climate change (It’s the end of the Earth as we know it, Comment) appears to momentous, and not withstanding the depressing (and logical) thoughts that it’s too late, too complex, too difficult and so forth, I still reckon it’s a good strategy to act as if changes in human behaviour, individual and collective, on any scale – massive and radical would be good options – might make a difference. A growing body of scientific researchers, journalists, activists, politicians, ethical lifestylers and eco-warriors keeps going “despite”.
My personal perspective is that there’s not a lot of positive gain in saying it’s a pointless endeavour. The physicist Niels Bohr said something along the lines that predicition is difficult, especially when it’s about the future. If we give up in despair now, we may not be in a position to “enjoy our grandchildren”. I would guess that multiple catastrophes are inevitable; it’s a question of what kind of catastrophes are we facing, can we mitigate/prevent any of them, and what would we like to make happen instead? Perhaps over the next few centuries, Anthropocene doesn’t have to have its current negative connotation if we commit to improving our meaning-making, attitudes and choices about stewardship of “our” planet.Online Contribution (Somerset Jen)
We have all moved on from Richard Dawkins’s fundamentalism, aeons ago (“Intelligent design? How come He made so many blunders?” Comment).
Dawkins’ theistic God died with Friedrich Nietzsche. God is no longer a noun. Uncertainty (which includes pain, suffering and death, along with all other so-called “imperfections”) is now seen as part of the game, just as language contains redundancy in order to get the message across. In science, it is called quantum physics; you just don’t know what is going to happen from second to second, just like life! Perfectionism (and all that sin stuff) went out with traditional Christianity. Both in quantum physics and in the new Christianity, relationship is all the rage.
Things only exist because of their relationship to each other; life only exists because of relationships between living creatures. Grenville GilbertOttery St Mary, Devon
Robin McKie deployed a well-worn argument against intelligent design: creation is flawed, therefore there can be no Creator. I would have thought the implicational relationship between such statements is hardly necessary and sufficient. Evangelical atheists need to learn from evangelical Leavers: unintelligent confusion does not work.The Rev David BlackTilston, Cheshire
I applaud Evgeny Morozov for his, once again, insightful analysis of the challenge of regaining control of our data from the technology behemoths (“There is a leftwing way to challenge big tech over our data. Here it is”, Comment).
The combination of citizen control of data and appropriately regulated access by democratically accountable entities, where the use of data can make a real difference, be that by a council or city, is compelling. However, one challenge will be data portability. Is data retained or does it move with the individual? If it is retained, then data can continue to be exploited for the benefit of remaining citizens, but that comes with the gradual erosion of an individual’s ability to control their data and understand how it is used. This conflict is not insurmountable, but must be overcome if the likes of Google, Facebook and Amazon aren’t supplanted by the likes of London, Birmingham and Manchester.Neil MacehiterGreat Shelford, Cambridge
I think you are a little hard on the bridge designer Riccardo Morandi when comparing the disaster in Genoa with that of another of his bridges, at Lake Maracaibo in Venezuela in the 1960s (“Amid the hunt for culprits, Genoa’s tragedy points to a malaise at Italy’s heart”, Comment). The bridges are remarkably similar, but the circumstances totally different. It would be an amazing design that could withstand an oil tanker at speed, as happened at Maracaibo.Alan SugarmanWest Chiltington, West Sussex
I don’t understand in what way William Miller thinks he supports state education while sending his children to fee-paying schools (“ I’d worked so hard to get away from the scrutiny of my father…”, Observer magazine). Perhaps he tells himself he is easing overcrowding or raising the bar. Wealthier parents buying better-resourced education for their children is so unfair as to be antisocial.

Anne McElvoy, as a senior editor of the Economist, would, one assume, be clear headed and objective. Yet she finds difficulty checking the rush of blood to the head when trying to scan the world beyond the comfortable status quo (“US Democrats are struggling to make sense of a socialist surge”, Comment). Several emotional semantic slips destroy her attempts at objectivity. Instead of an increase in membership of the Labour party, she gives us “an insurgent grab”. Instead of a “manifesto”, she prefers to call it “siren songs” and the content is just “stuff” that she propagandises as “free”, though they’re fully costed. She also falsely assumes that Marxism failed, whereas Karl Marx never laid out a blueprint for government. E JonesEastington, Gloucestershire
I agree with Sean O’Hagan that Aretha Franklin’s pain and heartbreak were transmuted into song (“Aretha: heartbreak and hope, struggle and inspiration”, Focus).
Her legacy will be a uniquely beautiful and expressive voice that moved everyone who heard it to tears and turned every song she sang, most of which were not written by her, into soul. And unlike Madonna, Aretha Franklin did not need gimmicks or continuously to reinvent herself. She made me feel like a natural human.

Brexiteers on prejudice
It’s interesting that, according to the Opinium poll reported in last week’s Observer (Labour suspends ex-MP over antisemitism row, News), the percentage of the total number of voters believing the Labour party is prejudiced against British Jews is almost identical to the percentage of the total number of voters who wanted to leave the EU. Something the Labour leadership might reflect on the next time it considers repeating Jeremy Corbyn’s “the British people have spoken... we must respect that result” line.David ClarkeBristol

The devices are being blamed for causing a drought during months when farmers near the German carmaker’s plant in Puebla expected plenty of rain.
While some may be convinced of the hail cannon’s power, scientific research has cast doubt on these observations. But effective or not, the technology represents humanity’s latest attempt to control the weather – rain dancing 2.0 – and has raised concerns about the lack of regulation and the assumption that there is a quick fix for complex meteorological phenomena.
Both hail cannons and hail rockets emit loud noises in the sky, and manufacturers claim this disrupts the formation of hail so that it falls instead as rain or slush.
In 2005, Nissan installed 20ft hail cannons at its plant in Mississippi after a hailstorm, much to its neighbours’ annoyance. When activated, the system fired off gunshot sounds into the sky every six seconds. “It was like having a boombox in my driveway,” said one neighbour at the time.
Farmers have also used hail cannons to try to prevent their crops from being crushed.
However, a review by the Dutch meteorologist Jon Wieringa concluded that these technologies were “a waste of money and effort” – a sentiment echoed by the World Meteorological Organization.
“The only beneficial effect of firing explosive rockets and grenades at hail clouds may be the emotional satisfaction of the gunners, who have fired at the enemy,” he wrote.
Cloud seeding has been shown to be more effective at controlling precipitation. It involves shooting chemicals into clouds – often from a small aircraft – to cause rainfall or snow.
It’s done in more than 50 countries worldwide for various reasons including dispersing fog at airports, reducing property damage from giant hailstones in Canada and to increase snowfall in Colorado and summer rainfall in Texas.
We control the symptoms instead of modifying what is producing the effect
“You have to be very careful about what types of clouds and what you are trying to do,” said William Cotton, a professor of atmospheric science at Colorado State University.
Seeding wintertime mountain clouds can, he said, increase precipitation by 6-8%. “That’s enough for a lot of water users to be happy and willing to pay for it,” Cotton said.
The evidence to support summertime cloud seeding seems to be much more shaky, with the National Research Council concluding in 2003 that “there is still no convincing scientific proof of the efficacy of intentional weather modification efforts”.
Critics are concerned that manipulating the weather is only treating the symptoms of drought rather than tackling the underlying causes.
“Even if it’s local, it’s worrying that in the face of climate change these kinds of alternatives come up,” said Silvia Ribeiro, the Latin America director of ETC Group, which examines the socio-economic and ecological impact of new technologies. “We control the symptoms instead of modifying what is producing the effect.”
That hasn’t stopped states and businesses from continuing to seed clouds, in some cases on a dizzying scale. The Chinese government is developing the world’s most ambitious cloud seeding project to boost rainfall across the Tibetan plateau, an area spanning 620,000 sq miles – three times the size of Spain.
The state-owned China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation has designed and constructed chambers that use military rocket engine technology that burn fuel to produce the cloud-seeding agent silver iodide. When the chambers are installed on mountain ridges, the particles travel up into the clouds and trigger rainfall in one of the driest places on Earth.
Because of the large area covered, some are concerned that the Tibet project teeters from weather modification into geoengineering territory.
“Weather modification tends to be quite local. You do it, it happens. You stop and it’s gone. Geoengineering, or modification of the climate, means you do something in a way that it stays like that,” explained Janos Pasztor, the executive director of the Carnegie Climate Geoengineering Governance Initiative, which seeks to create effective governance for climate engineering technologies.
“If [weather modification in Tibet] were done long enough, it will have an impact on the climate, not just the weather,” he said.
The main geoengineering approaches include removing carbon from the atmosphere and changing the clouds in the stratosphere so they reflect the sun’s rays back into space.
The latter approach – solar engineering – involves flying aeroplanes into the stratosphere to spread particles such as sulphur, whichthen form tiny particles called aerosols that can reflect light away from Earth. It’s designed to simulate the cooling effects of a volcanic eruption, but “without all the ash and the big bang” said Pasztor.
So far, there have only been a handful of small experiments, but much more research needs to be done if it’s to be deployed as an Earth-cooling technique.
Meddling with the climate in this way is highly controversial and raises all sorts of ethical and logistical questions.
“This would be the most global endeavour humankind has undertaken. Who is going to make the decision to do it? Trump? The head of Exxon? The UN general assembly?” asked Pasztor, who is urging governments to develop policies to prevent a rogue country of billionaires taking matters into their own hands.
“We have one atmosphere so we must get it right,” said Pasztor.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/26/rain-dancing-20-should-humans-be-using-tech-to-control-the-weather

Here's what I do know: that both democarats and republicans have done good and bad things in the course of US history. Many of the good things, irrespective of their political origin, are consistent with the broad definition of 'liberalism', where such views are as much a moral philosophy as a political creed. Wikipedia gives as good a definition as any:
BQSTART
Liberalism is a political and moral philosophy based on liberty and equality. Liberals espouse a wide array of views depending on their understanding of these principles, but they generally support civil rights, democracy, secularism, gender and race equality, internationalism and the freedoms of speech, the press, religion and markets.
BQEND
Perhaps I misunderstand your political outlook. Are you opposed to civil rights, democracy, gender and race equality, free speech for the public, press, religion and markets? Or are these 'liberal' values common to those of both the right and the left who are not polarised extremists, overwhelmed by fear, malignant intolerance and rank bigotry? People who don't see egalitarianism, kindness, care for the less capable and support for the disadvantaged, as some kind of weakness? 
Meanwhile, I will just reiterate the point you tried so hard to avoid; under the 'left-wing' stewardship of California's political class, the state has enjoyed tremendous economic success, giving the lie to the fatuous claims you made about 'liberalism' and 'the left'.
The failure of the American political landscape is the gross polarisation that makes enemies out of those with a different outlook. The only problem with socialism is that that people like you blame the creed for our terrible attempts to enact it, as if the idea was to blame for our failure, our corruption and our ignorance.

Show the development plans/aspirations of the companies involved in extraction of shale gas that include CCS.
BQENDThey don't.
But even without it, fracced gas is far lower carbon than importing LNG from Qatar, Algeria, USA and Russia - much of which is fracced gas at source.
Ref: [Overall, imported LNG is 21.05kgCO₂ (e)/GJ whereas domestic natural extracted gas is 7.71 kgCO₂(e)/GJ]https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/553488/2016_methodology_paper_Final_V01-00.pdf
on a purely pragmatic front, if the UK banned LNG imports and produced enough of our own to displace it, then that would save ... 7,203,599,987kg a year and rising as LNG import rise. Imagine if the whole of the EU banned LNG imports, set to rise 2% a year, each year.And as one should always show the working out.150,000GWh of LNG (imported) is 539,999,999GJ
so replace 150,000GWh of domestic fracced gas (and separately as much biogas as possible for the rest) we would saveFracced Total 4163399992kgLNG Total 11366999979kgSaving 7,203,599,987kg
That's without CCS.
So yes, given it will take decades to wean ourselves off gas, then we should take the lowest carbon option on the way - or admit as a country that we put local Nimbyism above the needs of the planet ... and what's that if not Climate Change denial?

BQEND
Here is a link for you magaman, from the British Geological Society, that answers your question succinctly:
BQSTART
""Before the current warming trend began, temperatures in the Holocene (the last 11,000 years) were declining. This was due largely to insolation – the solar radiation received by the Earth’s surface – and dictated by the Earth’s orbit and the tilt of the Earth’s axis. Insolation declined throughout the Holocene. This cooling took Earth’s climate into a Neoglacial period, culminating in the ‘Little Ice Age’ (1450 – 1850).  Astronomical calculations indicate that this period of low insolation and associated cool conditions should continue for about another 1,000 years. Nevertheless, after 1900 the overall decline in temperature sharply reversed.... 
....Given the above, based on a growing abundance of palaeoclimate data, there is now greater confidence than in 2010 that the only plausible explanation for the rate and extent of temperature increase since 1900 is the exponential rise in CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution. This rate of increase of CO2 is unprecedented, even in comparison with the massive injection of carbon into the atmosphere 55 million years ago that led to the major PETM warming event, and is likely to lead to a similar rise in both temperature and sea level.""
BQEND
Orbital changes are exerting a small cooling forcing on the Earth today, but they haven been completely overwhelmed by increased CO2 today. Additionally, these orbital forcings require ocean outgassing of CO2 to turn glacials into interglacials.

""Anthropogenic climate change accounted for ∼55% of observed increases in fuel aridity from 1979 to 2015 across western US forests, highlighting both anthropogenic climate change and natural climate variability as important contributors to increased wildfire potential in recent decades.

As a result Germany's capacity market which relies on exports started to suffer and Germany was shunting some of it's intermittency issues onto neighboring countries grids.This Germany has had to open new coal power plants to alleviate the issue.

Of course Greens in Germany were more closely associated with the anti nuclear campaigns of both military and civil which had been up to that point linked.Pro nuclear will state that Gen 2 reactors don't produce weapons grade material- and to a degree this is true- although the UK Magnox AGR reactors spent fuel required reprocessing because the material was unsuitable for long term storage and they specifically wanted plutonium. But in the US, Russia and France the fuel enrichment could either be diverted to power production or continued - as it was for weapons production. And India went with the heavy water method of weapons production.
Germany's experience of being a nuclear industrial power is different to that of other countries- the fast breeder reactor was a failure and was never switched on given Chernobyl coincided with completion, research had hit a wall [in France] and the cost of $4 billion had no chance of seeing a return. Of the 17 reactors- the 10 early ones were at the end of their lives- and 7 built in the 80s could have run to 2030- but with Fukushima are being closed early, but importantly they are still running- till early 2020s.Another factor is the the German nuclear industry is Siemens - with the ongoing and extremely costly delays with the EPR in Finland and France the Fukushima incident seemed a timely moment for seimens to get out of the nuclear business. [it's redirection in wind and offshore wind is extraordinary- a friend who works for them comes back from trips seeing new developments impressed- and they are secret so he has to express his view with enthusiasm!].
The fact that nuclear has not shut down means it is not contributing to Germany's poor CO2 reduction- and as the Germanwatch report points out it is industry that is dragging its heels.
When it comes to politics I know from German friends from the 80s and now that they lived on geo political fault line where nuclear conflict was real- now the conflict is the more rightwing nationalism of the east- which brings with it the same populism that denies AGW.
If Germany had decided to continue with nuclear it would be in a similar boat to France- struggling to build just one replacement reactor and the UK burdaned with decommissioning cost and starting to build just 2 reactors.', u'recommendation_count': u'7', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1535541334000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'the material was unsuitable for long term storage and they specifically wanted plutonium', u'effect': u'although the uk magnox agr reactors spent fuel required reprocessing'}], u'author_id': u'4738374', u'in_reply_to': u'119885365', u'id': u'119886907', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'ComfortablyPlumb', u'text': u'BQSTART

BQSTART
In April Russia started building Turkey’s first nuclear plant, worth $20bn. Its first reactor is due for completion in 2023. Rosatom says it has 33 new plants on its order book, worth some $130bn. A dozen are under construction, including in Bangladesh, India and Hungary.
BQEND And Russia is directly sponsoring these builds with state backed loans and insurance, as well as contracts to fuel and run them for the duration. The power wielded was too much for S.Africa who cancelled a deal struck by Zuma and Putin.
Russia has continued to back fast breeder reactor program and actually producing a commercial reactor the BN 800 with the first coming on line in 2016 and plans to export a plant to China. It is not the full fuel cycle but significantly will burn mixed oxide fuel reducing plutonium stockpiles.
However Russia's primary wealth and exports are gas and oil-the sector accounted for 16% of GDP, 52% of federal budget revenues and over 70% of total exports. [and that was before the price crash]. Russia has indirectly interfered in the politics of fracking in Eastern Europe, and it has been suggested tried to fund [and no doubt troll] anti fracking activists elsewhere.It should also be added that funding and interference in foreign countries has included pro and anti operations as the recent US exposure concerning vaccination in the US has revealed.

This indicator measures the “radiative forcing” or heating effect caused by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
...and also from the EPA :
Greenhouse gases from human activities are the most significant driver of observed climate change since the mid-20th century.

But because the Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that carbon dioxide is an air pollutant and the Obama EPA correctly concluded that it poses a threat to public welfare via climate change, the EPA is legally obligated to do something to address that threat. That meant they needed a replacement plan.
Last week, the Trump EPA unveiled that plan and inaccurately named it the ‘Affordable Clean Energy Rule.’ The rule basically just extends the life of some dirty coal power plants and encourages them to run a bit more efficiently. The rule’s costs in worsening public health far exceed its monetary benefits. It would more accurately be named the ‘Expensive Dirty Power Plan.’
But there’s a silver lining – coal plants are already shutting down so quickly because they can’t compete with cheaper, cleaner alternatives that it turns out we don’t even need the Clean Power Plan to meet Obama’s targets.
Many news stories about the Dirty Power Plan exaggerated its climate impact due to confusion about various points of comparison. For example, the Clean Power Plan aimed to reduce carbon pollution from US electricity generation 32% below 2005 levels by 2030. The Dirty Power Plan will encourage coal plants to operate more efficiently, which the EPA estimates will reduce emissions about 1% more than simply repealing the Clean Power Plan.
That sounds like a big difference between the two plans, and it confused a lot of reporters. The key point is that US electricity generation was already becoming cleaner years before the Clean Power Plan was even conceived. Coal plants have been shutting down so rapidly that power sector carbon pollution is already 25% below 2005 levels. That happened without the Clean Power Plan ever going into effect – we basically didn’t need it, because coal was replaced anyway just for being too expensive.
One of the remarkable things about the new EPA assessment released for Trump's power plan, isn't even related to the new plan.The EPA has radically reduced the estimated impact of Obama's Clean Power Plan. 1/
The EPA’s new analysis found that under the Clean Power Plan, carbon pollution from US electricity generation would have fallen 29% below 2005 levels by 2030, and under the Dirty Power Plan, it would fall 26% below 2005 levels by 2030.
Both appear to be extremely conservative estimates – remember, US power sector carbon pollution already fell 25% below 2005 levels by 2016 – but the point is that the climate difference between the plans is relatively small.
Basically, the Obama Clean Power Plan tried to accelerate the transition away from coal power, but it’s already happening so fast that it couldn’t go much faster. The Trump Dirty Power Plan tried to save the coal industry, but the coal death spiral has so much momentum that they could only tap the brakes and slow it down a bit. The EPA estimates that US coal production will be just 8% higher in 2030 under the Dirty Power Plan than it would have been under the Clean Power Plan.
While that slight increase in coal production won’t have a big climate impact, it’s bad news for anyone living near a coal power plant – mainly poor people and minorities, in places like West Virginia. Specifically, the EPA analysis estimates that the Dirty Power Plan will cause:
900 more premature deaths per year
40,000 more annual cases of asthma
42,000 lost work days
60,000 more school absence days
230,000 more restricted-activity days for kids
The EPA analysis concludes that the costs of these adverse health effects will far exceed the minimal costs of compliance with the Clean Power Plan. Specifically, the Dirty Power Plan represents a $2.7bn to $6.1bn annual loss for the US economy. Over a 15-year period, it adds up to an approximately $50bn loss due to the adverse effects of the increased coal pollution from the Dirty Power Plan. As Joe Romm put it:
In short, Obama’s CPP is a no brainer — small cost, huge benefits. And remember, this is according to figures buried in calculations released alongside the announced plan to repeal the CPP.
Yet, Trump has asserted for years that the CPP was a costly mistake, and that’s why the U.S. had to become the only major country in the world to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.
The Dirty Power Plan is just the latest component of the Trump administration’s anti-climate, anti-environment agenda. They’re also trying to freeze vehicle fuel efficiency standards, which had already been stagnant for decades prior to the Obama administration.
According to an analysis by the Rhodium Group, that would have roughly double the impact on carbon emissions as the Dirty Power Plan, and the increase in other pollutants would likewise cause more premature deaths and other adverse health effects among Americans. And unlike the US power sector, carbon pollution from the transportation sector is not falling.
Both rules will be challenged in court and are likely to be struck down, but at a time when we need to be doing everything possible to cut carbon pollution, when we’re being battered by wildfires and heatwaves and other extreme weather, these are incredibly irresponsible plans. Trump frequently claims to want crystal clean air and water, but he seems not to care if poor people near coal power plants are forced to breathe polluted air.
The silver lining is that Trump can’t save the dying dirty coal industry, and his EPA’s pollution plans will be reversed by the next administration in 2021. But it’s important to remember that a vote for Trump and the Republican Party is a vote for dirty air that makes Americans sick and as a result costs the economy billions of dollars.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/aug/27/trumps-dirty-power-plan-is-much-worse-for-kids-health-than-for-climate-change

The non-binding opinion written by Ukip MEP, John Stuart Agnew, has shocked EU lawmakers for its dismissal of climate science – and the support he received to write it from mainstream rightwing and liberal political blocs.
Green MEP Molly Scott Cato said their choice of Agnew, a Norfolk farmer, as parliamentary rapporteur by the agriculture committee, was a “truly scandalous” fiasco that illustrated a growing populist threat. A rapporteur is elected to shepherd EU proposals through the European parliament and, after negotiations with the European commission and EU states, into law.
The Agnew report calls for a €5.45bn green fund called Life to be used to prepare “for an impending Maunder Minimum” – or a period of low sunspot activity.
It deletes the European commission’s proposals for funds to be spent on clean energy infrastructure, references to climate mitigation and obligations under the Paris agreement.
Agnew claimed that his ideas represented scientific “fact”. He said: “I’m doing this to ensure that somewhere in the files and annals of the European parliament there was somebody who said: ‘The king isn’t wearing an invisible suit! The king is naked!’”
Rather than human activity, the Agnew report attributes climate change to cosmic ray fluctuations and gravitational pulls from elsewhere in the galaxy, sunspot activity, ocean currents and greenhouse gas water vapour, in the form of cloud cover.
“The other greenhouse gases, CO2, methane and nitrous oxide have a negligible effect on our climate,” Agnew’s paper claims. “The only potential risk of a major CO2 event in Europe is an erupting volcano.”
Dave Reay, professor of carbon management at Edinburgh University told the Guardian, after looking at the paper: “It is fitting that this laughable document misuses palaeoclimate information in its case against human-induced climate change – the hackneyed, pseudo-scientific arguments here would make the dinosaurs blush.”
Agnew’s paper has no legal weight and will almost certainly be dismissed by the environment committee when the issue is debated on 30 August.
In part, it reflects a turf war between the agriculture and environment panels over responsibility for separate proposals on greening obligations under the next CAP.
But with fears of an influx of far-right MEPs in parliamentary elections next year growing, Agnew’s success has also set alarm bells ringing. Scott Cato told the Guardian it was “shocking” to think that someone with his climate views could influence funding disbursements.
“It’s truly scandalous that a proud climate denier has got control of such an important file,” she said. “This fiasco shows the damage that can be done by electing populists who really have no understanding of their brief and are not competent to undertake the highly influential and detailed work that is required of elected politicians.”
Agnew has long campaigned against what he terms “the global warming scam”. He has also drawn attention for claiming thousands of pounds in CAP payments for his Norfolk farm every month, according to his members’ declaration.
He told the Guardian that “I threw my hat in the ring to do this [report] fully expecting to be thrown out of court,” but that he then received wide support, “to my genuine astonishment”.
A spokesman for the European People’s Party said their backing for Agnew was due to bidding procedures and not an endorsement of his climate politics.
Agnew was also supported by the European Conservatives and Reformists bloc of mostly Conservative MEPs and far-right Europe of Nations and Freedom faction.
The Socialists opposed Agnew and the Greens stood against him, but they were hampered by the abstention of the far left GUE group and support for Agnew from the ALDE bloc of Liberals. Two ALDE MEP’s contacted by the Guardian declined to comment.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/29/ukip-mep-sparks-outrage-with-report-denying-human-role-in-climate-change

Of course you need the thermometers to calculate the change but you don’t need a thermometer every 100 metres.

Well you can read this a couple of way. One is faculty as in university faculty which professor Lindzen is a professor emeritus at MIT, the complete opposite of a rejection by that faculty.

All the more reason in fact to encourage their science while criticising their bombast in op-eds etc. Spencer and Christie maintain the UAH dataset and if that’s inconsistent with the others well, that forces us to ask why?

BQSTART
the 2017 global temperature remains stubbornly high, well above the trend line (Fig. 1), despite cooler than average temperature in the tropical Pacific Niño 3.4 region (Fig. 5), which usually provides an indication of the tropical Pacific effect on global temperature7. 
Conceivably this continued temperature excursion above the trend line is not a statistical fluke, but rather is associated with climate forcings and/or feedbacks. The growth rate of greenhouse gas climate forcing has accelerated in the past decade.3 There is also concern that polar climate feedbacks may accelerate.8
Therefore, temperature change during even the next few years is of interest, to determine whether a significant excursion above the trend line is underway.

And the warming is causing changes that might surprise us. Not only is the warming causing long-term trends in heat, sea level rise, ice loss, etc.; it’s also making our weather more variable. It’s making otherwise natural cycles of weather more powerful.
Perhaps the most important natural fluctuation in the Earth’s climate is the El Niño process. El Niño refers to a short-term period of warm ocean surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific, basically stretching from South America towards Australia. When an El Niño happens, that region is warmer than usual. If the counterpart La Niña occurs, the region is colder than usual. Often times, neither an El Niño or La Niña is present and the waters are a normal temperature. This would be called a “neutral” state.
The ocean waters switch back and forth between El Niño and La Niña every few years. Not regularly, like a pendulum, but there is a pattern of oscillation. And regardless of which part of the cycle we are in (El Niño or La Niña), there are consequences for weather around the world. For instance, during an El Niño, we typically see cooler and wetter weather in the southern United States while it is hotter and drier in South America and Australia.
It’s really important to be able to predict El Niño/La Niña cycles in advance. It’s also important to be able to understand how these cycles will change in a warming planet. Fortunately, a study just published in Geophysical Research Letters helps answer that question. The authors include Dr. John Fasullo from the National Center for Atmospheric Research and his colleagues.
El Niño cycles have been known for a long time. Their influence around the world has also been known for almost 100 years. It was in the 1920s that the impact of El Niño on places as far away as the Indian Ocean were identified. Having observed the effects of El Niño for a century, scientists had the perspective to understand something might be changing. 
For example, in 2009–2010, intense drought and heat waves gripped the Amazon region – far greater than expected based on the moderate El Niño at the time. In addition, from 2010 to 2011, severe drought and heat waves hit the southern USA, coinciding with a La Niña event. Other extreme weather in the US, Australia, Central and Southern America, and Asia stronger than would be expected from El Niño’s historical behavior have raised concerns that our El Niño weather may be becoming “supercharged.”
To see if something new was happening, the authors of this paper looked at the relationship between regional climate and the El Niño/La Niña status in climate model simulations of the past and future. They found an intensification of El Niño/La Niña impacts in a warmer climate, especially for land regions in North America and Australia. Changes between El Niño/La Niña in other areas, like South America, were less clear. The intensification of weather was more prevalent over land regions. 
So, what does this mean? It means if you live in an area that is affected by an El Niño or La Niña, the effect is likely becoming magnified by climate change. For instance, consider California. There, El Niño brings cool temperatures with rains; La Niña brings heat and dry weather. Future El Niños will make flooding more likely while future La Niñas will bring more drought and intensified wildfire seasons.
Unsurprisingly, we’re already seeing these effects, with record wildfires in California fueled by hot and dry weather. We are now emerging from a weak La Niña, so we would expect only a modest increase in heat and dryness in California. But the supercharging of the La Niña connection is likely making things worse. We would have California wildfires without human-caused global warming, but they wouldn’t be this bad.
Dr. Fasullo nicely summarized the findings of the paper:
We can’t say from this study whether more or fewer El Niños will form in the future — or whether the El Niños that do form will be stronger or weaker in terms of ocean temperatures in the Pacific. But we can say that an El Niño of a given magnitude that forms in the future is likely to have more influence over our weather than if the same El Niño formed 50 years ago.
And this conclusion can be extended to many other situations around the planet. Human pollution is making our Earth’s natural weather switch more strongly from one extreme to another. It’s a weather whiplash that will continue to get worse as we add pollution to the atmosphere.
Fortunately, every other country on the planet (with the exception of the US leadership) understands that climate change is an important issue and those countries are taking action. It isn’t too late to change our trajectory toward a better future for all of us. But the time is running out. The Earth is giving us a little nudge by showing us, via today’s intense weather, what tomorrow will be like if we don’t take action quickly.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/aug/29/global-warming-is-intensifying-el-nino-weather

Coming despite severe warnings over lost jobs and investment from no-deal Brexit, his technology company is spending about £200m to expand the testing facility on a former second world war airfield at Hullavington, near Malmesbury in the west of England.
The investment comes a year after Dyson announced plans to create an electric vehicle to propel his high-tech household goods company to become a rival to Tesla, the carmaker started by the US billionaire Elon Musk.
The British engineering company is developing a car that is due to be ready for road testing in 2020, with the first deliveries coming a year later.
Dyson’s expansion plans for the research and development site, which is already home to about 400 workers, include planning applications for more than 10 miles of vehicle-testing tracks with high speed sections, hills and off-road routes to put its new electric cars through their paces.
Although only recruiting about 300 more automotive workers at present, planning details show the 45,000-square-metre site will ultimately have space for more than 2,000 people. In addition to the testing track, there will be a cafe, sports centre, recreation space and supporting technical facilities.
Dyson has yet to make a decision on whether it will mass-produce its electric vehicles in Britain once testing is complete. Although it designs and develops products in the UK, supporting high-value jobs, it manufactures them in cheaper locations such as Singapore and elsewhere in the far east.
The company employs more than 12,000 people around the world with about 4,800 in the UK, centred around Malmesbury.
Alongside its vacuum cleaners, hand dryers and car development, the company is working on battery technologies, high-speed electric motors, vision systems, machine learning and artificial intelligence.
Despite difficult trading conditions facing many firms after the Brexit vote amid heightened political uncertainty, Dyson has not changed his view that leaving the EU would be best for the country.
Before the referendum he was among the most prominent business supporters of Britain leaving the EU despite fiercely vocal support for remain from many other senior figures in business and industry.
“Brexit can supercharge British technology and refocus minds on global trade if only we grab the opportunity with both hands – the government must embrace it and support British businesses,” he told the Guardian.
Several major industrial companies and carmakers, including Airbus, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have warned a hard Brexit would trigger a reassessment of jobs and investments in Britain. Economic growth has slowed since the referendum, while households are more than £900 worse off, according to the governor of the Bank of England.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/30/dyson-expand-hullavington-wiltshire-facility-boost-electric-car-tests

Realising the need to reconcile planetary limits with the power of directing investment, for 30 years she was at the forefront of a movement that has encouraged fund managers to invest money in a more socially and environmentally responsible fashion.
Tessa co-founded the UK’s first green investment fund, the Merlin (now Jupiter) Ecology Fund, in 1988. She was later head of responsible investment at NPI (now part of Janus Henderson Investors), where she managed massive amounts of institutional money on socially and environmentally responsible lines – for instance by refusing to take shares in high-polluting companies or those involved in child labour.
In 1991 she co-founded the UK Social Investment Forum, which lobbied for the wider adoption of responsible investment in Britain. She was also involved in setting up what is now the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative, an alliance of more than 200 financial institutions that seeks to improve understanding of how banks, insurance companies and other major investors can take account of environmental, social and governance factors when deciding where to put their money.
In addition Tessa co-founded, in 2000, the Carbon Disclosure Project, a successful programme that has encouraged major companies to make annual disclosures of the greenhouse gas emissions they generate, and which works with them to cut those emissions. Now known as CDP, the project has grown dramatically since its inception, and works with more than 6,000 companies across the globe, including most of the biggest corporations.
 Tessa was born in Bletchingley, Surrey, to John Cormack, a pilot, and Jean Davies, the daughter of a Liberal peer. After leaving Prior’s Field school, in Godalming, she gained an environmental studies degree at King’s College London.
Working after her degree at the environmental thinktank Green Alliance, she spotted the power that was latent in fund management, and noted that few investors at the time were routinely weighing up the environmental impacts of their decisions. Fewer still considered that excellent long-term returns could be had by investing in business that respects the natural world. 
After an internship in the US with the green asset management firm Trillium and its inspiring leader Joan Bavaria, she co-founded Merlin (now Jupiter) Fund Management in London and was its head of social investments. There she helped to build up an investment team that featured many people who fanned out into new responsible investment operations across the world over the next quarter of a century. At NPI she built and led a team that grew sustainable assets under management faster than any other group in the UK, winning large institutional mandates.
Seeing the implications of billions of far eastern consumers joining the global economy, in 2000 she relocated to Hong Kong. There she set up the Association for Sustainable and Responsible Investment in Asia, which is now part of Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), an international network of investors pledged to incorporate social and environmental issues into their investment analysis and decision-making processes.
After helping to create the Carbon Disclosure Project, she became its first executive chair and then a board member until 2014 – encouraging, sometimes embarrassing, corporations into measuring and reporting their emissions. Through defining and disclosing their climate impacts, companies saw the need to bring them down – reducing demand for fossil fuels and driving finance into low-carbon technologies.
Over the last 20 years of her life Tessa developed an impressive portfolio of directorships. These included non-executive directorships at the Green Investment Bank and Solarcentury, a solar electricity company. She was possessed of an exceptional combination of energy, social confidence and free-spirited charm that brought her many admirers – her advice was sought by politicians including Tony Blair.
In 1983 she had married Henry Tennant, whose father became Lord Glenconner. Tessa and Henry had a son, Euan, shortly before Henry recognised that he was gay. They separated but remained close; in 1990 Henry died from complications of Aids. Tessa took over his forebears’ mansion in the Scottish borders, the grade A-listed Glen House, with accompanying farmland, cottages, steadings and offices. 
In 2006 she met Bill Staempfli, a New York architect who was in Oxford on sabbatical studying environmental policy, and they married in 2007. Responsibility for managing the Glen estate without the financial means to run it was a legacy that Tessa occasionally thought she could do without, but in partnership with Bill she brought the farm back in hand by managing it organically, planting new native woods, tackling a backlog of repairs and hiring it out for film and fashion shoots.
In 2012 Tessa discovered she had ovarian cancer – recording her treatment with wry commentary on a blog. In 2017 she found it had returned – though she spared her friends the knowledge. She declined further treatment, spending her last months at Glen with Bill, Euan, and her two grandchildren, who all survive her. 
One of her last acts was to be driven by Bill in their all-electric car to the Palace of Holyroodhouse, to collect the insignia of her OBE from the Queen.

… we can’t turn away from climate change. For The Guardian, reporting on the environment is a  priority.  We give climate, nature and pollution stories the prominence they deserve, stories which often go unreported by others in the mainstream media. At this critical time for our species and our planet, we are determined to inform readers about threats, consequences and solutions based on scientific facts, not political prejudice or business interests. But we need your support to grow our coverage, to travel to the remote frontlines of change and to cover vital conferences that affect us all.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as $1 – and it only takes a minute. Thank you.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/02/tessa-tennant-obituary

“I think there’s a lot of bad science behind what people are calling global warming,” he said on another occasion. 
In recent days, the outskirts of Redding have been ravaged by the Carr wildfire, and scientists have directly connected the blaze, which has claimed six lives and dozens of properties, to climate change. Yet LaMalfa sounds unswayed. 
“I’m not going to quibble here today about whether it’s man, or sunspot activity, or magma causing ice shelves to melt,” he told the Guardian on Tuesday, citing discredited alternative explanations for rising temperatures. 
Can climate-driven natural disasters shift attitudes about climate change? In Redding, the weeks to come may provide a somber test case. 
As of Tuesday evening, the Carr fire was 27% contained, and it was one of sixteen wildfires burning in California.
Like LaMalfa, the citizens of Redding are far more skeptical about climate change than the average American is. In 2016, a team from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication found that only 35% of Redding residents believed that global warming would harm them personally, five percentage points lower than the national average, and 12 points less than the average Californian. 
“Experience is an important part of determining one’s belief on climate change, but not necessarily the determining one,” said Christopher Borick, director of the National Surveys on Energy and Environment, which has carried out long-term studies on attitudes to climate change and other environmental issues. 
But he said partisan affiliation was still a more powerful influence on beliefs about climate. “If you gave me one factor to explain someone’s belief, I’d ask you what party they belong to,” he said. “Among Republicans, about half think there’s evidence of climate change, but only a third think it’s anthropogenic in its roots.”
Redding is the county seat of Shasta county, which is only about 200 miles north of San Francisco but has opposite political values. 
“The county went 65% for Trump,” noted David Ledger, who belongs to the Shasta Environmental Alliance, a coalition of environmental groups in the area. “The media here runs a lot of very conservative talkshows. The newspapers tend to have very conservative editorials. Almost all of them are skeptical of anthropogenic climate change.” 
Still, Ledger held out modest hopes that the events this week would shift some attitudes. “The fire will not cause a huge shift, but it may change some attitudes in the area.”
Near Redding’s Sundial Bridge, a popular gathering place for locals, a longtime resident, Ray Cutchen, dismissed any contribution of climate change to the fire. 
“I think it’s bull,” he said. “It’s just fire season. It’s hot. There’s more people living out further and further in the woods.”
His wife, Barbara Cutchen, sounded a more cautious note.
“I think it could be due to climate change,” she said. “All over the country it’s changing.” 
Ray responded with recollections of his own childhood in a nearby town.
“I can remember as a kid in Red Bluff, it’d be over 100 for three weeks at a time. People are babying themselves right into the grave,” he said. 
“It was an unfortunate event,” he added of the Carr fire. “But everything was just right for it to happen.” 
Like other Republicans the Guardian spoke with, LaMalfa, who is profoundly concerned for his constituents affected by the disaster, linked it less to anthropogenic conditions in the atmosphere than to forest-management policies by federal and state authorities, and specifically to efforts to limit logging. These, he claimed, had led to “fuel loads that have been left in the forest for 30 to 40 years”. 
“Climates always change, so the question is what do we do about the conditions” that now exist, he said.
Experts agree that forests are abnormally dense, a factor they link to the suppression of wildfires, which might otherwise have thinned out the trees. But they say it is unequivocal that climate change is leading to a longer fire season and drier vegetation.
A Republican state senator representing Redding, Ted Gaines, also batted back questions about climate change. 
“It was the environmental community that resisted for decades our ability to get into forests and manage them,” he said. “I think the environmental community has come around and realized we have created a tinderbox.” 
As smoke lingered in the air in central Redding, a passerby named Voyd Fleming approached the bridge and said he didn’t need science to tell him about climate change.
It’s “obvious”, he said. “Look at the trees around you right now. The leaves are falling out of the trees when they shouldn’t be. The environment is changing, and it’s changing everywhere.”
But that doesn’t mean he thinks he, or anyone else, can do anything about it.
“The good Lord has to fix it. We’re not capable of it.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/31/california-wildfire-climate-change-carr-fire

Climate change cast a long shadow in 2017, with the planet experiencing soaring temperatures, retreating sea ice, a record high sea level, shrinking glaciers and the most destructive coral bleaching event on record.
Overall, 2017 was third warmest year on record, Noaa said, behind 2016 and 2015. Countries including Spain, Bulgaria, Mexico and Argentina all broke their annual high temperature records. 
Puerto Madryn in Argentina reached 43.4C (110.12F), the warmest temperature ever recorded so far south in the world, while Turbat in Pakistan baked in 53.5C (128.3F), the global record temperature for May.
Concentrations of planet-warming carbon dioxide continued on an upward march, reaching 405 parts per million in the atmosphere. This is 2.2ppm greater than 2016 and is the highest level discernible in modern records, as well as ice cores that show CO2 levels back as far as 800,000 years. The growth rate of CO2 has quadrupled since the early 1960s.
The consequences of this heat, which follows a string of warm years, was felt around the world in 2017.
In May of last year, ice extent in the Arctic reached its lowest maximum level in the 37-year satellite record, covering 8% less area than the long-term average. The Arctic experienced the sort of warmth that scientists say hasn’t been been present in the region for the last 2,000 years, with some regions 3 or 4 degrees Celsius hotter than an average recorded since 1982. Antarctic sea ice was also below average throughout 2017.
Land-based ice mirrored these reversals, with the world’s glaciers losing mass for the 38th consecutive year on record. According to the report, the total ice loss since 1980 is the equivalent to slicing 22 metres off the top of the average glacier. 
Prolonged warmth in the seas helped spur a huge coral bleaching event, which is when coral reefs become stressed by high temperatures and expel their symbiotic algae. This causes them to whiten and, in some cases, die off.
A three-year stretch to May 2017 was the “longest, most widespread and almost certainty most destructive” coral bleaching event on record, the report states, taking a notable toll on places such as the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. Global average sea levels reached the highest level in the 25-year satellite record, 7.2cm (3in) above the 1993 average.
“I find it quite stunning, really, how these record temperatures have affected ocean ecosystems,” said Gregory Johnson, an oceanographer at Noaa.
There were several major rainfall events in 2017 contributing to a wetter than normal year, with the Indian monsoon season claiming around 800 lives and devastating floods occurring in Venezuela and Nigeria. Global fire activity was at the lowest level since 2003, however. 
While exceptionally warm years could occur without human influence, the rapidly advancing field of climate change attribution science has made it clear the broad sweep of changes taking place on Earth would be virtually impossible without greenhouse gas emissions from human activity. 
The loss of glaciers and coral reefs threaten the food and water supplies of hundreds of millions of people, while heatwaves, flooding, wildfires and increasingly powerful storms are also a severe risk to human life. 
These dangers have been highlighted in stunning fashion this year, with a scorching global heatwave causing multiple deaths from Canada to Japan, while wildfires have caused further fatalties in places such as Greece and the western US.

2. Skippers, too, are out in force. They seem to particularly delight in the lantanas which are a staple of landscaping here.
3. Tiger swallowtails seem less common than I recall. The garden is situated in an area known as the 'Inland Empire', in what was once the region's citrus belt but is now rapidly urbanising. The larvae's nickname, 'orange dogs', clues one that its future here may be in doubt.
4. Monarchs are more rare than they were only a decade ago, but many gardeners -- my friend included -- now plant milkweed to aid the species' local recovery.

The important point is that we will have started a process that is out of humanity's control. Ice sheets would continue to disintegrate for centuries. There would be no stable shoreline. The economic consequences are almost unthinkable. Hundreds of New Orleans-like devastations around the world. 
What may be more reprehensible, if climate denial continues, is extermination of species. The monarch butterfly could be one of the 20 to 50 percent of all species that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates will be ticketed for extinction by the end of the century if we stay on business-as-usual fossil fuel use.

The idea was that junior birdwatchers would count the birds in their gardens, to find out which were the 10 most common species. After Ms Baxter featured it on the programme, 34,000 children joined in, and the Great Garden Birdwatch has run every year since.
Volunteers and amateurs without scientific training have long had a crucial role to play in nature conservation. Over the last decade, such efforts have increasingly been grouped under the heading of citizen science. Provided you are somewhere in the UK, this is a good time to join in, because the Big Butterfly Count – the younger cousin of the birdwatch – is on and running until 12 August.
Butterflies, like nearly all wildlife, are having a rough time. Since the heatwave summer of 1976, we have lost around half of our abundant butterflies – the generalist species found in gardens, parks and countryside all over the UK – and three quarters of our habitat specialists – those butterflies that rely on rarer plants and settings for their food. As with wild birds, intensive farming is the main cause, with recent evidence suggesting that the introduction of neonicotinoid pesticides in the 1990s may also have been a factor.
It’s not all bad news: broadly speaking, British butterflies are thought to be among climate change’s winners, because the UK is in the northern range of most of the 59 species that live here, meaning rising temperatures can enable them to move into new territory. This summer the marbled white, purple emperor and black hairstreak are doing well, while the warm spring provided a boost for the most endangered of all British butterflies: the high brown fritillary. But the drought conditions are perilous for caterpillars, since many of the plants and grasses they feed on have dried out, and this year’s warm and sunny boom could well be followed by a 2019 bust.
Big fluctuations in populations are normal for butterflies, so conservationists focus on longer-term trends. But the count – run by the charity Butterfly Conservation, which is 50 this year and also focuses on moths – produces valuable information about how butterflies are doing in green spaces such as urban gardens that conservationists are usually unable to access. 
The delicacy and glorious colour of butterflies, and their metamorphosis from creepy-crawly to gorgeous, fluttering flight, has won them far more affection and prominence in human minds than other insects. Because of the long tradition of collecting and observing them, British butterflies are the most studied group of insects in the world. Though ants, bees and others have their champions, this realm of the animal kingdom is often overlooked by humans, and sometimes disliked. Butterflies are ideal ambassadors for the insect world.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/02/the-guardian-view-on-butterflies-elegant-ambassadors-for-insects

A scorching 46C was forecast for Setúbal, near Lisbon, on Saturday, as emergency services in Portugal issued a red alert until Sunday and urged people to avoid picnics and outdoor activities.
The Met Office said temperatures had risen to 45.5C in Alvega in central Portugal on Saturday afternoon and were still rising.
On Friday, 16 weather stations in Portugal registered record temperatures with Alcácer do Sal, near Setúbal, climbing to 45.9C.
The hot, dry conditions have led to several wildfires in Portugal. Nearly 700 firefighters are battling the biggest outbreak, near Monchique in the Algarve region.
Portugal’s highest recorded temperature was 47.4C, in 2003.
In Spain, a high of 45C was forecast for Córdoba and heat warnings have been issued for 41 of the country’s 50 provinces.
High temperatures contributed to the deaths of two men in Spain on Friday – one in Barcelona and the other in the Murcia region, authorities said.
Spain’s record high temperature of 47.3C was set in Cordoba in July 2017.
The Met Office did not, however, expect the record European temperature of 48C, set in Athens in 1977, would be broken this weekend.
UK temperatures are expected to peak at 31C (88F) on England’s south coast this weekend, the Met Office predicted.
Gosport in Hampshire was the hottest place in the UK by mid-afternoon, reaching 29.8C.
Areas along the Hampshire and Dorset coast are most likely to feel the heat on Saturday, while the hottest areas on Sunday are expected to be around London and stretching north to the Midlands.
Cloudy conditions are expected in Scotland and Northern Ireland, with some patchy rain to the north and west of Scotland.
The north-west/south-east split will continue early next week, with further showers expected across Scotland and Northern Ireland, while England and Wales stay generally dry and warmer.
Temperatures as high as 32C (90F) are possible around London on Monday and Tuesday.

Temperatures will need to climb significantly if they are to come close to England’s current August record of 38.5C (101.3F) recorded in Faversham, Kent, in 2003.
The intense heat is likely to lessen come Wednesday, as conditions turn “fresher and more changeable”, the Met Office said.
The mercury is being driven higher by a hot air mass moving north from Africa, bringing dust from the Sahara.
In the Netherlands, authorities closed some motorway sections after the heat melted the road surface.
In France, four nuclear reactors have been closed to avoid raising the temperature of rivers whose water is used to cool reactors and then returned.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/04/temperatures-in-southern-europe-top-45-heatwave-spain-portugal

The onset of this year’s hurricane season has seen leaders in the region tell the Guardian that Donald Trump needs to grasp the existential threat they face. Rising temperatures and increased precipitation caused by climate change is strengthening hurricanes, researchers have found, even as the overall number of storms remains steady.
“In 2017 we saw some of the most devastating and destructive hurricanes we’ve seen in our history,” said Selwin Hart, Barbados’ ambassador to the US. “This needs to be recognized.
“This isn’t some scientific debate, it’s a reality with loss of life implications. We need the US to be back at the table and engage. It’s imperative. We wouldn’t have a Paris climate agreement without the US and we need them back now.”
Hurricane Irma strengthened to a category five hurricane before slamming into the Caribbean and US in September, causing more than 130 deaths in places such as Barbuda, Saint Martin, Barbados and the US. This storm was swiftly followed by Hurricane Maria, which obliterated much of Dominica and caused a widespread, ongoing disaster in Puerto Rico, leaving thousands dead.
“Even before the passage of hurricanes Irma and Maria, we could already see the effects of coastal erosion, and even the loss of some islands,” said Ricardo Rosselló, governor of Puerto Rico. The US territory is part of an alliance with several states, including New York and California, that have committed to addressing climate change absent the federal government. “Puerto Rico remains in a more vulnerable situation than other states. It is expected that some of the initial effects of climate change will be seen in Puerto Rico,” said Rosselló, who called Trump’s climate policies “a mistake”.
During the 2015 Paris climate talks, Caribbean nations were among the loose coalition of low-lying countries that successfully pushed the international community to aim to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5C (2.7F) beyond pre-industrial levels.
This aspiration, which would provide many island states the hope of remaining viable in the face of sea level rise, drought and powerful storms, is currently far from likely, with a recent UN report warning the picture would be “even bleaker” if the Trump administration follows through with its vow to remove the US from the Paris deal.
The withdrawal from Paris would take three years, but in the meantime the Trump administration is working to dismantle the clean power plan, an Obama-era strategy to cut carbon dioxide, delay new vehicle emissions standards, open up new land and ocean to oil and gas drilling and even put in place a set of subsidies that would prop up the ailing coal industry.
“The US is a major player in the world and it needs to lead, we depend on it to be a moral voice on issues where people are vulnerable,” said Darren Henfield, foreign minister of the Bahamas. “We really hope the US readjusts its position. It seems there will be doubters until we start completely losing islands.”
Henfield said Bahamians have become “dramatically aware” of climate change following a series of hurricanes that have hit or brushed the archipelago in recent years. The country has attempted to accelerate its transition to renewable energy although it faces the conundrum of relying economically upon tourists, borne on huge cruise ships that emit large amounts of carbon dioxide.
“We are being forced to put up sea walls to push back the rising tides,” Henfield said. “We are very exposed and we could see the swallowing of the Bahamas by sea level rise. We don’t have much room for people, there’s nowhere for people to move. Climate change will exacerbate the issue of refugees.
“I don’t know what influences the mind of president Trump but the world will be negatively impacted by not dealing with climate change. We always talk to our neighbors in the north and part of our foreign policy is to sensitize them and the international community to the threat we face.”
But while Caribbean states plead for climate assistance, particularly from the US, they are also looking at how to adapt to a new environment. The Organization of Eastern Caribbean States, a coalition of island countries that spread in an arc south of the British Virgin Islands, has turned its attention to looming challenges such as food security, coastal village relocation and new building designs in order to deal with rising temperatures and seas.
“Dominica was a real wake up call for us, it virtually got washed away” said Didacus Jules, director general of the OECS. “We know the impacts are going to be increasingly catastrophic and we need to plan for that. We need to do things completely differently in order to protect life and limb.”
Didacus said he was alarmed by the US reversal on climate change. “We are very disturbed by what is going on, it’s a matter we’ll deal with aggressively in terms of diplomacy,” he said. “We will work with other island nations to make ourselves heard.”
However, many in the Caribbean fear the window of time to avert the worst is rapidly closing. Roosevelt Skerrit, prime minister of Dominica, addressed the UN last September in strikingly bleak terms, describing himself as coming “straight from the front line of the war on climate change”.
“Heat is the fuel that takes ordinary storms – storms we could normally master in our sleep – and supercharges them into a devastating force,” Skerrit said. “Now, thousands of storms form on a breeze in the mid-Atlantic and line up to pound us with maximum force and fury. We as a country and as a region did not start this war against nature. We did not provoke it. The war has come to us.”
Skerrit said the hurricane left Dominica with flattened homes, smashed water pipes, hospitals without power, wrecked schools and ruined crops. “The desolation is beyond imagination,” he said. “The stars have fallen. Eden is broken. We are shouldering the consequences of the actions of others.

ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel took aim at the administration for rolling back various environmental regulations.
“Maybe the most destructive thing these people are up to involves climate change,” he said. “Not only is it hotter than ever, but levels of carbon dioxide hit new all-time highs last year, we have abnormally warm temperatures around the globe, arctic ice is melting at an unprecedented rate.”
“Last month,” he added, “was the hottest month ever recorded in the state of California.”
“But not only won’t Trump address this, he keeps rolling back regulations that were designed to slow it down,” Kimmel explained, referring to the removal of various Obama-era regulations on asbestos and toxic coal ash. “And this is bigly important, so somebody needs to get through to the president before it’s too late.”
“He lives in this world, too, so as a service to the planet we made something that I hope he sees,” the host added, before showing a video tailor-made to “resonate” with the president.
In it, a narrator says that, by 2050, 80% of the world’s coastal golf courses will be submerged in water. “Rising sea levels,” he adds, “will make exclusive waterfront clubs uninhabitable.” The video also jokes about expected fried chicken shortages before finishing: “Young women will be too dehydrated to have sex with wealthy, older, married men.”
“It’s worth a try,” Kimmel concluded.
“I just want to start off tonight by saying happy birthday, Robert Mueller,” began Stephen Colbert. “Blow out the candles and make our wish.
“Mueller celebrated today by hammering former Trump campaign manager and discount cologne ad Paul Manafort,” the host continued, noting that Manafort’s longtime partner Rick Gates took the stand to testify against his former boss. 
“Gates has already pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and on the stand he made his former boss’s guilt perfectly clear,” said Colbert. When asked if he committed crimes with Manafort, Gates simply replied: “Yes.”
“It gets better, because Gates admitted on the stand that he stole hundreds of thousands of dollars from Paul Manafort,” Colbert added. “Manafort was making some big promises to people who lent him money. After Manafort got loans worth $16m, he recommended the banker who allegedly loaned him the money be nominated as President Donald Trump’s army secretary.”
Colbert went on: “Speaking of Mueller’s investigation, the president is still dealing with the fallout from his disastrous Twitter confession that his campaign colluded with the Russians in Trump Tower when he admitted that the meeting was about getting dirt on Hillary Clinton.”
Reading from a CNN report, Colbert added that Trump’s lawyers have suggested he stop tweeting about the Trump Tower meeting. “Little late,” Colbert joked. “That’s like saying: ‘I’ve got to warn President Lincoln! You know what, it can wait till after the play.’”
Meanwhile, Comedy Central’s Trevor Noah also discussed revelations from the Manafort trial.
“Today is day six of the Paul Manafort trial,” he began. “This week, prosecutors brought Rick Gates to the witness stand. Gates has been Paul Manfort’s right-hand man for years and, on top of that, he worked as a deputy campaign manager for Donald Trump.”
Noah added: “He knows where the bodies are buried and yesterday, he dug them up.”
“For Manafort, it must’ve been really wild, because every moment that Gates was on the stand, things just got worse and worse,” the host said, noting that, aside from admitting to committing crimes with Manafort, Gates also confessed to having stolen hundreds of thousands of dollars from his boss.

“He’s confessing to stealing from the same guy he was committing crimes with,” Noah said. “Manafort must’ve been so mad but also, at the same time, so proud.”
Noah went on to explain that, while the Manafort trial isn’t part of the Russia investigation, it did stem from it. And special counsel Robert Mueller is hoping the trial proceedings convince Manafort to flip on Trump.
“Man, Robert Mueller is cold-blooded,” Noah said. “He’s just catching the small fish as a way to get to Trump.”
“Why isn’t Manafort snitching on Trump?” Noah asked, before airing news footage speculating Manafort expects to be pardoned by the president. “Ah, yes, the presidential pardon. Trump hands out pardons like a Klan member handing out candy.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/aug/08/jimmy-kimmel-climate-change-trump-late-night-hosts

But anyone hoping for sightings of great white sharks in British waters are likely to be disappointed, despite a spate of scare stories that began after a researcher at the University of Southampton predicted that 10 shark species new to the UK could reach British waters by 2050. Dr Ken Collins made the prediction as part of a report to promote a TV channel’s shark series.
Earlier this year, scientists published evidence that tiger sharks off the coast of eastern Australia were most abundant in sea temperatures of 22C (72F), with less activity at higher and lower temperatures. Collins looked at other recent studies to compile a list of 10 possible new arrivals, including the great hammerhead, blacktip and bigeye thresher – but not the great white.
According to Richard Peirce, a shark campaigner and author, rising sea temperatures around the UK will not increase the likelihood of great whites arriving. “Most experts agree that the real conundrum with great white sharks is not whether they are likely to start rocking up but why they are not here,” he said. “Our conditions in Britain are already perfect and warming waters are not going to help them.”
Peirce has investigated nearly 100 claimed sightings of great whites in British waters and found fewer than 10 of them to be credible. Marine biologists say there is no scientific evidence of great whites arriving – and no risk of shark attacks. 
Last year saw what some say is the first British shark attack on a surfer when a man was left with a bloodied thumb after encountering a 3ft-long smooth hound shark.
This month, footage of a blue shark swimming in St Ives harbour excited locals in Cornwall and experts, who say this pelagic – deep water – species is more commonly found 10 miles offshore.
“Occasionally you’ll see a blue shark at the surface but they are certainly never patrolling the beaches looking for a tourist to eat,” said Hannah Jones of Marine Discovery, who runs wildlife watching trips from Penzance. “All this talk of sharks along the coast – the only sharks you’re likely to see are basking sharks.”
Though 2018 has been a poor year for sightings of basking sharks in Cornish waters, according to Jones, over the past three years her boat has encountered many more common dolphins as well as bluefin tuna.
“Bluefins were always here. Then they got hammered for fishing before EU controls have really helped bluefin stocks recover,” said Jones. “People think that tuna are little and come in tins. A bluefin can be bigger than a dolphin. If they are feeding en masse, charging through bait fish, they break the surface and you get this writhing mass of fish. It’s utterly spectacular, like nothing you’ve seen – a tsunami of tuna charging towards you.”
She added: “In the 1970s and 80s it was all Jaws fever. Most people are more sensible, and now if they see a shark it’s a massive privilege rather than anything scary. There have always been sharks here and in years gone by there would have been many more.
“We may perhaps start getting more southerly species, such as some species of hammerhead perhaps, but given that Cornwall is such a crossroads in terms of water temperature and salinity, many things would be possible. It doesn’t mean it’s likely.”
According to Dr Phil Doherty, a researcher at the University of Exeter who is investigating what influences the movement and migration of sharks, rising sea temperatures will not automatically lead to new species arriving because it is not yet known what tolerance different shark species have for different water temperatures, or how prey species may be affected by warmer waters. 
He said: “Some studies are showing plankton blooms starting to shift polewards in reaction to temperature changes. We might see other species moving in response to prey movements but it’s not something we can say for certain.”
Doherty also warned that Atlantic fishing – unregulated in the high seas – continued to be a check on shark species reaching British waters. “We still have very high levels of fishing, particularly for sharks in the Atlantic, and we have very little regulation of the catching of sharks,” he said. There are no limits for the number of blue shark and shortfin makos that can be caught by fishing vessels. “The by-catch level is huge for some of these sharks,” said Doherty.
Shark populations have fallen by up to 90% globally with 70 species classified as vulnerable – including the great white shark – or critically endangered.
Peirce said he supported the logic of Collins’ predictions, and new shark species could be a small positive to climate change. “Here are some wonderful new marine species that are going to be inhabiting our waters. It should not be a cause for fear and quaking but a cause for celebration.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/12/warming-seas-10-new-shark-species-british-waters-great-white

Probably because the emergency services will be restricting access to the area due to the speed and intensity with which the fires spread.
They don't have resources and time to babysit a bunch off paparazzi lest they all get injured or killed.

Finally a subject you claim to take seriously, unlike the scientific one that you've been posting sophistical, sarcastic nonsense about for God knows how long.Secondly, my answer was flippant because your question was silly; the words in Matthew are self-exaplanatory to anyone who's not trying to find a way of twisting some self-serving and relativistic 'interpretation' out of them.

Otherwise, the meaning is wholly obvious, which is why Jesus spoke in simple metaphors and stories- He didn't need a theologian to interpret the scripture for the masses.I don't know about your personal religious beliefs, but there is a curious form of 'Christianity' prevalent in the US particularly that bears no relation to the words of Christ, but is essentially an ideological cult with some conservative social derivations from the Old Testament, and a veil of pseudo-Christianity to give it the holy unquestionability of the sacred. It's adolatrous attitude to wealth is manifestly unchristian (justified by its 'creative' attitude to scriptural interpretation), and it's way of fetishising what it likes to call ""family values"" is something absent from either Book of the Bible, neither of which have anything much to say on the matter, being more concerned with polygamy, chattel wives and, in the New Testament, the family is more often than not regarded as a barrier to the fufilillment of a spiritual calling.

Indeed, I asked that question of one of our other resident deniers days ago, of what the trend in arson was.
Unsurprisingly, zero response.
It's just a convenient scapegoat (AKA LOOK ! SQURREL) to deflect the actual problem of persistent drought and high temperatures across the globe that as you say lead to conditions that facilitate longer and more widespread wild fires.
I have no doubt that arson plays a part, I have no doubt that more building in fire prone zones exacerbates the problem. But it doesn't explain wild fires in the Arctic and other areas where they have not be traditionally repellant. Once again, deniers fail to look at global trends.

So leaving aside Job, Abraham likewise was rich in many wives and cattle and gold.
You stated “I think it's hard to deny, honestly, that wealth is NOT said by Christ to be a barrier; not an insuperable one, hence He didn't say that it was simply impossible for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God- but a very great impediment,”
No. And here is where we disagree on the meaning of that verse. First of all, it is impossible (not just difficult but impossible) for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle. And that which is more difficult than “impossible” can’t be said to be merely a great impediment. It’s not an impediment. It’s an impossibility. So if interpreted to mean his wealth as opposed to his love of wealth, then no man who is rich could ever enter heaven. Not even Abraham. Of course we know this is not true, so clearly Jesus wasn’t speaking of the wealth of rich men, but instead the attitude of the wealthy who love their possessions more than God. Those men will find it more difficult (impossible) to enter heaven than the impossibility of threading a camel through the eye of a needle.
Keep in mind the context why Jesus used such strong language. Both in the accounts at Matthew 19:24 and John 10:25 Jesus is approached by a rich man asking how to be saved. When Jesus advises him to follow the commandments he dismisses that saying in effect been there, done that. Sensing that the man loves his possession, Jesus asks him to give them up. At that point the man turns away in sorrow. He obviously didn’t want to part with his possessions. That is when Jesus uttered the camel and needles eye analogy. But here is the point, it wasn’t because this man had accumulated possessions but because his love of those possessions outweighed his desire for eternal salvation.
So I disagree that Jesus is condemning wealth itself. I will grant you that many men of wealth exhibit a love of their wealth.

I sympathize with your distain for people who overly simplify the complex. Or even simplify the simple for that matter. Take your name for instance. The quote from Timothy 6:10 is:
""For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.""
I think all of us here are familiar with the socialist's oversimplification of that quote to render it: ""money is the root of all evil""
Naturally money is morally neutral so the socialist's oversimplification is patently absurd. But also self serving. By changing the quote from ""the love of"" to the object of that love, they feel morally just to fight that evil by the simple expedient of confiscating that ""evil"" from those who possess it.

moneytherootofevil posted a criticism of Trump calling him too simplistic. I responded by pointing out the irony of someone (whose own screen name is an oversimplication of a famous quote) calling someone else oversimplistic. The fact that the famous quote happens to be from the bible is immaterial. It’s the oversimplification of the quote, not the source of the quote, that was my point.
As usual you completely missed that point and thought instead that I was somehow making an off topic religious argument. I wasn’t. I was pointing out that the kettle was calling the pot black. You piped up with a biblical passage of your own as if it were some clever retort. It wasn’t. All you succeeded in doing was showing that you didn’t comprehend my point and as I suspect you didn’t even understand the meaning of the passage YOU brought up.
So I called you on it. Immediately sensing a trap, you knew you didn’t dare explain the quote because that would only confirm my suspicion of your ignorance. Nor could you skulk away without answering me on a topic YOU brought up. So instead you danced around, made a flippant remark, called me names, and claimed that the whole issue that YOU brought up was off topic. Yes. It was off topic. But you constantly post replies that are off topic. You get upset when I don’t respond to them, and now I see you get upset when I do.

The smoke made the air in the state’s Central Valley unhealthy to breathe for a record 15 consecutive days, as I can personally attest.
Fun fact: there are currently no clouds at all over NorCal.

Donald Trump decided to use the opportunity to renew his war with California by nonsensically blaming the wildfires on environmental laws.
California wildfires are being magnified &amp; made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which aren’t allowing massive amounts of readily available water to be properly utilized. It is being diverted into the Pacific Ocean. Must also tree clear to stop fire from spreading!
It’s no surprise that Donald Trump dislikes California. His 2.9m national popular vote deficit to Hillary Clinton is a sore spot, and her margin of victory in California was by 30% and 4.3m votes. California has also long been a leader in developing laws to clean and protect the environment, and Trump despises regulations that benefit public health and welfare at the expense of industry profits.
And so, we got the Tweet bemoaning water being “diverted into the Pacific Ocean” (in scientific terms, they’re called “rivers”). Daniel Berlant, assistant deputy director of Cal Fire immediately noted that water isn’t firefighters’ problem:
We have plenty of water to fight these wildfires, but let’s be clear: It’s our changing climate that is leading to more severe and destructive fires
Although Rep. Doug LaMalfa (R-CA), who represents the district encompassing Redding (or what’s left of it) denied the reality of human-caused climate change in an interview with the Guardian, the scientific research clearly shows that global warming is exacerbating wildfires. As one might expect, hotter, drier conditions lead to bigger fires. Zeke Hausfather showed in an analysis for Carbon Brief that there’s a strong correlation between temperatures and the total area of forests burned in the western USA.
A 2016 study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that 75% of year-to-year variations in area burned by wildfires in the western US can be explained by fuel aridity (a combination of temperature and precipitation), and:
Anthropogenic climate change accounted for ∼55% of observed increases in fuel aridity from 1979 to 2015 across western US forests … and doubled the cumulative forest fire area since 1984
July 2018 was the hottest month ever recorded in California. The past four years were the state’s four hottest, and 2018 is on pace to also finish in California’s top-five hottest years. Plus, California just recently emerged from its worst drought in over a millennium, which was likewise amplified by global warming and created plentiful wildfire fuel.
Other factors like forest management have also played a role in the growing size of wildfires, but human-caused climate change is clearly a major contributor. Under a high-emissions global warming scenario, a 2011 study found that by the end of the century the annual area burned by wildfires in California would increase by about 50%, and would double in heavily-forested Northern California. 
It’s also worth noting that forest management is primarily a federal, not state issue, headed by the Department of Interior and US Forest Service. As the Sacramento Bee reported:
The Trump administration’s own budget request for the current fiscal year and the coming one proposed slashing tens of millions of dollars from the Department of Interior and U.S. Forest Service budgets dedicated to the kind of tree clearing and other forest management work experts say is needed.
Ironically, California has been using the $256m allocated to wildfire risks from the state’s carbon cap and trade system revenues. Visiting the state yesterday, Trump’s Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said:
It doesn’t matter whether you believe or don’t believe in climate change. What is important is we manage our forests.
But given that global warming doubled the area burned by forest fires over the past three decades, it really does matter that the Trump administration denies climate change and is actively making the problem worse.
Meanwhile, California and the Trump EPA are battling over vehicle fuel efficiency standards, which had not improved for decades until the Obama administration took office and bailed out the American auto industry, whose gas guzzlers became unpopular when gasoline prices spiked. 
Transportation was the most obvious example. We let CAFE standards stagnate from 1980 to 2010. As @KnittelMIT has shown, automakers kept improving engine technology during that time, but used it to build bigger, more powerful vehicles instead of improving fuel economy. /4 pic.twitter.com/UxKSbEwJQr
The EPA has tried to justify freezing the standards by claiming more fuel efficient cars will cost consumers money by increasing new vehicle prices, and will thus also increase road deaths, because fewer Americans will buy newer, safer cars. This is some tortured logic. Were fewer Americans to buy new cars, they would save money, especially since those buying new vehicles would save thousands of dollars in gasoline costs over their lifetimes. And Trump is also planning to launch tariffs on imported autos and auto parts that will raise the costs of new cars sold in America by thousands of dollars. 
Moreover, particulate matter (to which vehicles are a major contributor) causes up to 30,000 premature American deaths per year. Decreasing this pollution by increasing fuel efficiency will save lives. The Trump administration denies this reality by claiming that some pollution is just fine. Although the scientific research has shown that there is no known safe level of particulate matter, the EPA has begun to assume cutting the pollution below a certain threshold produces no health benefits. The Trump EPA even hired a scientist who has argued that the air in America is “a little too clean for optimum health.”
California is fighting the Trump EPA’s efforts to weaken the fuel efficiency standards “in every conceivable way possible,” and is likely to win the legal battle. The California Air Resources Board unveiled a proposal last week that would require any new car sold in California to comply with California’s regulations regardless of what the federal government says. 
California moves to ensure vehicles meet existing state greenhouse gas emissions standardsAction comes in response to Trump Administration effort to roll back federal rules ➡️ https://t.co/dszgO7H5s5 #CleanCarStandards pic.twitter.com/xeR59EkAfF
And last year, California extended its carbon cap and trade system through 2030 with some bipartisan support from state lawmakers. But now the Trump administration wants to open more public land in California to fracking and oil drilling.

Following a summer of heatwaves and forest fires in the northern hemisphere, the study in the journal Nature Communications suggests there will be little respite for the planet until at least 2022, and possibly not even then.
Rising greenhouse gas emissions are steadily adding to the upward pressure on temperatures, but humans do not feel the change as a straight line because the effects are diminished or amplified by phases of natural variation.
From 1998 to 2010, global temperatures were in a “hiatus” as natural cooling (from ocean circulation and weather systems) offset anthropogenic global warming. But the planet has now entered almost the opposite phase, when natural trends are boosting man-made effects.
“Everything seems to be adding up,” said the author of the paper, Florian Sévellec of the French National Centre for Scientific Research. “There is a high possibility that we will be at the peak of a warm phase for the next couple of years.”
The scientist built his forecasting system by statistical “hind-casting”. This crunches the data from previous climate models to measure which combination was most effective in predicting past temperature trends. 
Based on this analysis, Sévellec says the statistical upward nudge from natural variation this year is twice as great of that of long-term global warming. Next year, it is likely to be three times higher.
He cautions that this should not be seen as a prediction that Europe will definitely have more heatwaves, the US more forest fires, South Africa more drought or the Arctic more ice melt. The likelihood of these events will increase, but his model is on a broad global scale. It does not predict which part of the world will experience warming or in which season.
But his data clearly suggests that water in the oceans will warm faster than air above land, which could raise the risks of floods, hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones.
“Natural variability is a wriggle around the freight train that is global warming,” he says. “On a human scale, it is what we feel. What we don’t always feel is global warming. As a scientist, this is frightening because we don’t consider it enough. All we can do it give people information and let them make up their own mind.”
He said his model should not be seen as the final word, but be taken alongside other forecasting systems, including those that look in more detail at what is happening on a regional level.
Dr Sam Dean, chief climate scientist at New Zealand’s National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, said the paper indicated mankind will have to rely less on “fortuitously cool years” from natural processes. Instead of the cooling La Niñas experienced in the first decade of the century, he said there have been more warming El Niños since 2014 and this trend looks set to continue. 
“While we can’t be sure exactly how things will play out, at the moment the odds are higher for hot years,” he said.
Other scientists praised the paper but concurred on the need for wider analysis. “The findings suggest it’s more likely we’ll get warmer years than expected in the next few years. But their method is purely statistical, so it’s important to see what climate models predict based on everything we know about the atmosphere and the oceans. Those are more expensive to run but also use more climate physics and observational information,” said Prof Gabi Hegerl of Edinburgh University.
Professor James Renwick of Victoria University of Wellington said the new forecasting system was clever, but its value will only be clear in the future. The broader trend, however, was clear.
“If the warming trend caused by greenhouse gas emissions continues, years like 2018 will be the norm in the 2040s, and would be classed as cold by the end of the century,” he wrote.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/aug/14/extreme-temperatures-especially-likely-for-next-four-years

Obviously.
The standard however is gaps no bigger than 2mm, not exactly the standard Barrow was recommending, which was ""airtight"". 
Alas, we can't ask Barrow why his research led him to say this, but I don't think it's out of the question to suggest he might've had something like negative internal pressures in mind as a cause of the fires he said started in roof spaces.
I mean, given ""airtight"" is a standard that's comparatively difficult to achieve, why was it his preference over simple fine screening. Was he trying to tell us something?
You will certainly get positive internal pressures if there's an opening in the windward surfaces, but that's not what I'm talking about.
And you certainly won't find positive pressure in an intact roof space standing in a strong wind stream. In fact, having spent some time in roof spaces in places where sugar cane is grown I've always been amazed at the amount of fine cane trash and dead embers that one finds lying on the ceiling, sucked in by far more gentle winds than we're talking about.

Mercieca, Merylese and their dog took shelter in the concrete fire bunker they had built beneath their house. “We sat in there and listened to everything explode.”
Overall, more than 200 houses were lost in the fire. The Merciecas lost four vehicles and their home office, destroyed when a flaming truck crashed into it. In the five years since, Mercieca has used his construction business to educate people about the importance of fire preparedness in their homes.
In the past, bushfire season – the period of heightened risk declared by state-specific authorities, often accompanied by fire bans – has typically begun in New South Wales in October and run until March. But an unusual period of months of exceptionally warm and extremely dry weather this year has prompted authorities to start the season early. Not only is Australia’s increasingly hotter, drier weather a cause for concern, but the country’s rapid urbanisation means more people are at risk than ever before.
For large areas in the north and west, bushfire season has been brought forward a whole two months to August – well into winter, which officially began 1 June. The rest of the state, including Sydney, will follow suit from 1 September, closer to spring but still four weeks earlier than usual.
The decision has already been justified. On the first weekend of August, a fire broke out at Doyalson on the NSW Central Coast, just north of Sydney, that crews had to fight to control. Two days later there were 11 uncontained fires in the state.
Rob Rogers, deputy commissioner of the NSW Rural Fire Service, notes that last season fire crews were battling blazes as late as April. “That’s not really bushfire season, and yet we had a big fire on the outskirts of Sydney,” he says.
If you look at Spain, everyone has white houses. It’s ridiculous that here it’s a trend to have a black roof
According to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (Bom), the January to July period 2018 was the warmest in NSW since 1910. Rogers linked these “unseasonably warm temperatures” with the deadly heatwaves in Greece and North America. “It’s fair to say that the climate is changing and longer fire seasons are something we’re starting to experience.”
Bushfires mostly threaten the bushland and national parks surrounding Australian cities, but as their limits edge ever-outwards – the country has one of the highest rates of sprawl in the world – urban areas are increasingly under threat. One of the late-season fires in NSW in April was in Holsworthy, a suburb 30km south-west of inner-city Sydney, forcing the evacuation of hundreds of people and sleepless nights for many more.
Even when not threatened by fire, western Sydney is known to be one of the hottest parts of the entire state of NSW. The area consistently reaches far higher temperatures than the eastern Sydney suburbs because of its unique geography and lack of sea breeze, which combine to create an urban heat island within an urban heat island.
In January this year Penrith – a major metropolitan area 50km west of the city centre – was the hottest place on Earth, reaching 47.3C while Sydney itself was 44C. Annually there are 14 heat-related deaths per 100,000 people in western Sydney, compared with five by the coast. The number of days above 35C a year is projected to increase by five to ten by 2030, while a recent study has predicted that summer heatwaves in major Australian cities are likely to reach highs of 50C by 2040.
Linden Ashcroft, a climate researcher at Bom, says the temperature difference between coastal and western Sydney can be massive and deadly. “The hot days are really dramatic and potentially really dangerous, but it’s the nights that are the real concern.
“If you think of an elderly person or vulnerable member of the community, they struggle through the day generally but then the nights should bring relief. If you’re getting that [urban heat island] effect, you don’t.”
Eight agencies in the western Sydney region have been working together to bring down temperatures through measures including tree-planting, installing air conditioning in public facilities, such as libraries and increasing opening hours for swimming pools in summer.
Stephen Bali, the mayor of Blacktown city council and president of the Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils, says there is a wider problem with the way Australian homes are built – typically with dark colours that absorb heat and without features that reduce the need for heating and cooling, such as double-glazed windows and double brick facades.
New homes being built in bushfire-prone areas must meet stringent building requirements, such as stronger glass with some ability to withstand heat and non-combustible features. But Bali says councils need the backing of state governments to mandate materials that are better suited to the Australian climate more broadly.
We may run into a situation where we exhaust our capacity to fight major fires and we have to rethink the way we live
“We need to look at building codes. If you look at Spain, everyone has white houses. It’s ridiculous that here it’s a trend to have a black roof.”
Andy Pitman, director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes at the University of NSW, agrees. “We design almost all our developments perfectly wrong for keeping cities cool,” he says. “Have you ever been to the Mediterranean? Build our houses like that.”
“They are well insulated. They have brightly coloured roofs to reflect sunlight. They don’t need a lot of cooling in summer, and they don’t need a lot of heating in winter.”
Australia’s rapid population growth, focused on its major cities, poses another challenge. Western Sydney is projected to absorb two-thirds of the 1.7m extra people expected in the city by 2036.
Not only will greater population density exacerbate the urban heat island effect, the state’s Office of Environment and Heritage has predicted that the conversion of areas in the north-west and south-west of Sydney from forest and grasslands to new urban development may double the projected temperature increases from climate change in the near future.
As urban areas from Darwin to Melbourne sprawl outwards in hotter, drier summers, the scene is set for a potentially catastrophic combination. “People cause fires,” says Ross Bradstock, the director of the centre for environmental risk management of bushfires at the University of Wollongong. “When you’ve got high densities of populations you can get lots of ignitions, either from people lighting fires directly or from things like power lines for transport.” There are strong indications that conditions conducive to major fires will increase with the changing climate, Bradstock adds.
Earlier starts and later finishes to bushfire season also mean authorities have less time in which to try to reduce the risk through controlled burns. “Sydney is surrounded by bush and a lot of it goes into the suburbs themselves,” says Rogers. “We’ve been trying to do burn-offs and reduce the fuel ahead of summer but in Sydney that’s challenging because people get concerned about the amount of smoke– we haven’t done as much as we’d like.”
Bradstock and his team have been using technology including satellite data and forecasting to pinpoint critically dry areas around Australian cities on a day-to-day basis, and predict that more than half a million houses are now directly exposed to bushfire risk.
Heatwaves are already the country’s deadliest natural disaster, with climatologists warning that they will only increase in frequency, severity and duration. Even Australian cities – better acclimatised to heat than many in the world – must adapt to the changing climate. Bradstock says that could include evaluating how close homes are built to bushland. If major fires become more frequent, as looks likely, “we may run into a situation where we exhaust our capacity to fight them and we have to rethink the way we live”.

In news that will rock seafood lovers, a study released overnight by academics in the UK found oysters in New South Wales have become smaller and fewer in number because of coastal acidification.
It’s part of what researchers fear is a worldwide trend driven by climate change and coastal runoff. 
Headed by University of Stirling academic Susan Fitzer, the study looked at oyster leases at Wallis Lake and Port Stephens, both on the NSW coast north of Sydney.
They make up the two largest Sydney rock oyster production areas in NSW.
The study found the oysters’ diminishing size and falling population is due to acidification from land and sea sources, part of a global trend.
“Sydney rock oysters are becoming smaller and their population is decreasing as a result of coastal acidification,” Fitzer said.
“The first thing consumers will notice is smaller oysters, mussels and other molluscs on their plates, but if ocean acidification and coastal acidification are exacerbated by future climate change and sea level rise, this could have a huge impact on commercial aquaculture and populations around the world.”
The risk to oyster populations around the globe from soil runoff has long been recognised. 
In 2014 oyster farmers in Port Stephens released an industry-driven environmental management policy which recognised that damage to oyster leases from the drainage from acid-sulphate soils was both “likely” to occur and “severe” in consequence.
But Fitzer’s research argues that run-off is not caused by agricultural activity and is rather the consequence of the impacts of climate change.
“A lot of work has been done near to Australia’s oyster fisheries to mitigate the impact of sulphate soils causing acidification, and there has been a marked decline in levels,” she said.
“The run-off from sulfate soils aren’t produced by agricultural activity, they occur as a natural result of climate change-driven increases in rainfall and sea-level rise. 
“But the trend persists and small changes in pH are having a huge impact on these molluscs.”
Increased acidification affects oyster growth by limiting the amount of carbonate in the water.
 “Acidic water is damaging oysters’ ability to grow their shells. We see lots of disorder in the calcite layers, because there isn’t enough carbonate in the water for the oysters to draw on for optimal shell formation and growth,” Fitzer said.
The issue is not confined to Australian oyster production. 
Ocean acidification has been reported globally, while coastal acidification from the land, as freshwater runoff from acid sulfate soils, is driven by rising sea levels and flooding also decreases environmental pH.
Fitzer has previously linked rising acidification to weaker shells in mussels in Loch Fyne, Scotland.
“This is the first time that the Sydney rock oysters’ shell crystallography has been studied, and we now know disruption to this process could have a significant impact on Australian aquaculture,” she said.
Fitzer’s research was published in the Journal of Ecology and Environment. 
Mike Webb, the NERC’s head of research, said the aim of the study was to contribute “to the understanding of how climate change will affect food production around the world, and lead to collaboration between researchers and industry to solve some of the challenges our society faces”.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/aug/16/sydney-rock-oysters-getting-smaller-as-oceans-become-more-acidic

The government is working up the regulatory option ahead of cabinet deliberations next week – as well as expediting a power price fix linked to the Neg, which will likely involve setting default pricing for electricity consumers and punitive measures to stop big energy companies extracting super profits from their customers.
Some government backbenchers have dug in their heels over legislating the Neg’s emissions reduction 26% target, framing that step as a breach of Australian sovereignty. The change means they will not be asked to endorse the 26% cut in a parliamentary vote as it will be set by regulation.
Guardian Australia understands the option to be put to cabinet next week would involve setting the target by an executive order that cannot be disallowed.
The option under consideration is that the target would be set via the regulation, and if a government wanted to increase it, it would first have to seek advice from the Australian Energy Regulator and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission about the impact of a target increase on electricity prices.
That advice would be made public.
Labor has pressured the government to make it easier for future governments to be able to scale up the Neg’s pollution target beyond the current proposal of a 26% reduction – flagging a desire that it be set by an administrative instrument rather than in legislation, which is harder to change.
The states, who can make or break the Neg through the Coag energy council, have also demanded the target be set in regulation so it can be ratcheted up.
The government has been plunged into a crisis this week, with a group of 10 backbenchers threatening to cross the floor to oppose the Neg. There is also a larger group, including some ministers, concerned that the existing policy won’t drive down power prices.
Current indications suggest the government will need Labor’s backing to get the Neg legislation through the House of Representatives.
Tony Abbott has escalated his public attacks on the policy, while the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, has held the line on the Neg but publicly articulated the circumstances in which he would have to resign from the cabinet if he reached a point of irresolvable conflict with the prime minister on the detail.
The current fraught debate shares many of the hallmarks of the Liberal party’s internal convulsion in 2009 in which Abbott took the leadership from Turnbull after a vicious internal fight about his support for emissions trading.
Turnbull loyalist Christopher Pyne sounded a warning shot to restive colleagues during his regular Friday appearance on the Nine Network, criticising Abbott’s supporters for “hyperventilating” over the government’s energy policy.
“We are not on the ropes,” he said in answer to a question about the government’s re-election prospects.
“The polls are about 50-50 and there’s a lot of hyperventilating going on and there’s a few people I think who are trying to put the band back together from the late 2000 and noughties.”
Asked who “they” were, Pyne said: “I think we know who they are.”
The government’s objective in expediting the power price package to accompany the Neg has been to reduce the number of MPs prepared to cross the floor by half.
Senior figures expect Abbott, and possibly a couple of others, to cross the floor regardless of the rework.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/aug/17/turnbull-ditches-emissions-legislation-to-head-off-backbench-dissent

While many have already made their home more energy efficient, 62% said they wanted to fit solar and a surprisingly high 60% would buy an energy storage device such as those sold by Tesla.
An even greater number – 71% – would join a local energy scheme such as a community windfarm or solar panel collective, according to the YouGov survey.
The results run counter to the government’s approach to climate change and energy, which favours large-scale power generation such as nuclear plants and offshore windfarms.
Community energy projects have flatlined in the face of government subsidy cuts and tax changes, while incentives for household solar will expire next year without a replacement. There is no support for people considering a home battery.
James Thornton, CEO of environmental law group ClientEarth, which commissioned the research, said: “Government policy is plainly at odds with public sentiment – and its own ambition to tackle climate change – as far as our energy sources are concerned. 
“People want to know more and take ownership of how they get their energy – that’s clearly demonstrated by the broad support in the poll for household solar and community energy schemes.”
Solar installers have told the Guardian that, increasingly, people are also opting for home batteries when they buy solar.
Energy storage is also making inroads at utility scale. On Monday, water company Anglian Water will announce it has bought a 300 kilowatt hour (kWh) storage system from UK-based firm redT, for use at a water treatment site alongside solar panels.
Solar was ranked the most popular of all energy sources in the ClientEarth survey, while gas was second worst behind coal. 
More than two thirds (68%) thought the big six energy suppliers’ market dominance should be broken up to allow smaller clean energy firms to grow. Exactly half said they would move their pensions to avoid fossil fuel investments, a figure that rose to 59% for 18-34 year olds.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/aug/20/majority-of-uk-public-want-to-install-solar-panels-poll-finds

This phenomenon – which has never been recorded before – has occurred twice this year due to warm winds and a climate-change driven heatwave in the northern hemisphere.
One meteorologist described the loss of ice as “scary”. Others said it could force scientists to revise their theories about which part of the Arctic will withstand warming the longest.
The sea off the north coast of Greenland is normally so frozen that it was referred to, until recently, as “the last ice area” because it was assumed that this would be the final northern holdout against the melting effects of a hotter planet.
But abnormal temperature spikes in February and earlier this month have left it vulnerable to winds, which have pushed the ice further away from the coast than at any time since satellite records began in the 1970s.
“Almost all of the ice to the north of Greenland is quite shattered and broken up and therefore more mobile,” said Ruth Mottram of the Danish Meteorological Institute. “Open water off the north coast of Greenland is unusual. This area has often been called ‘the last ice area’ as it has been suggested that the last perennial sea ice in the Arctic will occur here. The events of the last week suggest that, actually, the last ice area may be further west.”
Ice to the north of Greenland is usually particularly compacted due to the Transpolar Drift Stream, one of two major weather patterns that push ice from Siberia across the Arctic to the coastline, where it packs.
Walt Meier, a senior research scientist at the US National Snow and Ice Data Center, said: “The ice there has nowhere else to go so it piles up. On average, it’s over four metres thick and can be piled up into ridges 20 metres thick or more. This thick, compacted ice is generally not easily moved around. 
“However, that was not the case this past winter (in February and March) and now. The ice is being pushed away from the coast by the winds.”
The world may have warmed by around 1C (1.8F) over the past century but the Arctic far outstrips this global average and is warming at around twice the rate of the rest of the world.
In places, the rate of warming has been astonishing. Novembers in the Alaskan town of Utqiaġvik, formerly Barrow, are now 5.5C warmer than they were in 1979. This past winter, the warmest on record in the Arctic, saw some locations exceed 20C hotter than normal.
The Arctic is dominated by sea ice, unlike the Antarctic which is essentially a huge land-based ice sheet. As the ocean and atmosphere warm, sea ice is shrinking in extent, at around 13% a decade since 1979, according to Nasa. The bright white surface of ice, known as albedo, is giving way to the dark ocean, meaning that sunlight is being absorbed rather than reflected, amplifying the warming effect.
These “rapid and dramatic changes” are introducing a “new normal” to the Arctic, according to US government scientists in a report card last year. Storms are eroding away ice-free coastlines, summer wildfires are becoming fiercer and certain species, such as polar bears, are increasingly struggling to find food. This is all providing a major challenge to communities in the Arctic, but a boon to the shipping industry, which can navigate the area more easily. This task will get even simpler once the Arctic is ice free in summertimes, forecast as soon as 2040s.
Ice is easier to blow around as a result of a warming trend, which has accelerated over the past 15 years. “The thinning is reaching even the coldest part of the Arctic with the thickest ice. So it’s a pretty dramatic indication of the transformation of the Arctic sea ice and Arctic climate.”
“Scary,” wrote Thomas Lavergne, a scientist at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute, in a retweet of a satellite-gif of the blue water penetrating white ice and exposing hundreds of miles of the Greenland coastline.
So the open water / low concentration patch North for Greenland is still there (and slowly moving westward). Nice and scary. From https://t.co/jPx1JmNayA https://t.co/hGstLYafcW
He said this would flush chunks of thicker ice out through the Fram or Nares Straits into warmer southern waters.
“I cannot tell how long this open water patch will remain open, but even if it closes in few days from now, the harm will be done: the thick old sea ice will have been pushed away from the coast, to an area where it will melt more easily,” he added. 
This year’s openings are driven more by wind than melting but they have occurred during two temperature spikes. In February, the Kap Morris Jesup weather station in the region is usually below -20C, but earlier this year there were 10 days above freezing and warm winds, which unlocked the ice from the coast.
Last week, the crack opened again after Kap Morris Jesup briefly registered a record high of 17C and strong southerly winds picked up to 11 knots. Experts predict that coastal seas will freeze again but probably later than normal.
“I think that solar heating of the water column will increase during this opening and this will delay freeze-up and ice formation,” said Rasmus Tage Tonboe, a sea ice expert at the the Danish Meteorological Institute.
The latest readings by the Norwegian Ice Service show that Arctic ice cover in the Svalbard area this week is 40% below the average for this time of year since 1981. In the past month, at least 14 days in the past month have hit record lows in this region. Although thinner ice elsewhere in the Arctic means this is unlikely to be a record low year overall, they are in line with predictions that there will be no summer ice in the Arctic Ocean at some point between 2030 and 2050.
Keld Qvistgaard, the ice service coordinator in Denmark, said this was not the first time a gap had appeared between the shore and the main ice pack but the one formed from 1 to 5 August was different in its extent. “This event is a pretty big one going all the way to west of Kap Morris Jesup. This is unusual,” he said.
As well as reducing ice cover, the ocean intrusion raises concerns of feedbacks, which could tip the Earth towards a hothouse state. 
Freakish Arctic temperatures have alarmed climate scientists since the beginning of the year. During the sunless winter, a heatwave raised concerns that the polar vortex may be eroding.
This includes the Gulf Stream, which is at its weakest level in 1,600 years due to melting Greenland ice and ocean warming. With lower circulation of water and air, weather systems tend to linger longer.
A dormant hot front has been blamed for record temperatures in Lapland and forest fires in Siberia, much of Scandinavia and elsewhere in the Arctic circle.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/21/arctics-strongest-sea-ice-breaks-up-for-first-time-on-record

In reality veganism reduces the eating of such crops, as those are exactly what are fed to livestock at the density current in Britain. The amount of soya fed to the average cow to produce a litre of milk is several times that used to produce a litre of soya milk, so switching to soya milk reduces demand for soya imports. Only once consumption of meat, dairy and eggs falls below a quarter of current levels need she worry about impacts on her kind of farming.
Even then the kind of animals that she farms might find a niche outside being farmed. I have no idea whether she sells the meat of her Exmoor ponies for human consumption, but the excessively meat-eating majority include plenty who would refuse it. Cat and dog meat is not generally eaten in Britain, but it still has those animals.
If vegans reach a big enough majority, the thinking behind eating plants directly rather than eating what eats them might lead to keeping the animals that cats and dogs eat. That might be rabbits for those who still want a traditional pet, sheep for those who want something large but docile, pigs for those who want a challenge. 
For now, veganism can be seen as compensating for all those whose consumption of steaks – and cheese, omelettes and the rest – is far from “occasional”. It is not compensating nearly enough, nor will it be until we reach that majority, but it is all that one individual can do.Charles EL GilmanMitcham, Surrey 
• Although Isabella Tree’s views on veganism will upset some, wasting edible pests (eg rabbits) is difficult to condone given growing risks to food supplies. Livestock’s impact (numbers and/or impact per head) needs reduction but this needs investment and changed attitudes. Yet supposing hi-tech methods allowed large-scale synthetic food (not just meat) to be produced, problems still remain.
Such food wouldn’t benefit the world’s poor, while rainforests could be cleared for biofuels, other cash crops, minerals, logging and dams. Such threats apply elsewhere, along with suburban sprawl and other development (These projects shape our lives. But we have no say in them, Journal, 22 August), fracking and water abstraction. Rewilders could be outbid by those aiming to give everyone western lifestyles and the jobs to afford them.
With gas escapes from ice sheets and the need to re-home climate change refugees, food security and conservation will both struggle. Tree’s ideas are not silver bullets but, along with restoring fish stocks, could provide safety nets against severe crop losses since free markets can’t handle gluts and nobody is clearly responsible for food security. Iain ClimieWhitchurch, Hants
• Isabella Tree puts forward a compelling case for us being omnivores; our natural teeth structure is to eat meat and veg, which fits us into the cycle of life. Her comments about soil structure remind me of John Steinbeck’s The Grapes of Wrath – there were other factors in the Oklahoma dust bowl, but the bad farming practices inflicted misery on many thousands of people in America in the 1930s. Hopefully, we will save the soil structure in the UK by extensive farming and being our natural selves, omnivores.Andrew ParkerTruro, Cornwall
• Could Monsanto et al be behind the relentless drive to veganism? Scarlett Conlon reports (18 August) that the fashion industry is creating mass-market synthetic leather from genetically engineered yeast and pineapple leaves. They will also need to find ways of producing artificial, plant-based wool.
Vast numbers of new factories will be required to mechanically replicate milk, butter, cheese, eggs, meat, leather, wool and feathers, producing highly processed foodstuffs and engineered materials to replace all natural animal products.
And what of fish? Will cats be allowed to eat them? Will it be acceptable to use human excrement as an organic fertiliser base, replacing animal dung, blood, hooves and horns?
In the new puritan, domestic-animal-free world, will down, moor and pastureland, with the ecosystems they support, be replaced by endless GM crops and factories?Judy StevensBrighton

Globally, the main cause of saltwater incursion will be global warming, don't you agree?
BQEND
First, the discussion was about the Nile Delta. I already state the main reasons for the problem there.
Globally? No. Where is your evidence for that? Coastal aquifers have been pumped for decades, many of them at too high a rate such that the freshwater-saltwater interface moves inland. It also causes upconing of saline water from the saltwater wedge at depth.
Overpumping of coastal aquifers is the main cause of saltwater intrusion. ('incursion' is not the term the experts use).
Regarding deltas. Well, you need to ask why deltas seem to be mostly just above sea level. Is it just coincidence? No. They are at that level because they adjust with sea level. They are the point where major rivers meet the sea and dump their load of sediment as flows come to an abrupt halt. If the sea level falls, the level of the delta falls. If sea levels rise, the level of the delta rises - unless of course, humans alter the natural delta flooding and sediment depostion process as has happened with the Nile (and many other deltas).

The saltwater intrusion of the Nile Delta is principally a result of two manmade factors: (1) over abstraction of fresh groundwater, causing the saline interface to move inland, and (2) a REDUCTION in flooding. The natural condition was for periodic river floods to cover the delta and restore freshwater to aquifers. With the massive amounts of water removed fom the Nile for irrigation, and massive lossess from evaporation from the manmade lake behind the Aswan Dam, the natural recharge has deminished.

No.
These are not the only choices and nor can we continue to construct on, and live on, floodplains with this attitudes. You cannot build your way out of flooding with ""hard"" defences: high-impact, high-cost, slow-build projects are no longer feasible in the UK where risk of flooding is increasingly spatially unpredictable with localised intense rainfall, and where local government has limited resources to spend on defences' construction and upkeep. 
What is needed is a transition to households taking responsibility for their own flood safety (i.e. through making modifications to their homes, purchasing flood insurance etc.), and enhanced government support in enabling residents to do that. Expecting flood defences to protect you is simply no longer feasible.

There is a risk that if too much focus is applied to one cause, other equally important, or more important causes, will be missed.

Adaptation is the process of adjusting to climate change in order to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities associated with it. Most adaptation strategies are designed to adjust to a new climate state. However, despite our best efforts to curtail greenhouse gas emissions, climate is likely to continue changing far into the future.

Very far into the future:
A new paper indicates just how long lasting will be the impacts from this refusal to listen to scientists: 
BQSTART
By analyzing the fish fossils inside, researchers determined that global temperatures were stable for a long time before the asteroid impact, but then, afterwards, temperatures quickly rose and stayed about 5 degrees Celsius warmer for about 100,000 years. 
MacLeod says it's notable that the impact pumped up carbon dioxide over a short time span that, geologically speaking, is comparable to what humans have been doing in burning fossil fuels since the start of the Industrial Revolution.
""The atmosphere was loaded for a very brief interval of time, and the consequences of that change in atmospheric composition lasted for 100,000 years,"" MacLeod says. ""So it illustrates, I think, really strongly, even if we went back to 1850 levels of carbon dioxide emission, it's going to take a 100,000 years for the carbon dioxide that we've already put in the atmosphere to cycle through the Earth's systems.”

The main cause is how we use the land: building on flood plains, covering with impermeable surfaces and removing vegetation in the upper parts of river basins. Building on flood plains has two main outcomes: first it puts buildings (often homes) right into the most vulnerable places, and second, it pushes flood waters up or downstream to areas that previously had a lower flood risk. Simply blaming it on climate change, means you accept increased flood risk is inevitable, and all you can do is adapt. The strap lines says: ""People living near waterways must choose between moving away or building ever-larger flood defences."" But a far more effective approach is twofold: first, improve planning regulations to prevent these ongoing rapid changes to land use, and, second, to restore more natural flood regimes as much as reasonably possible. Many cities are already doing this. This includes opening up green spaces to better absorb floods, restoring city streams and rivers to a more natural meandering form, with strategically placed vegetation to slow flows, replacing impermeable paving with permeable versions, replanting woodland in the upper basin, etc. A third component is to accept floods happen and be prepared for the emergency response and recovery. In the UK, flood maps show up to 1 in 200 year floods. So if a flood happens today, it is not automatically due to climate change. It may simply be one that is due.

They were founded in an era where boats were the easiest and sometimes the only form of long distance transport. Towns also developed at either end of important bridges.
The risks of being on the river and being exposed to flooding or storm surges were outweighed by the economic advantages of having property on the waterfront. 
Apart from a handful of major ports, a lot of ancient towns now have all their goods supplied by road and see their rivers as much as a threat as an asset. 
As rainfall intensifies with climate change the potential devastation from floods leaves residents with two choices, move away from the river or build ever-larger flood defences. 
Recent research shows that in poorer countries where floods have swept through towns people have relocated to higher ground, abandoning their homes rather than face a repeat catastrophe. 
Richer countries, including Britain, have opted to build earth banks or concrete walls to protect real estate in towns from the rivers, effectively sealing off the waterways that were the original reason for their existence and wealth.

It sounds like spinning straw into gold: suck carbon dioxide from the air where it's contributing to climate change and turn it into fuel for cars, trucks and jets. 
A British Columbia company says in newly published research that it's doing just that — and for less than one-third the cost of other companies working on the same technology.

Others lean out of their windows on one bank of the canal, staring at the growing piles of rubble of what was once rows of homes on the opposite bank. The previous occupants as well as those looking on are a harbinger of thousands who will be forced to leave their homes due to climate change. 
Abir Mohamed Abdel-Salam says she doesn’t remember exactly when the canal water first rose above the height of her front window, pouring into her house. “It would reach the top of my thighs,” she says. Black fumes rise overhead from the adjacent petroleum factory. 
For years, flooding has been a regular occurrence, and now she knows her emergency response by heart.
“First I would send someone to turn off the pumps,” she says, referring to the nearby pumping station designed to prevent flooding on an adjacent coastal road, one driven by wealthy Egyptians en route to their summer homes. “Then we would build a fort inside our house with the furniture.” 
The three tiers of crumbling cement houses in El Max once formed the backbone of a 1,000-strong fishing community. But since March, the local authorities have forced half the residents out of their homes and into bleak tower blocks overlooking the canal they once depended on for their livelihood. Those that remain await the demolition of their homes, gazing at the rubble on the opposite bank as a reminder of what awaits them. 
Alexandria is a city on the frontline of climate change. According to United Nations figures, even a 50cm sea-level rise will destroy its beaches entirely, while “the Alexandria lowlands – on which the city of Alexandria originally developed – are vulnerable to inundation, waterlogging, increased flooding and salinisation under accelerated sea-level rise”. 
The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said that global sea levels are expected to rise by as much as 68cm by 2050, flooding parts of Alexandria and seeping into the groundwater. It will also cause building collapses and force saltwater into vital farmland in the nearby Nile Delta region, destroying livelihoods and forcing more internal displacement. 
The plight of El Max’s residents is an early warning sign, the first wave of thousands who will be forced to move due to the effects of climate change on the area, in particular nearby Lake Mariout. 
“There are many areas around the lake that are located at least 3m below sea level,” says Alexandrian climate scientist Mohamed El Raey. “[They] will have to be abandoned and the people relocated. In these low-lying areas, there will be hundreds of thousands of people affected by flooding.” El Raey estimates that the government will be forced to move residents in less than 10 years. 
These displaced people will form part of a growing global problem. The UN estimates that since 2009, one person every second has been displaced by a climate-change related disaster. 
El Max is an unknown corner of the city to many Alexandrians, tucked away between a tangle of concrete overpasses, flat planes of polluted industrial wasteland and dust-choked streets where thick, dark clouds from nearby factories have coated every visible surface. Much of the surrounding area appears almost hostile to human life, despite its placement between the fertile Nile Delta and the Mediterranean coast.
The area is known as Alexandria’s own Little Venice, a community of people dependent on the water for their way of life and the rows of pastel-coloured homes that once sustained them. The decades-old informal dwellings are considered “slums” by the local government. The area has also featured in Egyptian film as a place of gangsters and illicit trading, generating rumours of real-world crime.
“This is Venice-El Max!” laughs Ahmed Saber, guiding his boat through the soupy brown water on the canal. Pollution from nearby factories has turned it into thick sludge, killing off many of the fish needed for the fishermen to survive. “It feels like Venice – I have a boat like they do in Europe. But it’s all about to be destroyed,” he says, as his boat passes another with rows of teeth painted at the bow to resemble a shark. 
Saber, like many others in El Max, has repeatedly refuted signs of flooding that are all around them, from layers of rust on the bars on windows and doors to the water-worn steps that run between the houses. It seemed that admitting to the problem meant taking the side of the local authorities, who they said had been threatening the move for several years. 
But by June this year, when half the community were forced to relocate, some residents were willing to be more open about the flooding. 
The original problem, explains El Raey, stems from Lake Mariout. “The lake is almost 3m below sea level, so waste water dumping there causes fluctuations in the canal,” he says. “The buildings along the canal are also located below sea level.” The situation is worst in the winter, when the sea level rises.
Annual rainfall on Egypt’s coast has recently reached unprecedented levels, such as in 2015, says Dr Khayal Zahra of Egypt’s Coastal Research Institute. “Climate change-related problems meant that the amount of rainfall exceeded 227mm in two days.” The average rainfall had been 250mm a year, for the past 100 years. Excess rainfall exacerbates the rising levels of polluted water in El Max, overloading the nearby pumping station and raising the water levels of the canal until it floods residents’ homes. 
But the rising waters on Egypt’s coastline will not affect everyone equally: Egypt’s poorest, living on the water’s edge or dependent on its resources, are vulnerable to the first and worst effects of climate change. They are also the authorities’ frequent target for forced relocation plans aimed at alleged illegal construction in areas they seek to reclaim.
“The state is working to end the issue of slums by 2022,” says Mohamed Sultan, a spokesman for the governor of Alexandria, referring to a state-wide initiative by President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi to eradicate informal housing, known as ashwiyyet – urban working class centres often associated with both poverty and social discontent. Although several generations of families live in El Max and have paid rent for decades, the government claims the homes were built illegally and that the only solution is forced relocation, and demolition. 
“The governorate has already started relocating the residents to a much safer area,” says Sultan, in reference to an austere cluster of red and sand-bricked tower blocks. The buildings are closer to the nearby beach, putting them in the path of future rising tides. “The previous houses were considered dangerous for the lives of the residents, as the water level increased and entered the homes, risking the lives of those who lived there,” he says. 
The governorate insists that a new port will allow residents to fish, and store their equipment. But none of the residents the Guardian speaks to in El Max seem aware of the opportunity, viewing the move as a blow to their way of life and a shove into potential unemployment. They also cite a steep rise in rent, from under £1 a year to almost £9 each month – a sum that is untenable for many. It will mean packing extra family members into homes that residents like Abdel-Salam brand tiny compared with the houses they had before.
“The water is an excuse for the government to relocate people,” says Ali Abdel Rahman, a 63-year-old fisherman who sits inside the small blue-and-white-painted hut where he stores his fishing equipment. The room smells of saltwater, and most surfaces are encrusted with either salt, or rust. Outside the shop he sometimes cooks his catch on a small grill, and chats to his neighbours. He is cynical about government promises.
“I’m 63. There’s nothing I can do other than fish,” he says. “They say they’re building us new homes – but these houses aren’t homes, they’re just offices,” he adds bitterly. 
Abdel Rahman, Abdel-Salam and other residents are certain that their lives in the new tower blocks might be a reprieve from the floods, but that the move will tear them away from their way of life. 
“There, we have a sea view – but nothing else,” says Abdel-Salam. ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/aug/29/alexandria-little-venice-egypt-climate-change-frontline

The Baie de Somme is about 70km away, and in fact I used to have a house there. The duck hunting there was appalling. The sanctuary of the Marquenterre is right next door, with arctic birds that have flown thousands of kilometres to overwinter ""accidentally"" getting blasted out of the sky. A particularly horrible hunting exploit in the Somme is to capture ducks and wire a stone to their legs so they can't fly away, and they are surrounded by decoys. They quack so much in their distress that it attracts other ducks, who are shot out of the sky by hunters in bunkers. Those are my two experiences of hunting in France, both horrible.

Palestine is on the green radar but not top of agenda. You might think that spending 4 % of the time discussing or having \ and selling organic olive oil produced in West Bank Palestine could be better spent on something else but I don't see this as impacting on the Green main agenda.
Macron has been proactive in a few green issues, especially the economically vital to the French industry with electric cars, but like others policies, they are to be implemented in the future. I am not saying it won't happen, France doesn't have the choice if they don't want to be left behind.
But, in the meantime, you would expect to see some signs of progress on what would be ""low hanging fruit"" such as hunting. It seems like the relaxing of hunting was the sign that environmental issues weren't that important.
Nicolas Hulot, like many greens, can see that if the planet was to become inhabitable and hostile, it wouldn't be just the welfare of the farmers that would be questioned but the whole humanity, including mass movement of population. Farmers, on the other hand, think there still time and that the transition should be slower.

The numbers you quote are misleading (intentionally or not), as these figures are calculated by including the cost of services that have already been privatised in other countries, hence a bigger public spending. ""Reducing these public expenses a bit"" will very much damages services indeed, especially those that have already started to dig into the bone (healthcare and hospitals, for instance).
The next step of this predictable ""discussion"" is you maintaining that spending would be best if made by the private sector, when there is abundent evidence that it is not the case.
The lanagement of such previously state-owned sectors as water distribution, motorways, and countless others show to what extent private interests are compatible with a concern for the greater good.

He was elected President because he had the good luck to run against a fascist. 
His party was given a majority because of 1) the virtually unprecedented (and I don't just mean in France) degree to which people turned their backs in disgust at the electoral process, given who was running and (especially ) who was likely to win and 2) the absurd advantage that the French electoral system gives to centrist parties; unless a socialist is prepared to vote for a reactionary candidate, or a reactionary for a socialist one, centrist candidates will mop up in the second round, as the acceptable second choice. 
La République En Marche attracted the votes of less than 14% of the electorate in the first round, and about 17% in the second.

The only failure, if you could call it that, was in Macron's attempt to convince Germany to address their coal burning with an enhanced carbon tax.Macron’s appeals [to implement additional carbon taxes like the UK 'Carbon Price Floor'] were rejected.
However, on the advice of Climate Scientists[1], president, Macron decided to revoke his predecessors ideas on cutting nuclear and promised to use an appropriate mix of nuclear and renewables to deliver emissions cuts.

EDFs P/E ratio is >17% and their dividend is 3¼%
Their Debt to Asset ratio is circa 18% (way below the 40% when you'd begin to have any concerns.)

Has he lost credibility on the environment too? | Pauline Bock,article,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/29/macron-minister-environmental-credibility-nicolas-hulot-shock-resignation,0,"No one knew Nicolas Hulot, the French environment minister, was about to resign when he went on a radio breakfast show yesterday morning – not even himself. But as the live discussion unfolded, focusing on his government’s failures on climate change, it became clear that Hulot had reached a decision.
“I can’t lie to myself any more,” he said. “I don’t want my presence in the government to give the illusion that we’re facing up to such stakes,” he said on public radio France Inter. Explaining how he had felt “alone” in a cabinet that only took insufficient, “tiny steps” to tackle environmental challenges, he announced that he would resign.
In a moment of striking self-awareness, Hulot, a celebrity environmentalist, continued: “Have we started to reduce our CO2 emissions? No. Have we started to reduce our use of pesticides? No. To prevent the erosion of our biodiversity? No.”
Neither the president, Emmanuel Macron, nor the hprime minister, Édouard Philippe, had been made aware of Hulot’s decision before it happened. The French government was taken entirely by surprise: Marlène Schiappa, Macron’s secretary of state for equality, was being interviewed on another radio station when she heard the news, and asked the presenter if he was joking. Hulot had been one of Macron’s most popular ministers, even after he was accused of sexual assault last February, which he denied.
For the French president, it is a heavy blow. On a state visit to Denmark, Macron said he respected Hulot’s “personal decision”, and hoped to still be able to “count on his free and confident engagement” in the future. Yet the surprise resignation complicates things further for the government, who after the mess of this summer’s Benalla scandal was already preparing for a challenging autumn with a much-condemned pensions reform on the agenda.
It was only a year ago that Macron rebuked the US president, Donald Trump, for pulling out of the Paris climate agreement by calling to “make our planet great again” – a slogan he proudly turned into a hashtag to underline his campaign pledge to fully address the impacts of climate change. As his ratings keep falling – dropping to 39%, the lowest of his presidency so far – the former poster boy for global environmental action has now lost his cabinet’s signature green advocate.
And Macron has got only himself to blame: according to Hulot, what drove him over the edge was the presence of a hunting lobbyist at a meeting earlier this week. “It is symptomatic of the presence of lobbyists in circles of power. Who holds the power? Who rules?” Hulot wondered on the radio. (A few months ago, Macron also announced the reintroduction of the traditional presidential hunt). When Hulot asked the president why the lobbyist was there, Macron apparently responded that he “didn’t know how he had got in.” Understandably, Hulot did not appreciate the impudent humour. Political opposition vocally supported his condemnation of lobbyists’ influence. Macron “sucks up” to lobbyists, ecologist Yannick Jadot told Le Monde.
For all the debate around Hulot’s resignation, his wake-up call remains unanswered. “I don’t understand that we are witnessing the gestation of a tragedy with indifference,” Hulot said. “The planet is becoming a sauna, our natural resources are draining, biodiversity is vanishing. And we stubbornly try to revive an economic model that is the cause of all this mess.”
Macron may still save face – but that will take real political courage by living up to his promises on cutting emissions, pesticides bans and wildlife protection. Sucking up to lobbyists won’t make the planet great again, Manu.

But some have found a solution: growing cannabis.
Hemp cultivation has been legal in Italy since 2016, and over the last few years the amount of land dedicated to the plant has increased from 400 hectares (1,000 acres) in 2013 to 4,000 hectares today.
The law – which allows cultivation for non-pharmaceutical use of plants with up to 0.2% of the psychoactive compound THC – was introduced with the intention of increasing the development of industrial hemp production. Italians have taken advantage of the legal change to produce not only hemp ricotta and environmentally friendly bricks, but also hemp pasta and biscuits.
“The boom in the production of hemp is an excellent example of the ability of agricultural firms to discover new frontiers,” said Roberto Moncalvo, the president of Coldiretti, Italy’s largest farmers’ association. “We are in the middle of an opportunity for economic and employment growth.”
Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?
This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.

This solution to the crisis affecting Italian farmers can be seen in a small green oasis set in the arid interior of Sicily. Among the clay fields and sheaves of abandoned grain, a sign depicting a seven-point leaf hangs from a gate.
Beyond it is Salvo Scuderi, the president of the agricultural cooperative Colli Erei. The 41-year-old has just finished reaping part of his hemp harvest, which will be used to make pasta, oil and flour. This year, Scuderi and 20 other producers of Rete Canapa Sicilia, an association whose goal is to promote and market the use of hemp in the region, have together produced almost 150 tonnes.
“Hemp saved our business,” he said. “This year we earned 10 times more than what we used to earn with wheat and it has enabled us to hire four workers.”
Wheat yields a profit of €250 (£220) per hectare in today’s market, while hemp can generate net earnings in excess of €2,500 per hectare, according t Rete Canapa Sicilia. And there are many Sicilian farmers who, in order to breathe new life into the dry land and to improve their financial situation have substituted wheat with hemp.
In the countryside around Catenanuova, temperatures can reach the mid-40s in the summer. It is where the Italian car manufacturer Fiat used to test its prototypes under high temperatures, scorching weather would force trains to stopbecause of expanding rails. But it is not the heat alone that has caused the desiccation of the land.
“Years of monocultural wheat cultivation are the problem,” said Dario Giambalvo, professor of agricultural sciences at the University of Palermo. “It has caused soil erosion, and is at risk of soon making the land infertile.”
According to data from Italy’s Council for Agricultural Research and Analysis of Agricultural Economics, land planted with durum wheat decreased by 7.4% in southern Italy last year, and by more than 9% in the north of the country. Overall production decreased by more than 4% during the last year.
This is why the move towards to hemp farming could help, say experts.
“The cultivation of hemp is a valid opportunity for a diversified farming which can be a good solution for the rebirth of abandoned and less fertile land,” said Giambalvo, “The ancient Romans taught us that diversifying crops can help make the land more fertile. I do not know if this will lead to the growth of the agricultural sector, certainly for Italy is a return to the origins.”
Up to the 1940s, Italy was the world’s largest producer of hemp after the Soviet Union. Back then in Italy, more 100,000 hectares were planted with hemp. After the war andthe move towards synthetic fibres, the cultivation of hemp plummeted. The downward trend continued as the campaign against illegal drug use was strengthened. In 1961 the Italian government signed the single convention on narcotic drugs. Despite the international treaty specifically excluding non-pharmaceutical hemp production from the regulations controlling cannabis, it led to further to decline in hemp cultivation in Italy.
This could open the way for the legalisation of plant species with levels of psychoactive substances over 0.2%
“Hemp has been waiting 60 years to reclaim its rightful place,” said Scuderi. “And this could open the way for the legalisation of plant species with levels of psychoactive substances over 0.2% and to develop pharmaceutical experimentation.”
The 2016 law does not prohibit the commercialisation of hemp flowers, a gap that allowed market for the sale of light cannabis to blossom, with more than 500 stores in Italy. The flowers, sealed in bags or jars with names such as Gorilla Blue, Amnesia and Raging Bull, can be collected and used for tisanes or as scents for wardrobes. But the majority of customers simply crumble them, roll them and smoke them. The effects are not as pronounced as most cultivated strains of cannabis, which typically have THC levels of 15-25%, but do offer an immediate sense of relaxation.
According to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, Italy ranks third in Europe for consumption of cannabis.
On his company’s jars of hemp flowers, Scuderi has placed a label: “pizzo-free”. “It means the product is made without giving a cent to the mafia,” he said. “We launched a clear message: producing cannabis doesn’t mean just regenerating the land; it is also a way to weaken the mafia, which for decades has continued uninhibited in its quest to control the criminal business of drugs trafficking, and to give back to the farmers what the bosses had taken away from them.”

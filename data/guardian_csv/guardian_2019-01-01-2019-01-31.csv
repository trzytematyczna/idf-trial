being lean green and efficient means renewable energy, longer lasting products, no pointless building contracts, merged supply chains, pooled demand, recycled products, mass automation, shared services etc etc. All this would lead to the biggest Co2 savings one can think of but its scoffed at because of the huge unemployment that would ensue. green energy is far too efficient to employ the numbers that fossil fuel employ since fossil fuels have to be discovered, mined, transported, refined and much more.
The biggest antidote to Climate change is recession (less jobs), therefore the biggest driver is the opposite (economic activity i.e. jobs).

(But I am always open to persuasion.) I have taken a rather analytical stance on this.
Well, I suspect what you say is because the environmental movement grew world wide from movements that sprang up to protect landscape, wildlife and areas of scenic significance from commercial exploitation. Sierra Club etc.So there is a natural synergy between them and labour movements committed to protecting rights of workers from commercial exploitation. Trade unions etc.In both cases it is collective action for collective benefit.
Then along come post-modernist theories of the identity of the individual where the ills of the world were blamed on social dynamics, (I have studied post-modernism formally). The focus shifted to became about the personal experience of the individual.Don't get me wrong. These theories have done a huge amount to remove discrimination based on identity. And we are the better for it.
But, a couple decades ago it went tribal and morfed into a new type of class war built around the tropes of theoretical models. And more recently, like all class warfare, it has been about the exercise of, and disputation of - power. Power between self identifying identityists and those they blame for the ills of society. By the very nature of its focus of the impact on the individual, it has splintered into more and more narrowly defined identities.
Neoliberalism focuses on the individual. It claims that in maximising the opportunities of the individual, society gains overall. Identityism makes the same claim. That in maximising the rights of the individual, society gains overall. Despite being at loggerheads, identityists and conservatives are both pursuing the cause of the rights of the individual.Neither are fighting for the collective rights of society. Both are battling for the power of groups within society.Both claim personal freedom is paramount above collective social laws where those laws inhibit the behaviour of individuals.
Now you don't have to be Albert Einstein to see how the aims of the identity movement can and do conflict with the collective aims of the environmental movement which seeks overarching principles and laws for the protection of the environment that inevitably limit the freedom of the individual. (Such as restricted access or commercial activity.)
Environmentalism seeks to limit the power of exploiters of nature.The collective good.Identityism seeks to limit the power of exploiters of minorities.The individual good.So it is not unexpected that they both end up on the left.
But, it is an uneasy alliance because of a fundamental dichotomy of purpose.
We are witnessing The Australian Greens Party ripping itself apart.And I believe that fundamental dichotomy of purpose is at the heart of its problems.

Economics, What's the cost if we do nothing to slowdown Climate Change?
BQEND
Just looking at the IPCC SR1.5:
“Balancing of the costs and benefits of mitigation is challenging because estimating the value of climate change damages depends on multiple parameters whose appropriate values have been debated for decades (for example, the appropriate value of the discount rate) or that are very difficult to quantify (for example,the value of non-market impacts; the economic effects of losses in ecosystem services; and the potential for adaptation, which is dependent on the rate and timing of climate change and on the socioeconomic content).”
The best estimate of cumulative discounted damages due to 1.5C of warming by 2100 amounts to $54tn, the report says, rising to $69tn for 2C.
https://www.carbonbrief.org/in-depth-qa-ipccs-special-report-on-climate-change-at-one-point-five-c
And from the Stern Review, 2006:
Using the results from formal economic models, the Review estimates that if we don’t act, the overall costs and risks of climate change will be equivalent to losing at least 5% of global GDP each year, now and forever. If a wider range of risks and impacts is taken into account, the estimates of damage could rise to 20% of GDP or more. In contrast, the costs of action – reducing greenhouse gas emissions to avoid the worst impacts of climate change – can be limited to around 1% of global GDP each year.

Regardless of the fact that corporations have comparatively vast resources, individuals purchase much of their product. Lowering consumption of fossil fuel derived products on a large scale will damage the corporate profits of those giants, at some point they will be forced to change or be swallowed by the debt they will undoubtedly accrue in an effort to continue their operations. I have no doubt that the amount individuals can do as a collective is substantial even with the restrictions placed on our actions by the current fossil fuel driven infrastructure. Here are just a couple of actions that would be substantial:
1. Don't buy an SUV, buy a reasonably sized vehicle that will fulfil your general needs (make sure you understand what those are). Purchase a PHEV or EV.
2. Install water saving filters that reduce flow. 1.9l/minute seem plenty for the bathroom and 4l/minute is more than enough for the kitchen with modern techniques. For the shower, anything with 6l/minute should be enough as long as the quality is good. This here will lower your water related energy consumption by 3-10x depending on what equipment was used before and is very cheap to do. In my residence, I have calculated that we could collectively avoid 10000kWh or more of fossil fuel consumption with this change which is close to 3000kg of CO2 while also reducing our bills by about 10% on average. Assuming fossil fuels are consumed for heating water, it's the easiest and cheapest option to improve the situation and does not result in any comfort loss from my experience, in my case it has improved comfort.

This is true, although political pressure can only be generated if enough individuals act in ways that indicate they care about the environment.
The only thing that will solve the problem of global warming is action on a planetary scale, which can only happen if governments change the rules of the game, to shift our economies away from fossil fuels and towards renewables.
But governments will only do that if they are constantly reminded that people care, and that has to be done by many individuals acting together.

GHGs contributed a global mean surface warming likely to be between 0.5°C and 1.3°C over the period 1951–2010, with the contributions from other anthropogenic forcings likely to be between –0.6°C and 0.1°C, from natural forcings likely to be between –0.1°C and 0.1°C, and from internal variability likely to be between –0.1°C and 0.1°C. Together these assessed contributions are consistent with the observed warming of approximately 0.6°C over this period. {10.3.1, Figure 10.5}

Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems. Limiting climate change would require substantial and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions which, together with adaptation, can limit climate change risks.

It threatens our environment, probably irreversibly, to the extent that large areas of the globe, including many places with significant populations, will become uninhabitable, either below sea level or too hot.
There are far less actions that actually specifically do anything about climate change and that is actually by far the most serious threat. Things like the the price of electricity or even the entire business economy before that makes no sens at all. 
Even if you only count the cost in dollars and ignore the intangible factors, the cost makes any other economic fiddling just that, fiddling at the edges. Think of the cost every time a cyclone flattens coastal towns or fire a rages across the country. Think of the cost of massive crop failures and the resulting food shortages. Think about famine induced migration in the millions, and the wars that will probably cause. Any part of that represents an economic impact far greater than fiddling with the economy by waving a big stick at energy vendors.
Yes we can and should worry about recycling and so on so long as it does not distract us from getting with doing something about global warming.

Clearly you have no idea what you're talking about.
China's official COP 21 policy is to do whatever it likes with emissions until 2030 and and at that point decide whether it does anything at all. The US, in the meantime, has
already reduced its emissions through the use of unconventional gas reserves.
Here's a quote from the International Energy Agency: ""The biggest drop (in 2016) came from the United States, where carbon dioxide emissions fell 3%, or 160 million tonnes, while the economy grew by 1.6%. Emissions in the United States last year were at their lowest level since 1992, a period during which the economy grew by 80%."" Facts are awkward things, huh?

If you make a statement like this without qualifying it with the circumstances under which the statement holds true then clearly you do not know what you are talking about. Of course renewables are cheaper - they have no fuel costs - but that's only at the marginal cost of production when they can be produced. However, it does not address the issue of generation when there is no sun/wind available or the fact that exisiting inverter technology cannot set the network frequency or the fact that renewables need massive storage facilities for firming to the same level of reliability and so on. These inconvenient facts also make renewables very expensive under many circumstances.

School children going on strike demanding climate action provide a shining example of disruptive, urgent, agenda-setting activism. They acted like their lives depend on it – we all should.
BQENDWe really should. And as adults we are responsible for the system which has done this to us. And as responsible adults we
must understand the intimate details of the system, to isolate precisely which bits are at fault, and actually fix the flaws, rather than merely paper over them between wars.
It is within your power if it is within the bounds of your intent.
1. As the basis for economy, the Earth is all we have. All wealth must come from it, and ultimately be returned, from your next breath, to a wind farm to a vortex sword in WoW. Digital wealth is still dependent on the physical; requiring land, people and energy.
2. Land(aka nature), Wealth(what you want/need) and Money(sharing mechanism) are three entirely different categories of ""thing"", as your baby could undoubtedly attest. Capitalism says that they are all forms of capital. This is the source of the distortion, the heist of the millennium, and the huge thorn in Earths paw.
3. Wages are created by intelligently trained and employed people producing needed goods and services and available in the increased value of work-products, after work is done. The enormous production surplus achieved through division of labour, technology and other productivity multipliers underpin the value of the currency, always worth what you can buy with it.
Capitalism says wages are drawn from capital. In a barely-efficient world the only limit to production is availability of working citizens. Unemployment is not only unjust, it is also inefficient and completely unnecessary, not a natural human state at all.
So where did capitalism come from and why has it destroyed the Earth?
When the above creed was first written down by an unknown journalist in 1879 in then-remote San Francisco, Henry George, in the legendary Progress and Poverty. He sparked a global movement, including catalysing formation of Australian Labour. George was opposed to Marx's uncompromising revolution, preferring a social evolutionary approach, combining the best of individualism and collectivism based on the natural economy of the Earth and human desire/need.
While Marx was left to rearrange his manuscripts and even foment revolution on the outskirts of Europe, Henry George's thesis of a single tax on commercial land value to singularly fund civilisation gravely threatened established global power elites.
George had set out to discover the true cause of recessions, and why the worst poverty always seemed to accompany the most progress. Succeeding spectacularly, Progress and Poverty promised salvation in this life, not the next, and remains the only published work in history to outsell the Bible, globally, in a single year. Which it did for twenty consecutive years.
From Progress and Poverty chapter 17: ""The Problem Explained"":
BQSTART
Three things unite in production: land, labor, and capital. Three parties divide the output: landowner, laborer, and capitalist. If the laborer and capitalist get no more as production increases, it is a necessary inference that the landowner takes the gain. 
The facts agree with this inference. Neither wages nor interest keep step with material progress. Yet rising rents and land values invariably accompany advancement. Indeed, they are the mark of progress! Increasing rent explains why wages and interest do not increase. The same cause that gives more to the land owner also denies it to the laborer and capitalist. 
..In short, the value of land depends entirely on the power that ownership gives to appropriate the wealth created by labor. Land value always increases at the expense of labor. The reason greater productive power does not increase wages is because it increases the value of land. Rent swallows up the whole gain.
 That is why poverty accompanies progress.
BQEND
So he was stopped. Since they could not refute his arguments, Land Barons, Industrialists and Bankers literally bought entire economics departments to corrupt the language to steal the very value of civilisation itself; Oil magnate John. D. Rockefeller created the Chicago school of Poison, Railroad Tycoon Ely Stanford started Stanford university, Banker J.P. Morgan founded Columbia.
In the process of so doing, they emasculated the discipline of economics, stripped dignity from labour and set in motion a planet-wrecking doctrine. Neo-Classical economics aka neoliberalism aka capitalism was born, for the benefit of rent-takers and to the catastrophic detriment of the working-citizen and the living world upon which s/he depends.

Never knock the little person’s attempts to make a difference with individual life choices to try and limit the damage we do collectively to our planet.
It is only when we start thinking about the little things – such as the food we should buy (how does its production affect the planet?) and the products we buy (do we need to throw-away and replace endlessly?) – that the bigger issues come into focus too.

Damn right, given that the current fossil fuel industry owners of the ship still expect to dock in New York in spite of just entering the iceberg field. And far from changing course, they continue to order their puppet governments around the world (captain and crew) to increase speed. 
Seriously we don't really understand the degree to which our political systems are in hock to big business and the fossil fuel industry in particular. Thinking that using a few less plastic bags and takeaway coffee cups will save the world is silly but that's nothing to how naive we are to imagine that anything is going to change without a global political revolution in which banking, finance, industry and business are all brought firmly to heal quick smart.
A vote for a conservative, climate-denying, pro-business government in the crucial years remaining to us dooms us all. In other words we will have to have Corbyn, Shorten, Sanders, whatever remains of the Left in Europe and anyone but Putin (all the Russian progressives are in jail or dead) in power at the same time if we are going to have a chance of making this work.

Climate change is being driven by the consumerism that Capitalists and their governments promote. As a consequence of the harm being done to our planetary home in order to feed the demands of consumerism, I foresee a miserable future for our young as they grow up, one of increasing dearth and want, of ever more frequent, violent conflict for possession or control of ever more scarce natural resources, such as arable land, and water. I foresee the pressure on our own western civilisation reaching breaking point, as entire nations land up on our shores, driven here by the advance of desert and drought in their lands. I foresee the cost of energy rising astronomically, and (so that the rich need suffer no hurt via tax increases), fewer and fewer of us will have access to state, or affordable, healthcare, or state funded old age retirements, or indeed, any sort of material security at all.I foresee tens, then hundreds of thousands of workers rendered forever unemployed, as capitalist corporations turn increasingly to automation to cut production overheads. Only the adoption by the government of a universal living income (ULI) can address the consequences of such an inevitable development.

Perhaps the UK's Labour party will prove me wrong when I wrote above: ""Nor do I see our present major political parties denouncing consumerism for what it is: a planetary blight.""Labour's shadow Treasury Secretary, Clive Lewis, said that politicians must persuade consumers to make dramatic lifestyle changes if devastating climate change and mass extinctions are to be averted. From cutting back on red meat to taking fewer flights, the Norwich South MP said the public must face up to “real, stark choices” in the years ahead.“If you want your children and grandchildren to avoid food shortages, to avoid power shortages, to avoid biological degradation, biodiversity loss – if you actually want a planet that’s inhabitable – then we need to make some choices together, now, and some of them are about quite dramatic changes to how we live,” Clive Lewis (the UK's Labour party shadow Treasury Secretary) said in an interview with the Guardian.
I agree with Clive Lewis: “Leadership and punching above your weight doesn’t necessarily always have to mean gunboat diplomacy and bombing other countries into the stone age. It can actually mean leading by example, and helping other countries.”If Britain were to lead in radically transforming our consumer based economy, then other countries may within a few years follow.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1546421761000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'100124009', u'id': u'124224471', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'AlexanderGH', u'text': u'Some people would be nervous of uncontrolled immigration when sub-Saharan Africa and southern Europe become uninhabitable.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1546421542000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'4503360', u'in_reply_to': u'124222246', u'id': u'124224355', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'AlexanderGH', u'text': u'It doesn't help that environmentalism is associated with the left, when it should be seen as conservative stewardship.Our only environmental party puts a lot of people off with its focus on gender and migration.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1546421404000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'4503360', u'in_reply_to': u'124222536', u'id': u'124224273', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Hemptheworld', u'text': u'Only around 90 or so fossil fuel corporations are producing 75% of alk carbon emissions .The public are getting played like a fiddle.', u'recommendation_count': u'2', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1546421172000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'18277923', u'id': u'124224158', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'drprl', u'text': u'BQSTART

We must act collectively | Emily Mulligan,article,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/02/one-persons-recycling-wont-stop-climate-change-in-itself-we-must-act-collectively,0,"Climate change is happening now and it’s happening faster and much worse than predicted. It’s threatening to the world we know and everything in it. It’s already killing people. This is beyond doubt or argument.
We have just years to change course. If we manage it, we could save the world, at least the one we recognise. Realistically, the prognosis at the moment is that we won’t manage to steer the ship around in time.
So why have we, as people with everything to lose, not acted sooner?
We have a global climate agreement and we know what needs to happen. This is a problem we know how to solve. But we aren’t acting with anywhere close to the urgency fit for the situation. Renewable energy is cheaper than the bad stuff anyway. Australia is a rich country with the means and the smarts to take on big challenges, so why aren’t we doing it? What will it take to get people to respond in a fitting way?
It’s not surprising that in response to a problem this huge, this existential, people seek out something they can do, from using a keep cup to being fastidious with the recycling. It makes us feel better, it gives us something tangible to do, it stops us from despairing. But we need to admit that even if every plastic bottle and tin can ever produced was recycled, we’d still be on track for catastrophic climate change. No matter how many plastic straws are declined or ocean plastic turned into shoes, every indication points to our children never knowing coral reefs, the Arctic melting and the seas rising.
It is liberalism’s most dangerous lie that an individual’s action can solve problems of this scale.
So what should we be doing?
Stop Adani. Do not let that mine go ahead. My baby who has not figured out that a triangle block goes through the triangle hole could probably figure this one out. We need less pollution in order to keep the world’s ecosystems functional. Digging more new coal to burn is bad maths. We cannot let new coalmines happen. Join a local action group, meet your MP, flick some cash to the people working on this full-time, lock yourself to a bulldozer – this one is really important and there’s a movement set up ready for people to join in and get involved.
More important than any one person’s composting is government policy. Shortly after Australia signed the Paris agreement, Queensland relaxed its land-clearing laws, wiping out any reduction in our pollution that we had committed to in front of the world.
We have a coal-smooching, wilfully ignorant prime minister and a government refusing to take on any climate leadership because it doesn’t fit in with their ideology. Conservatives began the conservation movement, but this current crop of conservative politicians are trying to keep coal plants like Liddell open that even the coal companies want closed. 
Australia does not have an energy policy. This is not due to lack of knowledge or understanding. It’s due to lack of leadership and the influence of people who stand to make a buck now and will probably not be alive to see the worst of catastrophic climate change.
That’s not something you can reason with. They’re simply not up to the job.
So people need to act collectively. The first step is getting involved in this year’s election, when governments are most susceptible to influence. The most important thing we can do is try and influence government decisions. We urgently need to stem the flow of climate pollution into the atmosphere and absorb the pollution already out there on a scale that individuals can’t muster.
When we sort our waste in our homes or remember our reusable shopping bags it’s helpful, but in itself it is not up to the challenge of stopping climate change. If we are going to respond to the problem at the scale and urgency that reality demands, we need to do more. School children going on strike demanding climate action provide a shining example of disruptive, urgent, agenda-setting activism. They acted like their lives depend on it – we all should.

Now, with a federal election looming, he is gambling his parliamentary majority and political future on them.
When Canadians cast their votes next October, they will do so amid standard electoral issues: jobs, the economy and foreign policy. But in a country largely dependent on resource extraction, a pair of politically fractious additions have risen to the top: carbon taxes and pipelines.
“The good news for the prime minister is that when you ask Canadians who they think would make the best prime minister, he still has a comfortable advantage over Conservative leader Andrew Scheer,” said Nik Nanos, a Canadian pollster. “The bad news is that leading up to the next federal election right now, it’s basically a coin toss between the Liberals and Conservatives.”
Canadians have shown an increasing concern for the environment, but in a country largely dependent on resource extraction, the results are often messy.
Earlier in the year, as part of its pan-Canadian climate change strategy, the federal government required all provinces have a minimum level of carbon pricing. For those that fail to do so, the government will implement its own carbon tax, set to begin in July 2019. Already, the levy has fired up Trudeau’s political opponents – at both the provincial and federal level.
But the prime minister had been forced to fend off barbs from critics – including the left-of-centre New Democratic party and Indigenous communities, that any environmental goodwill he might have earned through his carbon tax has been sullied by the support for – and subsequent nationalisation of – an oil pipeline. “The only true test of a climate change plan, after all, is whether carbon is going up or down,” said the NDP leader, Jagmeet Singh, in a statement about his frustrations with the Trans Mountain Pipeline, which runs from Alberta to the British Columbia coast.
The result for Trudeau is a tricky path forward as he heads off attacks that he has done too little on the environment – or too much.
“Trudeau has moved from having an environment that was friendly and pliant to one that is more combative and hostile,” said Nanos, pointing to a string of shifts to Conservative – or right-of-centre – provincial governments across the country since Trudeau was elected in 2015. Doug Ford, Ontario’s premier, has repeatedly called carbon pricing “the worst tax ever” and at least five provinces have banded together to fight the tax in the courts, a battle legal experts believe they will lose.
Along with their provincial counterparts, the federal Conservatives have pledged to repeal any carbon taxes, with Scheer dismissing the policy as an “election gimmick”. This fight comes amid reports that Canada is not on pace to meet its 2030 climate goals.
“The opposition or the politicians will convince people that the carbon price is hurting them, even though that’s a lie,” said Mark Jaccard, professor of sustainable energy at Simon Fraser University.
Jaccard, who has also served as a policy analyst, has previously warned respective governments that carbon taxes – while effective at reducing emissions – are politically difficult to sell and often not as effective as other policy options. He points out that the biggest emissions reductions in Canada came from the Ontario government’s closure of coal plants. The recent plan to close all of Canada’s coal plants by 2029 will have a far greater impact than a carbon tax – yet the tax will probably remain at the centre of the discussion.
The tax could end up being particularly appealing from an electoral standpoint, said Nelson Wiseman, a professor of political science at the University of Toronto. All proceeds from the levy will be remitted back to households in the form of a cheque, the first of which will arrive in July – a date Wiseman suspects will be close enough to the election that people will take notice.
But Wiseman, who has studied the country’s elections for generations, cautions: “We’re still a long way off. And things can change on a dime in politics.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/02/justin-trudeau-environmental-record-canada-election-year

She will say on Friday that a meat tax in the UK could be offset for more sustainable meat producers, such as organic livestock farmers, through more money for sustainable agriculture schemes.
Lucas will tell the Oxford Farming Conference, an annual gathering of farmers from across the UK, that the country must prioritise “more humane and human-scale methods of livestock farming, together with support for farmers to transition to less livestock”.
“If the world’s diet doesn’t change, we simply can’t avoid the worst effects of climate change,” Lucas will say, in a stark warning timed to coincide with the push for people to adopt a vegan diet for a month, the “Veganuary” movement.
In a call likely to be controversial, she will say: “Better manure management and careful selection of feed can both help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but – at the risk of incurring the wrath of the energy secretary, who said recently that encouraging people to eat less meat would be the worst sort of nanny state ever – we need serious consideration of measures like a meat tax.”
She said that it would take “more than motivated consumers to bring about sustainability” in agriculture. Globally, livestock rearing is estimated to be responsible for about 15% of greenhouse gas emissions.
Lucas has tabled a parliamentary motion to require farming to be net zero in emissions as quickly as possible, which would involve ways to reduce fertiliser use and increase the amount of organic matter in the nation’s soils, both issues that Michael Gove, the environment secretary, also espouses.
She said: “We need to bring the whole food chain into the circle of responsibility, not leaving farmers to work on their own, together with clear signals that society will play its part in funding this transition through a new agriculture policy.”
But the notion of Veganuary has come under attack from some at the conference, with the National Sheep Association (NSA) claiming the movement, which encourages people to give up animal products for the month and consider permanent changes to their diet for health and environmental reasons, was part of a “campaign against livestock farming”.
Phil Stocker, chief executive of the NSA, defended British sheep farming as working to improve the environment rather than causing damage to it. “Our concern is that our unique, grass-based method of sheep production in Britain is hidden within more global and general statistics,” he said.
He contrasted the UK’s sheep farming, which includes many upland areas unsuitable for other forms of agriculture and is one of the least intensive forms of livestock farming, with the megafarms and feedlots that characterise beef, pork and poultry production in many parts of the world, chiefly the US but increasingly being brought to the UK.
“We are seeing criticisms from welfare campaigners, rewilders, climate change campaigners and health campaigners – but all these are connected and ignore the fact that UK sheep farming works very much in harmony with our environment, our landscapes and our human ecology, creating a countryside the majority of the public love and producing a food product that is healthy and nutritious within a balanced diet,” he said.
Stocker said he opposed a meat tax: “The right meat, consumed sensibly, should be incentivised and not taxed. Sheep production is not damaging to the environment or to health – sheep mainly eat grass and grass is part of a complex and natural cycling of carbon, with soil storing carbon in organic matter.
“Any meat tax would be likely to affect all meat production and consumption – and there are many different forms of meat production. A meat tax would end up putting further pressure on primary producers – in the case of sheep this would impact on the profitability of many small family farms, yet these are highly desirable and deliver a host of economic, social and environmental goods.”
Earlier Gove told the conference that advances in synthetic biology meant that in the future we would be able to create traditional farming products such as meat, milk or eggs in laboratories, adding that “the potential for Britain to lead in this revolution is huge”.
But asked whether the UK should be looking into increasing its production of “fake meat”, the National Farmers Union president, Minette Batters, said: “When you have one of the very few areas in the world where you have the right climate for producing food, that surely is what you should be doing.”
She added that “95% of what we eat is produced in soil, it’s nutrient dense and that is why it is such a valuable food. Why would you want to be stepping back from that?”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/04/caroline-lucas-green-mp-meat-tax-oxford-farmers-conference-prioritise-sustainability

The resulting images reveal a stark depiction of how climate change has taken its toll on the glaciated landscape.
For a forthcoming exhibition on Ruskin and Turner, Emma Stibbon was commissioned to go to Chamonix and record the glaciers around Mont Blanc where, in the early 1800s, Turner painted sublime watercolours that inspired Ruskin to embark on his Alpine tours decades later, photographing and drawing awe-inspiring glaciers such as the Mer de Glace.
In June, the same month in which Ruskin produced his daguerreotypes (early photographs) of the Mer de Glace more than 160 years ago, Stibbon found his viewpoint for her own images, using another early photographic process, cyanotype. While Turner and Ruskin observed the drama of a sea of ice almost at the level they stood, Stibbon looked down into an exposed deep valley with “a dark moraine-covered floor, almost completely devoid of ice”. She saID: “It’s unrecognisable.”
Her commission forms part of the Ruskin, Turner &amp; the Storm Cloud, exhibition opening at the York Art Gallery in March and Abbot Hall, Kendal, in July. It is part of a worldwide programme of exhibitions, conferences and publications to mark the 200th birthday of Ruskin, a writer, artist and social reformer whose achievements are sometimes eclipsed by scandals, including his ill-fated, unconsummated marriage to Effie Gray and a libel action brought by painter James McNeill Whistler. “When we think of the Alps,” said Stibbon, “we think of iconic white peaks. By the end of this century, there probably won’t be any snow.”
She added that Ruskin was ahead of his time in realising “the Industrial Revolution was affecting air quality and that air pollution was linked to the use of coal. He could see that glaciers move and I think he suspected that there was some [ice] recession, which would have been starting around that period in the 1850s.”
Suzanne Fagence Cooper, research curator at York Art Gallery and author of a new book, To See Clearly: Why Ruskin Matters, said Stibbon’s images show the glacier retreat “very clearly”, and capture a “sense of real loss”.
While Ruskin events extend to Japan and America, in the UK there is a cinema screening, from 22 February, of Effie Gray – the 2014 film written by Emma Thompson – and the exhibition, John Ruskin: The Power of Seeing, from 26 January at Two Temple Place, London. It features more than 190 exhibits revealing how Ruskin’s influence is still felt.
Robert Hewison, author of the recently published Ruskin and His Contemporaries, said: “Ruskin was, by the end of his life, treated as a kind of prophet – although not in his own country – for predicting both economic and ecological deterioration. Climate change appears to show that he was right.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jan/06/climate-change-ravages-turner-majestic-glaciers-ruskin--alps-emma-stibbon-exhibition

Nuclear generation is only fairly clean if you only look at the power station. If you include the whole process, from mine to Windscale, then it is anything but clean. For example, they still have tanks full of highly radioactive waste to deal with.
BQEND
The Windscale piles were primitive reactors built and operated for the sole purpose of producing weapons grade plutonium. They had nothing to do with nuclear power. The first pile was operational in 1950. That's almost 70 years ago. What's relevant is nuclear power today.
As for the Sellafield pools, they are also very much legacy engineering and technology that will never be used again. The spent fuel pools associated with light water power reactors are absolutely nothing like the Sellafield pools. The radioactive materials are locked away in the fuel rods NOT dissolved in the water or lying in a radioactive sludge on the bottom. You could safely dip your legs into the water in SFPs on swim on the surface. The water is clean. 
Having said that, even in a legacy engineering context, the waste in the Sellafield pools is isolated from the environment in complete contrast to gas combustion that just dumps the waste into the atmosphere. The Sellafield pools obviously must be dealt with, and there are engineering challenges, but they are not actually harming humans or the broader environment.

This is a false equivalence: there are not equal or even approximately equal evidence-based arguments « on both sides ». Indeed there aren’t even « both sides »: this is not a debating society.

It looked at how technology uptake over the last century has accelerated more and more, comparing the slow uptake of the telephone to the exponential rise of the smartphone.I realise an EV is a big ticket item and that could hold it back.
But then you see how ICE sales are dropping all over the UK, Europe and the US (although big auto there tells us that people are just buying more SUV/pickups instead of sedans).Diesel has lost a lot of it's shine, governments are committing to only EV sales by 2030/40. So it's quite possible that a large % of potential buyers are thinking to hang on until EV becomes more affordable.
This may come as a surprise, but the study projects a cross-over of ICE sales, EV sales and oil production in around 5 years time! Still a lot of ICE sales but the graph was clearly dropping. When you consider that ICE consumes a large % of oil production, it makes sense that oil will drop to.

For the 800,000 years for which we have records, average global CO2 levels fluctuated between about 170 ppm and 280 ppm. Once humans started to burn fossil fuels in the industrial era, things changed rapidly.
BQEND
Last June it was recorded at 411 ppm much of this goes in to the oceans which you might think is a good thing unfortunately the oceans warm up and become more acidic the first visible effects of this is the bleaching and dying off of coral as the temperature is too warm for them to live. Coral is an important resource for many other species as a place to live and for food. As the oceans become more acidic other animals will die crashing populations all of the way up the food chain to the apex predators.

Clever, efficient, but disingenuous - and completely beside the point.
Fossil is simply not sustainable, in any sense. Period. 
Apart from the damage from climate change, already showing, millions of people suffer directly from the pollution. Plastic is everywhere, including in our bodies. Huge areas of land and water are destroyed. Distribution costs enormous sums (and environmental costs) because energy is not harvested locally. There is nothing smart, cheap, efficient or sustainable with oil and coal. 
Some of the more progressive companies in oil/fossil understand this, but far too many just cling to their money streams - no matter the cost.
But, change must and will come. Maybe it's been slowed down for some years, while shady interests have been remarkably successful at using lies and algorithms to muddy perceptions, and create divisions among us.

She has contributed to more than 125 scientific papers and won numerous prizes for her science communication work. In 2018 she was a contributor to the US National Climate Assessment and was awarded the Stephen H Schneider award for outstanding climate science communication.
In 2018, we have seen forest fires in the Arctic circle; record high temperatures in parts of Australia, Africa and the US; floods in India; and devastating droughts in South Africa and Argentina. Is this a turning point? This year has hit home how climate change loads the dice against us by taking naturally occurring weather events and amplifying them. We now have attribution studies that show how much more likely or stronger extreme weather events have become as a result of human emissions. For example, wildfires in the western US now burn nearly twice the area they would without climate change, and almost 40% more rain fell during Hurricane Harvey than would have otherwise. So we are really feeling the impacts and know how much humanity is responsible.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its 1.5C report in October. A month later, the US federal government’s climate assessment – to which you contributed – came out. How did these two massive studies move our understanding along? These assessments are important because there is a Schrödinger’s Cat element to studying climate impacts. The act of observing affects the outcome. If people aren’t aware of what is happening, why would anyone change? Assessments like these provide us with a vision of the future if we continue on our current pathway, and by doing so they address the most widespread and dangerous myth that the largest number of us have bought into: not that the science isn’t real, but rather that climate change doesn’t matter to me personally.
Compared to past studies, how much media attention did these reports receive?There was significant coverage but a lot of media survive by generating controversy so they bring on opposing voices rather than explaining the scientific facts. Climate change shouldn’t be fodder for commentators who represent the interests of the fossil fuel industry by muddying the science. As a human and a scientist, this focus on controversy is frustrating. A thermometer is not liberal or conservative.
Fossil fuels have brought us many benefits ... but the solution to our current crisis is to stop using them. That is scary
Are there any signs that public opinion is shifting in the US and elsewhere? We haven’t yet reached the tipping point to motivate sufficient action. But there has been a change. Ten years ago, few people felt personally affected by climate change. It seemed very distant. Today, most people can point to a specific way climate affects their daily lives. This is important because the three key steps to action are accepting that climate change is real, recognising it affects us, and being motivated to do something to fix it. Opinion polls in the US show 70% of people agree the climate is changing, but a majority still say it won’t affect them.
Trump was dismissive of these reports and has repeatedly tried to deny any link between climate change and extreme weather. What are the politics behind this denial? It’s a vicious cycle. The more doom-filled reports the scientists release, the stronger the pushback from politicians whose power, ideology and funding depends on maintaining the status quo, and who are supported by those who fear the solutions to climate change more than they fear its impacts. Opposition to climate change is a symptom of a society that is politically polarised between those who cling to the past and those who recognise the need for a better future. Fossil fuels have brought us many benefits – and I’m grateful for their contribution to my life – but the solution to our current crisis is to stop using them. That change can be scary, especially for those with most to lose financially from this shift. If you feel threatened, the instinctive reaction is to push back.
Progress of sorts was made at the UN climate talks in Poland, though many scientists say global society is not moving fast enough. What is your take? Progress was made in Poland as the world agreed on a rule book to implement the Paris agreement. The agreement is like a global pot luck in which every nation brings something different to the party. For some it’s soil conservation, for another wind power or carbon pricing. Poland gave us an agreed common standard on how to measure these contributions. That was progress. As scientists, we are like physicians for the planet who have been monitoring its rising fever for 80 years. We know that our lifestyle, specifically our dependence on fossil fuels is the cause of a problem that is rapidly becoming serious and in some cases even dangerous. So when we see the world dragging its heels and carbon emissions continuing to grow, we become concerned, anxious, and even frustrated. We know we aren’t changing fast enough.
On current trends, if you had to give a percentage breakdown of the likelihood of the following three outcomes by 2100, what would you give: a) keeping to 1.5C; b) keeping to 2C; c) rising above 3C; and d) overshooting 4C?I’d put my money on a gradual bend away from a higher scenario, which is where we are now, until accumulating and worsening climate disasters eventually lead to a collective “oh shit!” moment, when people finally realise climate impacts do pose a far greater threat than the solutions. At that point, I would hope the world would suddenly ramp up its carbon reduction to the scale of a Manhattan Project or a moon race and we would finally be able to make serious progress. The multitrillion-dollar question is simply when that tipping point in opinion will come, and whether it will be too late for civilisation as we know it. I hope with all my heart that we stay under 1.5C, but my cynical brain says 3C. Perhaps the reality will be somewhere between my head and my heart at 2C.
What is the best way out of the climate crisis? What policies would make a difference? The most important thing is to accelerate the realisation that we have to act. This means connecting the dots to show that the impacts are not distant any more: they are here and they affect our lives. It also means talking about solutions. The technology and knowledge are there. The economics already make sense. In Texas, where I live, the biggest military base, Fort Hood, switched last year to renewables because they were cheaper than natural gas. And finally, it means weaning ourselves off fossil fuels, which is challenged by the fact that the majority of the world’s richest companies have made their money from the fossil fuel economy – so the majority of the wealth and power remains in their hands. 
Are there any climate engineering schemes or trials that have potential? One solution being discussed is the idea of deliberately geoengineering the planet to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and/or cool the planet. I believe it is important to discuss and study these technologies very thoroughly, because implementing some of them, like solar radiation management [spraying particles into the air to simulate a volcanic eruption and block some of the sunlight reaching Earth], is extremely risky. It would be like giving an experimental drug to every human on the planet before it had been tested. I’m more hopeful about smaller scale, less risky geoengineering projects that suck carbon dioxide out of the air, such as those being trialled by Climeworks to turn carbon into stone or fuel: or even massive tree-planting efforts, as in Bhutan. 
What’s the role of global finance? Can money managers, shareholders and multinationals exert pressure and take positive action in ways that short-termist, vote-hungry politicians seem unable to do? Yes! In the world we live in, money speaks loudly. Thanks to the growing divestment movement, we have seen cities, universities and entire countries, in the case of Ireland, withdrawing investments from fossil fuel assets. This isn’t only happening for ethical reasons but for practical ones as well. As clean energy continues to expand, those assets could become stranded. When money talks the world listens.
What are the most positive developments you have seen in the past year in the climate field? I’m asked what gives me hope on a daily basis, and my answer is, I don’t find hope in my science, I find it in people. Over the last few years, the number of people who want to talk about and do something about climate has increased exponentially. Then, there is the unexpected leadership of organisations such as Young Evangelicals for Climate Action, RepublicEN, the Iron and Earth group – young professionals in the oil and construction industries who want to be part of the move from fossil fuels; and the take-up of renewables even in conservative states like Texas, which now gets 20% of its energy from wind and solar power.
Finally, there’s the encouraging news such as solar being the fastest-growing power source around the world, clean energy jobs growing from India to the US, and new technology being developed every year that drops the price and increases the accessibility of fossil fuel alternatives.
This year has also seen the rise of disruptive campaigning, for example Extinction Rebellion in the UK; the student strikes led by Greta Thunberg; and direct action in the US and Canada against oil pipelines. Is there a point when scientists also have to speak out more forcefully? We are moving in that direction. Scientists are not just disembodied brains floating in a glass jar, we are humans who want the same thing every other human wants, a safe place to live on this planet we call home. So while our work must continue to be unbiased and objective, increasingly we are raising our voices, adding to the clear message that climate change is real and humans are responsible, the impacts are serious and we must act now, if we want to avoid the worst of them. 

What are the key political moments in 2019 for climate policy in the US and the world? International talks are important but we should be looking at subnational actors because there is a lot going on at the city and corporate level. Across the US a hundred cities have committed to going 100% clean energy. Companies like Apple have already achieved that goal. In the US there’s a new climate bill with bipartisan sponsors, which is essential for legislation to succeed long-term. 
Are we likely to get any respite from climate change? (Sighs.) Climate change is a long-term trend superimposed over natural variability. There’ll be good and bad years, just like there are for a patient with a long-term illness, but it isn’t going away. To stabilise climate change, we have to eliminate our carbon emissions. And we’re still a long way away from that.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jan/06/katharine-hayhoe-interview-climate-change-scientist-crisis-hope

More than 90% of the heat trapped by humanity’s greenhouse gas emissions has been absorbed by the seas, with just a few per cent heating the air, land and ice caps respectively. The vast amount of energy being added to the oceans drives sea-level rise and enables hurricanes and typhoons to become more intense.
Much of the heat has been stored in the ocean depths but measurements here only began in recent decades and existing estimates of the total heat the oceans have absorbed stretch back only to about 1950. The new work extends that back to 1871. Scientists have said that understanding past changes in ocean heat was critical for predicting the future impact of climate change.
A Guardian calculation found the average heating across that 150-year period was equivalent to about 1.5 Hiroshima-size atomic bombs per second. But the heating has accelerated over that time as carbon emissions have risen, and was now the equivalent of between three and six atomic bombs per second.
“I try not to make this type of calculation, simply because I find it worrisome,” said Prof Laure Zanna, at the University of Oxford, who led the new research. “We usually try to compare the heating to [human] energy use, to make it less scary.”
She added: “But obviously, we are putting a lot of excess energy into the climate system and a lot of that ends up in the ocean,. There is no doubt.” The total heat taken up by the oceans over the past 150 years was about 1,000 times the annual energy use of the entire global population.
The research has been published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and combined measurements of the surface temperature of the ocean since 1871 with computer models of ocean circulation.
Prof Samar Khatiwala, also at the University of Oxford and part of the team, said: “Our approach is akin to ‘painting’ different bits of the ocean surface with dyes of different colours and monitoring how they spread into the interior over time. If we know what the sea surface temperature anomaly was in 1871 in the North Atlantic Ocean we can figure out how much it contributes to the warming in, say, the deep Indian Ocean in 2018.”
Rising sea level has been among the most dangerous long-term impacts of climate change, threatening billions of people living in coastal cities, and estimating future rises is vital in preparing defences. Some of the rise comes from the melting of land-bound ice in Greenland and elsewhere, but another major factor has been the physical expansion of water as it gets warmer.
However, the seas do not warm uniformly as ocean currents transport heat around the world. Reconstructing the amount of heat absorbed by the oceans over the past 150 years is important as it provides a baseline. In the Atlantic, for example, the team found that half the rise seen since 1971 at low and middle latitudes resulted from heat transported into the region by currents.
The new work would help researchers make better predictions of sea-level rise for different regions in the future. “Future changes in ocean transport could have severe consequences for regional sea-level rise and the risk of coastal flooding,” the researchers said. “Understanding ocean heat change and the role of circulation in shaping the patterns of warming remain key to predicting global and regional climate change and sea-level rise.”
Dana Nuccitelli, an environmental scientist who was not involved in the new research, said: “The ocean heating rate has increased as global warming has accelerated, and the value is somewhere between roughly three to six Hiroshima bombs per second in recent decades, depending on which dataset and which timeframe is used. This new study estimates the ocean heating rate at about three Hiroshima bombs per second for the period of 1990 to 2015, which is on the low end of other estimates.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/07/global-warming-of-oceans-equivalent-to-an-atomic-bomb-per-second

On first look, Bald Knob has an unsettling aesthetic: a sparsely populated town, a bygone agricultural zone with toppled silos, old trailers, taxidermy businesses, boarded-up shops and a Waffle House. It’s a narrative cliche to present a rural place below the Mason-Dixon line this way, yet the scenery fits the bill.
I’ve lived in places like these, where a casual observer sees a weathered town and locals just see home. I proceed with caution anyway. I’m also unsettled by news reports of armed white nationalists marching at the capitol building in nearby Little Rock. I know this is how a lot of people experience the rural south – sorting through stereotypes and history as they go, wondering how much of the old south is present in the new.
The 12,900-acre Bald Knob Refuge, which sits about 60 miles north-east of Little Rock, is a blend of both the old and new south. It’s a former rice farm that has grown rice and soybeans in order to provide much-needed habitat and fuel for migratory waterfowl like pintail ducks and snow geese since 1993.
A half-mile into the refuge, the truck ahead of me spooks an unfathomable cloud of waterfowl. Hundreds of thousands of ducks rise from the wetlands, calling and circling. It’s breathtaking to witness. Later, a huge flock of lesser snow geese passes above me. My heart pounds; it’s moving to hear so many wingbeats overhead, to see the formations of a thousand white birds in the blue sky.
Another truck comes by. The man rolls down his truck window and asks, “You OK?”
“Fine,” I tell him, climbing down from the roof of my rental car, and showing him my camera. “Watching birds. You?” I ask even though I can see his rifle in the back.
“Out scouting hunting spots,” he says, flashing a charming smile. “You can get a better view if you take the road ’round that way.” He points me toward a new route, then takes off.
The relationship between hunters and conservation has always surprised me. Yet it’s often imperative to the success of major initiatives in the south, thanks to the influence of the not-for-profit organization Ducks Unlimited, which has a worldwide membership of 700,000 and has helped conserve over 13m acres of habitat. There are more than 34 million sportsmen and women in the United States.
Sportsmen and traditional environmentalists aren’t always mutually exclusive, or easy co-conspirators. But, there is a critical need for information to flow between those on the ground and those in policy. In order to address the urgent realities of climate change, traditional environmentalists must continue to find ways to communicate and partner with non-traditional audiences: hunters, big agriculture, fishermen, corporations and loggers.
I wanted to talk to people in the south who already work on these frontlines, and are able to build bridges between seemingly disparate audiences.
Charlie Phillips, clammer and entrepreneur, is one of those men who’s lived several lives, as a fishmonger, horse trader and shrimper.
“I’m one of those rare Republicans that believe that if you don’t take care of your environment, your environment can’t take care of you,” he says. Phillips, the owner of Sapelo Sea Farms in Georgia, makes his living growing clams, so water quality is crucial to him, which is why he serves on boards and tries to help scientists and fishermen find common ground.
He’s frank about climate change and how it’s affecting his industry. He talks about the onset of “king tides”, and fish stock moving north as waters warm. He was working on the back of a shrimp boat in 1968 when Hurricane Camille hit. “I saw the big ships washed up on shore,” he tells me. “I’ve seen what big hurricanes can do. They’re worse now. Things aren’t what they used to be.”
“Listen,” he says. “Fishermen just want to be able to catch what they want to catch and be left alone.”
He says working fishermen end up not trusting scientists because the scientific reports don’t match up with what they witness firsthand on the water every day. Reports from scientists, he says, “feel three or four years behind what the fishermen see”. He thinks it’s crucial for fishermen and scientists to interact and learn more from each other. “We’ve gotten really good at throwing rocks at each other,” he tells me. “But we need to give up on throwing rocks. It’s not conducive to fixing problems.”
Phillips is focused on what he cares most about: water. He’s evangelical about it. “It affects everything,” he says. “Wildlife, business, eco-tourism.” He bought his father’s restaurant, the Fish Dock, and uses the menus to educate customers about local water testing results. “I took poetic license,” he tells me, laughing. “I don’t use the word ‘fecal’, just ‘water quality’.”
The following day I talk with Dr Zakiya Leggett, a forester and professor at North Carolina State University whose research focuses on carbon sequestration and soil ecology. She talks about her empathy for freshmen, many of whom tell her at the beginning of her class through a pre-course survey that they don’t believe in climate change. They tell her she shouldn’t try to change their minds.
“We have to remember,” she says, her tone compassionate, “especially if these students are coming fresh from home, that they haven’t had time to form their own opinions.” She adds, “Maybe I can’t impress my ‘opinions,’ but I will give them the facts, like graphs of temperatures rising.”
Leggett estimates that half of her students are coming from a rural environment. Born in Memphis, she recalls the difficult time she had adjusting when she went from the Tuskegee University to Duke University. She remembers struggling with elitism herself.
Now she mentors students through this vulnerable transition, and is able to forge connections with first-generation college students and conservative students, as well as students of color – all groups who might otherwise struggle to join conversations about the scientific realities of climate change.
Dr Todd Merendino, the manager of conservation programs in the Ducks Unlimited Texas field office, negotiates strategic partnerships with wildlife state agencies, agricultural producers, hunters, biologists, private landowners, petrochemical companies and the oil industry. A hunter and fisherman, he has a practical, outcomes-focused approach to his work.
“Our mission is waterfowl and habitats,” he says. “I look for symbiotic relationships. Common ground. Common goals.”
He speaks with corporations about responsible growth and convinces them that “wetlands and marshes are your insurance policy against flooding”. He ticks off the nature of their conversations: flood storage capacity, coastal restoration projects, storm surge abatement, initiatives that keep the marsh healthy.
Ducks Unlimited recently completed a beneficial dredge use project near Port Arthur, Texas, which will move 2m cubic yards of dredge material to restore approximately 1,300 acres of the Salt Bayou Marsh watershed, an important migratory bird flyway recently degraded by hurricane damage. It’s generally more expensive to utilize dredge material in this manner, he says, but smarter to move it to a place where it serves a purpose.
Merendino’s work has large-scale outcomes, and with that objective in mind he welcomes chances to partner with corporations and big agriculture. “If the rice industry went away,” he points out, “the amount of waterfowl habitat loss would be insurmountable, impossible to overcome.”
After seeing the beauty and importance of the Bald Knob Refuge, the scale, necessity and complexity of this work impresses me.
It’s easy to be an armchair activist in 2019, or make condescending online comments about the state of climate change activism in the south. But it’s much more difficult to swim against the ideological current, or to operate between two exasperating worlds in a hands-on way, in search of real impact.
There is certainly more opportunity for cooperation and partnership, and places where more traditional environmentalists like me could find common ground with a hunter in Arkansas or a fisherman in Georgia, so that we could, quite frankly, save what we both love.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/09/republicans-climate-change-conservatives-environmentalists-arkansas

That's the power of protest | Rebecca Solnit,article,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/14/standing-rock-ocasio-cortez-protest-climate-activism,0,"It’s hard right now to remember how hot it was last August on the long sandy beach where the Colorado river meets the Green river in southern Utah. I was a few days into a rafting trip through Cataract Canyon with a bunch of young climate activists, and one of them, Will Munger, was telling me that since his months at the Standing Rock resistance camp, he had been encountering young Native people whose experiences at the protest site had encouraged them to dream of new possibilities and take actions that might otherwise have seemed out of reach.
Wandering back and forth along the edge of the water, we began to discuss how, often, the consequences of an uprising or a movement are not linear. Success and failure are often premature measures and oversimplifications; actions, interventions and conversations change beliefs and create new values, alliances and possibilities. We’d seen this dynamic from many unanticipated uprisings and movements: the indigenous movement Idle No More, which began in Canada in 2012; Black Lives Matter; the feminist insurgencies since 2013 and the anti-gun movement in the hands of the Parkland youth.
On a cold day this January, I was thinking again about that conversation as I contemplated Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s decision to run for office. “I first started considering running for Congress, actually, at Standing Rock in North Dakota,” she said late last year. “It was really from that crucible of activism where I saw people putting their lives on the line … for people they’ve never met and never known. When I saw that, I knew that I had to do something more.”
In 2016, when LaDonna Brave Bull Allard and others launched the camps protesting the Dakota Access pipeline, they could not have known some of the indirect consequences of their actions – including prompting a young woman from New York City to run for office. Sometimes the results that matter are not direct or intended – though four tribes continue to litigate over the pipeline, and they had a modest court victory on 8 January.
Today, Ocasio-Cortez represents New York’s 14th district in Congress, and 45 congresspeople support the Green New Deal that she began promoting last fall. Significantly, the Green New Deal is not Ocasio-Cortez’s creation. As Standing Rock prompted her to run for office, the Sunrise Movement created the climate vision she carried into Congress. Founded in 2017, Sunrise is a youth-led movement that aims to “to stop climate change and create millions of good jobs in the process”. As the movement’s co-founder Varshini Prakash recently told the Huffington Post, Sunrise is trying to “activate the millions of Americans who are ready to fight for a Green New Deal but haven’t heard of it yet”. For me, the movement’s sudden appearance in national politics this year was even more surprising and thrilling than Ocasio-Cortez’s primary victory.
The Green New Deal is a much-needed response to what the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and American scientists told us last fall: we probably have 12 years to transform the energy economy globally, or else. The proposal makes its mark by setting new goals for the nation and by reminding us that climate and jobs, ecology and economies don’t have to be opposed, while recent polls tell the congressional leadership that the majority of Americans want swift and radical action on climate.
Getting there requires understanding that the process may not be straightforward. Unsurprisingly, the Green New Deal was not immediately adopted by the Democratic leadership, and if you were to tell the story thus far in the terms that we’ve learned from action movies and sports, it’s a conflict that already has a conclusion: as the news site Politico put it: “Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi 2, Ocasio-Cortez 0.”
But, like the Standing Rock uprising, the work of the Sunshine Movement and Ocasio-Cortez will generate other benefits and consequences; if we are going to get to the goal it will, of course, be by a more circuitous route – though it must be a speedy one. Last Wednesday, Congressmen Jimmy Gomez and Ted Lieu of California introduced a bill, the Climate Solutions Act of 2019, with similar goals – or reintroduced it, since Lieu (who’s also supporting the Green New Deal) has introduced a bill by that name twice before.
You could not possibly catalyze a movement in the Dakotas with the intention that a woman would run for Congress in New York City and then go to the Capitol to advocate on climate. You could not assume, imagine or calculate that that would be a consequence. But you can recognize how common such indirect consequences are, and how important it is to not discount them. The course of history is full of confluences and meanders, oxbows, watersheds, dams and floods, tributaries and distributaries.
Cataract Canyon is where the Colorado river pours into the reservoir of stagnant water backed up from Glen Canyon dam. When Glen Canyon dam was completed, a little more than 50 years ago, most people – whether they loved or hated this massive intervention in the wilderness – imagined that the reservoir would stand for centuries. But the dam is failing, thanks to overallocation of the river’s water and to the way climate change has reduced rainfall and snowfall in its watershed.
At the end of my journey with Will and the other climate activists, I saw over and over how the river was cutting new channels through the silt that had built up when the reservoir was higher; how what was stagnant was now active again. This was never supposed to happen, or it was supposed to happen hundreds of years hence.
“Let us never, ever, ever give up,” tweeted Ocasio-Cortez the day after her swearing-in, adding: “It wasn’t long ago that we felt our lives were over; that there were only so many do-overs until it was too late, or too much to take … I honestly thought as a 28-year-old waitress I was too late; that the train of my fulfilled potential had left the station.” Climate change tells is there is no time to waste. But history tells us that social change works in indirect and unpredictable ways, and that it’s worth pressing on for what you believe in.

Barnaby Joyce says he gave water back to irrigators to stop 'greenies' 
Joyce’s comments at odds with press conference on Wednesday when he likened water thieves to cattle and sheep thieves.
Barnaby Joyce has told a pub in a Victorian irrigation district that the Four Corners program which raised allegations of water theft was about taking more water from irrigators and shutting down towns.
The deputy prime minister, agriculture and water minister told a gathering at a Hotel Australia in Shepparton that he had given water back to agriculture through the Murray Darling Basin plan so the “greenies were not running the show”. 
“We have taken water, put it back into agriculture, so we could look after you and make sure we don’t have the greenies running the show basically sending you out the back door, and that was a hard ask,” he said in comments reported by the ABC.

We’ve been seeing numerous impacts catching many scientists by surprise with how soon they are occurring. In 2014 two independent teams of scientists reported that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is likely irreversibly retreating. 3.3 meters of sea level rise equivalent of ice there is being destabilized by a warming ocean and energy is going into the net melting of ice all over the planet. 
The paleoclimate record indicates that increasing global temperature by just 1.5-2°C above preindustrial temperature commits the system to an eventual 6-9m of sea level rise, a large fraction of which could arrive within the next 100 years.
Corals may not survive this century of warming and acidifying oceans, and droughts and floods linked to global warming—and conflict linked to those droughts—have already caused four countries to face famine.
Because of the decades to millennial long lag between a climate forcing and our feeling the full effect, due to the thermal inertia of the ocean and response time of the ice sheets, the effects we are feeling now are largely just the beginning of the result of emissions from the 20th century. And emissions have been increasing steadily for decades.
We are also seeing numerous amplifying feedbacks: loss of albedo (heat reflectivity) from ice melt, permafrost melt, methane release and massive wildfires; the Earth is starting to wrest any possible further human control of the climate away.

The damning assessment by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority is contained in the December 2018 progress report posted on its website and comes as NSW faces growing questions over whether its rivers are over-allocated in the wake of a big fish kill at Menindee on the Darling River.
Water resource plans, or water-sharing plans, set the detailed rules for sharing water between irrigators and the environment in each catchment. They include rules on how allocations will be made, when irrigators must cease pumping in low flows, pump sizes permitted, and rules for shepherding environmental flows down the river.
But NSW has failed to submit even first drafts of 12 of of its 20 required plans, including those for major rivers such as the Barwon Darling, the Lower Darling, the Namoi and the Murrumbidgee.
Instead, NSW is operating its rivers under old plans, which have not been accredited.
In particular, the 2012 Barwon Darling water-sharing plan has come in for heavy criticism because it allows irrigators to pump during low and medium flows.
The revelations of NSW’s slow progress come as as low river flows, hot weather and algal blooms in several rivers have caused massive fish kills.
The NSW minister for primary industries, Niall Blair, denied on Tuesday there was a problem of over-allocation in NSW, saying that the primary cause of falling dam levels and low flows was the drought.
“We have water-sharing plans and we are developing and submitting our water resource plans for all across New South Wales to be signed off by Canberra,” he said. “This is not a debate about over-allocation.
“This is a drought. For people to jump on the bandwagon now and point the finger at farmers and tell them they are responsible for this – go and look at the records.
But the water-sharing plans Blair was referring to are incomplete and NSW lagging is far behind other states.
The MDBA said 12 of NSW’s were only at the “preliminary phase” in which NSW outlines its approach to the MDBA. The MDBA rated its level of confidence of NSW meeting the deadline at 30% or less.
“The MDBA remains concerned about the large volume of work that needs to be completed,” the report said. “At this stage MDBA considers that eight of the 20 NSW WRPs are on track for accreditation by mid-2019.
While the authority said NSW was co-operating, it said the state still needed to resolve a number of complex policy implementation issues to enable the accreditation of its plans.
These included floodplain harvesting, water accounting issues and the protection of environmental water in the northern NSW catchments.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/16/damning-murray-darling-report-says-nsw-well-behind-on-water-sharing-plans

And another version of this sort of thing is what is often called red tides or toxic blooms. That picture on the left is just staggering to me. I have talked about it a million times, but it's unbelievable. 
In the upper right of that picture on the left is almost the Mississippi Delta, and the lower left of that picture is the Texas-Mexico border. You're looking at the entire northwestern Gulf of Mexico; you're looking at one toxic dinoflagellate bloom that can kill fish, made by that beautiful little creature on the lower right. 
And in the upper right you see this black sort of cloud moving ashore. That's the same species. And as it comes to shore and the wind blows, and little droplets of the water get into the air, the emergency rooms of all the hospitals fill up with people with acute respiratory distress. And that's retirement homes on the west coast of Florida. 
A friend and I did this thing in Hollywood we called Hollywood ocean night, and I was trying to figure out how to explain to actors what's going on. And I said, ""So, imagine you're in a movie called 'Escape from Malibu' because all the beautiful people have moved to North Dakota, where it's clean and safe.

Rob DeConto’s ice sheet model in 2016 was for the first time able recreate the high sea levels of the Pliocene and accurately track observed glacial flow rates so it seems more useful than previous sluggish models.
From his 2016 paper regarding that model:
“Incorporating these mechanisms in our ice-sheet model accelerates the expected collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet to decadal time scales, and also causes retreat into major East Antarctic subglacial basins”
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X14007961
However, according to Richard Alley, that numerical model “specified a maximum retreat rate that has already been exceeded in Greenland for short times, and the wider glaciers and deeper beds of Antarctica will likely allow faster or much faster retreat than has been achieved in Greenland”, so the several meters of sea level rise over the next hundred years DeConto says their model produced under Business-as-usual may be conservative.

Globally ice shelves constrain about 25m of sea level rise equivalent of ice grounded below sea level where warming oceans can access it and it can make icebergs.
It's minus 50 C on parts of Antarctica, warm it up to minus 45 C and who cares? But it's at the melting point at the coast where ice shelves are thinning and disappearing.
The glaciologist Richard Alley said that a 1 degree C rise in temperature is a big insult to an ice shelf almost anywhere on the planet. 
When the Larsen B ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula broke up in 2002 the glaciers behind sped up 6-8 fold and are still flowing at that accelerated rate today because the cork was removed. Luckily there's comparatively little ice there.

Of the roughly 130m of sea level rise during the last deglaciation only around 2m of that was due to thermal expansion. And the planet's alpine glaciers are gone before they add half a meter. So the only things on the planet which can produce large, fast sea level rise are the ice sheets.

Nutrient rich waters from the depths slow their journey to the surface where they feed important fisheries like sardines and anchoveta and oxygen rich waters from the surface slow their journey to the depths, turning the ocean to desert.

Maps of the ocean floor are less detailed than those of Mars or the moon. Marine biologists have discovered deeply weird and genuinely wonderful species: boxer crabs wielding anemones like weapons; the rope-like Praya dubia, up to 50 metres long; immortal jellyfish, which unlike any other known creature can revert from maturity to an earlier stage of development, akin to a butterfly becoming a caterpillar. But on one estimate we have identified less than a tenth of ocean-dwelling creatures.
What we can be certain about is that the extraordinary diversity of life in the oceans is under immense and growing threat. This week we learned that the last five years were the hottest on record. Global warming has heated the oceans by the equivalent of one atomic explosion per second for the last century and a half; in recent years the pace has accelerated to between three and six atomic bombs per second.
More than 90% of the heat trapped by greenhouse gas emissions has been absorbed by the seas. Billions of people living in coastal areas are under threat from rising sea levels, due both to the melting of ice – happening at a frightening and increasing rate – and the physical expansion of water as it warms. Climate change is making storms more powerful and disrupting the patterns of marine life on which communities depend.
But it is only the most comprehensive of the dangers. Carbon emissions are also causing ocean acidification. Intensive fishing, pollution and the exploitation of mineral resources are all taking their toll. Between a fifth and a quarter of marine species are already threatened with extinction; global marine populations have halved since 1970. Though only three humans have reached the deepest known point, the Mariana trench, our collective impact is felt there in the form of pollutants and plastics.
Recently, an expert warned that today’s children may be the last generation to see the glory of coral reef systems which have survived for tens of millions of years. Bleaching, first observed in 1983, has already affected up to a third of warm-water reefs. Scientists around the world are “farming” corals in an ingenious attempt to sustain them, but the only real solution is to stave off the worst climate change scenario.
The New York summit overseen by the UN secretary general this September will be a key test of whether nation states are serious about cutting emissions. The new reports provide yet more evidence of how urgent this is. As one expert on ocean warming notes in the Guardian today, it can still be tackled if we act immediately; this is a test of will, not ability. We know that the human consequences if we fail will be catastrophic. And yet, because we have still to explore the oceans more fully, we may never realise quite how much we have lost.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/16/the-guardian-view-on-warming-oceans-a-rising-toll

On Friday, parts of NSW and the ACT were again forecast to soar above 40C – for the fifth day in a row.
Nine records were broken in NSW on Wednesday, and more are forecast to fall on Friday.
In Penrith in Sydney’s west, temperatures will hit 45C, up from 42C on Thursday. In Menindee – the site of mass fish kills in the Murray river – another 45C day is on the cards. It reached 47C on Wednesday and Thursday, and the maximum temperature hasn’t been below 45C since Monday.

Rebecca Farr, a forecaster for the Bureau of Meteorology, said Canberra would break the record for the longest stretch of over-40C days since records began in 1939.
“For Canberra, today we are forecasting 40C and, if we reach that, it will the the first time on record that we will have four consecutive days of 40C or more,” she said.
“Broken Hill is forecast to hit four consecutive days of 45C, and that also hasn’t happened before. Records there started in 1957.”
The northern regions of Victoria, including Mildura, Shepparton and the border towns of Albury-Wodonga, will also stay above 40C.
According to the Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO, Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910, and temperatures will increase in the future.
So how will climate change affect future heatwaves in Australia?
The CSIRO and BoM have compiled different models for predicting the outcome of climate change in Australia to produce a guide to how different regions will likely be affected.
They found that every part of Australia will continue to experience increases in average temperature, and will have a higher frequency of hot days.
The duration of hot spells will increase in every region. In many areas in the northern half of Australia, the average number of days above 35C could increase by two to three times.
Late in the century, towns such as Darwin, Alice Springs and Broome  may experience days with temperatures above 35C for about a third of the year.
These higher temperatures will also result in higher evaporation, which will continue to make drought conditions worse.
But southern and coastal regions will experience the welcome relief of sub-30 temperatures and even rain. Melbourne is set for a maximum of 28C, Geelong 26C and Warrnambool 21C.
It will also cool in South Australia, at least compared with the record-breaking 48.9C recorded in Port Augusta on Tuesday.
Temperatures will still hover in the 30s but the stretch of nearly-50C temperatures looks to be over.
Port Augusta is set for 32C (down from 48.9C), Tarcoola 31C (down from 48.7C), Coober Pedy 38C (down from 47.8C) and Woomera 37C (down from 47.6C).
But central Australia will remain scorching. Oodnadatta – one of the hottest 15 places in the Earth this week – will still sit at 46C.
In NSW, the towns of Ivanhoe, Bourke and Wilcannia are all facing 46C. Gundagai will swelter through 44C, which is only slightly down on the 45C experienced on Wednesday.
Farr said the summer had smashed records across the state.
“Yesterday we saw some January records broken,” Farr said. “Cobar (47.2C), Parkes (44.5C), Wagga (45.2C) and Tuggeranong (40.8C) all had their hottest January day since records began.
“On Wednesday, we even saw some annual records broken. It was the hottest day since records began at Broken Hill airport (46.3C), Whitecliff (48.2C), Wilcannia (47.9C) and Albury (45.6C).”
Temperatures in NSW are expected to drop over the weekend. Menindee is set for 36C with some cloud cover and Penrith 32C. Wilcannia and Ivanhoe will drop to 40C, but Bourke is set to stay hot at 45C on Saturday, and hold at over 40C through all of next week.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/18/australia-heatwave-sydneys-west-to-hit-45c-after-week-of-extreme-weather

The retreat hasn’t been equal in the US and Canada. The famous alpine ice masses in the Cascade Mountains in the north-west US have largely been spared from the trend.
“The losses we would expect were reduced because we got a lot of additional snow,” said David Shean, a co-author at the University of Washington. “Moving forward we may not be so lucky.”
The jet stream – the currents of fast-flowing air in the atmosphere that affect weather – has shifted, causing more snow in the north-western US and less in south-western Canada, according to the study released in Geophysical Research Letters, a publication of the American Geophysical Union. Changes in the northern hemisphere jet stream are increasingly firmly linked to global warming.
That warming from humans burning fossil fuels is also expected to continue to melt alpine glaciers, even under scenarios for more moderate greenhouse gas levels.
While some of the fourfold increase in the melting rate in western North America is related to manmade climate change, the researchers can’t say with certainty how much.
“We’re starting to understand these shorter cycles that have real impacts on how the glaciers are behaving and how much water is stored in the glaciers,” Shean explained.
Alaskan glaciers get much of the attention in North America because Alaska is warming faster than the continental US. Mount Hunter in Denali national park, is seeing 60 times more snow melt than it did 150 years ago.
The North American glaciers analyzed in the new study are far smaller than those in Alaska, Asia and elsewhere, so they won’t contribute much to sea-level rise as they melt. The authors say they offer critical lessons for water management, fisheries and flood prevention.
With shrinking glaciers, less water will be available for nearby river systems when rainfall is low. In some parts of the world, millions of people could lose their primary water supplies.
In the Pacific north-west US, if glaciers melted entirely, that could reduce the flow of certain watersheds by up to about 15% in dry months of August and September, Shean said.
“In our case that will have an impact, especially if we’re having a drought year … but in general at least for the foreseeable future we should be OK here in Washington,” he said.
Snow pack changes will be more important than glacier melt for water planners in the western US, Shean said.
Still, changes in water temperature could pose problems for fish. And the sediment that comes with melting glaciers could fall to the bottoms of riverbeds, making them overflow during heavy rains.
The authors got their data by comparing satellite images of glaciers from 2000 to 2009 and from 2009 to 2018. They estimated elevation changes, which can be difficult to assess with the smallest glaciers. Other researchers are attempting to get spy satellite and aerial photos from the 1950s and 1960s declassified so they can study longer-term changes, Shean said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/18/north-america-glacier-melt-study-climate-change

A pull factor would be a re-jigged economy in which people-centred, environmentally-friendly, non-productive jobs were profitable, this profitability being cemented in a new Law that creates a new form of money supply.
If banks can create money out of thin air, governments could create money through millions of people doing such work, the work generating the salary of the workers plus an added profit to invest in creating similar jobs. In this way a ""green"" economy could be created and grow, permitting businesses and workers to escape from the destructive economy.
In this way, factories and shopping centres could vanish without causing unemployment.
And, after thousands of years of cruelty handed down to us from our own kind and invading ""top dogs"", it's about time there were millions of really great jobs that worked directly on us rather than on perfecting technology and the usefulness of materials.
What's the point of democracy and supposedly being an intelligent animal if we cannot make profitable the jobs that really are beneficial to us?

Avoiding dangerous climate change is an acute problem that must be solved in the time-frame of years, whereas global population is a chronic problem that will take decades at least to solve.
Besides, emissions do not correlate with population at all well: the richest 10% emit 50% of CO2 and the poorest 50% emit 10%. You could literally slash the world's population by 50% and still have 90% of emissions.

But there was a time in the recent past when all the countries of the world moved quickly to discuss a common threat, agreed an ambitious plan of action and made it work.
The Montreal protocol, which came into effect 30 years ago, was drawn up to address the alarming thinning of the ozone layer in the Earth’s stratosphere. It was the first agreement in the history of the United Nations to be ratified by all 197 countries. Since it came into effect on 1 January 1989, more than 99% of the gases responsible for the problem have been eradicated and the “ozone hole” – which, in the late 80s, vied for headline space with the cold war, Diana, Princess of Wales, and Madonna – is receding in the sky and the memory.
According to the latest UN study, the “ozone holes” (there are actually two: one above each pole) are healing at the rate of 1% to 3% a decade and will have completely vanished in the northern hemisphere by the 2030s and the southern hemisphere by the 2060s. This is cause for back-slapping, but also frustration that the world has not been able to unite as effectively over the climate and biodiversity crises. Here are half a dozen lessons.
The satellite animation of the changing atmosphere over the Antarctic first shown in 1985 appeared to show a growing “ozone hole”. This was a scientifically imprecise description of the thinning that was concentrated at both poles, but the metaphor – of the roof over our home planet being punctured – captured the public imagination and, most importantly, conveyed a sense of urgency. By contrast, many people feel distant from climate problems, which are usually illustrated with images of polar bears, filled with caveats and headlined with vague labels, such as “global warming”, which sounds benign (or even desirable for those living in cold countries), and “climate change”, which comes across as a statement of the obvious.
When scientists raised the alarm about chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) gases, there was initially uncertainty about their impact on the atmosphere and the process, but the risks from sunlight weakly filtered by the ozone layer (cancer, crop failure, ocean ecosystem collapse) were so great that world leaders decided not to wait. Instead, they applied the “precautionary principle”: “If in doubt, cut it out.” Even before the science was settled, they started to act. This was also supposed to be the case with the climate, but lobbying to deny the validity of the science, particularly in the US, has stymied action.
Governments temporarily put aside cold-war hostilities and united rapidly around a solution to the ozone problem. From the first research in 1973, it took just 16 years for the world to discuss, agree and put in place a solution that reversed the trend. By comparison, scientific warnings that carbon dioxide emissions could disrupt the climate date back to at least 1962 (and the risks were speculated on much earlier). Yet despite numerous international agreements on the subject since then (Rio 1992, Kyoto 1998, Copenhagen 2009, Paris 2015), emissions are still climbing.
In the 80s, the environment was not yet the polarising issue it has become, but the dominant figures – including the US president, George HW Bush, the Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, and the British prime minister, Margaret Thatcher – still had to overcome business interests, treasury doubts and political short-termism to protect the future health of the planet. They refused to accept the delaying tactics of chemical companies, some of which argued action should wait until the science was clearer. Today, Trump, Bolsonaro and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, represent fossil fuel interests, deny science and undermine international cooperation.
The phased ban on CFCs and dozens of other ozone-depleting gases was an economic blow to chemical firms, refrigerator producers and aerosol-spray manufacturers. Rich countries dealt with the job losses, technology upgrades and other economic consequences internally, but also provided support for poorer nations to manage the transition. From 1991 to 2005, pledges totalled $3.1bn. Similar arrangements exist for climate accords, but the sums need to be far higher because the actions are so much more expensive, the responsibility of industrialised nations is so much greater, and the impact on poor countries is incalculably worse.
The Montreal protocol has been updated numerous times as the science has sharpened and new climate goals have been incorporated. This month, the Kigali amendment added a plan to cut hydrofluorocarbons by more than 80% over the next 30 years, which would reduce global heating by 0.4C by the end of the century. Under the Paris climate agreement, governments are supposed to ratchet up the ambition of their pledges to cut emissions, but most governments are failing to meet even their current inadequate targets.
Looking at this list, a millennial might be tempted to conclude that the Montreal protocol was possible because it came about in a golden age when leaders were smarter, politicians more representative and populations more amenable to scientific persuasion. But, as anyone alive in 1989 knows, that is far too simple an explanation. The reality is that environmental action was easier then because the world had more ecological breathing room, capitalism was less dominant and the corporate push-back – and control over politics – was weaker. The ozone layer was a relatively simple fix compared with the climate, which is the biggest, most complex, multidimensional challenge humanity has ever faced. It is one thing confronting a handful of chemical firms, quite another to take on the world’s fossil fuel companies, car manufacturers, cement-makers and agribusiness conglomerates, representing hundreds of millions of jobs, trillions of dollars and 200-odd years of industrial development.
Bush, Thatcher, Gorbachev and the then Chinese leader, Deng Xiaoping, knew this in 1989, when global temperatures were already rising at an unnaturally rapid rate. A year earlier, in a US congressional testimony reported throughout the world, the then Nasa scientist Jim Hansen had declared “with 99% confidence” that this heating was a result of human activity. They also knew the problem would be easier to solve then than 30 years in the future. Initially, Bush promised to lead a determined global response to climate change, but – as the short-term costs of a long-term solution became apparent – he balked. Instead of a comprehensive response, he merely strengthened research, paved the way for a drawn-out global negotiating process and complacently put his faith in future innovation and entrepreneurship.
He may well have reassured himself that his environmental legacy was secure, thanks to action on ozone. But the climate can that he and others kicked forward 30 years ago is still clanking through the corridors of global conferences. It is a lot rustier now, but still basically the same half-response to a problem that becomes bigger and harder to solve with every year that passes.
So this year’s anniversary of the implementation of the Montreal protocol should not just inspire nostalgia for 1989, but a curse on the first generation of leaders to dodge climate responsibility. And as we are already suffering the consequences of their failure, it should remind us that every day of delay has a massive and imminent cost. Each fraction of a degree of global heating that can be prevented will save lives, species and money.
In our lifetimes, the ozone hole will be closed in the stratosphere while the increasingly angry beast of climate rages below. How angry is up to us. Montreal reminds us that nothing in politics is inevitable, that profits do not have to come before people, that global problems can have global solutions, that we can shape our own future. That depends on how far we are willing to push. In 1989, that wasn’t far enough. Nor has it been since. In 2003, the UN secretary-general, Kofi Annan, called the Montreal protocol “perhaps the single most successful international agreement to date”. Sadly, that still applies today.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/20/how-to-stop-the-climate-crisis-six-lessons-from-the-campaign-that-saved-the-ozone

I know. I acknowledge a similar thing about warmer seas installing more moisture into the atmosphere creating heavier snowfalls. I suppose you just want to argue. 
Both of you have completely missed the point. Snowpack does not equal glaciers. Yet, some findings in the past suggested snowpacks would reduce in the Alps. This short piece is saying the opposite— that warmer seas upwind of the Alps have great potential to increase snowpacks. 
I understand that glaciers may still recede in this scenario, or they may not.

Another hallmark of climate change deniers is their belief that it is a 1:1 relationship. Climate change caused by AGW will not manifest itself in a uniform manner globally. Some regions will experience more warming than average (eg Arctic amplification), some areas may get drier, others wetter, some colder. Weather patterns will also change, so whilst the average rainfall may be the same, it may be manifested in shorter sharper deluge followed by drought.
All of this has been in the scientific literature for decades, should anyone wish to inform themselves as opposed to spouting unsubstantiated drivel.

Alas, no, it turns out that the recent record-breaking dumps of snow across much of southern Germany, Switzerland and Austria are more likely a consequence of global warming. Why? Balmy temperatures in the North Sea and Baltic Sea are cooking up the ideal conditions to create snow.
Right now, average surface water temperatures in the North Sea are about 8C (46F), while the Baltic Sea is hovering at about 3C (37F). It might sound bracing, but as data from the Danish Meteorological Institute shows, these numbers are a good couple of degrees warmer than average for the time of year. And herein lies the problem. “Global warming enhances the current snowfall … Anomalously high sea surface temperatures in the North Sea and Baltic are loading winds from the north with moisture,” tweeted Stefan Rahmstorf of the University of Potsdam last week. Meanwhile, warmer than average air temperatures across northern Europe in early January provided the ideal environment to turn all that moisture into snow.
Around the globe oceans are warming far faster than expected. Extra snow and rain is a consequence we are all going to have to get used to.

Enormous glaciers in Greenland are depositing ever larger chunks of ice into the Atlantic Ocean, where it melts. But scientists have found that the largest ice loss in the decade from 2003 actually occurred in the south-west region of the island, which is largely glacier-free.
This suggests surface ice is simply melting as global temperatures rise, causing gushing rivers of meltwater to flow into the ocean and push up sea levels. South-west Greenland, not previously thought of as a source of woe for coastal cities, is set to “become a major future contributor to sea level rise”, the research states.
“We knew we had one big problem with increasing rates of ice discharge by some large outlet glaciers,” said Michael Bevis, lead author of the paper and a professor of geodynamics at Ohio State University. “But now we recognize a second serious problem: increasingly, large amounts of ice mass are going to leave as meltwater, as rivers that flow into the sea.”
The research provides fresh evidence of the dangers posed to vulnerable coastal places as diverse as Miami, Shanghai, Bangladesh and various Pacific islands as climate change shrinks the world’s land-based ice.
“The only thing we can do is adapt and mitigate further global warming – it’s too late for there to be no effect,” Bevis said. “This is going to cause additional sea level rise. We are watching the ice sheet hit a tipping point.
“We’re going to see faster and faster sea level rise for the foreseeable future. Once you hit that tipping point, the only question is: how severe does it get?”
The study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, used data from Nasa’s gravity recovery and climate experiment (known as Grace) and GPS stations scattered across Greenland to analyze changes in ice mass.
This showed that Greenland lost about 280bn tons of ice per year between 2002 and 2016, enough to raise the worldwide sea level by 0.03 inches annually. If all of Greenland’s vast ice sheet, 3km thick in places, was to melt, global sea levels would rise by seven meters, or more than 20ft, drowning most coastal settlements.
The rate of loss hasn’t been even, however, with the ice melting four times faster in 2013 compared with 2003. Researchers said this was driven by rising global temperatures from human-induced climate change as well as the North Atlantic Oscillation, a periodic weather phenomenon that brings warmer air to western Greenland.
The fate of Greenland’s huge glaciers in the south-east and north-west has long been viewed as a key factor in global sea level rise but the Ohio State-led research suggests the ice fields of the island’s south-west may prove an unexpectedly large source of meltwater.
Scientists have been gaining a greater understanding of how the two massive ice masses on the planet, in Greenland and Antarctica, are reacting to a warming ocean and atmosphere.
Arctic ice loss has tripled since the 1980s, with melting in places such as Greenland and Alaska providing the greatest instigator of sea level rise while destabilizing the very ground underneath 4 million people’s feet.
Antarctica is becoming an increasing concern, however, with ice vanishing at its fastest rate in recorded history. The world’s largest expanse of ice is now losing about 219bn tonnes of ice a year, a trajectory that would contribute more than 25cm to total global sea level rise by 2070. Should the entire west Antarctic ice sheet collapse, sea levels would balloon by around 3.5m, albeit over a lengthy timeframe.
“We are warming the planet, this is melting ice, and that is raising sea level,” said Richard Alley, a geologist and glacier expert at Pennsylvania State University. Alley added that while there are uncertainties over future sea level rise “if the big ice sheets change more rapidly than expected, they could drive faster or much faster rise than expected”.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/21/greenland-ice-melting-faster-than-scientists-previously-thought-study

When quizzed, older pupils revealed that a Cleg, Haematopota pluvialis, is a particularly nasty form of fly that you do not notice until pain alerts you to the fact it has cut a hole in your skin and started to suck your blood. 
It is very similar to a horsefly, except smaller, silent and stealthy, so normally not detected until the damage is being done.
At the time it seemed a rather apt name for an unpopular master, never happier than when wielding a cane, but was completely forgotten about until last summer’s heatwave. 
The wet spring benefited the overwintering larvae and the hot summer was ideal for the adults. Bites were frequent, painful and itchy for days. 
But all those years ago the boys had got it wrong – it is only the females that bite and suck your blood to provide the nourishment for the eggs they are about to lay. The males lack the sharp mouthparts to cut through your skin and are harmless nectar eaters and beneficial pollinators. 
It is too early to say whether last year’s unwelcome population surge will be repeated; the larvae do not emerge as adults until May.

A veteran of international climate change negotiations, John attended the Rio Earth summit in 1992, and every UN summit on climate change since, representing the RSPB and BirdLife International since 1998.
John’s deep knowledge of climate science and understanding of the world of international negotiations made him a quietly significant figure. He argued consistently for the protection of tropical forests as a key step towards meeting environmental goals, helping build alliances between conservation, development and human rights advocates.
He was so well known that negotiators sought him out in his usual haunts, whether at a coffee table in the conference halls, or with his fellow smokers, where he would share a mixture of physics, political analysis and gossip.
Born in Surbiton, south-west London, John was brought up on Christmas Island, in the Indian Ocean, and then in Tanzania, where his father, Bill Lanchbery, a mechanical engineer, ran a power station. His mother, Betty (nee Ball), was a furnishings designer. John returned to Britain to take his A-levels at Dulwich college, in south London.
John’s early career was at ERA Technology in the development of innovative thin film and microelectronics technologies for a variety of applications. Meanwhile he studied part-time for a degree in mathematics at the Open University and then a master’s in solid state physics at the City of London Polytechnic (now London Metropolitan University).
A year teaching at the Open University followed and in 1991 he started at Vertic, the NGO that supports the implementation of international agreements, working on climate change monitoring, which led to his engagement in the climate negotiations and ultimately working for the RSPB.
John operated through calm consideration, in both his scientific and personal lives. He was a rock for colleagues and a friend and mentor to many. He would always find time to explain the intricacies of the climate negotiations, enlivening the driest of topics with amusing anecdotes – especially over a glass of wine.
John is survived by his partner of 28 years, Nicola Jenkins, his son, Christopher, and daughter, Alexandra, from a marriage that ended in divorce; and by a granddaughter, Pippa.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/23/john-lanchbery-obituary

It got to this point because we do it too much, plain and simple. And part of his better livestock management is simply to have less livestock. Which we can achieve by eating less meat.
I firmly believe that animal protein is beneficial for us (sad we have to kill to live, but that's how it is. Even plants are alive so vegans kill too). Moderate recent trends do not advocate to give up meat altogether, just that we eat less of it.
Yes, this will cause some damage to the economy of livestock producers and butchers, but it evens out by benefiting growers and greengrocers.
Eating less meat and more fibre is scientifically proven to be better for our health. And when we don't need industrial cattle processing, a lot of nightmarish suffering can be avoided.
Did you know that young chickens get killed and ground for animal feed if they're male? Some times they are ground ALIVE.

Beef was a once or twice a week thing when I was a kid (maybe that was already excessive) but now people eat it every day. The environmental and economic subsidies this product receives is out of all proportion to our protein needs, which amount to ~80-100g per day.
If you want to do somehing for the environment but you don't want to join a cult, at least cut out or restrict beef consumption. If you think that a diet based around some chicken, fish, dairy and vegetable protein is boring then it indicates a lack of imagination.

Yes ruminants of all kinds evolved before humans domesticated them. And yes there is nothing intrinsically wrong with the fact that they produce methane, and yes running them in more natural, grassland management systems may well lower the methane production per animal.
But. We now have stocked the planet with such vast numbers of ruminants and repurposed so many ecosystems towards ruminant raising that we now have a hugely greater population of ruminants of the planet - wild and domestic - than existed in the past. 
Wild species of ruminants have populations in the 100's of 1000's and millions. In the past some may have been in the 10's of millions maybe.
We have around 1.4 BILLION cattle and water buffalo and around 1.9 BILLION sheep and goats, hugely more than natural ecosystems could have supported in the past. 
It isn't eating meat that is wrong. But the scale of it is. Unless we can seriously reduce the amount of methane produced per animal, to well below the levels they would produce naturally, then simply doing the best management practices is insufficient - important but insufficient.
We need good management AND destocking. Not eating no meat.

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/29/methane-emissions-cattle-11-percent-higher-than-estimated
BQSTART
Revised calculations of methane produced per head of cattle show that global livestock emissions in 2011 were 11% higher than estimates based on data from the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC). 
After rising slowly from 2000 to 2006, the concentration of methane in the air has climbed 10 times more quickly in the last decade, according to earlier research.
Besides natural sources such as peatland, wetlands and termites, methane from human activity – approximately two-thirds of the total – is produced in two ways: the odourless and colourless gas leaks during the production and transport of coal, oil and especially natural gas; and, in roughly equal measure, from the flatulence of ruminants such as cattle and sheep, as well as the decay of organic waste, notably in landfills.
Methane accounted for about 16% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2015, according to the IPCC.
Methane is far more potent than CO2 as a greenhouse gas, capturing more of the sun’s radiative force, but it persists for less time in the atmosphere. Taking that into account, scientists calculate that over a 100-year period the “global-warming potential” of the gas is 28 times greater than for carbon dioxide.

Not when humans are the real weapons of climate destruction | Tony Lovell,article,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/24/should-we-stop-eating-meat-not-while-humans-are-the-real-weapons-of-climate-destruction,0,"As we are starting to see the effects of climate change materialise in front of our eyes, people are looking for things they can do to help heal our planet. One common theme has been a call to stop eating meat, mainly due to methane emissions from cows.
This is a simple answer, but I suggest it is an answer to the wrong question.
How did nature get things so horribly wrong when she allowed cows to evolve? After all, they are evil weapons of climate destruction, aren’t they?
Let’s start with a few basics.
Cows are ruminant animals. This means they have a multi-chambered stomach, one part of which is called a rumen. This is a fermentation vat containing billions of microbes breaking down the plants the animal eats. As part of this process, some of these microbes produce methane.
Lots of animals produce some methane, including horses, dogs, termites, people and even kangaroos.
Ruminants evolved 50 million years ago, and today there are almost 200 different species. So ruminant animals have a rich ecological diversity and a long evolutionary history.
Other ruminants include the American elk, Chinese goral, Himalayan tahr, Japanese serow, Reindeer, Siberian ibex, water buffalo and yak. There are mountain, marsh, snow and swamp ruminants. There are American, Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, even Siberian ruminants.
If nature got it wrong when she allowed ruminants to evolve, she got it wrong at a global scale.
But maybe she didn’t get it wrong after all? Maybe it’s not her, maybe it’s us?
Instead of asking “What do we humans need to do to reduce ruminant methane emissions?”, we should be asking “What have we humans done that has so unbalanced the natural methane cycle?”
Bacteria that “eat” methane live in healthy, properly managed soils beneath the feet of healthy, properly managed livestock. (Remember, nature doesn’t do “waste”.)
These methane-eating bacteria (methanotrophs) act as a balance to the methane produced by the methane generating bacteria (methanogens) in the rumens of the livestock above ground. This is the missing part of the natural methane cycle that we need to restore.
I believe there is a massive difference between “livestock” and “properly managed livestock”.
As soon as we take grazing animals off grass and put them into a feedlot or confinement dairy, we have severed their link to the land. This means that we have now prevented nature from doing what she does best, which is utilise any “waste”, cycle and reuse nutrients, and balance the system.  When we manage livestock properly, out on grass and respecting the natural relationship between soils, grasses and grazing animals, we get a cleaner, fresher and properly balanced production system. We get healthy ecosystems, healthy animals, healthy people.
If we start asking the right questions instead of the wrong ones, the answers begin to matter.
The answer to reducing our impact on the climate is not to stop eating meat, it is to properly manage land and livestock.

The sixth mass extinction has begun, our oceans are warming 40% faster than scientists anticipated, and the US’s carbon dioxide emissions rose 3.4% in 2018. How, I wonder, is everyone so calm? So business-as-usual?
The field of ecopsychology explores our connection to nature, and the way it affects our state of mind. Many of us fail to realize how essential that connection is.
Given that southern Florida – with its billions of dollars of vulnerable real estate on exposed coastline – is considered by many scientists as ground zero for climate change, I started my listening tour there. Floridians receive a constant stream of bad climate news. I was curious: does the state of the environment – specifically, the pending losses of biodiversity, tourism and property, and the prediction of category 6 hurricanes – keep people up at night? 
After a long morning of driving through the Everglades, I stopped at Joanie’s Blue Crab Cafe, a vibrant red shack on the side of Highway 41 in Ochopee. “Sit anywhere you like, baby,” Lisa, the waitress, said.
I grabbed a bottle of Coors from the cooler, and sat on the sun-soaked back deck overlooking a stretch of water lined with sawgrass and frequented by alligators. Over a few hours I saw cypress swamps, mangrove forests, osprey, bald eagles, roseate spoonbills and sandhill cranes. Even though there has been a 90% loss of wading birds in the Everglades this century, there is still so much left to lose.
“You’re having the blackened grouper sandwich,” Lisa said. “So good it will make you cry.”
Lisa was right – the grouper was incredible. And crying wasn’t out of the question. The government shutdown had given my trip a raw feeling. That morning signs were posted at the national park sites: “Enter at your own risk.” The Everglades – the largest subtropical wilderness left in the United States – is an environmental treasure imperiled by pollution, toxic algae blooms, disrupted water flow and politicians who favor big industries like sugar.
Climate change denial and avoidance are prevalent here. The new governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, announced surprising plans for big environmental reforms earlier this month, without mentioning climate change (a term his predecessor, Rick Scott, also refused to use).
Many people I spoke to in the Everglades didn’t want to talk about climate change. They considered it too political.
After I got home, I reached out to Erica Henry, a biologist who studies at-risk butterfly populations in the Florida Keys and Everglades, for her take. “You could be fatalistic about the fact that the news is bad, or that particular species seem doomed,” she said. “You could be paralyzed. But I’ve picked off my little piece, the problem I can help solve.”
I drove north, through Florida’s panhandle, witnessing miles of extensive tree damage from Hurricane Michael. I thought I’d hear tales of increasing environmental anxiety over rising seas, and the misery of enduring hurricane seasons in the era of climate change. But in nearly all of my conversations, I encountered more resolve than anxiety.
I booked a charter boat out of Ocean Springs, near Biloxi, to see Mississippi’s barrier islands. My captain was Matthew Mayfield, a chef, restaurateur and fisherman with an infamous smoked tuna dip. As we pointed the skiff away from the Gulf Coast, he recalled how his wife’s dresses were caught in the branches of the oak trees after Hurricane Katrina, just waving around.
We found a pelican skull and tail tracks of a small gator as we walked the white sand beaches of Horn Island, made famous by artist and conservationist Walter Anderson, who notoriously rode out Hurricane Betsy tethered to a tree. Mayfield told me about the clouds of monarchs that pass through in the fall. Generations from now, Horn Island may be gone.
On the way home, I worked up the courage to ask Matthew why he rebuilt his life on the coast. “Why do you stay?” I asked. He said he needed time to think about it.
In the days that followed, he sent me reasons and pictures of the family property, colorful sunsets, local food, and a tame fox. “People that live here realize that the reward greatly outweighs the risk and pain of a storm,” he explained. “No one really cares how much you make or what you do for a living. Maybe we have a bond that storms intensify.”
“Don’t you worry about the future?” I asked.
“I can’t live my life like that,” he said.
A few days later, I stood across the street from the Saint Louis Cathedral in New Orleans, where 13 years ago Hurricane Katrina took down massive oak trees, ornamental fencing, a portion of roof and the marble hands of a statue of Jesus Christ.
Cammie Hill-Prewitt, who coordinates residencies for artists focused on the environment for Tulane University, agreed to talk to me about the spiritual tax of living on the coast in the era of climate change. She evacuated for Katrina, but stayed through Isaac, pregnant and with three house guests.
“I grind my teeth during hurricane season,” Hill-Prewitt admitted. “But I have a 30-year mortgage. My partner owns restaurants. It’s not easy to leave.”
“We’re not exactly zen about it,” she clarified. “If you came back in September, when it’s hot, and there are four tropical depressions looming in the Atlantic, you’d get different responses. Incredible how short our memory is.”
While waiting for the annual Joan of Arc parade to start, we talked about a kid she knew who processed the trauma of Katrina through his Lego play for years, building houses then smashing them to pieces.
Thousands of people had lined the street, drinking, wearing sequined dresses and feathered hats. The drums started. A green paper mache dragon was hoisted into the air, followed by angels, then Joan of Arc on a well-trained horse.
Hill-Prewitt leaned over to me. “This is why we stay,” she said.
Later, I met Anna and Cam working at The Little Toy Shop near the bustling Cafe du Monde. They were in elementary school when Katrina hit. When I ask if they were anxious about climate change forecasts, Anna shrugged. “Maybe for a year or two after Katrina,” she said. Then she said something quietly profound. “You just learn not to get too attached to things.”
From New Orleans, I drove through Mississippi, from Natchez, to Piney-Woods, and finally Oxford, where I joined Heather McTeer Toney for coffee. She was the first African American mayor of Greenville, Mississippi, and a former Obama appointee, overseeing the south-east region of the Environmental Protection Agency. I wanted to hear about her experience with frontline communities, people living near levees and in flood zones.
“Our story of climate change and the south has always been about attachment to land,” Heather explained. “It’s generational. Cultural. This is our home and we’re as intertwined as flesh and blood.”
Heather agreed with me that the south – particularly communities of color – is often unfairly painted as uniformly oblivious, and disinterested, when in fact the conversation is just taking place in a different language.
“We talk about climate concerns daily, but express our fears through the changes we see in hunting, fishing and farming instead of carbon emissions and PM2 standards,” she said. “We understand it quite well and are fearful for the future of our homes and children.”
During my trip, I thought that I might observe more of a cultural tipping point, an urgency in places that need it most. But I found that many members of coastal communities have built up psychological resilience after living through years of extreme weather.
Avoidance and denial are proven coping mechanisms. And, frankly, most people are just trying to work and get through the day, and express concern for the future differently, from off-record conversations to outright advocacy. But continuing to reckon with a science-based reality – as painful and worry-inducing as it might be – is an important step toward informing meaningful, individual action.
Home is an emotional commitment. We’re an adaptable species, but also habitual and sentimental; that’s one reason we’re stuck in denial. It’s the reason change is going to hurt so much.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/24/us-south-climate-change

Almost every day in summer is 40C or above here.
Usually, the rivers provide relief: swimming in cool water, fishing for golden perch or Murray cod or seeking the solace of a big sleepy red gum that lines the banks.
But this year there are no rivers. With the mercury in the mid-40s, the Narran, the Namoi and the Barwon – all tributaries of the vast Murray-Darling river system – are dry, or reduced to a series of green, stagnant weir pools. The mighty red gums, roots exposed, are hanging on for dear life. Heritage-protected lakes and wetlands are empty, and with them have gone the breeding grounds of native birds and fish.
Australia has endured a searing summer of drought and extreme heat. Hundreds of feral animals have died of thirst or faced culling as they encroached on properties in search of water. All-time temperature records have been broken in South Australia, with Adelaide reaching 46.6C, while Melbourne had its hottest day since the catastrophic 2009 bushfires, and more fires swept through Tasmania.
The Murray-Darling basin, which stretches from Queensland, through New South Wales and Victoria before emptying into the Southern Ocean near Adelaide, should be the lifeblood of the continent in such times. But things have gone very wrong on the rivers.
At Menindee, near Broken Hill, thousands of fish were found dead on 6 January, including giant Murray cod up to 40 years old.
Government ministers blamed the drought that set in across eastern Australia from April 2017. The deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, said the environmental disaster was down to the fact it “just hasn’t rained”.
“We are experiencing a very, very dry period of unprecedented proportions,” he said. “And when it rains, it will come down in such torrents people will probably be saying ‘what are we going to do with all the water?’ That’s Australia.”
But the huge fish kill drew the nation’s attention to the wider crisis on the Murray-Darling, which has been the subject of political wrangling between farmers, environmentalists and Indigenous groups for decades.
While irrigation has expanded in some of Australia’s driest regions, the Darling and its tributaries have been reduced to a series of muddy pools. It’s not the first time the Darling has ceased to flow, but the unfolding severe ecological and social consequences have caused Australians to question whether its plan to save the Murray Darling basin from environmental disaster is working.
“We have witnessed a catastrophic failure of Australia’s supposedly world-leading water management system,” Rene Woods, from the Murray Lower Darling Rivers Indigenous Nations says.

For decades the states along the river had been handing out water licences to farmers without any thought about what unbridled extraction for farming would mean for the river or downstream states.
By the 1990s, the mouth of Murray at the end of the river system silted up. Salt levels became dangerously high, jeopardising Adelaide’s water supply, as well as internationally recognised wetlands.
Governments were forced to act and in 2007, after years of difficult negotiations, the states and the commonwealth agreed to a plan that would licence water extraction and buy back a share of water for the environment.
This water is owned by the Commonwealth and is released periodically to mimic nature and, in theory, keep the rivers healthy.
But from the outset, the plan owed more to political compromise than science.
“The best available science assembled for the guide to the the Basin Plan said that we needed 3,200GL to 7,600GL for the environment,” said Jamie Pittock, a professor at the Australian National University and a member of the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists.
But ultimately only 2,750GL was allocated to the environment. Astoundingly, the plan also failed to take into account climate change, despite scientific reports showing that most of the basin will become hotter and drier.

The Aboriginal nations of the basin have been all but ignored, too.
“In the 1990s, when NSW water reform began, it was really difficult, because we had people say “what have Aboriginal people got to do with water?” They didn’t see that we had a valid place at the table,” Yuwalaraay man Ted Fields says.
Aboriginal people have some say over about a third of the country in the basin, but they hold less than 0.01% of Australia’s water diversions.
Native title rights do not include ownership of natural waters. They can include the use of water for personal, social, domestic and cultural purposes but an entitlement to extract water doesn’t mean there is any water to extract, or that the water is drinkable. Traditional owners are angry at being shut out of the water conversation.
The loss is not just about day-to-day shortages. Gamilaraay and Yuwalaraay elders who have lived on the rivers all their lives say they have never seen conditions as bad as now, and they doubt it can ever be recovered.
“This to me is the ultimate destruction of our culture,” Gamilaraay elder Virginia Robinson says in Walgett.
“All people think about now is there’s no water. Aboriginal people were very close to nature and that’s all unbalanced now. There’s no nature to go back to.”
Buying up water to return to the environment remains deeply unpopular in much of rural Australia because of its impact on farms, rural towns and jobs.
At the same time the creation of a water market, where allocations can be traded, has benefited big agribusinesses who moved into industrial scale production of cotton and other high value crops, as well as water trading.
The Greens and Indigenous groups have called for a royal commission amid allegations of corruption and poor governance. South Australia has already held its own royal commission into the plan, but was hampered by the federal government’s refusal to cooperate. It will report next week and is expected to warn that key aspects of the Murray-Darling plan are in breach of the Commonwealth Water Act.
In Walgett the dry river means the town must live on bore water indefinitely. Bore water is high in mineral content, especially sodium. It kills gardens and discolours basins and bathtubs. It comes out of the tap very warm – there’s no need to turn on the hot tap to have a shower, but there is also no chance for a cool drink.
Locals say bore water is not a long-term option as a drinking supply. Water restrictions mean no water can be used during daylight hours, and there are limits on washing, flushing of toilets and the use of evaporative air conditioners, even when with temperatures at extreme levels.
The fish kill and the heat have at least brought the problems of water management squarely into the consciousness of city dwellers.
The future of the Murray Darling basin is now a major issue in the upcoming federal and NSW elections.
Yuwalaraay cultural educator Daryl Ferguson has a message for politicians and voters alike.
“Everyone should take a leaf out of our culture – it is about looking after the land.
“Everyone says “this is mine, this is my part of the river, this is mine, mine, mine.”
“I’m not here to talk about ownership; that’s not our culture. You want to own it? That’s fine.
“Just look after it.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/25/when-the-river-runs-dry-the-australian-towns-facing-heatwave-and-drought

The last time the atmosphere contained as much carbon dioxide as it does now, birdlike dinosaurs roamed what was then a verdant landscape. The earth’s lushness was at least partly caused by the abundance of CO₂, which plants use for photosynthesis. That has led to the idea that more CO₂ in the atmosphere could create a literally greener planet. 
Today, plants and soil around the world absorb roughly a quarter of the greenhouse gases that humans release into the atmosphere, helping the Earth avoid some of the worst effects of climate change. In an ideal situation, as levels of carbon dioxide increased, plants would soak up more of these emissions, helping to fuel their growth.
But in a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature, researchers found that under a warming climate, rather than absorbing more greenhouse gas emissions, plants and soil may start absorbing less, accelerating the rate of change.

Fishing is not hydrology. In this case people's intuition can be wrong, as evident from the misinformation posted on this thread.

Not really, I along with xiphoid, understand it pretty well, unlike some other posters here. And based on your ""Wider rivers transport less water"" statement you don't understand how rivers behave either. Tides may back up water temporarily, but they do not effect the total water transported to the sea.

The point was that a deeper river as in any body of water will not freeze so quickly as a mud puddle. Surely you are not going to claim that the mud puddles in your street thaw before a river nearby. With the Thames estuary the embankments compressed the channel, making it swifter when it flows in as well as out. This led to greater movement because the high tides could not spread into the neighbouring streets and fields. Do you even know London? If you did you could see an example of this effect at the park along the Thames at Embankment. There is a water stairs that is at the bottom of Villiers Street. The Thames was thus wider at this point. Wider rivers more easily freeze along the banks and they also transport less water out to sea, as some of it overspills the streets/fields during high tide.

By the early 19th century, Britain’s climate was beginning to ameliorate a little. But as a final throwback, the winter of 1813-14 proved to be one of the coldest on record. January 1814 ranked as the third coldest ever: ahead even of 1963, but just behind 1795 and 1684.
As in previous very cold winters, the tidal stretch of the river froze over. January 1814 was also very snowy, while icebergs floated down the river and into the estuary damaging ships. It was also very foggy.
Not that the freezing weather deterred Londoners from enjoying themselves. Once again, they erected temporary gin-palaces on the ice, played games of skittles, danced to music, and even roasted whole oxen over open fires. Someone even walked an elephant across the river by Blackfriars Bridge.

Just for clarity you were the OP in this thread. 
For starters, you can adapt your journey to a museum if the train is cancelled but not if the museum is burnt down. 
In this case, your modern way of life and the economic precepts which these large corporations are founded just simply cannot exist in the conditions that are forecast from the minimum consequences of the climate change of the ppm where we are headed.
It is too big an issue to go into in detail and there are even extinction level event scenarios to cover but instead I will stick to the basics of where we are at now in the short-term:
Ocean dead zones:https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/44677/aquatic-dead-zones
These are growing and thing people only really discuss as relates past mass extinctions.
Ocean ecosystem collapse:

While the knock on effects to humans in cities is slow, it nonetheless represents a clear stressor upon all land ecosystems and things like cod once estimated the most abundant marine biomass by animal could risk vanishing.
From 400ppm we'd expect an eventual 20m sea level rise:
and the Geological record is grim:
BQSTART
""Atmospheric CO2 is currently just below 400 parts per million (ppm) on average. It last reached similar levels during the Pliocene (5.3-2.6 million years ago). At that time, temperatures rose to levels 2-3°C warmer than today, and sea level rose by up to 20m in places. Sea level takes a few hundred years to reach equilibrium in response to changes in atmospheric CO2 and temperature, which may explain why sea level has not yet risen to the same levels seen in the Pliocene. ""

and

BQSTART
""Recent estimates suggest CO2 levels reached as much as 415 parts per million (ppm) during the Pliocene. With that came global average temperatures that eventually reached 3 or 4 degrees C (5.4-7.2 degrees F) higher than today’s and as much as 10 degrees C (18 degrees F) warmer at the poles. Sea level ranged between five and 40 meters (16 to 131 feet) higher than today.""

This doesn't mean only places less than 20m above sea level are affected. Much of this will be form of flooding and soil degredation. Coupled with drought you'll see impacts on crop supply. 
For the amazon:""Future fire activity will also depend on anthropogenic factors especially related to land use change. For the Amazon it is estimated that at present 58% of the area is too humid to allow deforestation fires but climate change might reduce this area to 37% by 2050 (Le Page et al., 2010). Golding and Betts (2008) estimated that future Amazon forest vulnerability to fire may depend non-linearly on combined climate change and deforestation.""

""As of 15 April, the eruption was not large enough to have an effect on global temperatures like that of Mount Pinatubo and other major past volcanic eruptions.[88][89] One previous related sequence of eruptions of this volcano, beginning in 1821 is recorded as having lasted for over two years, but no single set of major eruptions is known to have lasted more than 'several days'. Should the eruption continue for a sufficient length of time at its current intensity, the potential remains for a temporary global cooling effect. By analogy, the Laki eruption has been linked with extreme weather events from severe hailstorms in Great Britain to the Mississippi River freezing at New Orleans.[90][91] Sulfate aerosols that reach the stratosphere catalyse the production of chlorine monoxide (ClO), which destroys ozone (O3). In the upper troposphere, the same aerosols become nuclei for cirrus clouds, which increase the Earth's albedo, thus altering its radiation balance.[92] Several eruptions during the past century have caused a decline in the average temperature at the Earth's surface of up to half a degree Celsius for periods of one to three years""

In 2018 the Guardian reported that farmers around the Bay of Bengal were driven by drought to fish the Bay and now fisheries there are collapsing and the migration from a population of hundreds of millions is beginning.
When climatic zones and rains cross borders now there will be people with guns on the other side who may not like those being forced to move. I believe India and perhaps one more country are now building walls to contain the population of Bangladesh which resides on the sinking Ganges River Delta. 
And half a billion people live on sinking river deltas while the protective deltas are eroding, sea level is rising, and maximum storm strength may be increasing.
We have to keep our greatest challenge front and center.

Its optimism. Even in the direst of circumstances, it is always able to find a silver lining.
Take climate change, for example. After weird weather and ominous warnings of more to come, many of us are freaking out about an environmental apocalypse. Indeed, a new poll shows record numbers of Americans are worried about climate change and, after last year’s heatwave, concerns about the issue have soared in Britain.
Now, it seems that big companies are equally worried about global warming, but they are thinking about the future with cool heads. Rather than being consumed by doom and gloom, or considering the idea that we should curb consumerism, corporations have realised climate change is an exciting business opportunity. You can see evidence of this in recent disclosures to CDP, a UK-based environmental reporting NGO that surveys companies on the “risks and opportunities” they face because of changing weather patterns. The 2018 disclosures, reported by Bloomberg last week, provide a fascinating insight into how some of the world’s largest corporations are, as Bloomberg puts it in a headline, “Getting Ready to Monetize Climate Change”.
Let’s start with the pharmaceutical industry, which is particularly well placed to profit from our dystopian future. As Merck notes in its disclosure to CDP, climate change may lead to “expanded markets for products for tropical and weather-related diseases including water-borne illness”. AbbVie sees similar opportunities, saying that its “immunology product line could see an increase in sales” as a result of more extreme conditions. And Eli Lilly, another large pharmaceutical company, cites research showing climate change may increase the risk of diabetes by “curtailing physical activity, disrupting traditional food supplies, and increasing food insecurity”. While that is sad and all, the upside for Eli Lilly is a potential increase in demand for its diabetes products.
It’s not just big pharma that sees dollar symbols in disaster. Honda reckons its generators may empower its consumers when the world’s infrastructure crumbles. The company notes that “the Katrina disaster was followed by a 27% increase in unit sales of [Honda] generators”. Meanwhile, the Home Depot is optimistic that, at the very least, it will sell more ceiling fans “should temperatures increase over time”.
The tech industry, as one would expect, is taking an innovative view of how an apocalypse may affect the bottom line. Apple thinks that “as people begin to experience severe weather events with greater frequency” they will become increasingly glued to their mobile phones. It notes that, as well as helping you check in with your loved ones, your iPhone can “serve as a flashlight”. Which takes the idea of seeing the bright side of a bad situation to a whole new level.
Apple also says that, if disaster strikes, you can charge your mobile device using “hand cranks”. Few people do that at the moment, but don’t be surprised if you see iCranks, Armageddon-proof iPhone chargers, hitting a store near you soon. All in all, Apple says that if it is “successful in creating products attractive to people whose purchasing habits are changing due to concerns about climate change” it could raise annual net sales by $2.3bn (£1.75bn). That’s something to be cheerful about as the ice melts, eh?
Anyway, while there are plenty more examples of corporate climate-change optimism, let’s skip to the moral of this story, which is that, when it comes to global warming, we should all be acting more like multinationals. Rather than worrying about the planet being destroyed, why not ask yourself how you can best monetise the rest of your time on Earth? Invest in big pharma. Get a hand crank. And don’t lose sleep over deforestation – after all, money doesn’t grow on trees.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/commentisfree/2019/jan/28/looking-on-the-bright-side-of-climate-change-think-of-all-the-money-corporations-can-make

Amid growing awareness of the environmental impact of livestock farming – and the benefits of reducing meat consumption – the British department store is the latest retailer to tap into the rising recognition of the benefits of eating insects on both nutritional and environmental grounds.
Basil fusilli pasta and raspberry and pumpkin seed granola – made from flour from ground buffalo worms – will go on sale in Selfridges’ food halls this week, along with dark chocolate and fig protein bars made with cricket flour.
The products have been developed by the specialist French brand Jimini’s, which sells through Spanish and German supermarkets and is aiming to expand its presence in the UK. The new products are exclusive to Selfridges.
Environmental experts have long recommended insects as a sustainable food source that could help end world hunger and reduce the damaging impact of meat production. Insects are also nutritious, containing essential proteins, fats, minerals and amino acids.
A regular portion of buckwheat pasta usually contains about 10g of protein, whereas Jimini’s insect fusilli contains 18g. Jimini’s cereal bars contain 20% protein and granola 14% – both products are blended with a selection of fruit and nuts for variety of texture. The products will be promoted in Selfridges initially in themed, pop-up “bug bars” but may remain on sale permanently.
Edward Goodman, the food buying director of Selfridges, said: “We are sure our epicurious customers will be surprised and delighted discovering the new range in store.”
In the UK, food choices are becoming increasingly important in the debate about how to counter climate change, reflected in the rise of “flexitarianism” whereby a largely vegetable-based diet is supplemented occasionally with meat.
In November, Sainsbury’s became the first major UK grocer to stock edible crickets – selling the roasted insects as snacks in small bags from the UK brand Eat Grub in 250 of its stores.
“Having sold over 10,000 packs of Eat Grub crickets in less than three months, we’re continuing to see Sainsbury’s customers explore edible insects as a new sustainable protein source,” said Katherine O’Sullivan, Sainsbury’s buying manager. “We’re always looking to provide our customers with new and exciting products such as these.”
The global edible insect market is forecast to exceed $520m (£395m) by 2023, according to recent research. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization said at least 2 billion people regularly consume insects and they could help meet the food needs of the world’s growing population.
More than 1,000 insect species are eaten around the world but they hardly feature in the diets of many rich nations. In the UK, crickets and other insects have so far been predominantly limited to quirky pop-ups or sales through online outlets and feature on a few restaurant menus.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/29/insects-worm-their-way-into-selfridges-food-hall-in-bug-bars

The Campaign to Protect Rural England’s recent report on this very issue echoed many of these concerns, highlighting that soil degradation costs at least £1.2bn a year in England and Wales alone. Soil must be seen not only as a fundamental for delivering productive farming and a healthy countryside, but also critical to tackling climate change – or mitigating its worst effects. Its importance should not be understated.
There are solutions, however. By scaling up and incentivising farmers to switch to nature-friendly farming techniques, such as conservation agriculture and agroforestry, we will create a productive farming industry that works with nature and enables farmers to reduce their costs, while still producing the food and services that we need. Rebuilding biological life in soils is vital to enabling this life-giving asset to function as it should. Our soil will once again effectively lock in carbon, store and filter water, support ecosystems and restore the health of the natural environment.Graeme WillisSenior rural policy campaigner at the Campaign to Protect Rural England 
• On page 3 of the Journal I read “the modern western diet needs a complete overhaul if we are to avoid potential ecological catastrophe” (Eat less meat – and redraw the entire global food system, 28 January). And on page 10: “Can we feed the world if we ditch intensive farming?”
Both of these concerns are predicated on a global population in excess of 10 billion people by 2050. Might it not be easier to persuade people to have slightly fewer children than it would be to move the western world on to a diet of nuts and berries? Of course it would also help to reduce our CO2 emissions and our carbon footprint.Melvyn RustSt Albans, Hertfordshire

Each plant has 15 or more tillers, or stalks, and the grains hang heavy from them. The Thai farmer says this will be his best-ever harvest in 30 years and he will reap it four weeks earlier than usual.
It is very different on the other side of the field. Here, Junpeng planted his rice in closely spaced clumps of 20 or more seedlings in shallow water just as he, his father and millions of other small farmers across south-east Asia have always done. He used the same seeds but the conventionally grown plants are wind-battered and thin, and clearly have fewer, smaller grains.
Junpeng is part of a pilot project to see if it’s possible to grow more rice with less water and fewer greenhouse gases. The dramatic difference between his two crops points a way to help the world’s 145 million small rice farmers, and could also greatly reduce global warming emissions from agriculture.
The project, backed by the German and Thai governments and by some of the world’s largest rice traders and food companies, has seen 3,000 other farmers in this corner of Thailand’s “rice basket” near the Cambodian border trained to grow sustainable rice according to the principles of a revolutionary agronomical system discovered by accident in Madagascar in the 1980s.
Jesuit priest Henri de Lalanié working in the highlands observed that by planting far fewer seeds than usual, using organic matter as a fertiliser and keeping the rice plants alternately wet and dry rather than flooded, resulted in yields that were increased by between 20 and 200%, while water use was halved. Giving plants more oxygen, minimising the competition between them and strictly controlling the water they receive is thought to make them stronger and more resilient to flood and drought.
When it was first employed outside Madagascar in 2000, the system of rice intensification (SRI) was dismissed  by a handful of scientists who questioned the legitimacy of the reported increased yields. But since then, it has evolved and been developed by peasant farmers working in many different climates around the world.
Academic criticism has since all but disappeared and the SRI system of farming has been validated in hundreds of scientific papers and adopted by up to 20 million farmers in 61 countries, according to the SRI information centre in Cornell University.
“The results consistently cite yield increases, decreased use of seed, water and chemicals, and increased income,” says Norman Uphoff, professor of global agriculture at Cornell.
Vietnamese, Cambodian, Nepalese, Filipino, Indian and African farmers have all reported large increases. In 2011, a young Indian farmer broke the world record for rice production, harvesting 22 tonnes from a single hectare (2.47 acres).
“SRI is very positive in west Africa. It uses fewer seed and fertilisers and needs less water. Farmers saved up to 80% of the cost of seed and got increased yields and incomes. They see the advantages and they change. People are teaching each other now,” says Professor Bancy Mati, director of the water research centre at Jomo Kenyatta University in Nairobi, Kenya.
The Thai farmers who took part in the Ubon Ratchathani trial say they are delighted. Says Khampha Bunchansee from Noan Dang village: “It was very easy to learn. I will use the extra money to invest in a tractor. If I can do it, anyone can. Everyone can come and learn.”
“I applied more fertiliser on my conventional crop but it produced lots more leaf but not more grain,” says Wanna Sriwila, also from Noan Dang. “Now I bring other farmers to see what can be done. Seeing is believing.”
But what is now exciting some of the world’s largest food corporations and governments is that growing rice along SRI principles also greatly reduces emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas methane, which escapes when rice, or any other crop, lies waterlogged for weeks at a time.
Methane is roughly 30 times more powerful than CO2 as a greenhouse gas, and rice emits as much as 1.5% of the world’s total greenhouse gas emissions. With the human population in south-east Asia expected to grow by around 100m people in the next 20 years, emissions from rice growing could increase 30% or more.
The urgency to act for the global good, self-interest in maintaining production and the possibility of accessing money to reduce farm emissions has now led heavy rice-using food companies like Mars and Kellogg’s, and the agri-business colossus Olam, to set up the Sustainable Rice Platform (SRP).
This coalition of companies, NGOs and governments sets the world’s first voluntary sustainability standards for rice growing. It adopts the basic SRI principle of planting seedlings further apart, and keeping them moist rather than flooded, but adds targets and measurements to provide consistency.
“Rice is both a victim and a cause of climate change,” says Sunny Verghese, CEO of Singapore-based Olam’s, which grows its own rice on 25,000 acres in Nigeria, owns mills and processing plants across south-east Asia and ships nearly 20% of the world’s globally traded rice.
“South-east Asian rice farmers are among the world’s most vulnerable to climate change impacts such as rising sea levels, salinity, temperature rise and droughts. Yields can decrease as much as 10% for each 1C temperature increase, threatening food security for billions of people.
“With another two billion people we cannot carry on the way we are. We must go beyond what is currently being done and achieve far more at greater scale. We must re-imagine the whole food supply chain if the world is to become carbon neutral by 2050,” he says.
“SRI should influence everyone’s thinking. In Nigeria we saw a 70% increase in yields, albeit from a low base. SRI is revolutionary. It is a genuine change in thinking. It is difficult for scientists to understand that an amateur [like Lalanié] should have a solution. We want to partner with SRI, to scale up in Africa.
“But reducing emissions from rice cannot be a trade-off that hurts farmers and communities who depend on it for their income and sustenance. We have to measure the true cost of food and dismantle the subsidy system.”
Working with German development agency GIZ and south-east Asian governments, Olam now plan to roll out SRP rice to 100,000 farmers in Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and India within five years, increasing yields and incomes, and reducing methane emissions by 50%.
Governments and global bodies must act too, says tropical agronomist Erika Styger, director of climate-resilient farming systems at Cornell University who led a three-year World Bank study of 50,000 farmers using SRI methods in 13 west African countries. This saw a 56% rise in yields in irrigated areas, an 86% increase in rain-fed areas and an average 41% increase in income.
“The SRI revolution is happening. People are changing their practices and you can see SRI in the field in many places now. There is no reason why SRI should not become normal agronomic practice,” says Styger.
“But there is no long term funding. If we want to make it mainstream it needs to get to a critical mass. We are left with breadcrumbs, with only short-term project finding,” she says.
“The food system is broken. Olam on its own cannot fix it, we can only change it. We can’t do it overnight but there is a new way of collaborating. Companies must change and reduce their resource intensity. The whole food sector must change,” says Verghese.
“What is needed now is large retailers to brand SRP. It’s the way we can reduce emissions, use less water and grow more. Win. Win. Win.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/jan/30/miracle-method-sustainable-rice-scientists-dismissed

In response to ComfortablyPlumb ""And I suspect that the reason why many hot countries like the UAE are deploying nuclear that is usually confined to cold ones (as well as solar etc)"". 
BQSTART
The UAE (United Arab Emirates) is a country of 9.5 million people in area of 84,000 square km (compared with 5 million Queenslanders in a state of 1,850,000 square km) at a similar latitude to Southern Queensland. For obvious reasons fresh water hydro is not an option but there is some mountainous country in the north-east not far from the Arabian Gulf.
BQEND
BQENDI really don't understand why you feel compelled to 'write out' what I've said as if it's explanation or correction.
I think it's safe to assume that we both know what UAE stands for - and the subject we are discussing.
We both have the internet, there's no need and no point to be scored that way.
UAE is an example of cost and environment - I'm not saying that every nut and bolt should be copied.
BQSTART
The UAE has the fifth largest natural gas reserves in the world so dispatchable electricity from gas turbines is an option. Despite an absence of coal reserves in the UAE, Dubai's coal fired Hassyan Project currently under construction will supply 3,600 MW of generating capacity most likely using coal imported from nearby Iran.
BQENDThe subject, should you choose to accept it, is cutting emissions.
The question isn't 'how not to have nuclear' the question is 'how to substantially cut emissions'

The UAE has 11,500 MW of gas turbine generation capacity at a six locations throughout the country.

""Whilst I 'think' Australia is a country best set for a renewables 'only' platform, I suspect the cost of making the grid capable of handling that on the necessary scale will stifle the role out of utility scale renewables.""
The question isn't whether nuclear costs more than wind or solar (or coal) - it probably does.

BQSTART
Currently in Australia the cost of maintaining and expanding the transmission and distribution grid contributes 54% of the retail cost of electricity. That cost has little to do with the cost of adapting the grid to accommodate the installation of renewable
BQENDThe question is whether nuclear costs more than [insert renewable]+storage+grid enlargement/strengthening costs.
BQSTART
One at a time. 
Frequency controls ""as the grid, which is dominated by thermal coal, becomes increasingly asynchronous (fewer thermal plants with frequency damping steam turbines) then the more frequency controls (such as the small 100MW Tesla in SA) there will be"" battery bank ""in SA"" has successfully dealt with frequency fluctuations caused by problems outside South Australia including problems with aging coal fired power stations in Victoria.
BQEND
BQENDNobody said otherwise -
BTW: there's no need to paraphrase my question in long hand.
The reason why EFR is necessary is because more generation will be intermittent.So as Australia (hopefully comes off its >70% coal) then more EFR will be required.
The fact that it works 'now' is a reflection of the fact that Australia has very little grid side asynchronous generation.
So unless you're saying that Australia intends to install no new renewables then you need to accept that more renewables means a requirement for more FFR/EFR
It does not need saying that such systems have to be paid for - 
BQSTART
 
BQSTART
""Snowy River 2.0"" is a planned 2,000 MW capacity readily dispatchable stored hydro scheme.
BQEND
BQENDAgain, no neet to explain.
The point is that is a grid stability cost related to intermittency.
.... not free
BQSTART
 
BQSTART
""HVDC links to shunt power from state to state from where it is to where it isn't"" don't play a large role in linking state grid to state grid with the exception of one from the Victorian Riverland to the South Australian Riverland, but HVAC (high voltage alternating current) links do, though most of those were built using federal funding during the Hawke/Keating years and are likely due for an upgrade. Power is shunted during heatwaves such as recently occurred from Queensland to New South Wales and from South Australia to Victoria and from Tasmania to Victoria when the largely coal based generating capacity of New South Wales and Victoria could not meet demand.
BQEND
BQENDand again, you really don't need to explain what it is - the point is that Australia is coming off coal and onto a more intermittent supply which has a direct correlation with storage and gas/diesel back-fill.

Walsunda - It is not the question because to significantly decrease CO2 emissions large amounts of storage are not needed (particularly in countries with large gas reserves)
BQEND
Well, quite. A renewables grid locks in gas.
A wind+solar+gas calculation based on UK wind statistics (e.g. Table 6 here) shows that if you have enough gas capacity to meet 100% of UK consumption over a year, then — even with additional solar — 20% of generation ends up being gas as backup for wind lulls. That gives you an aggregate carbon intensity of 113g CO₂/kWh for the electricity system as a whole.
The UK emissions target is 50g CO₂/kWh. 
Using gas as backup for wind lulls won't decarbonise electricity. That's a well-known and uncontentious point.

You attack off-shore wind prices, and misrepresent the lowest prices (which are £57 not £75), just as costs continue to fall further and faster. You claim future installs will cost more:

One at a time.
Frequency controls ""such as the small 100 MW Teasla"" battery bank ""in SA"" has successfully dealt with frequency fluctuations caused by problems outside South Australia including problems with aging coal fired power stations in Victoria.
""Snowy River 2.0"" is a planned 2,000 MW capacity readily dispatchable stored hydro scheme.
""HVDC links to shunt power from state to state from where it is to where it isn't"" don't play a large role in linking state grid to state grid with the exception of one from the Victorian Riverland to the South Australian Riverland, but HVAC (high voltage alternating current) links do, though most of those were built using federal funding during the Hawke/Keating years and are likely due for an upgrade. Power is shunted during heatwaves such as recently occurred from Queensland to New South Wales and from South Australia to Victoria and from Tasmania to Victoria when the largely coal based generating capacity of New South Wales and Victoria could not meet demand.
""Then there's the grid costs of getting power from frequently remote wind and solar farms"" to consumers.
Where are wind and solar farms more remote from consumers than coal fired power stations? Solar panels on my roof are definitely not remote from their consumers 3 metres below or at most 50 metres down the street. Solar farms on the Darling Downs are no more remote from the 3.4 million consumers in South East Queensland than the Tarong Power outside Nanango. Solar farms and wind farms in North and Far North Queensland are closer to the 300,000 consumers north of Mackay than the Stanwell power station in Rockhampton.
Also there are economies of small scale and reduced transmission distance inherent in wind and solar for areas with small spread out populations.

If your roof generates [n]kwh a day and you store it for the evening instead of exporting it then the most you will offset generation is [n]kwh a day - unless of course you go away for the night or on holiday in which case that power is lost rather then being exported to the local supply where it would offset someone else's aircon.

BQENDThere is no rule that says that addressing AGW will be economic - there's nothing economic about EFRs and storage for solar/wind etc - but it is a critical expenditure that renewables rely on to work, the cost of which is never mentioned in the same breath as the cost of generation.
So the question isn't whether nuclear costs more than wind or solar (or coal) - it probably does.
The question is whether nuclear costs more than [insert renewable]+storage+grid enlargement/strengthening costs.

Australia needs nuclear if it is to keep the power on. 
The mention of batteries is a sure sign that the commentator doesn't have a clue.
BQENDWhy would you want nuclear when renewables are a fraction of the cost in Australia. And nuclear is far more expensive than RE + storage.
Look at one of the comments in last weeks 'Carbon Commentary' newsletter from Chris Goodall:
BQSTART
Cost of solar and wind. NextEra, a US utility that is one of the world’s largest developers of renewable energy said that the company sees ‘the beginning of the next phase of renewables development (that) pairs low-cost wind and solar energy with a low-cost battery storage solution'. ‘With continued technology improvements and cost declines, we expect that without incentives, wind is going to be a $0.02 to $0.025 per kilowatt per hour product, and solar is going to be $0.025 to $0.03 per kilowatt hour product early in the next decade. Combining these extremely low cost with one-half to three-quarter cent added for a four-hour storage system, will create a nearly renewable generation resource that is cheaper than the operating cost of coal, nuclear and less fuel-efficient oil and gas-fired generation units’.
BQEND
So, in US dollars, we have the UK rolling out new nuclear late next decade at $130/MWh, v's wind and PV with 4hrs storage early next decade at between $25 and $38 per MWh.
So you actually want to spend 3-5 times more for your leccy than you have to, do you?

For those of us that support RE (not nuclear campaigners) we can clearly see that demand side storage, even in homes, benefits the national grids through offset, after all, if a powerstation (even a small domestic PV system) is added to 'the grid' then it's supply will impact the grid.
If a homeowner doesn't ask for a kW of power, or their neighbours don't need it because the 'small powerstation' is exporting next door, then the national grid doesn't get asked for that kW.
Once you put maths tricks, or deliberate anti-RE and anti-storage spin aside, you see that domestic storage benefits all. And the big benefit is that the CAPEX is borne by the household, not the grid for the batts.
I note that in Aus, households with storage can join schemes that negotiate on their behalf to provide additional supply to the grids during peak periods by having 1,000's of households export from their batts. Not only do the households get paid peak prices for that leccy, but all of Aus benefits as the increased supply helps to reduce peak prices.

""Not one developed nation has a plan for renewables only. Why do you think that is?"" 
No imagination combined with vested interests
BQENDYou are probably right, and of course these 'not 100% RE options' are government plans, whereas many, many studies show that RE + storage costs would be cheaper as prices tumble.
The fun part now is that as fast as some folk argue against RE + storage on cost grounds, we see RE + storage being deployed at cheap and ever cheaper prices, so it looks like intraday RE + storage is sorted.
Then we need to consider longer term storage, such as CAES, LAES, PHS etc, but let's not forget bio-methane as that has a low cost of storage, and can be used to demand follow when burnt as gas generation if necessary. That is reaching efficiencies of ~80% now, so a great way to store Aussie sunshine.
Power-to-gas with high efficiency
So, we can expect something like 50% of PV gen to be consumed at time of generation, perhaps 25% consumed via high efficiency intraday battery storage, so about 25% consumed as gas generation from bio-methane at 40% efficiency (80% x 50% gas efficiency).
The fun bit here though is even at 40% efficiency the PV (via gas generation) is still far cheaper than nuclear, with the UK paying out A$180/MWh with the planned new nuclear at HPC, whilst Aus can expect sub A$40/MWh for PV generation, which even at 40% efficiency (on that part) is still only A$100/MWh.
Or a weighted average of A$180/MWh nuclear v's A$57.50/MWh* for PV.

Currently in Australia the cost of maintaining and expanding the transmission and distribution grid contributes 54% of the retail cost of electricity. That cost has little to do with the cost of adapting the grid to accommodate the installation of renewables but much to do with changing patterns of demand peaks and troughs including the uptake of domestic airconditioning. Large 80% increases in network costs have occurred in the last decade or so independent of any cost of adapting the network to renewable sources of electricity. 
One source of renewable energy, rooftop solar, has reduced the need to increase network transmission capacity as it uses little to none of the network at times of peak demand due to airconditioner use. Rooftop solar capacity in Queensland is currently equivalent in output to one of our large black coal fired power stations. Large utility scale concentrations of photovoltaic panels such as are being rolled out in Queensland and large scale wind farms such as as being built in southern Australia and North Queensland require no more additional grid upgrade than a coal, gas or nuclear plant of similar capacity.
Australia is a major exporter of uranium with the world's largest uranium mine in South Australia. A inquiry into the nuclear industry options possible for that state found that, at least for the next two decades, a nuclear power plant to supply power to the 1.7 million South Australians was uneconomic.

In the UK Hitachi was bid at £75/MWh the same as the 2023 price for near shore offshore wind. Deep water will cost considerably more.
BQENDAs usual you misrepresent the facts.
The Hitachi bid was not £75/MWh, it was £75/MWh plus £5bn of direct investment in the build costs by the UK government.
£75/MWh over 35yrs, against an expected £50/MWh wholesale price is an additional subsidy of £25/MWh, or approx £23bn, so a total subsidy/contribution cost of £28bn.
Whereas the 2022/23 off-shore wind price is only £57.50/MWh, and only for 15yrs, so comes to about £5bn in total subsidies if we match generation for generation. £5bn v's £28bn in subsidies, despite off-shore wind being relatively new, and only having had support for a decade, whereas nuclear is 'old' and has received vast subsidies in the UK (and worldwide) for about 60yrs.
The higher price of £75/MWh is actually for the 2021/22 pot that was issued at the same time. But you know that, and choose instead to quote the higher price.
I'd also point out that up to the last auction, even the day before the £57.50/MWh result, you were still posting this misleading claim:

BQEND
Posting it despite myself and others pointing out to you for nearly a year, that it was old and outdated.
Now you pretend that costs for more off-shore wind will be more expensive, when the government itself expects even cheaper bids this spring and has capped bids at £56 & £53/MWh for the two time periods - yet you (again) suggest much higher costs.
UK offshore capped at €63/MWh for next auction

The ""nuclear industry"" has spent nearly 80 years researching ""SAFE"" storage ""possibilities"", none have worked so far, and all methods to determine practicability of storing toxic residue for the necessary thousands of years are reliant upon generations upon generations upon generations maintaining the necessary security regime to keep these toxins safe.
BQENDin short, there are three relatively straight forward options.
1/. recycle it with FBR/MSRs, and generate clean, green, electricity (this is the only vector for physically getting rid of it if ... you want to)2/. Bury it - coal and gas (and uranium) were fine there for tens of millions of years.3./ Leave it in a pile for our children to deal with.
The objections to it are political and ideological objections - not technical.Needless to say, much of the narrative against nuclear is fed by the fossil fuel industry.
Industry comparison:Let us not forget that all industries produce waste - there are few industries whereby the ingestion of a small part of its waste stream would not kill you.Arsenic, for example, does not break down.Par exemplar the waste from solar pv is literally the larger issue (as volume grows as an issue) and old solar pv is uncontrolled in disposal but can poison a water supplies.There are no controls on it.
So at present it is far more a likely problem than the tiny quantities of HL nuclear waste from power, medicine and industry.

The problem is that Australia's grid requires massive expansion and strengthening to make that work - yet the public refuse to pay for it whilst at the same time asking their politicians where the renewable generation is.
Nuclear has the advantage that it is a direct replacement for coal because it uses the existing grid infrastructure.
So if Australia decides (as it seems to have done) that spending hundreds of billions updating their grid to accommodate renewables is too much, then they could use renewables to limit demand and have their baseload (literally: the minimum demand requirement) met with some nuclear.
Australia already has industrial/commercial nuclear, it just doesn't use it for power.
The change from coal will not be free, but then there's no rule that says that addressing AGW is free.

Nuclear is just too expensive. It cannot compete with renewables on any measure
BQENDIt's wrong to think of it as a competition.
Coal is a base load provider.Nuclear is a baseload provider.Intermittent supplies are not.Intermittent supplies with storage get some of the way there but still require gas backup.
So if Nuclear is a direct replacement for coal and gas (with no expensive [often non existent] extras then nuclear kills coal and gas/ - wind and solar do not.
So if anything if we got rid of nuclear then it would be a huge boost to coal and gas.
Par exemplar, the German phase out of nuclear was a huge boon to the coal sector who far from closing down, opened new coal plants and new lignite coal strip mines through forests and villages to balance the removal of nuclear.
So it isn't nuclear /vs/ renewables, it is nuclear PLUS renewables in a mix.
The UK is completely off coal by 2022/5 using a mix of RE+nuclear and no marked increase in cost.Germany is opening new coal power stations and have some of the most expensive electricity.
Australia is 70% coal.

In the UK Hitachi was bid at £75/MWh the same as the 2023 price for near shore offshore wind.Deep water will cost considerably more.
And contrary to reports that it was cancelled, the only reason why that project paused is while they find a finance partner.

Sounds like you need CAES -mention in post. I'm sure Australia has the best solar in the world but needs compressed air storage to keep it running night and day
BQENDCAES is very inefficient - you can incrrease the eficiency if you link it up to an LNG plant but we want to come off those.
But that's an aside - the fact is that Australia's grid is not set up for renewables - intermittent power needs storage but it also needs a bi directional grid and hugely expensive trunk lines to move power from where it's working to where it isn't.
Whether CAES, Pumped Hydro, Batteries or whatever the grid requires a complete reconfiguration to work like that and the Australian public has already made it clear that they have no tolerance for spending money on the grid - and that limits the amount of renewables which can go on it.

Chris Uhlmann and Alan Moran blamed the high prices on wind power, Pauline Hanson called for people to use more power and Judith Sloan called demand management a bribe.
There were three notable things that happened with our energy system during what will become the new normal of extreme heat. 
At the end of last week it was hot. Like, record-breaking, fry an egg on the pavement hot. Many parts of South Australian and Victoria faced their hottest days on record.
As Australians tried their best to stay cool, almost everyone who had an air conditioner switched it on and we experienced a “peak demand” event. This is a period where our electricity system is stretched to its limit and wholesale electricity prices reach their peak.

As our planet warms we can expect more days like Thursday and Friday. While we still have time to avert the worst impacts of climate change, some warming is now locked in and that means the heatwaves we have experienced more than once already this summer are now an inevitable part of Australia’s future.
So what should we do about it?
Australia needs to get serious about reducing climate pollution, which continues to rise and do our contribution to stop runaway global warming.
We can improve our houses and building so they better manage the heat. Australian houses are sometimes called leaky tents; they let in the heat in summer and the cold in winter.
It doesn’t have to be this way. Insulation, double-glazing, draft proofing, better building standards, all these things will keep your house passively cool and reduce (though not eliminate) the amount of air conditioning you need. It’s not rocket science, but currently we aren’t doing any of this.
We can also upgrade our air conditioners to be more energy efficient. According to energy analyst Tristan Edis, new air conditioners use half the electricity of the majority of air conditioners that were installed in the early 2000s. On hot days, this would make a significant difference.
Our coal and gas plants are ageing. As they age, they breakdown and need maintenance more often. Last week was a case in point. In Victoria, Yallourn power station took one of its units offline for maintenance and another had to be taken offline unexpectedly early Friday morning. Also in Victoria, Loy Yang A had a boiler tube leak just before the heatwave hit and was out for the duration. In New South Wales, Liddell and the Tallawarra gas plants were both offline for many days due to unplanned faults.
These six coal and gas units totalling 2,225MWs of capacity were not available for at least some of the period of Australia’s most intensive heatwave on record.
This is at best a sign that our coal plants are getting old and can’t be relied on at peak times and at worst it was price-gouging behaviour by some of Australia’s largest energy companies.
We need to get serious about demand response. Demand response is when households and industry are paid not to use electricity for some nonessential operations for a period of time. While this isn’t a great idea all year round, for a few hours on a few days a year it’s the cheapest and most effective way of maintaining an electricity system. This is standard practice in the US and Europe where they even have markets for demand response. This is urgently needed here, but was resisted by rule-maker, the Australian Electricity Market Commission (AEMC), until late last year.
We also need to continue to build new electricity supply in the form of solar, wind, battery storage, pumped hydro and similar.
At the end of last week we experienced two types of blackouts. First there were localised blackouts affecting about 25,000 households in South Australia on Thursday night. These were due to fuses blowing in our distribution infrastructure. These fuses are designed to blow when infrastructure gets too hot so that it isn’t damaged. This was the electricity system working as it should. It isn’t surprising given the record temperatures.
The second type of blackout experienced was “load shedding”. This is where the market operator temporarily cuts off some energy users from the system to ensure “system integrity” and to ensure it doesn’t fail catastrophically. In Victoria on Friday afternoon, 160,000 customers were blacked-out over a two-to-three-hour period.
Load shedding is the action of last resort and Aemo did everything it could before taking this path. It fired up emergency reserves, asked big energy users to power down and appealed to us to lower our electricity use.
Australia’s electricity system is incredibly reliable, typically exceeding our reliability standard of 99.998%. That basically means that the electricity supply needed is available 99.998% of the time.
Almost all blackouts in Australia (96.6% according to the AEMC) are because of faults in the poles and wires. What happened on Friday was very rare – only 0.2% of blackouts occur because there isn’t enough operational generation in the system.
However, particularly for people suffering health conditions as well as older and younger people, power outages are dangerous and they aren’t good for business either.
So what should we do about it?
We need more on-demand capacity – there is need for storage (batteries and pumped hydro) and dispatchable solutions (concentrating solar thermal and demand response), that can turn on and ramp up quickly.
Renewables (hydro, solar and wind) account for about 20% of generation in the National Electricity Market, higher in South Australia. Over the two-day period in question, renewables averaged higher than 20% generation and on Friday afternoon, when power was needed most, a combination of hydro, wind and solar provided over one-third of Victoria and South Australia’s power.
However, while wind and solar will provide the bulk of our annual electricity need in the future, there is need for on-demand solutions. These solutions will fill the gaps in the two to six hours overnight where there is a lull in the wind, or when forecasts (demand or supply) are wrong.
The good news is that CSIRO and Aemo have found that just such solutions – wind and solar backed by batteries and pumped hydro are also the cheapest new-build options to deliver reliable, clean electricity supply.
We need to recognise climate change is causing more heatwaves which brings increased risk of localised blackouts and even load shedding. We need to start adapting to this new normal. One strategy to do this would be to create community cool zones where people can go to stay cool in extreme heat. These cool zones should have backup power that means they will stay cool even during blackouts.
Finally, we also need to have strategies for giving people, particularly vulnerable people, more notice of potential blackouts. If we get serious about demand management there will be better systems in place to provide this notice to people and even incentives and support for folks to go to the movies or a community cool zone.
While we can never have an electricity system that is 100% reliable, there are straightforward policy and engineering solutions that can increase our electricity system’s resilience to climate change in the future.

There has also been insufficient progress in agriculture to stop harmful practices that increase carbon dioxide production, and heavy industry is not doing enough to use energy more efficiently, according to analysis carried out by the World Resources Institute thinktank.
Without progress on all these fronts, the world is unlikely to see global greenhouse gas emissions peak in 2020, which is likely to be necessary to stay within the 1.5C or 2C warming thresholds that scientists have identified as key to the future safety of the planet.
But the analysis also found important steps forward, on renewable energy, curtailing greenhouse gas emissions from shipping, and public sector investment in reducing emissions. These suggest progress in other aspects of tackling climate change is also possible, with greater effort from the public and private sectors.
The WIR looked at six key goals that have been pegged as necessary to cause emissions to peak in 2020 and achieve the targets of the 2015 Paris agreement. They include goals on energy, transport, land use, industry, infrastructure and finance.
The report found that renewable energy accounted for about a quarter of global electricity generation in 2017, and more than two-thirds of new power generation capacity. By 2020, electricity from renewables is likely to be consistently cheaper than fossil fuel energy, making it possible that 30% of electricity could come from renewable sources by 2030, one of the Mission2020 milestones.
But coal-fired generation is still increasing, with coal-fired power plants continuing to be built in some areas, while existing plants are not being removed from service fast enough. Electric vehicles, meanwhile, comprise 1.4% of overall sales, making a 2020 milestone of 15% of new car sales hard to reach.
The goals are the work of Mission 2020, a global coalition of several climate analysis organisations, headed by Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief who negotiated the Paris accord. Mission 2020 has calculated that if these milestones are achieved by 2020, it will make the longer-term Paris goals possible – because progress now on reducing emissions will make it easier and cheaper to reduce them in the longer term – and wants to spur sufficient progress on climate change to bring that about.
Figueres is attending the World Economic Forum in Davos to press political and business leaders for more support for climate change initiatives. She said: “The impacts [of climate change] have never been as clear, nor action so urgent, as we are quickly approaching tipping points of no return. It would follow, then, that leaders everywhere should now be discussing this number one concern as their number one priority.”
She added: “The decisions we take over the next two to three years are crucial for the unprecedented structural changes we must embark on to safeguard our climate and clean up our air. This is the make it or break it opportunity we have, knowing that the world is expected to invest about $90tn on infrastructure in the period up to 2030, with much of this investment to be programmed in the next few years.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/22/analysis-warns-lack-progress-2020-global-emissions-target

According to the World Meteorological Organisation, last year was the fourth hottest on record and confirms a trend of rising temperatures that is a clear signal that we are having an effect on the climate. Droughts, floods, fiercer storms and heatwaves, as well as sea level rises, are all expected to increase markedly as a result.
Late in the year there was also the starkest warning yet from scientists of what our future will be if we allow climate change to take hold. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the global body of the world’s leading climate scientists, which has been producing regular reports on the state of climate science since 1988, produced its latest comprehensive overview examining what the future will look like if we undergo 1.5C (2.7F) of warming.
That does not sound like a lot – most people would be hard put to notice a temperature difference of 1.5C – but in climate terms, 1.5C above pre-industrial levels is enough to take us into the danger zone. It would see the mass die-off of coral reefs, the extinction of some species, rising sea levels, wet areas of the world becoming wetter and dry areas drier, and the decline of agricultural productivity across swaths of the globe.
That is a future we should obviously try to avoid. But the UN climate conference in Poland that ended the year’s climate-related events in December showed little sign that the urgency of the scientists’ warnings had been heeded. Instead, countries discussed a “rulebook” for putting the 2015 Paris agreement into practice, including such arcane matters as how countries measure and verify their emissions, and how often they should report on them, and rows over carbon credits.
In Poland, there were no firm commitments to ramp up countries’ national targets in line with scientific advice, and this is unlikely to happen before 2020 at the earliest. On current national emissions-cutting targets, we are in for about 3C of warming. Yet the IPCC warned that if we want to avoid 1.5C of warming, we have about 12 years to bring global emissions under control and swiftly move to just half of their current level. That represents a massive shift needed in the global economy, and yet emissions worldwide look to be moving upward again slightly after a decade in which they showed signs of stabilising.
There was also bad news from the US at the talks, which played little part as Donald Trump prepares to withdraw from the Paris agreement, except to hold a side event at the conference celebrating a bright future for coal.
Looked at this way, the omens from 2018 were not good. Fortunately, however, 2019 may indeed be a breakthrough year. Public opinion is mobilising around the world and politicians and businesses are paying attention. There will be a series of high-profile events that will engage the public and governments and may provide a better way forward than was managed last year.
Chief among them is the promise of António Guterres, the UN secretary general, to hold a summit for world leaders that will require them to face up to the dangers of climate change head on. Guterres is uncompromising, warning in Poland that it would be “immoral and suicidal” not to take firm and urgent action commensurate with the scale of the problem.
Leaders will be put on the spot, and will come under very public pressure as coalitions of civil society groups seek to put their case around the summit and in the lead-up to it. The role of women, who are among the most vulnerable to climate change, will be highlighted, and the role of young people, who will have to live with the consequences of their elders’ mistakes in a warming world.
The French president, Emmanuel Macron, is also holding a One World Summit, planned for the summer, at which the focus will be on persuading businesses to take a leading role, investing in projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and changing the way they use energy.
There are clear signs of hope on climate change also in the rapidly falling cost of renewable energy technology, which is now competitive with fossil fuels. And the Keep it in the ground campaign has succeeded in encouraging many investors to move their money out of fossil fuel stocks.
But most of all the civil society campaigns which have ramped up in 2018 and look set to increase their momentum in the coming year are taking effect. Public opinion around the world is that our leaders, governments and businesses should be doing more on this vital issue. This can be seen in some unexpected ways, such as the rise of veganism and flexitarian eating, as people seek to reduce their impact on the climate from eating meat. Through well-publicised and effective movements and actions, more and more people are refusing silently to acquiesce in ignoring the dangers to the climate.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/02/climate-change-environment-2019-future-reasons-hope

I assume I’ve fallen far enough that I’ve pulled my climbing partner, Sean, into the crevasse with me. This is what it’s like to die in the mountains, a voice in my head tells me.
Just as my mind completes that thought, the rope wrenches my climbing harness up. I bounce languidly up and down as the dynamic physics inherent in the rope play themselves out. Somehow Sean has checked my fall while still on the surface of the glacier.
I brush the snow and chunks of ice from my hair, arms and chest and pull down the sleeves of my shirt. Finding my glacier glasses hanging from the pocket of my climbing bib, I tuck them away. I check myself for injuries and, incredibly, find none. Assessing my situation, I find there’s no ice shelf nearby to ease the tension from the rope, so Sean will not be able to begin setting up a pulley system to extract me.
I look down. Nothing but blackness. I look at the wall of blue ice directly in front of me, take a deep breath and peer up at the tiny hole I made when I fell through the snow bridge spanning the crevasse – the same bridge Sean had crossed without incident as we made our way up Alaska’s Matanuska Glacier towards Mount Marcus Baker in the Chugach Range.
“You get to look down one more time, then that’s it,” I tell myself out loud.
Again, there’s only the black void yawning beneath me, swallowing everything, even sound. My stomach clenches. I remind myself to breathe.
“Sean, are you OK?” I yell as I clamp my mechanical ascenders to the rope in preparation to climb up.
“Yeah, I’m all right, but I’m right on the edge,” he calls back. “I can’t set up an anchor, so we’re just going to have to wait for the other guys to catch up.”
Time passes. The onset of hypothermia means I can’t control my body from periodically shaking. To ignore my fear of dying, I gaze meditatively at the ice a few feet in front of me as I dangle.
The miniature air pockets found in the whiter ice near the top of the glacier have long since been compressed, producing the mesmerising beauty of centuries-old turquoise ice. Slightly deeper into the crevasse is ice that has been there since long before the Neanderthals.
I hang suspended in silence, mindful not to move for fear of dislodging Sean. Giving my full attention to the ice immediately within my vision, I focus on how the gently refracting light from above seems to penetrate and reflect off the perfectly smooth wall. Staring into it, the blue seems infinite. Despite the danger of my situation, the glacier’s beauty calms me.
Eventually our two other teammates arrive and work to extract Sean from his perch just six inches from the edge of the crevasse. The three of them set up a three-way pulley system. Laboriously, my teammates begin to haul me up, inches at a time, out of what nearly became my tomb. I continue to focus on the delicately shifting shades of blue in the ice as I draw closer to the surface.
My teammates pull me up to the lip of the crevasse. I repeatedly plunge the pick of my ice axe into the snow and haul myself out, never before as grateful for being on top of a glacier. I stand and gaze up at a mountain to the west, behind which the sun has just set. Snow plumes stream off one of its ridges, turned into red ribbons by the setting sun. Snowflakes flicker as they float into space.
As relief floods my shivering body, I roar in gratitude. Utterly overwhelmed by being alive and surrounded by the beauty of the mountain world, I hug each of my three climbing partners. Now that I am safe, it sinks in just how close to death I’ve been.
That was 22 April 2003 – Earth Day. In hindsight, I believe the emotion I felt then stemmed in part from something else – a deeper consciousness that the ice I had seen was vanishing. Seven years of climbing in Alaska had provided me with a front-row seat from where I could witness the dramatic impact of human-caused climate disruption. Each year, we found that the toe of the glacier had shrivelled further. Each year, for the annual early season ice-climbing festival on this glacier, we found ourselves hiking further up the crusty frozen mud left behind by its rapidly retreating terminus. Each year, the parking lot was moved closer to the glacier, only to be left farther away as the ice withdrew. Even sections of Denali – the highest mountain in North America, which stands more than 20,000 feet tall and is roughly 250 miles from the Arctic Circle – had already undergone startling changes in 2003: the ice of its glaciers was disappearing quickly.
Our planet is rapidly changing, and what we are witnessing is unlike anything that has occurred in human, or even geological, history. The heat-trapping nature of CO2 and methane, both greenhouse gases, has been scientific fact for decades, and according to Nasa, “no question that increased levels of greenhouse gases must cause the Earth to warm in response”. Evidence shows that greenhouse gas emissions are causing the Earth to warm 10 times faster than it should, and the ramifications of this are being felt, quite literally, throughout the entire biosphere.
Oceans are warming at unprecedented rates, droughts and wildfires of increasing severity and frequency are altering forests around the globe, and the Earth’s cryosphere – the parts of the Earth so cold that water is frozen into ice or snow – is melting at an ever-accelerating rate. The subsea permafrost in the Arctic is thawing, and we could experience a methane “burp” of previously trapped gas at any moment, causing the equivalent of several times the total amount of CO2 humans have emitted to be released into the atmosphere. The results would be catastrophic.
Climate disruption also brings with it extreme weather such as hurricanes and floods. For instance, a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, leading to an increase in the frequency of severe major rain events, such as Hurricane Harvey over Houston in summer 2017, which dropped so much rain that the weight of the water actually caused the Earth’s crust to sink by 2cm.
Earth has not seen current atmospheric CO2 levels since the Pliocene epoch, some 3m years ago. Three-quarters of that CO2 will still be here in 500 years. It takes a decade to experience the full warming effects of CO2 emissions. Even if we stopped all greenhouse gas emissions, it would take another 25,000 years for most of what is currently in the atmosphere to be absorbed into the oceans.
Climate disruption is progressing faster than ever, and faster than predicted. Seventeen of the 18 hottest years ever recorded have occurred since 2001. The distress signals from our overheated planet are all around us, with reports, studies and warnings increasing daily. Worst-case prediction made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change about the rise in temperatures, extreme weather, sea levels and CO2 levels in the atmosphere have fallen short of reality. Countless glaciers, rivers, lakes, forests and species are already vanishing at a pace never seen before, and all of this from increasing the global mean temperature by “only” 1C above the preindustrial baseline. Some scientists predict it could rise by as much as 10C by 2100. A study led by James Hansen, the former director of Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, warned that the rise we have seen so far has already caused unstoppable melting in both the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets.
Mountaineering in today’s climate-disrupted world is a vastly different endeavour from what it used to be. Glaciers are vanishing before our eyes, having shrunk to the lowest levels ever recorded, and are now melting faster than ever. Seventy per cent of the glaciers in western Canada are projected to be gone by 2100. Montana’s Glacier National Park will most likely not have any active glaciers by 2030. The Matanuska Glacier’s ancient ice is already rapidly vanishing. Dramatic changes are occurring even in the planet’s highest and coldest places. Even Mount Everest is transforming, as thousands of glaciers across the Himalayas are likely to shrink by up to 99% by 2100. A child born today will see an Everest largely free of glaciers within their lifetime.
I lived in Alaska for a decade beginning in 1996, and spent time on the glaciers there. As early as the late 90s, large portions of the holiday season would go by in Anchorage without any snow on the ground. The waterfalls that my climbing friends and I had used for ice climbing barely froze some winters, and we could see the glaciers that we used to traverse to access peaks shrinking from year to year.
In Nepal the sacred mountain Machapuchare rises abruptly on the eastern boundary of the Annapurna Sanctuary. As a child I came across a photograph of this peak in a geography textbook and was immediately captivated by its majesty. Shaped like a fish’s tail, the knife-edged ridge that forms its summit is a seemingly paper-thin line of rock that drops precipitously on either side, causing the apex of the peak – which is nearly half a mile higher than the top of Denali – to be one of the more dramatic summits anywhere. It is a masterpiece of nature.
When I was 10 years old, I saw the Rocky Mountains of Colorado for the first time, their silhouettes against the setting sun, and I was awestruck. Years later I travelled to Alaska and drove a short way into Denali national park and preserve. When the afternoon clouds parted to reveal the majesty of Denali’s summit, my first inclination was to bow in wonderment. A year after that I moved to Alaska, and began training myself in the mountaineering skills I needed to access these sanctuaries that stand far from the violence, speed and greed of society. John Muir, the Scottish-American naturalist, author, philosopher and early wilderness-preservation advocate, captured my feelings precisely: “I am losing precious days. I am degenerating into a machine for making money. I am learning nothing in this trivial world of men. I must break away and get out into the mountains to learn the news.”
A glacier is essentially suspended energy, suspended force. It is, in a sense, life frozen in time. But now they are themselves running out of time. The planet’s ecosystems, pushed far beyond their capacity to adapt to human-generated traumas and stresses, are in a state of freefall. Just as I watched hundreds of years of time compressed into glacial ice flash before my eyes in a matter of seconds as I fell into the crevasse, swathes of the natural world are, in the blink of a geological eye, falling into oblivion.
Modern life has compressed time and space. You can traverse the globe in a matter of hours, or gain information in nanoseconds. The price for this, along with everything we want, on demand, all the time, is a total disconnection from the planet that sustains our lives.
I venture into the wilds and into the mountains in large part to allow space and time to stretch themselves back to what they were. The frenetic pace of contemporary life is having a devastating impact on this planet. Humans have transformed more than half the ice-free land on Earth. We have changed the composition of the atmosphere and the chemistry of the oceans from which we came. We now use more than half the planet’s readily accessible freshwater runoff, and the majority of the world’s major rivers have been either dammed or diverted.
As a species, we now hang over the abyss of a geoengineered future we have created for ourselves. At our insistence, our voracious appetite is consuming nature itself. We have refused to heed the warnings Earth has been sending, and there is no rescue team on its way.
At the end of July 2017 I flew to Alaska’s northern shore. A couple of days after my arrival I took a morning walk along the Arctic Ocean. The only thing that was a constant was the shore beneath my boots and the crunching sound of the tiny stones as I walked. Up here, only 1,300 miles from the north pole, the sun never sets in summer, and time stretches until it loses its meaning.
Utqiagvik (formerly known as Barrow), one of several ancient villages in the area, is the northernmost incorporated point in the US. The indigenous people here, the Iñupiat, have learned to live on the edge of the tundra and the seas, with the whales, the birds and the ice floes.
I met 55-year-old Marvin Kanayurak, who was born and raised here, as were his parents. He is a whaler and volunteers doing rescues. He tells me how there used to be pressure ridges in the sea ice (formed when two ice floes are forced together) during the winter that were 50 or even 60 feet high, but now they are “lucky” to find any even 20 feet tall. Heading out across the ice to find open water in the spring used to take them two weeks of plotting and making a trail. Now it takes them only a couple of days because the open water is so much closer.
Kanayurak had told me that he was a volunteer gravedigger. The permafrost used to be 10-12 inches below the surface, so it would take three days of chipping with an ice pick to dig a grave. Now the permafrost is several feet below the surface, and softer, so he can dig a grave in a few hours.
Permafrost is a layer of ground that is continuously frozen for a period of two years or more. It contains dead plants that absorbed CO2 from the atmosphere centuries ago, and then froze before decomposing. When it thaws, microbial activity converts a large portion of that organic material into methane and CO2, which is released back into the atmosphere. According to a Nasa report, over hundreds of millennia, “Arctic permafrost soils have accumulated vast stores of organic carbon” – an estimated 1,400-1,850 gigatonnes, compared to 850 gigatonnes of carbon in Earth’s atmosphere.
That’s equal to around half of all the estimated organic carbon in Earth’s soils, with most of it located in the top 10 feet of thaw-vulnerable soil. Scientists, along with others, are learning that the Arctic permafrost is less permanent than its name implies. Estimates of how much carbon will be released by thawing permafrost show it could average around 1.5bn tonnes annually, which is roughly the same amount as current US annual emissions from burning fossil fuels. Dr Kevin Schaefer, a research scientist for the National Snow and Ice Data Center who studies permafrost carbon feedback (PCF) – the warming of the surface of the planet that would result from the release of carbon from the permafrost – estimates that PCF by itself will increase temperatures by 0.2C by 2100, and even more beyond that. This means PCF will have a significant effect on the long-term climate, even if the goal of limiting atmospheric temperatures to 2C is reached.
While I was in Utqiagvik I spoke to Dr Vladimir Romanovsky, a professor of geophysics at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, who also specialises in permafrost. His lab has been collecting temperature data each year in many locations around the world, but mostly across Alaska, Canada and Russia.
“If it comes closer to thawing point, then it becomes unstable,” Romanovsky said. “For any permafrost research, that is the crucial data: what is the temperature and how stable is it?”
His lab is unique in that it now has nearly 40 years of data records from a variety of locations, and he generates permafrost temperature modelling to explain how the temperatures are changing.
The changes in the permafrost happening across Alaska’s North Slope are due to some of the most dramatic temperature increases in the world. In 35 years of measurements here, the temperature at 20 metres below the ground has increased by 3C since Romanovsky’s first measurement, and at the surface of the permafrost one metre below the ground, the average temperature has increased by a staggering 5C since the mid-1980s. Even small increases bring the temperature of the permafrost closer to 0C. Crossing that line means the permafrost will start to thaw.
Scientists used to believe the permafrost was stable across the North Slope, and that it would not begin to thaw this century. Romanovsky said: “If you look at our records, however, and extrapolate into the future another 30 years, assuming changes continue as they have been for the last 30 years, the permafrost on the North Slope will hit 0C by 2050 or 2060 at the latest. Nobody was expecting this, and most people would be surprised to see this happen so soon.”
Schaefer also expressed concern about the impact that thawing permafrost will have on the infrastructure and people of the Arctic. “Thawing permafrost represents a radical change to the environment and way of life in the Arctic, with unknown social costs,” he said. I asked if he thought it would be necessary to relocate most, if not all, of the coastal villages in northern Alaska. He said that as sea levels go up and permafrost thaws, “there is risk the thawing will destroy critical infrastructure, which will require repair or moving it, and that includes entire villages. If you built your village right next to the ocean and it starts to melt, you have to move. This is happening in interior Alaska along rivers, and it’s also happening across the entire Arctic zone.”
Roads, railroads, oil and gas infrastructure, airports, seaports – all these things were built across the Arctic on the assumption that the permafrost would stay frozen. “When it is frozen it is solid, but it thaws out and turns to mud, so it’s easy to see this causing a lot of damage to infrastructure,” Schaefer said.
Dr Leonid Yurganov, a senior research scientist at the University of Maryland Baltimore County physics department and the Joint Center for Earth Systems Technology, is an expert in the remote sensing of Arctic methane levels. He told me his team of researchers had already detected long-term increases in methane over large areas of the Arctic, and warned that the fast liberation of methane would influence air temperature near the surface and accelerate Arctic warming. “The difference in temperatures between the poles and the equator drives our air currents from west to east,” he said. “If this difference diminishes, the west-to-east air transport becomes slower, and north-south air currents become stronger. This results in frequent changes in weather in the midlatitudes.”
It would change the climate, he says, “everywhere in the world”.
Two days after leaving Utqiagvik, I flew from Anchorage to Seattle on my way home. Forty-five minutes before we landed, while flying at 35,000 feet, the plane entered a cloud of brownish-grey smoke rising from the 146 wildfires scorching British Columbia beneath us. At that point, they had burned more than 600,000 acres and forced 7,000 people from their homes. We descended into the brown cloud until we landed in Seattle, which was also enveloped in the smoke.
A couple of days later, a leaked draft report from US scientists across 13 federal agencies warned of a worst-case scenario of 18F warming over the Arctic between 2071 and 2100. The report also noted that the Arctic was losing more than 3.5% of its sea ice coverage every decade, that the extent of the September sea ice had declined more than 10% per decade, that the land ice was disappearing at an increasingly rapid rate and that the severity of winter storms was increasing because of warming temperatures.
The grim news seemed endless: the snow-free season on Alaska’s North Slope is lengthening. The year 2016 experienced the longest snow-free season in 115 years of record-keeping – roughly 45% longer than the average snow-free period over the previous four decades. The October temperature at Utqiagvik increased by a staggering 7.2C between 1979 and 2012.
We are already facing mass extinction. There is no removing the heat we have introduced into the oceans, nor the 40bn tons of CO2 we pump into the atmosphere every single year. There may be no changing what is happening, and far worse things are coming. How, then, shall we meet this?
Like so many people, I have wondered what to do at this time. Each of us now must find our own honest, natural response to the conditions that we have brought upon ourselves.
I am heartened by people like my friend Karina Miotto in Brazil, who has devoted her entire life to protecting the Amazon. Each time a report is published about increased deforestation in her beloved rainforest, I watch Karina become consumed in grief. But each time, she goes deeper within herself and her community, further strengthening her love for that portion of the planet where she lives, and repurposes herself into her next action to protect the Amazon. I find solace in the fact that there are millions of others like Karina, particularly among the younger generations, who have drawn their lines around their respective portions of the planet closest to their hearts and are making their stands.
I find my deepest conviction and connection to the Earth by communing with the mountains. I moved to Colorado and lived among them when I was in my early 20s, and it was there I began to deepen my relationship with them, and to really listen to them. I would hike out and just sit among the peaks, watching them for hours, and write about them in my journal. Today I know in my bones that my job is to learn to listen to them ever more deeply, and to share what they are telling us with those who are also listening.
While western colonialist culture believes in “rights”, many indigenous cultures teach of “obligations” that we are born into: obligations to those who came before, to those who will come after, and to the Earth itself. When I orient myself around the question of what my obligations are, a deeper question immediately arises: from this moment on, knowing what is happening to the planet, to what do I devote my life?

They are in trouble. And they are not alone. The US has 1,400 cities and towns threatened by sea level rise. I think China has even more populated cities exposed.
The shoreline is the most important line in the world, and for the last 6000 years has been remarkably stable (after rising 130m after the last deglaciation).
So 2,000 years after London was founded we still have it. But just our current CO2 level, when sustained in the past, led to sea levels perhaps tens of meters above today.

Now as the surface warms faster than the depths it gets harder to turn the ocean over, so it gets more strongly stratified.
Nutrient-rich waters from the depths which feed important fisheries like the anchoveta and sardines slow their journey to the surface. And oxygen-rich surface waters slow their journey to the depths and the ocean turns to desert.

According to the Bureau of Meteorology’s annual climate statement, the nation’s average temperature last year was 1.14C above the average for 1961-1990, making 2018 slightly warmer than 2017.
“When we look across all of Australia in 2018, we can see that every single state and territory had above average day and night-time temperatures,” the bureau’s senior climatologist, Lynette Bettio, said in a statement on Thursday.

The average maximum temperature for the country as a whole was particularly warm, sitting 1.55 °C above the 1961–1990 average, making 2018 Australia’s second warmest year on record for daily high temperatures.
Nine of the 10 warmest years on record in Australia have occurred since 2005.
Bettio said the only part of the country to buck the trend for above average temperatures was Western Australia’s Kimberley region, which had cooler than average nights for the year.
The bureau said rainfall totals in Australia in 2018 were the lowest since 2005.
The total was 11% below the 1961-1990 average, but many areas experienced significantly lower average rainfalls, the bureau found.
Bettio said large areas of south-east Australia had rainfall totals in the lowest 10% on record.
New South Wales had its sixth-driest year on record while the Murray-Darling Basin had its seventh driest.
However, some parts of northern Australia and south-east Western Australia received above average rainfall totals.
The climate and energy program director at the Australia Institute, Richie Merzian, said the data confirmed what Australians knew about climate change.
He said increasingly hotter years were the country’s “new normal” and polling by the institute showed just under three quarters of Australians (73%) had serious concerns about climate change.
“Most Australians will feel vindicated that 2018 was officially one of the hottest years on record, having felt the impacts that are now becoming the new norm,” he said.
“We have entered a new normal of increasingly hotter years and in 2018 we had a spike in Australians seriously concerned about the changing climate – 73% in 2018, up from 66% in 2017.”
The bureau’s statement follows a run of exceptionally high temperatures around the nation late last month, along with a prolonged heatwave in Queensland in late November and early December.
Globally, 2018 was the fourth-warmest year on record, according to the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service assessment, released on Tuesday.
The last four years have seen the highest average temperatures globally since records began in the 19th century.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/10/australia-had-third-warmest-year-on-record-in-2018

But the variable nature of wind and solar power means that storing energy until consumers need it has become the next big challenge. And so, large-scale battery installations are springing up across electricity grids around the world, to make them more flexible. In 2017, more than 1GW of power storage capacity was added around the world – a record, yes, but still a drop in the ocean of global energy demand.
Of course, we are not talking about a few AAA batteries here. And yet, all batteries broadly work in a similar manner.
Electrical energy is converted to chemical energy when you charge a battery, and then the process is reversed when you draw power from it.
There are three main constituents of most batteries: two electrodes and some form of chemical medium called the electrolyte, which can be a liquid, gel or solid. To generate electricity, a chemical reaction takes place that sees electrons move from the negative electrode, called the anode, to the positive electrode, called the cathode.
When you charge the battery, the process is reversed, sending electrons back to the anode.
There is around 500MW of large-scale battery power installed around the UK, a figure that is expected to double within three years, according to the analysts Aurora Energy Research. Almost all capacity uses lithium-ion.
Globally installed power is expected to top 50GW by 2020 – and surge to almost 1,000GW by 2040, according to Bloomberg NEF. That would equate to about 7% of the world’s energy capacity.
In the UK, battery installations are primarily being deployed to supply services to National Grid. Such ancillary services are increasingly important to help match supply and demand as a growing amount of intermittent wind and solar power comes online.
There are also the beginnings of “hybrid” renewable energy power plants, where batteries are installed alongside solar farms and windfarms. This is particularly important for the economics of solar farms, which can push down power prices around midday by peaking at the same time. Instead of exporting immediately, hybrid farms can store power to sell later at higher prices.
In other parts of the world, such as South Australia, batteries are being used to make the grid more resilient and avoid blackouts. Crucially, batteries are not yet suitable and do not make economic sense for interseasonal storage – that is, storing up solar power in summer to release in winter.
Elon Musk may have popularised the concept of a home battery when he unveiled Tesla’s version three years ago, but the firm was not the first and is not the biggest in this field. Such batteries, which are about the size of a gas boiler, can store and release electricity either generated by a household or imported from the grid.
The German firm Sonnen, which has around a 25% global market share in home batteries, said most customers today are people who have solar panels or live in storm-hit regions and want a clean, reliable backup source of power. “The market is still in the very, very early phase,” says the chief executive, Christoph Ostermann. Germany, Italy, Australia and the US states of California and Hawaii are the biggest markets so far.
For solar households, it makes more financial sense to store and consume the energy rather than be paid for exporting it to the grid. In future, as more time-of-use energy tariffs emerge, there might also be enough of an incentive to install one to avoid peak pricing.
However, for Ostermann, the most exciting prospect is harnessing thousands of the batteries as a “virtual power plant”. He describes this as an “Uberisation” of batteries that the company does not own but can call on, with permission. “We are not heading for utility scale, but virtual power plants can provide significant power,” he says.
We are just beginning to see the second generation of battery-powered vehicles, according to the entrepreneur Henrik Fisker, the founder of the electric car maker Fisker Inc. He views affordability and a decent range between charges as this crop’s defining features.
While the first models, with the exception of Tesla, could manage around 100 miles, most new ones now offer between 200-300 miles. “I see the market starting to boom around 2020 or 2021, as there is more choice [of models],” says Fisker.
Fisker also views ultrafast charging as vital to helping electric cars go mainstream. While a typical home will take about 8-10 hours to fully top up a car (with a 3KW socket), some new public chargers can do that in about 10 minutes (using a 350KW charger).
Electric double-decker buses, built by the Chinese manufacturer BYD, already ply the streets of London. Elon Musk has announced plans for an electric truck.
But the energy density required for heavy transport makes it a lot harder for batteries to beat fossil fuels. “It’s definitely more challenging,” says Prof Paul Shearing, the Royal Academy of Engineering’s chair in emerging battery technologies. “[But] I think the future is going to be electric, no matter which way you cut it.”
Will we all be flying around in electric jumbo jets soon? “Not yet,” says Shearing, who adds that energy density and weight of batteries meant there would probably only be used in unmanned aerial vehicles in the short term. “I think it’ll be a long time until we see an electric passenger plane,” he says.
A key element in lithium-ion batteries is cobalt, despite manufacturers’ attempt to reduce the amount required. More than 60% world’s cobalt is produced in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where concerns have been raised about the social and environmental impact of mining the metal.
The lithium in the batteries comes mainly from three big producer countries, Australia, Argentina and Chile, along with emerging producers such as Bolivia, Brazil, Canada and Zimbabwe. Water consumption and scarcity in some producer countries is the big concern here. “There are definite ethics issues. Large companies are going to be driven by cost,” says Shearing, of cobalt and lithium production.
What happens to the batteries towards the end of their life is also a big challenge. Dr Jonathan Radcliffe, of the school of chemical engineering at the University of Birmingham, is worried about the fate of batteries when their performance in today’s crop of electric vehicles is no longer good enough for cars. Some now have a second life as a home battery, but he fears the market could be saturated in a few years, undermining the financial case for reuse.
“The risk is that there is no viable second-use in the UK and we have a large amount of battery waste, without the processes in place to deal with it,” he says.
The bigger and denser the battery, the more chemical energy it can store and therefore the more electricity it can generate. But a bigger, denser battery is more expensive, heavier, takes longer to charge and has more potential for destruction if things go wrong.
The chemistry and internal construction of the battery also plays a role in how much energy it can store. Lithium-based batteries are popular because they have a relatively high energy-to-weight ratio and maintain their charge well when not in use.
In most devices, battery life is a trade-off between physical size, design, energy density and safety, alongside the energy efficiency of the device it powers.
Most batteries can only maintain their full capacity for a finite time and number of charge and discharge cycles. The exact process of battery ageing is still a hot research topic, but there are several mechanisms at play that occur when the battery is used or stored.
The most common is the build-up of material on the anode, which slowly gets deposited when the battery is used or stored. A similar oxidation can also occur on the cathode, while the active ingredients of the battery can react and degrade over time. A combination of these effects reduce the amount of lithium ions and active material available for storing electricity, therefore reducing maximum capacity.
But the internal resistance of the battery can also increase as it ages, meaning its peak power output is lower, a process that causes issues in iPhones.
How a battery is used and stored can dramatically affect its ageing. For instance, batteries can be damaged by exposing them to extremes of temperature, which is more problematic for a car or similar than a smartphone.
Rapid cycling of the battery also increases wear, particularly if the power demands on the battery are very high, as is the case with electric cars. Charging and using the battery to its extremes also accelerates ageing, such as charging batteries to their maximum and discharging them to zero.
Safety was thrown into the spotlight when some of the batteries inside the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 developed a fault that caused them to short circuit and catch fire.
When something disrupts the chemical reaction inside the battery, it can cause “thermal runaway”, where uncontrolled reactions chain together, generating too much heat, typically resulting in batteries bursting or catching fire.
Various safety mechanisms, both electrical control circuits and physical measures including shielding and battery structure, mean such events are rare. But they are of particular concern for portable devices, which are often held on a person, and electric vehicles that may be involved in a collision that could damage the integrity of the battery.
Companies are working hard to increase the amount of energy that can be packed into a battery, and to bring down the cost of making them.
Future prices are unlikely to fall as fast as they have in the past, says Ostermann, because reductions have already been so rapid. Sonnen has seen prices fall from more than €1,000 (£905) per kilowatt hour of energy capacity when it started in 2010, to about €150-200 per kWh today. But the company expects to cut costs in electronics such as inverters.
New wonder materials will take a while to break through, Shearing says. “The next 10 years are going to continue to be lithium-ion dominated. It’s taken a long time to get to this productivity and technological maturity level. For anything to catch up will take a while.”
Most innovation will be around lithium-ion, he believes, such as improving the energy density and lowering costs by reducing the amount of cobalt in a battery. The rate at which batteries can take on a charge will also improve, Shearing adds.
Radcliffe agrees that lithium-ion will continue to dominate. Cost and performance will improve, driven by the scale-up of manufacturing and continued research, he says.
Batteries will also be put to new uses. Fisker says that as technology improves, he expects to see them eventually appear on construction sites, in mines and in industrial equipment, replacing diesel generators. They will be deployed in increasingly small devices, such as medical implants, Shearing says.

It shows that meeting the internationally agreed aspiration of keeping global warming to less than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels is still possible. The scientists say it is therefore the choices being made by global society, not physics, which is the obstacle to meeting the goal.
The study found that if all fossil fuel infrastructure – power plants, factories, vehicles, ships and planes – from now on are replaced by zero-carbon alternatives at the end of their useful lives, there is a 64% chance of staying under 1.5C.
In October, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said the difference between 1.5C of warming and the earlier international target of 2C was a significantly lower risk of drought, floods, heatwaves and poverty for hundreds of millions of people.
Christopher Smith, of the University of Leeds, who led the research, said: “It’s good news from a geophysical point of view. But on the other side of the coin, the [immediate fossil fuel phaseout] is really at the limit of what we could we possibly do. We are basically saying we can’t build anything now that emits fossil fuels.”
Nicholas Stern, of the London School of Economics, who was not part of the research team, said: “We are rapidly approaching the end of the age of fossil fuels. This study confirms that all new energy infrastructure must be sustainable from now on if we are to avoid locking in commitments to emissions that would lead to the world exceeding the goals of the Paris agreement.” 
The study, published in the journal Nature Communications, used computer models to estimate by how much global temperatures would rise if a fossil fuel infrastructure phaseout began immediately. The lifespan for power plants was set at 40 years, cars an average of 15 years and planes 26 years. The work also assumes a rapid end to beef and dairy consumption, which is responsible for significant global emissions.
In this scenario, the models suggest carbon emissions would decline to zero over the next four decades and there would be a 66% chance of the global temperature rise remaining below 1.5C. If the phaseout does not begin until 2030, the chance is 33%.
The analysis did not include the possibility of tipping points such as the sudden release of huge volumes of methane from permafrost, which could spark runaway global warming.
The scientists accept their scenario is at the extreme end of ambition, but said it was important to know that meeting the 1.5C target was still physically possible and dependent on the choices made now and in the coming years. “The climate system is not stopping you [hitting the target], global society is stopping you,” Smith said.
Other work, using a different approach, has also shown that keeping within the 1.5C limit is possible if radical action is taken immediately. In some sectors, zero-carbon technology already exists, such as renewable energy. But in others, such as aviation, it does not. “Maybe the solution here is flying less,” Smith said.
Prof Dave Reay, of the University of Edinburgh, who also was not part of the research team, said: “Whether it’s drilling a new gas well, keeping an old coal power station open, or even buying a diesel car, the choices we make today will largely determine the climate pathways of tomorrow. The message of this new study is loud and clear: act now or see the last chance for a safer climate future ebb away.”
Smith’s personal belief is that global heating will surpass 1.5C. “We are going the right way, but I don’t think we will do enough, quickly enough. I think we are heading for 2C to 2.5C.”
But he added: “If you don’t have a goal, you are not going to get anywhere. If you have a target that is really hard to achieve and you miss it slightly, that is better than wandering aimlessly into a future climate that is no good for anybody.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/15/immediate-fossil-fuel-phaseout-could-arrest-climate-change-study

The WEF’s annual global risks report found that a year of extreme weather-related events meant environmental issues topped the list of concerns in a survey of around 1,000 experts and decision-makers.
But with Donald Trump announcing protectionist measures aimed at China and the European Union in 2018, the report said the international cooperation needed to limit further global warming was breaking down.
“Global risks are intensifying but the collective will to tackle them appears to be lacking. Instead, divisions are hardening,” the report said, noting that nine out of 10 people polled said they expected relations between the leading powers to worsen in 2019.
“The world’s move into a new phase of strongly state-centred politics, noted in last year’s Global Risks Report, continued throughout 2018.”
The global economy slowed in the second-half of 2018 and the report said activity this year would be held back by growing geo-economic tensions, with 88% of respondents expecting further erosion of multilateral trading rules and agreements.
Børge Brende, president of the World Economic Forum, said: “With global trade and economic growth at risk in 2019, there is a more urgent need than ever to renew the architecture of international cooperation.” 
“We simply do not have the gunpowder to deal with the kind of slowdown that current dynamics might lead us towards. What we need now is coordinated, concerted action to sustain growth and to tackle the grave threats facing our world today,” he said.
Environmental risks continued to dominate the risks report, although there were also long-term concerns about the dangers posed by cybersecurity breaches in the years ahead.
The report tracks five environmental risks: biodiversity loss, extreme weather events, failure of climate-change mitigation and adaptation, man-made disasters, and natural disasters. All five are thought to be in the high-impact, high-likelihood category.
The risks report is a collaboration between the WEF, the Zurich Insurance Group and the professional services firm Marsh &amp; McLennan.
Alison Martin, group chief risk officer at Zurich Insurance Group, said: “2018 was sadly a year of historic wildfires, continued heavy flooding and increasing greenhouse gas emissions.
“It is no surprise that in 2019, environmental risks once again dominate the list of major concerns. So, too, does the growing likelihood of environmental policy failure or a lack of timely policy implementation.”
Martin said a significant increase in infrastructure was needed to effectively respond to climate change in order to adapt to the new environment and transition to a low-carbon economy.
She added: “By 2040, the investment gap in global infrastructure is forecast to reach $18tn against a projected requirement of $97tn. Against this backdrop, we strongly recommend that businesses develop a climate resilience adaptation strategy and act on it now.”
Trump’s “America First” agenda has involved pulling the US out of the 2015 Paris climate change agreement, the introduction of tariffs on imports into the US, the announcement that American troops are being pulled out of Syria and the decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal.
The risks report said: “Reconfiguring the relations of deeply integrated countries is fraught with potential risks, and trade and investment relations among many of the world’s powers were difficult during 2018.
“Against this backdrop, it is likely to become more difficult to make collective progress on other global challenges – from protecting the environment to responding to the ethical challenges of the fourth industrial revolution.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/16/global-tensions-holding-back-climate-change-fight-says-wef

Bullshit.

Aside from payments such as the use of diesel on residential premises and by hospitals, the DFRS has assumed the characteristics of an industry subsidy scheme. The agricultural and mining industries are the main beneficiaries (Table 4). In this respect, it is noteworthy that the Department of Finance and Administration, since February 2000, has treated reporting of the DFRS as a subsidy; previously, the Department netted DFRS payments against excise duty revenue.(30)

The question is will the Australian people buy the Coalition’s line and be played for a fool on electricity prices a second time?
BQENDI do not believe so. Too much happened for this to happen. Australian's are not stupid and generally know when they are being conned for a second time:
1) Because of climate warming, the world (bar that stupid Trump guy) has woken up to the impacts of Climate Change; even farmers get it this time around resulting in a majority wanting action now.2) Too many more people are suffering from high electricity prices in concert with stagnant wage growth whilst the country continues to grow year on year.3) The country does not have an energy policy and that is made clear to all, supported by the energy industry itself who are now openly calling for a NEG approach.4) Renewables are even more popular now as evidenced by people and companies taking up renewables at an even faster rate. 5) We had a carbon price in place for about 1 year and our GDP did not take a hammering despite all the fear mongering Abbott and co thrust upon us.6) Since Copenhagen we have had more international support for action on Climate Change that we had before. Countries have actually ratified targets and we are all waiting for the US to once again get on board.7) This LNP government is increasingly seen by the public as being on the wrong side of the Climate Change debate as evidenced by the split in its own ranks on Climate Change.8) This LNP government is increasingly seen by the public as being beholden to the fossil fuel industry.
These factors were not that front-of-mind when Labor introduced a Carbon Tax.

my council services had correspondingly increased but nothing's changed there
BQEND Actually, lots has changed in that space, though you may not have noticed. Councils used to pay low salaries, but offer very consistent work, concentrating on just rates, roads and rubbish. Now many just outsource the rubbish, and most major roadwork. But you'll be pleased to know that there is a huge proportion on well-above median wages. And a dozen-plus in even the poorest areas are on $150k+ packages, because they got to up-vote the importance of their own positions. My own council (Randwick NSW) is currently advertising for a sustainability officer, paying up to $98k + 9.5% super.
I think all public service jobs should be tendered, in precisely the same way that all public service contracts are tendered. If some retired engineer with suitable skills offers to contract for 2-3 years for half that amount, why is the job being offered at twice an open market rate. Similarly, I just don't think there is that much 'real' responsibility for all the top positions to be over $150k+super. If these jobs were truly opened up to offers from the local community, the cost of running local government would be significantly reduced.

Why? Firstly, because in the last 15 years Australia has gone from some of the lowest electricity prices in the world to some of the highest and a good number of people are hurting. Secondly, in the 2013 election Tony Abbott played us for a fool on electricity prices and it has been a key part of the Coalition election playbook ever since.
Between 2007 and 2013 electricity network companies spent about $50bn upgrading our poles and wires. That $50bn had to be paid for and it was by us, as consumers. According to the Productivity Commission this resulted in electricity prices rising by 70% over the five years to 2013. The voting public was well aware of the price hike, while being almost completely unaware of its causes. This allowed then opposition leader Tony Abbott to talk his way into the top job partly on the back of a scare campaign against carbon pricing and renewable energy.
In 2011 the Gillard government announced its Clean Energy Future Package to address Australia’s contribution to climate change. The package included a carbon price which happened to take effect just as consumers had really started to notice the price hikes caused by network overspending. This isn’t surprising since according to analysis by the Australian Electricity Market Commission, electricity prices had risen by about 40%.
Abbott was able to blame the high cost of electricity on the carbon price even before it was implemented. Unlike the massive hike in network charges, the much more modest impact of the carbon price came with a compensation package that left most households better off. But this didn’t save the carbon price from taking the fall.
Parts of Australia’s mainstream media either fell asleep on the job, cheered him on or found that the lax regulation of network infrastructure spending or arguments about the Weighted Average Cost of Capital didn’t make for juicy soundbites.
“Axe the tax” was at the heart of Abbott’s 2013 election campaign. And the rest, as they say, is history.
Cut to 2019, the Coalition is trailing in the polls and one of the major differences between the Coalition and the ALP is that the ALP has a climate policy and the Coalition doesn’t. The centrepiece of the ALP’s climate policy is a 45% emissions reduction target and a 50% renewables target both by 2030. The Coalition is already running a scare campaign that these targets will cause sky-high electricity bills.
The question is will the Australian people buy the Coalition’s line and be played for a fool on electricity prices a second time?
Here’s are a few things that will help you navigate the electricity price spin in 2019.
Most of Australia’s remaining (and largest) coal power stations were built in 1970s and 80s. Typically, coal and gas-fired power stations are built to last 35 to 40 years and if they are looked after they might last 50 years, albeit with more frequent breakdowns.
In New South Wales, four of the five coal-fired power stations are scheduled to shut down in the next 15 years and they need to be replaced with new generation. Despite what Coalition backbenchers say, the cheapest new build generation is solar and wind, backed up by storage such as pumped hydro up by storage. This fact has been stated over and over by everyone from CSIRO and the Australian Electricity Market Operator (AEMO), to Bloomberg New Energy Finance to the federal government-owned utility Snow Hydro. AGL and the University of Technology Sydney also both found that a portfolio of new technologies dominated by renewables would be cheaper than to upgrade the 47-year-old Liddell station – currently Australia’s oldest coal power station, which is slated for closure in 2022. These analyses don’t even consider the climate impacts of burning coal.
Given our generation is ageing it is important to remember that new generation, no matter what type, will generally be more expensive to run than old and written-off assets. Wholesale electricity prices were always going to rise a certain amount during this decade and the next, but with better planning they need not have risen anywhere near as much as they did.
What we pay as a electricity consumer is a result of three factors – electricity prices, the amount of electricity we use and the amount of electricity we produce ourselves. The first factor – electricity prices – we individually have little control over (though we can advocate and vote for good policy solutions), the other factors are definitely in our control. We can install solar panels, buy more energy efficient appliances, turn lights and air-conditioning off when we are out of the house and if we own our own home we can also install insulation and make a number of other upgrades. All of these solutions will help lower your power bills while electricity prices continue to rise.
This brings me to the issue of green schemes. If I had $1 for every time conservative politicians and pundits blamed green schemes and renewable energy for rising electricity costs, I’d be rich. The “environmental cost” component of electricity prices are those which pay for government policies like the Renewable Energy Target, energy efficiency schemes and others. According to the ACCC these account for about 7% of your bill.
While the policies have costs, numerous reports show these policies help lower electricity bills either through lower wholesale costs or helping household and businesses install solar and become more energy efficient. The ACCC found that households with solar pay on average $514 less than those without. While analysis by the Green Markets Institute found that the current renewables build driven by the RET will halve wholesale electricity prices in the next four years. These policies and programs lower bills, while also lowering climate pollution – a win, win.
As the impacts of climate change become more evident and the cost of clean technologies fall, the only people who are likely to look foolish this election are those that continue to deny the basic economic and environmental reality that acting on climate in the electricity sector, also helps lower our power bills.

It’s clear that this diet offers both better health than the current norm of a high-meat diet, and a more environmental food production system with its emphasis on plant rather than animal production. However, I doubt the validity of some claims in the report.
The report states: “Food is the single strongest lever to optimise human health and environmental sustainability on Earth.” Population reduction is a much more powerful lever. It reduces not just the need for food, but also the need for energy, housing, transport, schools, climate change mitigation strategies and waste disposal.
Moreover, population reduction should be easier to effect than the proposed change of diet, the latter clearly being, as the report states, a daunting task. “Humanity has never aimed to change the global food system on the scale envisioned. Achieving this goal will require rapid adoption of numerous changes and unprecedented global collaboration and commitment.” Conversely, when women have access to education and contraception, they will not choose to have more children than they can support. Population decline follows. The provision of education for girls and women, and of contraception, needs only expansion of existing well-known programmes.Richard VernonIffley, Oxfordshire
• Your story oversimplifies a report that does not acknowledge the significant differences in farming methods and consumption patterns across the globe, and could serve to misinform readers about the realities of our fantastic livestock production here in Britain.
We do not yet understand the implications of a heavily plant-based diet like the report recommends on either our health or the environment. There is a very real possibility it could see us relying on imported produce, produced to lower standards than our own and with increased transport emissions.
In Britain we have extensive grasslands, which act as carbon stores helping to mitigate climate change. The most effective and sustainable way to use this land is to graze livestock, which will turn inedible grass into high-quality, grass-fed, nutrient-rich beef, lamb and dairy, all reared in an extensive system.
Your readers should be assured that when they buy British, they are buying a product that is high quality, safe and sustainable. It would be a shame if this report has the effect of undermining British farmers who do a fantastic job producing food for the nation, all while caring for our countryside.Stuart Roberts Vice-president, NFUJohn Davies President, NFU Cymru
• The survey featured in your article (Strongest opponents of GM foods know the least but think they know the most, theguardian.com, 14 January), contains flaws that question the validity of its conclusions. The UK government’s GM Nation? debate on GM crops and foods in 2002-03 included formal public engagement meetings. At these events, participants were presented with information on GM technology, including arguments for and against its application in agriculture.
The outcome was clear: the more knowledge about the subject the participants received, the greater was their concern, as reported by the Guardian at the time. The lesson learned from this exercise was that balanced scientific information on a technically complex subject such as GM must be provided so that people can make an informed decision. Thus the information gathered from surveys of the type featured in this latest article is meaningless, since no effort was made to educate the survey respondents on the topic in question.Dr Michael AntoniouHead, Gene Expression and Therapy Group, King’s College London
• Every January we get a shedload of articles in the media about health and diet followed by a plethora of correspondence arguing the points about what is good or bad, and what we should or should not eat and drink. It’s almost like having an annual Brexit debate and just as tedious.
I’ve discovered a highly nutritious way to get oils, fibre and fruit in one bite-sized package every Christmas: brazil nuts “enrobed” (as they say in the industry) in plain chocolate. I manage to make them last through January to help cope with all the newspaper articles, magazine supplements and TV programmes that bang on about diets. Balanced diets and all things in moderation (even chocolate coated brazil nuts).Paul FaupelSomersham, Cambridgeshire

I’m an enthusiastic green activist and I earn very little so I can live a low-carbon lifestyle. That’s the way I like it; I don’t want much money, because people who earn a lot have a high carbon footprint. This green lifestyle saves my family about £10,000 a year on utilities, food and travel compared to the average family of four. But that’s not the reason I do it.
I’m proud to make between £3,000 and £4,000 a year gigging as a children’s entertainer called Professor Fiddlesticks, riding a unicycle and juggling. I also give talks on climate change and other green subjects, plus I sell compost, do gardening and bike trailer removals, which adds up to about £2,000 a year.
I live with my wife, Gill, who works full time as an unpaid carer, and two adult children. We bought our house outright after Gill’s mother died, with help from my dad. As a family, we get a working tax credit of £367 a month.
I’m a freegan, which means I get food from bins, from foraging, or from my garden. I’m largely vegan, but eat dairy if I find it thrown away. The most unexpected thing I found in a bin was a bottle of champagne. I buy unsold fruit and veg for a penny a bag from a local food shop and get four loaves of yesterday’s bread for £1 from the local bakers.
We spend about £100 a week on basics such as rice and pasta. I occasionally have a coffee or pint out, but we never go to restaurants or get takeaways.
I’m frugal with water. We only pay about £280 a year for it. In the bathroom our rule is “if it’s yellow, let it mellow. If it’s brown, flush it down,” and I also have a compost toilet in the garden. I wash every day in a cup’s worth of cold water, using a flannel.
I use a wood stove to cook meals as much as possible and our gas bill is about £200 a year. The electricity bill is about £340 annually with Good Energy. We have an energy-efficient fridge, freezer and washing machine and our solar panels earn almost as much as we pay for electricity.
I travel by bike and sometimes by train. I haven’t flown in a plane since 1997. We don’t own a car or go on holidays. I don’t care if my T-shirt has a hole in it. However, I did get a tattoo of a compost symbol for my 50th birthday.
I haven’t been able to afford a pension and I never have more than about £2,000 in the bank. I never know when money will come in, so I don’t budget. But I believe happiness is separate to your income. Aside from my sadness for the state of the planet, I’m a happy bunny.
I’m always busy, either chopping wood, turning compost, or picking beans. I’m autistic, which means I’m very enthusiastic and a bit over-focused. But my focus isn’t on cleanliness, or train numbers. It’s on saving carbon and trying to promote the green agenda.
I do a lot of volunteering. I help out with a group called Abundance York, picking unwanted fruit from gardens and taking it to local schools, food banks and homeless shelters. I also distribute spare freegan food and other items to places it can be recycled or reused. I give food to a friend who’s on universal credit, and to Food Not Bombs, who provide free food in town.
I’ve been trying to get people to be more green for about 30 years and I am proud that I have such a low carbon footprint. However, I feel like a failure: the CO2 concentration has risen continually over this time and climate change is now an existential threat. Yet we still live in a wasteful society.
I’ve had a lot of negative comments about my lifestyle over the years. Some people feel challenged by me. They ask: “Do you think what you do really makes a difference?” I tell them that an ocean is made up of lots of individual droplets. I’ll keep doing what I do for as long as I’m fit and able.

#MeToo has rightly focused on calling out abuse and exploitation. What is happening to ensure both men and women develop their understanding of this behaviour in order to eradicate it?

The election of Jair Bolsonaro as president of Brazil is a watershed in Brazilian politics. It signals a significant swing to the right after years of rule by the leftwing governments presided over by Lula and Dilma Rousseff. Generally speaking, Brazil does not receive the attention in the world’s media that a country of its size and importance deserves. The election of Bolsonaro is significant because the new government is likely to bring about changes which will impact on the world through climate change through deforestation of the Amazon as well as removing protection of indigenous peoples.Geoffrey Brown, Nottingham, UK

As he spoke, experts predicted up to 1,500 individual private jets will fly to and from airfields serving the Swiss ski resort this week.
Political and business leaders and lobbyists are opting for bigger, more expensive aircrafts, according to analysis by the Air Charter Service, which found the number of private jet flights grew by 11% last year.
“There appears to be a trend towards larger aircraft, with expensive heavy jets the aircraft of choice, with Gulfstream GVs and Global Expresses both being used more than 100 times each last year,” said Andy Christie, private jets director at the ACS.
This is partly due to the long distances travelled, he said, “but also possibly due to business rivals not wanting to be seen to be outdone by one another”. Last year, more than 1,300 aircraft flights were recorded at the conference, the highest number since ACS began recording private jet activity in 2013.
Countries with the highest number of arrivals and departures out of the local airports over the past five years included Germany, France, UK, US, Russia and the United Arab Emirates, according to ACS.
The World Economic Forum disputed ACS’s analysis. . Oliver Cann, of the World Economic Forum, said: “We have been offering incentives to participants to use public transport for some years. We also ask that they share planes if they have to use them; something that has been gaining popularity in recent years.”
The World Economic Forum’s global risk report, released ahead of this week’s meeting, identified environmental challenges, including the failure to mitigate climate change, as top of the list of dangers facing the world economy.
On Monday, broadcaster and naturalist David Attenborough warned that “the Garden of Eden is no more”, and urged political and business leaders to make a renewed push to tackle climate change.
“We have changed the world so much that scientists claim we are in a new geological age, the anthropocene, the age of humans,” he said.
“What we do now, and in the next few years, will profoundly affect the next few thousand years,” added Attenborough, who received a Crystal award from the WEF for his work.
Speaking to journalists after his speech, Attenborough warned that economic models needed to change. “Growth is going to come to an end, either suddenly or in a controlled way.”

Adelaide hit 46.6C on Thursday afternoon, the hottest temperature recording in any Australian state capital city since records began 80 years ago.
The Red Lion, a pub in the city’s Elizabeth North suburb, promised to hand out free beers if the mercury rose above 45C. By 1pm, there was a line out the door and round the block.

In Port Augusta, 300km north-west, an all-time record was also set, as the city hit 49.5C.
Last week, temperatures in Adelaide, home to 1.3 million people, hit 45C, sending homelessness shelters into a “code red”, and sparking fears of another mass fish death in the Menindee Lakes in the neighbouring state of New South Wales.
In central and western Australia, local authorities were forced to carry out an emergency animal cull, shooting 2,500 camels – and potentially a further hundred feral horses – who were dying of thirst. 
Just so we're clear, being the hottest place on Earth is not the way that I had hoped Australia would be leading the world re. #climatechange when I started working on this thing ... but it's probably what our current level of policy ambition deserves.#climatecrisis #auspol pic.twitter.com/oPnEilRpcv

On Thursday, 17 records were broken across South Australia, either of all-time temperatures or January records.
Sternhouse Bay (45.6C), Port Lincoln (47C), Minnipa (47.3), and Snowtown (47.3C) were among the hottest, with Snowtown beating its previous record by 1.3C.
RECORDS: Stenhouse Bay has easily surpassed its previous record of 44.0C (on 16 Jan &amp; and 2 Feb 2014), and is now 45.6C. Adelaide Airport is also a record at 44.3C (previous record 44.1C 4th Jan 2013). Roseworthy is at 46.9 (prev record 46.7 on 28 Jan 2009).
Thursday’s heat is set to spread across the states of Victoria and New South Wales, just days after an earlier record-breaking heatwave passed across the country.
Last week, a dozen heat records fell, with nine alone in NSW. The small NSW outpost of Noona, around 800km west of Sydney, recorded the country’s highest ever overnight minimum temperature of 35.9C.
The back-to-back heatwaves are part of a summer that the Bureau of Meteorology predicted as being hotter and drier than average, partially as a result of climate change.
On Friday, Victoria will become the “hottest place in Australia”, according to Jonathan How from the bureau.
The cities of Mildura, Swan Hill and Echuca are set for 46C, which could break records.
In Melbourne, as Novak Djokovic and Lucas Pouille settle in for the semi-finals of the Australian Open, the maximum temperature will be 43C, with 44C in some suburbs.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/24/australia-heatwave-adelaide-breaks-its-all-time-heat-record-hitting-466c

Thunberg travelled by train for 32 hours to reach Davos, and spent Wednesday night camped with climate scientists on the mountain slopes – where temperatures plunged to -18C.
Having already addressed the UN Climate Change COP 24 conference, Thunberg is rapidly becoming the voice for a generation who are demanding urgent action to slow the rise in global temperatures.
As she travelled down Davos’s funicular railway from the Arctic Base Camp – while more than 30,000 students were striking in Belgium - Thunberg said the rapid growth of her movement was “incredible”.
“There have been climate strikes, involving students and also adults, on every continent except Antarctica. It has involved tens of thousands of children.”
Wow! They're back and this time they're 32,000 strong! These students want #climateaction and they are not going to stop marching until they get it! Be Like Them!!!#ActOnClimate #Klimaatmars #Youth4Climate #ClimateMarch #klimatstrejk #FridaysForFuture via @Green_Europe pic.twitter.com/Jra5Zq4TLg
Thunberg started her protest by striking for three weeks outside the Swedish parliament, lobbying MPs to comply with the Paris Agreement. After the Swedish election, she continued to strike every Friday, where she is now joined by hundreds of people.
“This Friday I can’t be there,” she told the Guardian. “So I will have to do it here in Davos, and send a message that this is the only thing that matters.”
Students around the world have been inspired by Thunberg, with thousands skipping school in Australia in November. Last Friday there were strikes in Germany, Belgium and Switzerland, where more than 20,000 students skipped school.
Missing gym class, geography and religion each Friday is something of a sacrifice for Thunberg, who says she loves school and can’t pick a favourite subject.
“I like all subjects. I love learning, which people maybe don’t think about me.”
She’s also been forced to give up her hobbies, as climate change activism has taken more of her time. “I used to play theatre, sing, dance, play an instrument, ride horses, lots of things.”
She’s sanguine, though, pointing out that climate activism is much more important: “You have to see the bigger perspective.”
Thunberg said she would like more students to join her strike. “That would have a huge impact, but I’m not going to force anyone to do this.”
In the UK, only a small number of students have so far begun strikes, including 13-year-old Holly Gillibrand in Fort William. But plans are now being made for a big strike on 15 February. Thunberg predicts there will be protests in many locations.
She believes parents should be supportive if their children tell them they’re striking on Friday. “Everyone keeps saying that the young people should be more active, and they’re so lazy, but once we do something we get criticised.”
The world’s scientists warned in October that, without a dramatic ramping up of action to cut emissions, global temperatures would rise by more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, with severe consequences for humanity.
Thunberg believes the older generations need to acknowledge that they have failed to protect the environment.
“We need to hold the older generations accountable for the mess they have created, and expect us to live with. It is not fair that we have to pay for what they have caused,” she says.
Thunberg has also called on business leaders and politicians to commit to “real and bold climate action”, and focus on the “future living conditions of mankind” rather than economic goals and profits.
In a video address for leaders attending Davos she says: “I ask you to stand on the right side of history. I ask you to pledge to do everything in your power to push your own business or government in line with a 1.5C world.”
Thunberg has been diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome, which she believes helps her see the problem of climate change clearly.
“My brain works a bit different and so I see things in black and white. Either we start a chain reaction with events beyond our control, or we don’t. Either we stop the emissions or we don’t. There are no grey areas when it comes to survival.”
The school strikes last Friday were by far the biggest to date. In Germany, an estimated 30,000 students left their schools in more than 50 cities to protest, carrying banners including: “Why learn without a future?” and “Grandpa, what is a snowman?” One 17-year-old student in Kiel, Moritz, told Deutsche Welle: “We want to help shape and secure our future so that there will be another world for us to live in in 60 years.”
In Belgium, 12,500 students went on strike last Thursday and plan to strike weekly until the EU elections in May. Some teachers were tolerant of the truancy. Patrick Lancksweerdt, in Brussels, said: “Education has to turn youngsters into mature citizens. By their actions, they proved that they are.”
School strikes also took place in 15 cities and towns in Switzerland. In Geneva, 12-year-old Selma Joly said: “Frankly, I would rather demand climate action than go to school. Otherwise, years from now, we may no longer be here.”
Janine O’Keeffe, who helps coordinate and keep track of the school strikes from her home in Stockholm, Sweden, was surprised at the scale of last week’s actions: “I am still in shock, actually – a nice kind of shock.”
Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace, says youth activism on climate change gives her hope. “The 15-year-olds just speak truth to power.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/24/school-strikes-over-climate-change-continue-to-snowball

The increase is being fuelled by the continued burning of fossil fuels and the destruction of forests, and will be particularly high in 2019 due to an expected return towards El Niño-like conditions. This natural climate variation causes warm and dry conditions in the tropics, meaning the plant growth that removes CO2 from the air is restricted.
Levels of the greenhouse gas have not been as high as today for 3-5m years, when the global temperature was 2-3C warmer and the sea level was 10-20 metres higher. Climate action must be increased fivefold to limit warming to the 1.5C rise above pre-industrial levels that scientists advise, according to the UN. But the past four years have been the hottest on record and global emissions are rising again after a brief pause.
“Looking at the monthly figures, it’s as if you can see the planet ‘breathing’ as the levels of CO2 fall and rise with the seasonal cycle of plant growth and decay in the northern hemisphere,” said Prof Richard Betts, at the Met Office’s Hadley Centre. “The graph is a thing of beauty, but also a stark reminder of human impact on climate. Each year’s CO2 is higher than the last, and this will keep happening until humans stop adding CO2 to the atmosphere.”
“This news is worrying and compelling,” said Prof Nick Ostle, at Lancaster University. “It represents a call to innovate with rapid and radical responses to offset these growing emissions.” He said cuts in fossil fuel use, deforestation and emissions from livestock were needed: “It’s a massive challenge but there are real opportunities to make an impact individually and globally.”
The Met Office has a good record of forecasting global CO2 levels and predicts that the average rise over 2019 will be 2.75 parts per million (ppm). That would put it among the highest annual rises in the 62 years since good records began.
Only years with strong El Niño events, 1998 and 2016, are likely to be higher. The rise in 2016 was 3.39ppm. In the decade after the first measurement on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Loa in 1956, annual rises were less than 0.9ppm per year.
An El Niño event occurs when the tropical Pacific swings into a warm phase, causing many regions to have warmer and drier weather. Trees and plants are natural carbon sinks because they absorb CO2 as they grow, but this is reduced in El Niño years.
“This year we expect these carbon sinks to be relatively weak, so the impact of record high human-caused emissions will be larger than last year,” said Betts.
The Met Office forecasts an average CO2 level in 2019 of 411ppm. Monthly averages are expected to peak at 415ppm in May, before the growing season temporarily reduces levels to 408ppm in September, when CO2 will begin rising once again. The level of CO2 in the atmosphere before the industrial revolution sparked the large-scale burning of coal, oil and gas was 280ppm.
“It never rains but it pours,” said Prof Dave Reay, at the University of Edinburgh. “Our own CO2 emissions are still increasing, and now the world’s natural carbon sinks are set for a bad year too. We know these sinks have been mopping up around half of all our emissions to date. We can only hope their faltering in 2019 is just a short-term blip, as without their help any chance of a safer climate future will turn to dust.”
Prof Jos Barlow, also at Lancaster University, said the rising destruction of forests is serious concern: “This has been a particularly bad year. Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon increased to around 8,000 square kilometres in 2018, which is equivalent to losing a football pitch of forest every 30 seconds. There are also worrying signs that deforestation is occurring at a faster rate in other Amazonian countries, such as Colombia, Bolivia and Peru.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/25/worrying-rise-in-global-co2-forecast-for-2019

Thanks for sticking with us throughout day. A reminder that there are still dozens of bushfires burning in Tasmania and Victoria. Authorities have warned people not to be complacent. 
An emergency warning is still in place for communities near a fire at Timbarra, in Victoria’s Gippsland region. The fire there has grown in size from 300ha to 4,000ha and it is now too late for locals to leave. 
There are six emergency warnings in place in Tasmania. Those cover locations including: Castle Forbes Bay, Geeveston, Port Huon, Cairns Bay and Waterloo; Waddamana, Hilltop and Penstock Lagoon; Bronte Park Area, Pine Tier Lagoon and London Lakes; Shannon; Lake Echo and surrounds; and Liawenee.
Much of southern Tasmanian, including Hobart, is covered a red, smoky haze. 
The other big story of the day, of course, was the fact that about 200,000 homes across Victoria were hit by power blackouts. You can expect the political argy to roll on on that one for the next few days.
With that, I’ll leave you. Have a nice weekend and if you’re in a bushfire-affected area, stay safe.

Victoria’s emergency services minister, Lisa Neville, says the Timbarra community may be living with the current fire for weeks to come. The fire was 300ha this morning. Over the day it has spread to cover 4000ha. 
We have a community who continues to do it very tough today. The Timbarra community, that whole region, which is living with the fire at the moment, a very active and dangerous fire. They had a really tough few days since the fire took off, and they are probably going to face this fire in their landscape for many weeks to come. The message I have right now is that it is still very early in the day. Please do not be complacent. 
Victoria’s emergency services commissioner, Andrew Crisp, is addressing the media. 
He’s talking about the fire at Timbarra, which is the most dangerous of the fires burning across Victoria.
Crisp says the fire has been burning since 16 January and residents have been provided advice about the need to activate their bushfire plans since then. 
Three people have made it to a relief centre at Buchan, but Crisp says authorities believe other locals have “made other arrangements”. 
Earlier today, the CFA warned people it was too late to leave the area and that they should take immediate steps to survive. 
“The fire is a dangerous fire,” Crisp says. “We’ve had to move fire fighters out of that particular area until things settle down.” 
“The change is not expected to go through there until the evening.”

D’Ambrosio has sung the praises of Victoria’s renewable energy during the heatwave, saying it was coal and thermal generators that failed the state. 
“We lost 1800 megawatts of power capacity generation in Victoria,” she said. “That is an extraordinary figure to lose. Essentially most of that was as a result of failed infrastructure from coal and gas units – in particular coal.
“People should be rightly disappointed that the power grid was not up to the stakes today...we have a 20th century energy system, for a 21st century climate.
“The fact is our thermal generators are ageing, they are becoming less and less reliable. Wind power came through today – it produced sufficient power generation. Our large batteries were available last night when we needed them the most. Renewable energy is the way of the future and the here and now.”
She did also apologise to Victorians for the outages. 
“The market operator had to make the decision to minimise the impact of [the failures]”, she said. “At 12 oclock today they directed load shedding distributed fairly across the state.”
150,000 Victorians had they power supply taken off “for a very short period of time”, she said. 
In Melbourne, the Victorian energy minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, is explaining why load shedding happened earlier today. 
She says the state suddenly lost 1,800 megawatts of power – mostly due to failed coal plants – which created a 250 megawatt gap. 
Supply was low, and demand increased as people tried to keep cool. Aemo then decided to load shed until the cool change came. 
“This morning Aemo advised we had more than sufficient power to meet all of our needs. The situation changed very very quickly. 
“The extreme heat continued to remain with us and demand continued to increase to unanticipated levels. That caused greater stress on our existing thermal generators ... That came on top of the fact we los three coal generators in the La Trobe valley.
“The market operator did what their job is, and decided there was an actual gap in energy supply to meet that continually rising demand.”
Tasmanians are being reminded that the state has a total fire ban extending over the entire Australia Day long weekend. 
Some other ways to look at those record-breaking temperatures yesterday. 
According to weather researcher Maximiliano Herrera, Port Augusta’s 49.5C is the highest temperature recorded at a coastal location in the southern hemisphere. 
On Wednesday, Red Rocks Point in WA reached 49.1C. The measuring station is only 70m from the ocean, which potentially makes it the hottest temperature ever recorded so close to the sea. 
Australia has just seen the world's hottest temperature recorded next to open ocean: 120.4°F (49.1°C), less than a block from the sea. https://t.co/fuEUt3Yqju
Back to that press conference. Emergency services have warned that the cool change will create a change in wind direction – placing more people at risk. 
If you are near a fire, be aware that the front could shift overnight. 
Fire services have 30 aircraft across the state, and up to 700 people at work. 
A police spokesman says: “Leave early before the need is there, ensure there is a planned route and travel slowly.”
Two fires have worsened – residents of Wilburville and Flintstone may be at high risk within 2 to 6 hours.
Both are now at Watch and Act. 
. @tasfireservice has upgraded the Emergency Warning for Flinstone from 'Advice' to 'Watch and Act'. There is a bushfire at Great Pine Tier, Central Plateau that may put Flintstone at high risk within the next 2-6 hours. More info at https://t.co/IaDvpThtIT #tasfires pic.twitter.com/4QuurU5wdi

The bureau of meteorology also adds that the fire danger remains high. 
While temperatures are now dropping, the wind is picking up, meaning the risk is still as high as ever. 
“While conditions are easing, the fire danger remains high for the moment,” a spokesman said. “As the temperature drop the winds are peaking – that is keeping the fire danger up.”
There are “cooler conditions and a slight easing of the winds” forecast overnight, but the danger will remain.
There is not a lot of rain forecast for tomorrow – only a couple of millimetres. Tasmania’s fire chief also warned that “severe conditions will now move on to the east coast from now on”. 
Tasmanian emergency services are giving a press conference now. The topline is that conditions remain severe, and many fires are still posing a threat. 
Tasmania’s fire chief says there are still 56 active fires in Tasmania, with 30 uncontained.
“Thirty of them still going, that means they are not contained, and they will be breaking their containment lines tonight,” he said. 
“It remains hot, windy and the fuels remain incredibly dry in this state right now. We have a long way to go. Do not underestimate the situation we are in. We can’t let our guard down.”
In Victoria, there is a house fire at Taylor Court, Colac. The fire is contained but an advice warning has been issued for Colac, Colac West, Colac East.
In Tasmania, the Zeehan Highway is closed. People looking to evacuate must travel via Strahan.
People travelling from Zeehan to the evacuation centre at Queenstown Basketball Stadium must travel via Strahan, rather than the Zeehan Highway. The Zeehan Highway is currently closed due concerns about smoke and embers. #tasfires

https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/opinion/consign-rudd-to-the...
Fully one-third of the cabinet walked out on Rudd rather than work with him. Several Labor MPs prefer quitting politics entirely to the prospect of serving under Rudd's leadership.
Well if it is the Daily Telegraph it must be true.
All those conservative papers did their best to rubbish Rudd. And many gullible people took the bait.
By reading comments here I can see the great influence Murdoch, other media commentators have on their views.
Remembering how issues were at the time. A totally different picture emerges.
Maxine McKew won Bennelong, Howard seat in 2007. She was horrified at the machinations by Shorten. Had been a respected journalist, not a party hack.
And Gillard soothingly said ""we were helping you, could see you weren't coping"". But earlier in 2010 she asked Rudd ""when is it my turn to be PM?""
24 June 2010 ABC
Political commentators say largely unknown Labor Party factional strongmen have shown their control of the Labor Caucus by engineering the political demise of Kevin Rudd.
Mr Rudd was ousted by his deputy Julia Gillard in an unopposed leadership spill after it became clear that he had no chance of marshalling the numbers to prevail in a contested leadership vote.
Some of the strongmen behind his demise are union bosses, while others have made the transition into Parliament as members and senators.
Apart from wielding power, there is one thing that they have in common: they are largely unknown to the Australian public.
David Feeney, Mark Arbib, Bill Shorten, Bill Ludwig, Karl Bitar, and Don Farrell are hardly household names, yet they hold sway within the Labor ranks.
Political commentator Professor Ross Fitzgerald says the Labor Caucus largely reflects the views of the factional strongmen.
""The factions these days in the main reflect the Caucus,"" he said.
""But in terms of the exercise of power, when push comes to shove, the factions, and especially the right faction, wields tremendous power in the Australian Labor Party federally and in most states.
""For Kevin Rudd to say as he did that he wanted to break the power of the factions is laughable.
""I would have thought this is the factions' revenge. He went down like a house of cards.""
The Ludwigs control the AWU along with the AWU's shining light in Federal Parliament, another Rudd coup plotter, Victorian MP Bill Shorten.
Professor Fitzgerald says Mr Shorten, along with fellow strongman Mark Arbib, will do extremely well out of the overthrow of Mr Rudd.
The World Today has spoken to former premiers, MPs and Labor stalwarts, who all agree that Mr Rudd suffered at the power of the factions.
So again this proves that Rudd was hard to work with is just a con by the big players in the Labor right faction.
Another reason :Shorten couldn't stand the screams of Gina, Twiggy, the Minerals council when Rudd proposed the Minerals Super Profit Tax.

A formal announcement was made on Sunday morning at a rally organised by several grassroots groups including the Vote Tony Out group and Voices of Warringah.
“I am in this to win it,” Steggall told Fairfax on Sunday. “I want to beat Tony Abbott, who has been a handbrake on Australian progress on many fronts but, particularly, effective action on climate change.
“I know what I am getting into but I am not a wallflower – I am tough. I learned from sport that you have to put the work in, and can’t just turn up on the day hoping for the result. I will do the work for this, just as I did the work for sport and law.”
Steggall, born in Manly, is a well-known figure locally. She won a bronze medal in slalom at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, and a World Championship gold medal in 1999.
Post-Olympics she studied media and then law and was admitted to the New South Wales bar as a barrister in 2008.
Steggall holds director roles on several Australian sports bodies and was appointed to the International Council of Arbitration for Sport in 2017. She also serves on the governing council of the exclusive Queenwood school in Mosman.
Steggall has adopted the rallying cry of independent Kerryn Phelps, who won the blue-ribbon Liberal seat of Wentworth in a byelection last year and has promised to operate from the “sensible centre”.
“I support sensible centre economic policies for a strong, stable economy and will resist proposed changes to negative gearing, franking credits and capital gains tax,” Steggall said.
Steggall said in a statement her policy priorities include effective climate strategy, the economy, healthcare and improving politics.
“The most common concern is the lack of action on climate change,” she said.
Her campaign has enlisted well-known scientist and recently appointed climate change expert at the Australian Museum, Tim Flannery, as an adviser on climate policies.
“People are also worried about the state of politics in this country, the lack of compassion on human rights, how rising congestion is disrupting our commutes, mental health and domestic violence,” Steggall said.
At a doorstop in Sydney on Sunday, Abbott said the Australia Day weekend was “not a time for heavy politics” but made his case for re-election based on policies including lowering power prices and his “120% support” for the northern beaches tunnel.
“Apart from that, we’ve just got to have the best possible government in Canberra and the best possible government is a Liberal government that keeps our country safe and our economy strong,” he said.
Asked about Steggall’s attack on his record on climate change, Abbott said he would “not get into tit-for-tat arguments with any particular candidate”, but argued Australia only contributed 1.3% of global greenhouse gas emissions.
“We could close our economy down tomorrow and it wouldn’t make a scrap of difference,” he said.
The education minister Dan Tehan, appearing on Sky News on Sunday, said Abbott would put a strong case forward for his re-election.
“People underestimate what Tony does within the community, for the community, they underestimate his ability to campaign,” Tehan told Sky News on Sunday.
“There was talk before the last election that Tony might have been in trouble in Warringah, he was re-endorsed by the voters there quite strongly.”
Tehan later told reports in Melbourne that Abbott has a “very good record to stand on” and will put a compelling case to voters because he has “more to offer in politics”.
Two other women – Indigenous Australian Susan Moylan-Coombs and Alice Thompson, a former employee of Malcolm Turnbull – have also said they would run as independents in Warringah.
However, Steggall is likely to have the backing of several grassroots groups that have been running a campaign against the former prime minister, including selling anti-Abbott T-shirts and posters.
The groups have been liaising with GetUp, which has vowed to work to remove Abbott and other climate change deniers from their seats at the forthcoming election, likely to be held in May.
Abbott has vowed to take on GetUp and the groups seeking to oust him, and has begun a social media campaign using the title of his first book, Battlelines.
An email from Vote Tony Out endorsing Steggall as the independent candidate for Warringah in the next federal election said: “More and more details will come out about Zali in the next couple of days but I can tell you she is an amazing woman who will make Warringah proud. She has been through quite a process to get to this point.”
Warringah has voted conservative since 1922 and Abbott, who first won the seat 25 years ago, holds it with a margin of about 15%.

And one wonders what relevance you believe they have to a debate on crop yields. You appear to be casting doubt on papers around crop yields because a paper on ocean heat content contained some particularly glaring errors.
What has one got to do with the other?
Are you hinting at some systemic alarmism in all papers related to climate change that spread doubt on what the IPCC report on crop yields? 
Errors in a handful of papers in any field that publishes tens of thousands of papers annually is what you might call a domain feature of any field.
I could easily point towards the underestimation of various key signals of warming as proof of the opposite.
Being a real skeptic means building a case of systemic bias that includes the documented counter examples. You are never going to be capable of this, Klapper - hence the scare quotes are ""modelling"" and the irrational casting of aspersions on an entire field because, shock horror, some papers elsewhere contained errors.

We can fill in the horrific effects climate change has had to date on crop yield. Let's do corn: x - 3.8% = 81%, x = 84.8% (the ""modelled"" increase in yield without climate change).
BQEND
Again, who is it you are arguing with here? I am the one who provided you with these figures, and I am still not sure what you think they contradict in light of everything I have written.
And Klapper, ""modelled"" in scare quotes? Really? Can we please leave this juvenility out of future posts? 
BQSTART
I doubt thats even true given the record to date of incompetent climate science to date (latest examples being Resplandy et al 2018 and Cheng et al 2019).
BQEND
I am now nostalgic for the previous skepticism by ""scare quotes"". Seriously, if you have nothing useful to say, consider not saying anything at all.
BQSTART
But you can now see the context of my comment of climate effects being insignificant in light of the recent crop yield increases.
BQEND
I'm afraid not - I would have thought a 4-5% decline in product via mild climate change of 1C so far - an effect that is increasing - was ""significant"". 
It's important to remember gross figures, as with drought and flooding, do not tell the story of regional and temporal shocks - that is a year of failed harvests with temperature extremes, or as in the case of the Mekong delta, an existential threat to a ricebasket that feeds tens of millions which without dramatic adaptation will be a regional catastrophe. 
There's already significant debate over whether the effects of mild climate change on crop yields led to instability in Arab countries, and if it is the case it doesn't take a genius to project those impacts forward to 1.5 and 2C. Maybe the effects on the Syria crisis have been overcooked, maybe they haven't - I'm not prepared to roll the dice.
As the IPCC state, small regions based on local agriculture are going to see widescale emigration - this can happen in the context of yields staying steady. At the same time, livestock production is estimated to fall 7-10% at 2C (IPCC).
Have you ever heard of El Alto in Bolivia? It's a city of just over a million people. 60 years ago or so it didn't exist. It's population is almost entirely indigenous peoples who once lived in rural and agricultural villages on the Bolivian Altiplano. Altiplanic agriculture relied on the very small fraction of humidity available at that high altitude - and even the first few decades of warming started to eliminate that small fraction and villages simply started failing. Ironically, the glaciers El Alto rely on for water are fast disappearing, as with many glaciers at altitude. It's one of many ""canaries in the coalmine"" that occur regionally at very low levels of warming - and this story would not show up on gross changes in crop yields.

Severe droughts made more likely by global warming worsened conflict in Arab Spring countries early this decade, forcing people to flee, researchers said on Wednesday, publishing evidence they said proved the connection for the first time. 
The study used data from asylum applications in 157 countries from 2006-2015, together with an index that measures droughts, as well as figures tracking battle-related deaths, to assess the links between climate change, conflict and migration.
The findings, published in the journal Global Environmental Change, showed a particular correlation between climate stresses and conflict in parts of the Middle East and North Africa from 2010–2012, when many countries were undergoing political transformation during the Arab Spring uprisings.

No, what I am saying is rather simple and derived from first principles: that increasingly negative impacts on agricultural production from climate change, and in particular severe and pervasive impacts projected as warming intensifies, is not at all incompatible with increasing contemporary agricultural production.

BQSTART
For sure CO2 helps increase yield and makes plants more drought resistant.
BQEND
Climate change’s negative effects on plants will likely outweigh any gains from elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. 
Isolating increasing CO2's positive performance on photosynthesis outside of any kind of context is not a particularly convincing argument. For example increased CO2 is making many staples less nutritious.
Increased CO2 can make many crops more water-resistant, but a warming world is radically changing the hydrological cycle increasing water stresses on agriculture.
Picking through the latest IPCC report on a world with only another 0.5-1C of warming this is what it has to say about climate change's impact on agriculture:
BQSTART
Temperature and precipitation trends have reduced crop production and yields, with the most negative impacts being on wheat and maize, whilst the effects on rice and soybean yields are less clear and may be positive or negative... Importantly, the faster growth rates induced by elevated CO2 have been found to coincide with lower protein content in several important C3 cereal grains...  Overall, the effects of increased CO2 concentrations alone during the 21st century are therefore expected to have a negative impact on global food security... 
Taken together, the findings of studies on the effects of changes in temperature, precipitation, CO2 concentration and extreme weather events indicate that a global warming of 2°C is projected to result in a greater reduction in global crop yields and global nutrition than global warming of 1.5°C

There is evidence that the 2007−2010 drought contributed to the conflict in Syria. It was the worst drought in the instrumental record, causing widespread crop failure and a mass migration of farming families to urban centers. Century-long observed trends in precipitation, temperature, and sea-level pressure, supported by climate model results, strongly suggest that anthropogenic forcing has increased the probability of severe and persistent droughts in this region, and made the occurrence of a 3-year drought as severe as that of 2007−2010 2 to 3 times more likely than by natural variability alone.

 Now that's desperation in desperate times.
Ice is melting all over the planet, because the world is above average in temperature. The N hemisphere is above average, the S hemisphere is above average, the Arctic is way above average, the tropics are above average, the Antarctic is above average.
We have thermometers analyzed by NASA, NOAA, the British Met Office, the Japanese, the Berkeley group.
If you throw away every thermometer in the city, temperatures in the country show warming.
Thermometers in the ground show warming, thermometers in the ocean show the ocean is warming, thermometers in balloons show warming, looking down from satellites they show warming.
Warmer air contains more moisture, so some areas are seeing storms with heavier than usual snowfall, such as Boston in some of the last few years.
But if you look at the snow and ice that care about temperature the most, we have less river ice than we used to, less lake ice, less seasonal snow cover, less seasonally frozen ground, less perennially frozen ground, we have smaller glaciers, we have shrinking ice sheets, we have loss of sea ice.

When climatic zones and rains cross borders now there will be people with guns on the other side who may not like those being forced to move. I believe India and perhaps one more country are now building walls to contain the population of Bangladesh which resides on the sinking Ganges River Delta. 
And half a billion people live on sinking river deltas while the protective deltas are eroding, sea level is rising, and maximum storm strength may be increasing.

The Great Wall of China and Hadrian’s Wall in Britain are among the best-known examples, and there is a 2,000-mile (3,200km) fence between India and Bangladesh.
The earliest-known barrier for this purpose was in the cradle of civilisation in Mesopotamia about 4,300 years ago. A 110-mile wall called the “Repeller of the Amorites” was built to keep out the tribe of that name who were known as “a ravaging people with the instincts of a beast”.
This was because they did not grow grain but hunted for their food. The wall did not work, however, because the Akkadian empire was being overwhelmed by a force greater than the Amorites – climate change. A drought in the region that lasted for 300 years destroyed the empire. During that period, the whole Middle East region was subject to mass migrations as various tribes looked for greener pastures as their homelands dried up.
Exactly what caused that drought is still not clear, but the effects are exactly those that are beginning to happen worldwide at the moment – an unpredictable climate forcing millions of people to migrate to survive.

Increasing concern that the industry is neglecting climate change and has failed to set emissions targets – unlike other sectors – prompted more than 80 investors representing $6.5tn (£4.94tn) to challenge fast food chain owners to put robust targets in place for their meat and dairy suppliers, in what could prove a landmark demand.
In a letter jointly organised by the Farm Animal Investment Risk &amp; Return (Fairr) Initiative and sustainability organisation Ceres, the fast food companies – which account for more than 120,000 restaurants worldwide – were censured for expanding without sufficiently mitigating their environmental impacts.
“If we are to meet the global climate ambitions set by the Paris agreement, and ensure the availability and sustainable management of global water resources, then global fast good brands need to take concrete action to manage supply-chain emissions and water impacts,” said Heike Cosse, from Aegon Asset Management.
“The takeaway from investors is that those firms that fail to meet this challenge face regulatory and reputational risks that put their long-term financial sustainability under threat.”
BMO Global Asset Management added that the long-term value of fast food multinationals was under rising threat, citing the growing demand for plant-based food, increased environmental regulation and fears over water pollution from intensive farms.
In the letter, the investor coalition – which also included Aviva UK – advised the chains to reduce their impact on freshwater, publish time-sensitive targets and publicly announce their progress each year.
Livestock farming is one of the leading causes of deforestation and water pollution, responsible for 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions – methane, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide. If global demand for beef increases 95% by 2050 as expected then catering to the growing appetite could have severe consequences.
“If you look at the next 20 years, methane is over 80 times more potent at warming the planet than CO2, so pollution from livestock is playing an outsized role in the climate-driven devastation we’re already seeing from superstorms, floods, droughts and wildfires,” said Ian Monroe, chief investment officer at Etho Capital and an earth systems lecturer at Stanford University.
In the US the majority of large meat processing plants that pollute streams and rivers face few consequences, according to research by Ceres, and the animal agriculture industry is exempted from reporting its greenhouse gas emissions.
Across the world, animal farming uses 83% of agricultural land despite providing only 18% of calorie intake, with consumers in Europe eating around five times the recommended amount of red meat, poultry and dairy products, according to Fairr. The organisation previously warned demand is set to exceed what can be met within “planetary boundaries”, and that the intensification of animal farming is not sustainable, with scientists recommending people adopt plant-based diets.
“Every day around 84 million adults consume fast food in the US alone, but the inconvenient truth of convenience food is that the environmental impacts of the sector’s meat and dairy products have hit unsustainable levels,” said Jeremy Coller, founder of Fairr and chief investment officer of Coller Capital. “To put this in perspective, if cows were a country, it would be the world’s third largest emitter of greenhouse gases.”
He added: “Other high-emitting industries, such as cars or oil and gas, are beginning to set clear yet ambitious climate targets, making animal agriculture one of the world’s highest-emitting sectors without a low-carbon plan.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/29/investors-urge-kfc-mcdonalds-and-burger-king-to-cut-emissions

Greta Thunberg (Mountain mover, 26 January) clearly didn’t think it was a waste of time. Taking 32 hours to get there by train, the 16-year-old activist practised what she preaches. What could be more important than the future of our planet? As she said in her speech: “Either we choose to go on as a civilisation or we don’t.”
Our leaders apparently don’t: private jets, Davos “gridlocked with limos” (What we learned at Davos, 26 January). Not a mention anywhere of a crisis, or climate emergency. But if we don’t take this desperate situation seriously, if we don’t act “as if our house is on fire” (Thunberg), Brexit will not matter in the least – Theresa May, Corbyn and thousands of other world leaders will have wasted their time.

""Oh, trust me, First Dog, I know smoke. Last year my school was shut down for two weeks because of the smoke making life unbearable in my county (Ventura, CA) as the Thomas Fire raged across the hills of my hometown and burnt hundreds of homes to the ground. This year, it happened again, as a fire raged across my county line and nailed Malibu, burning hundreds more homes down (including one of my fellow teacher's homes). Last year the rains came after the fires and unleashed a torrent of mud that killed my good friend and travel companion. But yes, as you know - this all comes down to politics. And when you support a candidate who backs fracking and fossil fuel extraction and call those who oppose her ""sexist"" (since you ignore her environmental record), you gain the rage of those who are tired of watching the world burn.""

Here's Your reply:
Nice timing on grinding your axe there. Permit me to wade into American politics for one moment: Americans are crazy. In a binary contest Clinton would have been a FAR better candidate than the insane monster you and your country voted in. The fact that you are still holding a grudge and are not talking about the anti-science position of Trump despite the horrible wildfires California has experienced tells us all about your twisted priorities and your crocodile tears.
It's the same thread as my initial post. Of course, now you want to claim you are an exceptionally bad or hasty reader and was not comparing my loss (mentioned again in the thread). Or maybe you will claim you were just hasty and did not bother to read the initial post for context?

NSW temperate rainforests are the MOST FLAMMABLE forests in the world. 
You are incorrect. You have not described a rainforest. 
Check out NSW website and vegetation formations.
Southern Warm Temperate RainforestAcacia melanoxylon (blackwood), Acmena smithii (lilly pilly), Doryphora sassafras (sassafras), Pittosporum undulatum (sweet pittosporum).
Cool Temmperate RainforestNorth from Barrington Tops the canopy is dominated by Cryptocarya nova-anglica (mountain laurel), Elaeocarpus holopetalus (black olive berry), Nothofagus moorei (Antarctic beech), and Quintinia sieberi (possumwood), 
while south from Barrington Tops Acacia melanoxylon (blackwood), Atherosperma moschatum (black sassafras), Doryphora sassafras (sassafras), Elaeocarpus holopetalus and Eucryphia moorei (pinkwood) predominate.
Rainforests occur in areas that are reliably moist, free from fire and have moderate to highly fertile soils. Comprised of a variety of broad-leaved evergreen trees, and very few eucalypts, rainforests represent relics of vegetation linked to other forests in the southern hemisphere. They contain many ‘primitive’ plants that are direct decendants of the earliest Gondwanan flowering forms.
Tree seedlings of rainforest plants are able to successfully establish in deep shade and enter a state of dormancy until a gap in the canopy is formed, usually due to the death and fall of older trees. Species compete for the new space and light in a perpetual process known as ‘gap-phase dynamics’. This is in contrast to other vegetation formations, which rely on stochastic events such as fire, flood or drought-breaking rain to drive regeneration.

Just saying, all human intervention has it's 'downsides' and assuming that relatively frequent cold burns, even 'patchwork' ones, is an 'answer' to catastrophic wildfires is probably optimistic, if not simplistic. Plants need to exceed reproductive maturity in order to replenish soil-born seed banks - which are vital, as I'm sure you also know.
I worry when I hear people who just want more and more 'burning off' as a panacea to 'protect' property start quoting indigenous practices - particularly reactionaries who have agendas that don't include botanical diversity . Forests are more than the trees, and even trees who have 'resprouting' as their regeneration after fire strategy can be depleted beyond their ability. Especially in a climate constrained ecosystem.

""This isn't good ... we really shouldn't be breathing this.""
That was the assessment of visiting Tasmanian Environment Protection Authority expert John Innis on Tuesday, as he prepared for a media interview next to the Morwell Centenary Rose Garden.
Mr Innis' laptop was at that moment reading in excess of 400 mg/m3.
Having already relocated once from near the Morwell bowls club, the group decided to shift again to an area in Morwell’s north, where the air was noticeably clearer to allow the media interview to proceed.
""We've often been seeing 800 micrograms per cubic metre here - that's some of the highest readings we've ever seen from an ongoing incident,"" Mr Innis said.
He said a reading of 1500 micrograms had been recorded over the weekend.
A three-day tyre depot fire in Tasmania was the only time Mr Innis could recall PM 2.5 readings at this level.
A monitoring trip out to Glengarry on Monday (20 kilometres from the Hazelwood fire) recorded 150 mg/m3 - a revelation Mr Innis said was ""quite surprising"".
While PM 2.5 monitoring commenced in Morwell on 12 February, three days after the Hazelwood fire started, hourly readings have only began making their way to the EPA's public website since Monday afternoon.
That's 13 days later!

It is right in town and when Engie owned it the fire whose smoke covered the La Trobe was deadly.
Engie is the owner of the Pelican Point power station in SA responsible for not backing up the power supply when the transmission poles were knocked out by a storm. 
Why did energy regulators deliberately turn out the lights in South Australia?
...the amount of gas generation available on Wednesday was about 20% less than the nominally available capacity. 
Had the full capacity been available, the blackouts would have easily been avoided. 
It is this fact that has particularly angered the South Australian government, which is once again facing political derision for failing to keep the lights on.
The largest single part of the unavailable capacity is 240 megawatts – roughly 8% of the state’s total gas generation – at Pelican Point power station. 
Pelican Point is the highest-efficiency, lowest-emission thermal power station in South Australia. 
But nearly two years ago its owner, the French multinational Engie (which also owns the Hazelwood coal station in Victoria), announced that the rising cost of gas had made it too expensive to run at full capacity. 
Since then Pelican Point has operated only intermittently, and never at more than half of its nameplate capacity.

Yates, a former Macquarie banker and head of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, confirmed on Wednesday he would run in Kooyong at the coming federal election, declaring Frydenberg deserved to be challenged because of a lack of action on the environment.
Yates told Guardian Australia that Frydenberg, now treasurer, “had plenty of opportunity to stand up in relation to the environment when he was minister, or even now, as a more influential person, but he’s failed to discharge his duty in relation to environmental responsibility”.
Frydenberg told reporters climate change was “real” and he defended the government’s policy record.
“The Coalition takes very seriously our international and domestic responsibilities and obligations to reduce emissions,” he said.
In rebutting Yates’ arguments, Frydenberg did not mention the policy he tried to implement as environment and energy minister, the national energy guarantee, which was scuttled when party conservatives moved against Malcolm Turnbull’s leadership last year.
But he said he was “proud of the work we’ve done to support the renewable energy target” – a mechanism Tony Abbott as prime minister attempted to wind back, and conservatives within the government still oppose.
Frydenberg said the government continued to fund abatement through the emissions reduction fund, which the Coalition declined to top up in last year’s budget, although the government has signalled more recently that the fund, a vestige of the Direct Action policy, will get a cash injection ahead of the federal election, and its remit could be broadened to look after threatened species and their habitats.
He also referenced ongoing work on energy efficiency and said the government would deliver “the world’s biggest pumped hydro scheme” in an expansion of Snowy Hydro. The government is yet to confirm whether it will back an expansion adding 2,000MW of new generation capacity, which was approved by the Snowy Hydro board in mid-December.
Frydenberg says the Coalition has presided over a reduction in per capita emissions, but emissions have been rising since the Abbott government repealed the carbon price legislated by the Gillard government.
The latest government projections show that Australia will miss its 2030 emissions reduction targets, despite Scott Morrison’s regular assertion that the country is on track to meet its obligations “in a canter”.
The report, released in late December, says emissions in 2030 are projected to climb 4% above 2020 levels, driven by higher levels of liquefied natural gas production, growth in agriculture, increased transport activity and a drop in the amount of carbon reduction from activities such as reforestation in the land use sector.
It projects emissions from all sectors, except for electricity, waste and land use, will grow by 2030.
A new report from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has found that Australia is not on track to meet its 2030 emissions targets under the Paris agreement and needs to bring its environment policies into line with the “scale of the challenge” the country is facing.
Yates joins other high-profile independents facing off against Liberals in the coming contest, with a number, including barrister and former Olympic skier Zali Steggall, who will take on Abbott in Warringah, citing inaction on climate change as a central motivation.
There is also continuing speculation that Julia Banks, a Liberal who quit the government for the crossbench late last year, will run against the health minister, Greg Hunt, in the Victorian seat of Flinders.
Yates will face an uphill battle to unseat Frydenberg in Kooyong, a prized Liberal seat held by party leaders including Robert Menzies. The treasurer and deputy Liberal leader tends his local turf assiduously, and won the seat in 2016 with a primary vote of 58%, which was a positive swing of 2% on the previous federal contest.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/30/josh-frydenberg-defends-coalitions-climate-record-as-he-faces-challenge-in-kooyong

Campaigners with the recently formed direct action group Extinction Rebellion posed as tourists on a visit to Holyrood before staging an hour-long sit-in in the chamber.
There were no arrests. Police escorted the protesters from the building through a side entrance and they were greeted by cheers from other campaigners gathered outside the parliament.
Extinction Rebellion was launched last October with the backing of 100 academics and the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams. Friday’s occupation was the group’s first direct action in Scotland, after sit-down protests in Parliament Square, Westminster, and at climate talks in Poland.
Robert Alcock, a builder and eco-designer who took part in the sit-in, said the group wanted Holyrood to take up far more ambitious CO2 reduction policies geared towards cutting net emissions to zero by 2025, in line with analysis from the International Panel on Climate Change.
Extinction Rebellion wants Scotland to convene a citizens’ assembly to decide how to achieve that goal through consensus. It would be made up of 73 members of the public drawn from Holyrood’s 73 single-member constituencies, and have the power to revise the parliament’s climate bills.
The Scottish government insists the country’s climate policies, enacted by Holyrood, are among the most ambitious and far-reaching in the world, and the most radical from any UK legislature.
Scotland’s first target to reduce CO2 emissions by 42% by 2020 has already been met, and the parties are now debating a fresh target to hit 90% by 2050 in a new climate bill.
Asked why Extinction Rebellion was targeting Holyrood rather than oil companies in Aberdeen or the oil refinery at Grangemouth west of Edinburgh, Alcock said: “This is a very symbolic place because it is representing the people of Scotland, and today is Burns Day, the day of Scotland’s national poet.
“While it is relatively progressive compared to other countries it comes nowhere near what is necessary to really address the gravity of the climate emergency.”
A Scottish parliament spokeswoman said: “Around 40 individuals on a free public tour refused to leave the chamber for approximately 60 minutes before leaving peacefully at 1.30pm.

Your original assertion was ""The ONLY way to decarbonise is by using hydrogen"".

Whats changed today is that we have very low cost renewables. In fact, we are approaching a nominal value for renewables lower than the natural gas import price ...
BQEND
It can be argued that the (capital) costs of building (new) ""onshore wind / solar"" is indeed cheaper than (new) ""gas / CCGT"" plants.
What is not cheaper is the combined ""build + running costs"" of ""wind / solar PLUS BACKUP / STORAGE"" at grid scales.

The far easier answer is to replace the gas that goes through the existing gas network, with minor modification. A lot is made by certain types of people of the fact that this is difficult. It is not; ...

What was the specific mechanism of that “natural variability” which caused the heating you described?
BQEND
Assuming a single mechanism for a complicated phenomenon like ""global warming over a 35 to 40 year period"" is wishful thinking.
As the IPCC put it (AR5, WG1 report, Chapter 10, in the ""The early 20th century warming"" sub-sub-section on page 887) :
BQSTART
Ring et al. (2012) estimate, based on time series analysis, that part of the early 20th century warming was due to GHG increases (see also Figure 10.6), but find a dominant contribution by internal variability. 
...
The pattern of warming and residual differences between models and observations indicate a role for circulation changes as a contributor to early 20th cenury warming (Figure 10.2), and the contribution of internal variability to the early 20th century warming has been analysed in several publications since the AR4.
...
Some studies have suggested that the warming is a response to the AMO (Schlesinger and Ramankutty, 1994; Polyakov et al., 2005; Knight et al., 2006; Tung and Zhou, 2013), or a large but random expression of internal variability (Bengtsson et al., 2006; Wood and Overland, 2010). Knight et al. (2009) diagnose a shift from the negative to the positive phase of the AMO from 1910 to 1940, a mode of circulation that is estimated to contribute approximately 0.1°C, trough to peak, to GMST (Knight et al., 2005).

I hope you are not insinuating that I belong to the extreme right as such an insinuation is extremely offensive to me.
 Thus what science calls a scientific theory is not just a guess but is the acknowledgement that an hypothesis has survived huge amounts of checking, testing, challenging and re-checking by countless others of all abilities and experience
I am fully aware of all this. 
I am reading Doughnut Economics, as recommended by a poster who understood my comments, and it begins with the recent rebellion of students of economics around the world against the out-moded Economic Science they had to learn to earn their titles but which ignored the pressing issues of this century, such as climate change.

Traditional conquests were very very expensive and with no guarantee of success; soldiers had to be clothed, armed, trained, fed and sheltered, and so on.

Here is a round-up of the recent research:
""A growing body of evidence demonstrates that climate change is already amplifying extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, droughts and floods, making them either more frequent or more intense. Awareness of this trend was among the factors leading to the Paris Agreement in 2015, with governments, businesses, the military and health professionals among the constituencies highlighting the growing impacts of extreme weather in the run-up to the summit.
A year ago, the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) published an analysis detailing what scientists had discovered about the links between climate change and extreme weather in the two years since the Paris Agreement.1 Today, we update that analysis with a further year’s-worth of scientific papers. This strengthens further the case that climate change is driving an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, documented on every continent except Antarctica.
In last year’s analysis, we identified 59 papers published in 2016 and 2017 exploring a possible link between climate change and amplification of extreme weather events, of which 41 found a positive signal of climate change. The additional year has brought a further 43 papers, of which 32 found a positive link from climate change to the event’s likelihood or intensity. Of the new batch, only four found that climate change decreased the chances of a particular extreme event, and these all involved snow and/or cold temperatures.""

""Strangely the team found that winter heat waves had experienced the greatest growth in size, leaving northern hemisphere seasons less defined than they used to be. Although winter heat waves tend not to be as hot as summer ones they do still strain health services and confuse ecosystems. ""
As I have already pointed out above I feel the concept of a ""winter heat wave"" less than useful. Nonetheless the article does discuss winter weather. The DC area is as I also mentioned to you, in a rather odd position because of the watershed of the Potomac/Chesapeake system which can disrupt the movement of air currents. As far as I know from my experience and reading about the local weather there, DC has always had capricious weather. My brother used to call December ""Sprimauter"" in the sense that it would often be around 70° F and balmy at Christmas. 
How does this apply to the forcings associated with global warming. As a recent study has pointed out, more heat from radiative forcings has lead to warmer oceans and they in turn are affecting local weather systems. Thus global warming intensifies weather extremes, and studies of sea temperatures and their correlation to weather systems have proved this. 
You may want to restrict yourself to discussing heat in a particular place in a particular month but the article is clearly about wider weather patterns.

Calling science or scientists ""consecrated"" is here a cheap insult, otherwise a sign of irrational credulity or cultism, but either way betraying it author's lack of grasp of the scientific method. Reading on ""the scientific method"" (Wikipedia might help) could save werdzwerth from exposing his unawareness of the fact that, in science if nowhere else, the words used have precise meanings. Thus what science calls a scientific theory is not just a guess but is the acknowledgement that an hypothesis has survived huge amounts of checking, testing, challenging and re-checking by countless others of all abilities and experience. Thus werdzwerth is free, and most welcome however amateur, to provide evidence or argument to rationally defeat any current scientific theory, but not to denigrate a scientific theory by nonsensically suggesting that it, or other theories, have been easily disproved. Few scientific theories have been as rigorously and repeatedly tested as those of Einstein on Relativity, but a century of intense testing has yet to find fault. And the testing will never end for as long as there is science.
Please, werdzwerth, understand that to claim that science is malleable, or that scientists play the game for personal gain, gets one nowhere. As in any pursuit there are frauds; one thinks of the brutal Trofim Lysenko, but he and many others have been exposed by the unstinting efforts (some at great personal risk) of others in those fields. Sometimes it has taken many decades, or longer, for the validity of certain hypotheses (eg Alfred Wegener on plate tectonics) to be validated and accepted by science, but great hypotheses demand great proofs. And still there are the idiots, as now when, despite the increasing accessibility of real science, we have this smug rash of precious anti-vaccination campaigners wilfully endangering not just their own kids but whole communities and, in particular, those individuals whose condition of immunosuppression prevents them from being vaccinated.

My voluntary work in revegetating the local creeks involves some contact with a few variously disabled young men.

My daughter's been Tourism Minister for the past 4 years. The Great Barrier Reef is the major natural feature that attracts overseas tourists to Queensland. As a biologist and a geologist I can't begin to describe its wonder and beauty. Queenslanders have looked after it for 50,000 years but now in recent years it has suffered extensive mass coral bleaching as a result of global warming.
Australian domestic real estate prices are among the highest in the world partly as a result of tax cuts for real estate investors but also as a result of skilled and business immigration.

Old democracies should not become complacent but instead learn from new democracies about improvement.

The term ""consecrated"" means, in relation to land or a church being declared sacred or bread and wine in Christian liturgy being declared to represent the body and blood of Christ. It's not a term used to refer to people whether they are scientists or not. You are confusing religion and science.
As already discussed all scientists are at heart professionals. The pay's not that good. A scientist is anyone who has undergone the appropriate training which whether in a formal postgraduate setting or more informally involves considerable self initiation. You have spoken of untrained people showing scientists to be speaking pure fiction. Please provide some concrete examples.
""Paleontologists were very prone to making amazing theories based on virtually no evidence only to be shown up.""
Note that an hypothesis based on virtually no evidence is not a theory.
Paleontology developed in concert with geology as a means of equating the stratigraphy of sedimentary rocks. This occurred before the theory of biological evolution by natural selection explained the morphological changes seen through geological time.
My first paid work in paleontology involved Permian invertebrate foissils used to correlate the comparative ages of sedimentary rocks in Australia, China, Nepal and Thailand. Such correlations sare of prectical use to the coal, oil and gas industries.
My later work involved vertebrate fossils in the Queensland Cretaceous which eventually led to an understanding of the effect of climate change in Antarctica on biogeography of large sauropods and led on to tracking changes in small mammal populations with Pleistocene climate change.

I occasionally come across terms in my scientific reading which I'm not familiar with but usually find I can come to understand their meaning with some on-line searching.

Cut-off dates worked for removing lead from petrol, and for dealing with CFCs that strip the ozone layer.
For fossil fuels we need different cut-off dates, dealing with the easier fuels and uses first.

Does your scientific knowledge go as far as setting up millions of profitable people-centred, environmentally-friendly, non-material, minimum-energy-consuming jobs to replace millions of climate-changing superfluous consumer goods ones as a way to evolve the economy away from the existing alarming one?
BQENDThe existence of any living entity tends to change the environment to some degree. As a prime example: our atmosphere once had a suffocating concentration of CO2 with almost zero oxygen but ~2.3 billion years ago underwent a massive change to oxygen-rich in the Great Oxidation Event (GOE) It appears that the GOE was triggered some 0.4 billion years earlier by the evolution of multicellular cyanobacteria - still with us today. It seems the greenhouse effect of that earlier CO2-rich atmosphere had kept the earth warm at a time when the early sun was far cooler than it is now.
That we exist today would still affect the atmosphere, earth and oceans even if we made nothing and lived by eating plants and occasional bare-handed sheep strangling, because any living thin consumes and emits. The GOE was a cataclysmic event at its time, but even that was a gradual process (it took 0.4bn years) compared with today's man-driven rates of CO2 and climate change.
Until the early C19th our effect on atmospheric CO2 was barely noticeable, swamped as it was by natural CO2-consuming processes. Even so, we were leaving various mineral footprints through our exploitation of metallurgy (lead poisoning being just one recurring issue, and having left a legible record in soil and bones since the Roman era and before, right up to today - e.g. Flint, Michigan). So a livable society without excessive CO2 emissions is possible.
What is different today is our insatiable demand for ""energy"" which we most readily generate from the combustion of carbon-rich natural materials found now in fossil form as coal, oil, natural gas. Before 1800 most of our combustible fuel came from felling trees which, if re-planted, recovered the CO2 emitted by our combustion of the predecessors. Today, however, we're emitting CO2 at about twice the rate at which all available natural processes can remove it (and the significant proportion of this as oceanic absorption does not exactly ""remove"" CO2, just holds it for later emission).
Now suppose we learn to halve, or much better than halve, our profligate CO2 emissions? That need not betoken the end of commerce, industry, travel. Indeed, we would certainly need the first 2 of these in good nick in order to achieve such a reduction, 'though far less travel of goods and people would certainly help balance the equation.
So let's have more local manufacture and agriculture; more truly community-based care; less conspicuous consumption; better-quality and longer-lasting products; more efficient and lighter vehicular transport. And let's bring back real work and skills for our young people, or those many for whom compulsorily extended school feels like a sentence of confinement, saving them from sterile addiction to smart-phones and social media and giving them real pride in achievement. Yet also encourage arts, literature and learning for learning's sake.

I observe and analyse but my bent is unannounced quite spontaneous artistic intervention in the public space to possibly create a change and a connectioin between strangers, which is very often expressed in original sequences of words. A couple of days ago my message was, ""why do millions flee from public contact to their private screens?"" I then overheard a young couple talking about this inside an underground carriage for several minutes. On Friday it was ""why don´t tourists cry their eyes out?"" and a few interesting conversations with complete strangers ensued.

I am glad you have a positive tourism. Here, despite severe cuts in public spending which has inevitably caused unnecessary deaths, before the right wing government was replaced last year by a left-wing one it suddenly found 2,000,000,00 euros to build a new terminal at the airport to increase its capacity from 45 to 70 million, and within weeks, the rent of our flat, like everywhere here, suddenly shot up 30%! This mass tourism is a new form of territorial conquest and it is successful here not just because of the climate and the modernist architecture but because the important people here love their second residences in the country more than their flats here and working for tourism enables them to enjoy them even more. The expulsion of neighbours from other neighbourhoods does not bother them a bit.

I am a very active person as a vocational social artist who also has to work to finance this vocation, which is very absorbing due to the rampant consumerism and other changes here. I don´t have the time to pursue all the sciences that I need to up be to date with. I have to rely on good communicators to lighten my load.

 Teaching retired people English from scratch makes for a lot of other demands on me. I even don´t much like the jargon of linguists of English as they use classical terms and other terms that don´t feel right or are not very useful for my students. I use terms like ""samesound"" and ""samespelling"", which do not require me to think ""now what does this term mean?"" Why invent new terms of retricted use if in our everyday language we have terms that already exist and mean the same or if we can use everyday words to coin new terms that are inastantly understandable? 
My interests go beyond the environment, to seeking how to replace soul-destroying factory jobs and wasteful consumerism with very satisfying jobs for people that enrich us as humans. One of my recent messages was the question ""why don´t we make ""being good"" a well-paid job?""
Now, tongue in cheek, I think environmentalists should seriously, perhaps full-time, study money and non-money-based economies so as to release hundreds of millions of humans from the profitable drudgery that is causing a lot of problems for the environment as well as these humans so that they could lead worthwhile lives from Monday morning onwards!

I am interested in a mass replacement of emissions jobs by non-emissions jobs through a change, which could be dead simple, in the economy so that people-centred jobs that are environmentally-friendly but which currently are not done, either because they are not profitable or we are not aware that these jobs could and should exist, will be done because they are profitable. I am talking about socially engineering human evolution along these lines and this environmental crisis is an excellent moment to change the course of the future for ever.
I want to close factories and shopping centres that deal with contaminating superfluous consumerism because we have used our collective intelligence to adapt the economy so that work by people directly on other people will be done because it is profitable (because we decide this and back this decisiion by Law), these profits then being used to permit non material economic growth.
I am finding that environmentalists don´t know what I am talking about or that they are fatalist, ""it is too late"". 
If this situation is that serious all avenues should be pursued , and with urgency.
I would like our money supply to come from people doing such work, you know, caring for dependent people, simply being parents, perhaps a one day a week paid job for all called Democracy, and so on. If factories and shopping centres can be closed down because we have switched to working in a profitable people-centred economy, by how much could emissions be reduced because resources and energy are not being used up, and by how much could human happiness be increased because we are working directly with each other on each other for the intellectual, emotional, social, creative, etc, benefit of each other?
 For example, we become able to invent an infinite number of interesting games with just one pack of cards rather than going to a shop to buy our very own wonderful selection of table games in large boxes with large plastic trays and bits of metal and wood, and for which we need to buy an extra cupboard for them.

Environmentalists are the ones trying hard to preserve a planet on which the conditions are as beneficial as possible for human life. An awful lot of what is going on right now - by burning fossil fuels for energy, for example - is the exact opposite.

Subscribe to the daily email from Carbon Brief. Subscribe to the daily email from Unearthed. Subscribe to the weekly email from Climate Action.

If you want to read the scientific papers, some of them are paywalled, others are readily available.
It feels to me as if you know there is an issue to be dealt with but not why, and what needs to be done.
If you would like a tough read that is based on the science but somewhat more accessible, try the IPCC's recent 1.5 degree report for policymakers, published in October last year.

I much prefer talking to people face to face. I express myself better. I do it quite a lot. I sit in a chair in the city centre with messages, such as the points of my initial posting yesterday, on or about me and invite comments, and conversation. It is something I have taught myself to do. My ideas, opinions and comments are not what are in the general media and I give them something to think about and they are usually grateful. This keeps the spirit if Socrates alive. Yesterday , after a positive contact with a young mixed nationality couple, which included showing them how to play a game I invented that permits participants to speak their different languages together with total equality (which is something I am passionate about)"", a young passer-by with a very priestly manner made me feel very guilty for eating meat. He had tapped into a deep well of guilt planted in me by Christian priests when I was a minor so overall, yesterday and a restless night that rezulted from it, bereft of my usual sense of humour, was a rather miserable time. 
I am interested in what your daughter's party are about and I will googe it. However, perhaps I have not made myself crystal clear.

And I have taken the trouble of publishing (making public) these discoveries through theatrical, poetic, song, clowning and other performings in the public places free of charge to whoever happened to be around.
I have financed this by teaching English. When, in recent years, I was faced with a group of retired people who wanted to learn from scratch, I ended up rebelling against the established scientific fact that spelling in English is random. I looked closely at what students have to go on with, the words themselves, and discovered patterns in letter sequences in words of one syllable. I have been able to teach better through presenting students with these clues to pronunciation step by step. This has occupied part of my time for up to ten years now.

My party's candidates are chosen by the the party members in their electoral district. In my daughter's case this worked. Our party has more members and better candidates that their competition.

Education of incoming overseas students from the economically burgeoning countries to our north is a greater export earner than coal or iron ore. Education is a low emission job that sells a high quality product for which there is a high demand. Some may simplistically think that education has nothing to sell.

Analysis of 38 years of NASA climate data has shown that the average size of northern hemisphere heat waves has grown by 50% since 1980. Presenting his findings at the American Geophysical Union’s Fall meeting in December, Chris Skinner from the University of Massachusetts explained how today’s “mega” heat waves are putting more people and ecosystems at risk. “If D.C is in a heat wave, then New York might be in one, and Phily might be in one too,” he said.
Strangely the team found that winter heat waves had experienced the greatest growth in size, leaving northern hemisphere seasons less defined than they used to be. Although winter heat waves tend not to be as hot as summer ones they do still strain health services and confuse ecosystems. In particular false springs can trick plants into blooming prematurely and being in trouble when winter returns. For farmers this can be economically devastating.
Having established that heat waves have grown, Skinner is now looking ahead, understanding what kind of heat waves we can expect twenty years hence, and pin-pointing which parts of the world are most vulnerable.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jan/11/weatherwatch-heat-waves-are-getting-bigger-as-well-as-hotter

In 2019 she releases her fourth album which, judging by the excellent songs played to the Guardian, is sure to be another hit. But she also has a stack of ongoing extracurricular activities.
Where has your head been at since the last album?I finished touring, moved to New York, and I was jaded, depleted of any artistic inspiration. I just started cooking, going to the dry cleaners, learning piano. New York doesn’t really have the same rock’n’roll scene it used to, and it was very lonely. I’d often book studios and there’d never be anyone else there. But it gave me a kind of freedom, because there was no one telling me to release an album. I wasn’t forcing myself to write pop songs about boys and relationships, which I used to be so obsessed with when I was younger.
And you got engaged. Did you write about that?I have a terrible habit of analysing things to within an inch of their lives, so I didn’t want to overanalyse what I had with him – it’s something much more pure, and something I didn’t need to explain to myself in a song.
But on one new song, Love I’m Given, maybe I was reflecting on how I finally felt I’d found this person that was loving me for the right reasons. I don’t think I ever got over being thrust into the spotlight, so I put on quite a tough exterior. I never had time to myself, and any time I did was in a hotel room somewhere – I’d probably had a few drinks, knocked myself out. I don’t know how I could have possibly given a good version of myself to anyone: friends, boyfriends, family. So I’m very grateful Caspar came along, because I feel like I was able to be myself again.
What else did you write about?Flux is about thinking about the person who you almost ended up with – I’m a sucker for what could have been. Electricity is about a friend who had been cheated on quite cruelly for a couple of years. But I can’t help writing with empathy, trying to understand why a person has behaved the way they have. Somebody tried to write a song to damage me, and it was a really horrifying thing to go through. I found it really baffling, and just sad, that something that I’d built entirely by myself, my career, was somehow at risk. It had a huge effect on me. But I still didn’t feel the need to be angry – so maybe that’s a good thing.
Are you talking about Ed Sheeran? [Don’t is widely believed to be about Goulding.]Er … not specifically. [Sighs] There was a period where I felt someone was trying to sabotage me. So there probably are small pieces of the songs that relate to things that frustrate me, and things that are happening in the world, but I’ve always been conscious that I want to keep songwriting as an escape.
There’s a bit of a pop-rap feel to some of the new tracks – were you trying to do something new?I think it’s important to know the way pop is changing – I would never release something completely blind, without listening to any radio or Spotify, and expect people to like it; and for it to compare with what’s out there. But I still find it thrilling when people release something that doesn’t sound like anything else – I’m always fighting to work with producers coming up with whole new soundscapes. My voice doesn’t sound like anyone’s in the world, so I’ve got that to my advantage, and I can also manipulate my voice as part of the track or make it into a sample. That’s how I stay not sounding like anything else – I have that locked, for ever.Does pop ever feel frivolous compared with your climate change activism?Sometimes it does. But often I really need to just write a bloody good pop song after meeting climate scientists, or going to the climate assembly in Kenya last year. Going to Greenland and seeing glaciers collapse. It’s gone beyond facts and boring data – we’re seeing it with our own eyes. The wildfires [in California] were exacerbated by climate change, the crazy storms that have been happening: it’s very obvious.
One of my motivations to have a bigger platform as a singer is so that I have more people to reach. Climate change has got to a critical point where we all need to be very active; we need to compensate for what’s going on in certain political situations. I know that “celebrities shouldn’t get involved in politics”, but it’s something we have to act on now. I can’t help but feel a bit frustrated that I’m the only one speaking out about something so important – no one else in my peer group is.
The next step is electing people who take this seriously, and to trust scientists. And having a bigger consciousness of your day-to-day actions. I don’t eat that much meat; I try to use sustainable fashion brands; we’re trying to make my tour completely plastic free, and cut down on flights, with a better eco-bus situation. I think I’m probably doing more good than bad, overall.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jan/01/ellie-goulding-interview-fourth-album-2019-arts-preview

Electricity generation in 2018 was the lowest since 1994, when Tony Blair became the leader of the Labour party.
The reduced need for power came despite there being 8 million more people living in the UK. Analysts said the figures were a sign of increasingly efficient use of energy and the country’s changing economy.
The UK website Carbon Brief, which analysed government and industry data, found that 335 terawatt-hours were generated by power plants last year, down by about 1% on the year before. Since 2005 the level has fallen by 16% – or the equivalent of two and a half Hinkley Point C nuclear power stations.
Simon Evans, policy editor at the group, said: “It could be a combination of more efficient appliances, energy-saving lightbulbs and, more recently, LEDs. Then there’s supermarkets installing better fridges, industry using more efficient pumps. Across all of those businesses, efficiency will have been going up. And of course there’s the changing nature of industry in the UK.”
The financial crisis could also have played a role in making homes and businesses more careful with their energy use, he added.
While generation fell almost every year between 2008 and 2014, it remained stable between 2015 and 2017, before resuming its downward march in 2018.
Previous research by the government’s climate change advisers has found that more energy efficient appliances helped save the average household £290 a year between 2008 and 2017.
Continuing to use energy more efficiently would help the UK reach its binding climate goals, Evans said. “Using less as an end in itself isn’t the point. But it is the case that meeting carbon targets is made easier if we use energy efficiently.”
Separate data from the National Grid showed that 2018 was the greenest year to date for electricity generation as more power is sourced from renewable sources and less from coal. The carbon intensity from electricity generation was down 6.8% last year and has more than halved since 2013.
The analysis by Carbon Brief found that renewable sources including biomass, hydro, solar and wind power supplied a record 33% of electricity this year, up from 29% last year. Renewables were just 6.7% of the mix in 2009.
Green energy was boosted primarily by new windfarms connecting to the grid, as well as new biomass plants, which included the conversion of a coal unit at Drax power station in north Yorkshire and the conversion of a former coal plant at Lynemouth, Northumberland.
Meanwhile the coal-driven output was down 25% despite warnings of a coal comeback driven by high gas prices. Nuclear power also had a weak year, with generation down 8%, mainly due to ageing reactors being taken offline for safety checks. Gas remained the top source of electricity supplies, but fell 4%.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/03/uk-power-stations-electricity-output-lowest-1994-renewables-record

Nottingham has become the first city council to pioneer the “Energiesprong” (energy leap) initiative, which has radically upgraded the energy efficiency of thousands of homes in the Netherlands.
More than 150 social housing homes in Nottingham will receive new wall cladding, windows and solar panels after the local authority won £5m from the EU’s European Regional Development Fund.
Some tenants in homes already refurbished in a pilot scheme have seen monthly energy bills drop from about £120 to £60-£70.
Joan Warburton, who lives near the city’s Clinton Street market, said her previously cold bungalow was now much more comfortable. “It’s made a lot of difference. It’s warmer. I don’t need my dressing gown now. All the draughts have gone. Before it [the home] looked like a rabbit hutch – it looks like a proper home now,” she said.
Energiesprong differs markedly from previous efforts at upgrading the efficiency of Britain’s housing stock, which is some of the draughtiest in Europe.
Previous policies such as the failed Green Deal largely resulted in piecemeal improvements, such as a new boiler or wall insulation. The Dutch approach aims to refurbish the entire house and bring it up to the high standards that will be needed in decades’ time if carbon dioxide targets are to be met.
Emily Braham, who is in charge of strategy and operations at the not-for-profit organisation Energiesprong UK, said: “The reason why this appealed to me so much is it gets us to a much better energy performance, where we have to be in 2050. That’s a huge difference to standard retrofit in the UK.”
Costs are relatively high, at £85,000 per property initially but are expected to fall to £62,000 by the end of the programme. Braham said scale would help costs fall as the supply chain adapted.
“Energiesprong is great, a gold standard – it should be pursued wherever possible for low carbon, low energy bills and high-skilled jobs,” said Pedro Guertler of environmental thinktank E3G.
He added that Nottingham city council is a leader, but most austerity-hit councils no longer had the capacity to lead such work. The Treasury should increase energy efficiency investment by £1bn a year, he urged.
Pilot Energiesprong projects are also planned in Maldon, Essex, and in the Exeter area. Braham said the government had indicated that it was interested in the initiative. There is currently a vacuum in energy efficiency policy, beyond schemes for people in fuel poverty.
Braham said a no-deal Brexit could jeopardise Enegiesprong’s prospects in the UK: “If we left without a deal, it would be a risk.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/07/dutch-eco-homes-idea-arrives-in-uk-and-cuts-energy-bills-in-half-nottingham-energiesprong

Carbon emissions rose sharply last year, increasing 3.4%, according to new estimates from the economic firm Rhodium Group. That year’s jump in emissions is the biggest since the bounce back from the recession in 2010. It is the second largest gain in more than two decades.
Coal plants are shutting down, but electricity demand is growing. Natural-gas fired power emits about half as much carbon as coal but still contributes to climate change. The fossil fuel is replacing most of the coal plants that are closing and also fed most of the higher demand, increasing power-sector climate pollution. Outside of the power sector, transportation, industry and buildings all increased their emissions as well, according to the estimates.
The numbers undercut one of the Trump administration’s key defenses for dismissing federal science reports that show rising temperatures will wreak havoc on the economy, kill people and cause more extreme weather. Trump has said he doesn’t believe the findings and his officials have argued they are exaggerated.
The Environmental Protection Agency chief, Andrew Wheeler, often trumpets declines in greenhouse gases, citing data showing that they fell 2.7% from 2016 to 2017.
But the EPA is rescinding Obama-era climate work, including regulations meant to speed a shift from coal. The agency contends that Donald Trump’s agenda is driving energy innovation that could help cut emissions. Energy experts, however, say Trump is doing the opposite by rolling back the rules and policies that could have sped renewable growth and by forgoing new regulations beyond the electricity sector.
Rhodium Group tracks the most prevalent greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide. The firm found a modest decrease in carbon emissions between 2016 and 2017, in part because of a warmer-than-usual winter that didn’t require as much heating. Since then carbon output has surged.
“The tailwinds of Obama administration policy are dissipating,” said Trevor Houser, a partner at the firm. “This year makes it abundantly clear that energy market trends alone – the low cost of natural gas, the increasing competitiveness of renewables – are not enough to deliver sustained declines in US emissions.”
Houser said the numbers would have been worse without the state and local policies enacted during the past five to 10 years.

Warming oceans take up more space, a process known as thermal expansion, which the study says is likely to raise sea levels by about 30cm by the end of the century, on top of the rise in sea levels from melting ice and glaciers. Warmer oceans are also a major factor in increasing the severity of storms, hurricanes and extreme rainfall.
Oceans store heat so effectively that it would take decades for them to cool down, even in the unlikely scenario that greenhouse gas emissions were halted urgently.
The report, published on Thursday in the journal Science, found that the warming of the oceans was accelerating and was matching the predictions of climate change models, which have shown global temperature rises are likely to lead to extreme weather across the world.
Zeke Hausfather, co-author of the paper and a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, said: “While 2018 will be the fourth warmest year on record on the [earth’s] surface, it will most certainly be the warmest year on record in the oceans, as was 2017 and 2016 before that. The global warming signal is a lot easier to detect if it is changing in the oceans than on the surface.”
Oceans absorb more than nine-tenths of the excess energy trapped in the atmosphere by greenhouse gases, and play a key role in regulating the world’s climate.
But the role of oceans in the global climate system was overlooked for many years, in part because of a lack of data and the difficulty of studying the marine environment. Only in recent years have scientists come to realise the full importance of oceans, which have effectively absorbed much of the impact of climate change in recent decades, but are now understood to be reaching their capacity as a buffer.
Separate recently published research extrapolated temperature estimates for the oceans for the past 150 years, and found substantial warming.
Published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, that research found the total heat taken up by the oceans in the last century and a half was about 1,000 times the annual energy use of the world’s population.
A Guardian analysis of those findings suggested that the amount of energy absorbed by the oceans was equivalent to an atomic bomb per second for the past 150 years. Scientists said this was unsustainable in the long term without seeing further massive effects, including extreme weather, fiercer storms, and sea level rises.
The heating could also affect sea currents around the world, with unpredictable consequences.
Late last year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that the world would face dire effects from global warming from 2030 unless urgent and drastic measures are taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The new Science paper analysed four studies published between 2014 and 2017, which corrected for discrepancies between different types of ocean temperature measurements and gaps in measurements.
Satellite monitoring, buoys and ships are all used to gather data on the effect of climate change on the oceans. In the past decade, a network of 4,000 buoys known as Argo has provided an unprecedented data set on the temperature, salinity and acidification of oceans.
By taking the four studies, with different methodologies, into consideration the authors of the new analysis were able to build a fuller picture than was previously possible, with calculations extrapolated back to the 1970s.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/10/warming-oceans-likely-to-raise-sea-levels-30cm-by-end-of-century-study

With 85% of the population living within 50km of the coast, the beach holds a special place in Australian culture, identity and our capacity for endless arguments.
What makes a good beach? Emotions run high and the lists run long. It could be the place your family picked or some half-mythical spot your mates once showed you, that doesn’t really have a name.
Sydneysiders scoff at the cold waters of St Kilda, while Bondi is a hell-hole compared with the serenity of Western Australia and the clear waters of Queensland, as long as you, uh, don’t look at Brisbane’s South Bank.
But who’s right? In an attempt to determine this, Guardian Australia is running a poll so you can pick Australia’s favourite beach.
We spoke to Australia’s beach ambassador, Brad Farmer, who has visited a vast chunk of the country’s 11,761 beaches (including the islands) and reviewed them, and also seen the slow degradation that threatens them. He points out that there’s probably a big difference between Australia’s best beach and an individual’s favourite beach.
We are also in danger of loving our beaches to death. At Hyams beach, in Jervis Bay, New South Wales, thousands of cars and illegal campers have to be cleared every season. Wherever we go, a tide of plastics and microplastics follows us. Two years of data analysed by Guardian Australia shows that plastic accounts for 75% of the litter on our beaches – chip packets, cups, decaying bags.
Climate change is speeding up coastal erosion, and even the deadly jellyfish are moving south, thanks to warming waters.
We have more than 11,000 beaches in Australia, and cannot include them all in the poll. But don’t be too alarmed if your favourite isn’t listed – you can enter it in and start a campaign to get it added. If there are enough people behind your beach, we’ll include it. Please note, however, that only coastal beaches will count (sorry Wagga Wagga).
We’ll also be watching for voter fraud, after this year’s New Zealand bird of the year competition was hacked, and our own Australian 2017 bird of the year poll detected some automated voting for the powerful owl. Not on our watch.
There are three categories: metro, regional and remote. You can vote once in each category.

The first Sitka spruces were notched into the grassy Borders hill just over 40 years ago, making them almost a decade older than me. For all my life, Wolfhopelee hill – which shares its abstruse name with, and is visible from, the house I grew up in – has been covered in rows of trees. When they were smaller, adders basked along the crushed stone track, and the grassy rides remained as fragments of the old sheep-grazed landscape. As the trees grew, the rides shrank and woodland species arrived: goldcrests, siskins and the occasional red squirrel.
Now the spruces’ time is up. This whole section of forest is being felled and will be replanted. Clear-felling is banned in Switzerland and has largely been abandoned in Germany, but is still favoured by British forest managers: it is faster and more profitable than selective felling.
I watch a contractor load logs on to his eight-wheeled forwarder, picking up giant scoops with the claw-like grab arm. Using the grab as a counterweight, he bumps over an undulating mat of twigs and broken branches to the log stack. It’s skilled work. The best lengths will be milled for construction or fencing, while thinner sections go for biomass pellets or chipboard.
The Cumbrian naturalist Derek Ratcliffe likened a clear-felled plantation to a battlefield, and this is what awaits me round the corner. I pass a forester’s caravan with a satellite dish and a sign warning me that I am on CCTV, and reach the summit. What I remember as a patch of open tussocks fringed with spruce (a favourite viewpoint) is now a quarry, the hill gouged out to remove the shale that surfaces the tracks. Otherwise there is nothing but a flattened mess of brash, with the occasional dead tree left standing, like the survivor of a wildfire.
Then I hear a familiar sound. Through the still morning air comes the rising and falling chinking and clinking of a flock of crossbills in flight. They land in the bare branches of a dead tree and begin preening, their bodies silhouetted like miniature parrots against the grey sky.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/14/country-diary-the-spruces-time-is-up

His return to the Luquillo rainforest in Puerto Rico after 35 years was to reveal an appalling discovery. The insect population that once provided plentiful food for birds throughout the mountainous national park had collapsed. On the ground, 98% had gone. Up in the leafy canopy, 80% had vanished. The most likely culprit by far is global warming.
“It was just astonishing,” Lister said. “Before, both the sticky ground plates and canopy plates would be covered with insects. You’d be there for hours picking them off the plates at night. But now the plates would come down after 12 hours in the tropical forest with a couple of lonely insects trapped or none at all.”
“It was a true collapse of the insect populations in that rainforest,” he said. “We began to realise this is terrible – a very, very disturbing result.”
Earth’s bugs outweigh humans 17 times over and are such a fundamental foundation of the food chain that scientists say a crash in insect numbers risks “ecological Armageddon”. When Lister’s study was published in October, one expert called the findings “hyper-alarming”.
The Puerto Rico work is one of just a handful of studies assessing this vital issue, but those that do exist are deeply worrying. Flying insect numbers in Germany’s natural reserves have plunged 75% in just 25 years. The virtual disappearance of birds in an Australian eucalyptus forest was blamed on a lack of insects caused by drought and heat. Lister and his colleague Andrés García also found that insect numbers in a dry forest in Mexico had fallen 80% since the 1980s.
“We are essentially destroying the very life support systems that allow us to sustain our existence on the planet, along with all the other life on the planet,” Lister said. “It is just horrifying to watch us decimate the natural world like this.”
It was not insects that drew Lister to the Luquillo rainforest for the first time in the mid-1970s. “I was interested in competition among the anoles lizards,” he said. “They’re the most diverse group of vertebrates in the world and even by that time had become a paradigm for ecology and evolutionary studies.”
The forest immediately captivated Lister, a lecturer at Rensselaer Polytechnic University in the US. “It was and still is the most beautiful forest I have ever been in. It’s almost enchanted. There’s the lush verdant forest and cascading waterfalls, and along the roadsides there are carpets of multicoloured flowers. It’s a phantasmagoric landscape.”
It was important to measure insect numbers, as these are the lizards’ main food, but at the time he thought nothing more of it. Returning to the national park decades later, however, the difference was startling.
“One of the things I noticed in the forest was a lack of butterflies,” he said. “They used to be all along the roadside, especially after the rain stopped, hundreds upon hundreds of them. But we couldn’t see one butterfly.”
Since Lister’s first visits to Luquillo, other scientists had predicted that tropical insects, having evolved in a very stable climate, would be much more sensitive to climate warming. “If you go a little bit past the thermal optimum for tropical insects, their fitness just plummets,” he said.
As the data came in, the predictions were confirmed in startling fashion. “The number of hot spells, temperatures above 29C, have increased tremendously,” he said. “It went from zero in the 1970s up to something like 44% of the days.” Factors important elsewhere in the world, such as destruction of habitat and pesticide use, could not explain the plummeting insect populations in Luquillo, which has long been a protected area.
Data on other animals that feed on bugs backed up the findings. “The frogs and birds had also declined simultaneously by about 50% to 65%,” Lister said. The population of one dazzling green bird that eats almost nothing but insects, the Puerto Rican tody, dropped by 90%.
Lister calls these impacts a “bottom-up trophic cascade”, in which the knock-on effects of the insect collapse surge up through the food chain.
“I don’t think most people have a systems view of the natural world,” he said. “But it’s all connected and when the invertebrates are declining the entire food web is going to suffer and degrade. It is a system-wide effect.”
To understand the global scale of an insect collapse that has so far only been glimpsed, Lister says, there is an urgent need for much more research in many more habitats. “More data, that is my mantra,” he said.
The problem is that there were very few studies of insect numbers in past decades to serve as a baseline, but Lister is undeterred: “There’s no time like the present to start asking what’s going on.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/15/insect-collapse-we-are-destroying-our-life-support-systems

Experts who have worked in the federal government under Republicans and Democrats say both have sometimes put politics ahead of science but none have done so as blatantly as Trump. And they warn the consequences could continue long into the future. 
“It’s as egregious as I’ve ever seen it, starting from the very top with the president just denying the existence of science, manipulating the system on behalf of special interests,” said the former surgeon general Richard Carmona, who testified to Congress that the George W Bush administration pushed him to weaken or suppress public health findings.
Trump’s high-profile denial of manmade climate change has occasionally overshadowed the many other ways his agencies are contradicting established research.
The administration is really not using science. It is using ideology
The agriculture department last month rolled back standards for schools to serve more whole grains, less salt and non-fat flavored milk. Department officials claimed schools struggled with the programs because students wouldn’t eat healthier foods.
But research found the food changes didn’t deter students from getting lunch and didn’t cause more plate waste. And the healthier food requirements were projected to be effective: one study estimated they could prevent 1.8 million cases of childhood obesity over a decade.
“I do think it’s pretty clear that these standards are working and that given more time, they will work better,” said Karen Perry Stillerman, a food policy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists.
The Trump administration is also cutting short evidence-based grants for teen pregnancy prevention programs, favoring curriculum focused on abstinence instead, despite a large body of research that shows abstinence-only programs don’t work. A 2007 evaluation of four federal abstinence programs found that they had no impact on sexual activity or rates of unprotected sex among teens.
Sara Flowers, the vice-president of education for Planned Parenthood, said the majority of the programs previously funded demonstrated young people changed their behavior in at least one of five categories: delaying sex, reducing sexual partners, increasing contraceptive use, reducing rates of sexually transmitted infections or reducing rates of pregnancy. 
“The administration is really not using science. The administration is really using ideology, and those are very different,” Flowers said. “This [program] has been rigorously tested by experts and vetted and analyzed.”
The Trump administration has also erroneously questioned the effectiveness of contraceptives in rules expanding exemptions for employers that don’t want to cover them under insurance plans.
Climate change and environmental science have also been at the forefront of the battle between science and the Trump administration. Power plant and car standards are being rolled back, as are pesticide restrictions and wildlife protections.
The Trump administration has ignored climate scientists’ warnings that rising temperatures and more extreme weather will hurt the US economy and risk lives. The interior department initially sought to remove references to manmade climate change in a report about how sea-level rise might flood national parks.
“The notion of there being political appointees who try to impose their political agenda in a way that is contrary to scientific evidence is not a new thing, but it has reached an entirely new level in the Trump administration,” said the Obama science adviser John Holdren.
One of the first major decisions by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was to forego a ban on the pesticide chlorpyrifos, which is associated with developmental delays and health problems in children and has sickened farm workers. Judges ordered the EPA to bar the substance, citing the science that shows it is dangerous. The agency is appealing the case.
Agency officials have also made fundamental changes to how the federal government weighs environmental and health research.
The former EPA administrator Scott Pruitt barred scientists working with EPA grants from serving on the science advisory panels that help shape policies. Instead, industries and states now have more sway over those boards.
The agency also plans to limit what science it will consider, requiring any studies used in the regulatory process to publish confidential participant data. 
A Democratic staffer for the House science committee, which plans to investigate the administration’s science cuts, said it’s been hard to even track all the agency changes.
John Bachmann, who advised the controversial Reagan-era EPA appointee Anne Gorsuch Burford on air pollution science, said she would listen to briefings on peer-reviewed data, even as she slashed budgets and eased enforcement.
“That was the most comparable period,” Bachmann said. “That was nothing compared to what we’re seeing now.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/16/trumps-war-on-science-how-the-us-is-putting-politics-above-evidence

It requires huge cuts in red meat-eating in western countries and radical changes across the world.
The “planetary health diet” was created by an international commission seeking to draw up guidelines that provide nutritious food to the world’s fast-growing population. At the same time, the diet addresses the major role of farming – especially livestock – in driving climate change, the destruction of wildlife and the pollution of rivers and oceans.
Globally, the diet requires red meat and sugar consumption to be cut by half, while vegetables, fruit, pulses and nuts must double. But in specific places the changes are stark. North Americans need to eat 84% less red meat but six times more beans and lentils. For Europeans, eating 77% less red meat and 15 times more nuts and seeds meets the guidelines.
The diet is a “win-win”, according to the scientists, as it would save at least 11 million people a year from deaths caused by unhealthy food, while preventing the collapse of the natural world that humanity depends upon. With 10 billion people expected to live on Earth by 2050, a continuation of today’s unsustainable diets would inevitably mean even greater health problems and severe global warming.
Unhealthy diets are the leading cause of ill health worldwide, with 800 million people currently hungry, 2 billion malnourished and further 2 billion people overweight or obese. The world’s science academies recently concluded that the food system is broken. Industrial agriculture is also devastating the environment, as forests are razed and billions of cattle emit climate-warming methane.
“The world’s diets must change dramatically,” said Walter Willett at Harvard University and one of the leaders of the commission convened by the Lancet medical journal and the Eat Forum NGO. The report, published in the Lancet and being launched to policymakers in 40 cities around the world, also concluded that food waste must be halved to 15%.
“Humanity now poses a threat to the stability of the planet,” said Prof Johan Rockström at the Stockholm Resilience Centre, Sweden, another author of the report. “[This requires] nothing less than a new global agricultural revolution.” Farm yields in poorer nations must be improved to create a sustainable, healthy world, the report found.
The planetary health diet is largely plant-based and allows an average of 2,500 calories a day. It allows one beef burger and two servings of fish a week, but most protein comes from pulses and nuts. A glass of milk a day, or some cheese or butter, fits within the guidelines, as does an egg or two a week. Half of each plate of food under the diet is vegetables and fruit, and a third is wholegrain cereals.
Willett said these provide the ingredients for a flexible and varied diet: “We are not talking about a deprivation diet here; we are talking about a way of eating that can be healthy, flavourful and enjoyable.
“The numbers for red meat sound small to a lot of people in the UK or US,” he said. “But they don’t sound small to the very large part of the world’s population that already consumes about that much or even less. It is very much in line with traditional diets.”
The planetary health diet resembles those already known to be healthy, such as the Mediterranean or Okinawa diets, the researchers said.
“The planetary health diet is based on really hard epidemiological evidence, where researchers followed large cohorts of people for decades,” said Marco Springmann at Oxford University and part of the commission. “It so happens that if you put all that evidence together you get a diet that looks similar to some of the healthiest diets that exist in the real world.”
The report acknowledges the radical change it advocates and the difficulty of achieving it: “Humanity has never aimed to change the global food system on the scale envisioned. Achieving this goal will require rapid adoption of numerous changes and unprecedented global collaboration and commitment: nothing less than a Great Food Transformation.”
But it notes that major global changes have occurred before, such as the Green Revolution that hugely increased food supplies in the 1960s. Moves to tax red meat, prevent the expansion of farmland and protect swathes of ocean must all be considered, the commission said.
Prof Guy Poppy, from the UK’s University of Southampton, and not part of the commission, said: “This ‘call to arms’ with its clear solutions is timely, comprehensively researched and deserves immediate attention.”
“This analysis is the most advanced ever conducted,” said Prof Alan Dangour, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and also not part of the team. “But there is a major question about the ability of populations to shift to such dietary recommendations and their wider public acceptability.”
Prof Nigel Scollan, at Queen’s University Belfast and part of the industry-backed Meat Advisory Panel, said: “This report tells us what we have known for millennia: an omnivorous diet is optimal. In the UK, encouraging people to eat less red meat and dairy will have little impact on the environment and is potentially damaging to people’s health.”
But Richard Horton and Tamara Lucas, editors at the Lancet, said in an editorial that global changes as set out by the planetary health diet were essential: “Civilisation is in crisis.

Plants grasses and herbs and shrubs in the same vicinity, encourage mulch, try to bring the soil back to life, because chances are if you’re planting in urban or former industrial-agricultural areas the soil has been killed off, all lifeforms from invertebrates to fungi are absent; the soil needs to be organic.The more diversity in flora that one can reintroduce – species wise and variety in age - the wider the range in diversity of fauna; get the bottom-end of the food-chain in place (bugs, skinks, etc) and other species will return.And it just need not be trees that are planted, for in some locations they are ill-suited; bushes and small trees make suitable alternatives.Whilst the article extols the virtues of ‘native’ trees, this comes with a few conditions dependent upon region. Some native trees constitute weeds when planted in foreign eco-systems; a well-known example being Cootamundra wattle (Acacia baileyana), a native from the Wagga wagga region, but weed from the Blue Mountains to the Otways. The preference therefore is to seek out indigenous plants; ie plants native to your specific bioregion, for not only are they well-suited to specific areas, they are very often extremely cheap or even free from community nurseries.Furthermore, according to the California Air Resources Board, a dollar spent on capturing methane from dumps, improving car gas mileage, or planting trees cuts five times as much greenhouse gas as a dollar spent on renewables. Research from Oxford Uni notes that trees help the atmosphere no matter what, they’re comparatively low-cost, and they carry little additional risk. Each year, the Earth’s trees suck more than a hundred billion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Consequently, the more of us the more trees the planets needs. It is time town-planners (sic) rejected the endless urban sprawl based upon the destruction of ecosystems and included compact design with an abundance of flora.So, whilst it is indeed good to plant a tree.

since science did science the hell out of that idea that global effects were skewed statistically to our tiny points of cities.
BQEND
I think you misunderstand the critiques of skeptics regarding the UHI effect. I don't argue that the heat from cities is a significant part of the climate warming. I do argue, on occasion, that the ground station temperature network is biased to coverage of urban vs rural temperature trends. Therefore the real surface warming measured by ground instruments is probably lower than the various SAT datasets are showing at present.
Here's a recent peer-reviewed paper on the subject. The first sentence of the abstract is: 
BQSTART
Most climatological datasets are beset with urban temperature influences that distort long-term trends.
BQEND
Here's
another (older) paper showing that UHI varies with population, therefore any station in an area experiencing population growth should experience an increase in surface temperature regardless of climate trends.
Here's another paper showing the same thing but with high resolution satellite data.
Here's another paper which hypothesizes that part of the temperature increase from increasing urbanization is the blocking of ground level winds by skyscraper construction.

I do get that urban planning can help a lot to lower ""peak urban island effects"" a lot - but as we know from the ""urban heat island effect"" of deniers - it does not really affect or solve the impact of AGW at all - since science did science the hell out of that idea that global effects were skewed statistically to our tiny points of cities. 
I get that for us humans it is important to keep hot-spots we create ourselves as inefficient as possible. And when we stroll ""Unter den Linden"" in Berlin it is hard to disagree. It helps to be under the linden trees
But to fix the urban environment does not change the cause of the heat. The globe will in fact heat up ever so slightly more if we use tactics to slow down the excessive heat in towns. The solution of keeping a city can transfer the energy into latent for the citizens. But that leaves the energy to express itself as ""more melting of ice-sheets"" (or more turbulence, if you like). 
The area of cities are so small that if we make cities to drop temperature by 10 degrees - it will not even register on the problem called ""global warming"". Because the planet is mostly not cities. 
So the trees in the city just slow down the deeper problem of a planet warming up
The reason why science think about living in a tree hut or exploding rockets with shades in the stratosphere is just because it is unpopular to talk about CO2.

But cities are not invulnerable to climatic changes. Indeed, when it comes to heat, they can fare worse. They are also far from homogenous. Counter to the images of “domed cities” that Buckminster Fuller proposed for Manhattan in the 1960s and that Dubai is touted to be pursuing, cities do not have equally distributed temperatures. Even if they do, the risk those temperatures represent are far from equally perceived or experienced.
Australians typically pride themselves on being pretty sanguine about the nation’s extreme weather, at least when it comes to spectacular events like Dorothea Mackellar-esque “flooding rains” or disasters playing out elsewhere on our vast continent. But this week even our assumed role as the world’s most variable climate took a turn for the worse, as Australia hosted the planet’s 15 hottest sites. Many of these extreme temperatures were recorded inland in small settlements. Port Augusta, for example, with 15,000 residents, was number two on the list at 49C. Nonetheless, the heat wave rolled across the continent affecting major urban settlements such as Canberra and Western Sydney.
Just as it is not merely an issue for “the inland”, heat is also far from external to cities. Heat is produced unevenly by cities themselves, especially given the way many urban settlements have been developed to date. As detailed in the well-understood “urban heat island” effect, dense building materials like concrete take longer to heat up and cool down. Metals reflect heat back into city environments. Buildings block the wind and stop the city from cooling down. Vehicles and other machinery all produce heat, including the air-conditioning that many of us rely on to cool our internal retreats. All this means that in general the outdoor environment of a city is several degrees warmer than the surrounding countryside.
Metals reflect heat back into city environments. Buildings block the wind and stop the city from cooling down
Australia’s cities complicate this classical view of the heat island model to the extent that city centres are close to the coast and heat is ameliorated by the immense heat-absorbing capacities of the ocean and associated breezes. But the size of Australia’s cities and in many places, their lack of greenery produces large contiguous patches of heat-absorbing and -emitting materials. Many of our cities’ heat islands are therefore better termed “heat continents” reflecting their size and inland location.
For those who need or want to move around the city on foot or by bike, people are advised to stay in the shade. For this reason, the City of Greater Bendigo is working with RMIT and Spatial Vision to develop an app that enables people to find “shadeways”. But much more could be done. In some places, shady routes simply do not exist, nor do safe pedestrian or cycling routes. Increasingly cities are working to make cities more walkable in recognition of the multiple benefits that come from doing so. But these efforts need to go hand in hand with shading. In hotter cities, walkability and rideability is increasingly not only about access but about the physical qualities of those routes. Are unshaded footpaths and cycling lanes alongside busy roads really walkable or rideable? More broadly, the shading and transpiration of tree canopies can ameliorate the temperature of any space, even indoor spaces that otherwise rely on expensive and maladaptive air-conditioning.
“Leafy suburbs” have a head start when it comes to seizing the temperature controlling properties of trees. They also tend to be the older, more expensive and better built suburbs and thus inaccessible to the majority of city residents who live in hotter, more air-conditioning-dependent areas and buildings. In growing recognition of trees as an important form of public infrastructure, numerous initiatives are seeking to increase tree cover.
But trees take a long time to grow. They are also themselves vulnerable to heat and other climatic conditions, particularly in areas where urban development means the basics of good soil and water are hard to find. Besides tree planting and maintenance, therefore, protecting existing trees is paramount. At present, development for new housing tends to occur on greenfield sites where one of the first steps is to remove existing trees to enable the movement of building equipment and later cars. While some of this tree removal is compensated by later plantings, the net loss, uncertainty and lag time in accessing the ecological services of trees can be immense.
The development industry needs to rethink the term “greenfield” towards “treefields”. This would be a rediscovery of well-known landscape ecological principles put forward by Ian McHarg and others in the Woodlands development more than 50 years ago. Designing new housing leaving the trees in the ground and the existing ecosystem in place, augmented with new strategically placed plantings, would help future proof new development sites against extreme heat by reducing the amount of heat the site itself produces. Combined with the role of trees in holding carbon and absorbing carbon dioxide and thus reducing the global warming that is worsening heat extremes, protecting existing trees in treefields and further afield is ever-more essential. The “bubble” we need to live in is not a glass air-conditioned dome, it is a tree canopy.

Michelle Coles, the owner of the local cinema, took off her shoes at night to test the concrete before letting the dogs out. “People tend to stay at home,” she said. “They don’t walk around when it’s like this.”
It’s easy to see why: in the middle of the day it takes seconds to blister a dog’s paw or child’s foot. In Mildura, in northern Victoria, last week gardeners burned their hands when they picked up their tools, which had been left in the sun at 46C. Fish were dying in the rivers.
Almost every day last week a new heat record was broken in Australia. They spread out, unrelenting, across the country, with records broken for all kinds of reasons – as if the statistics were finding an infinite series of ways to say that it was hot.
The community of Noona – population 14 – reached the highest minimum ever recorded overnight in Australia – 35.9C was the coldest it got, at 7am on Friday. It was 45C by noon.
A record fell on Tuesday in Meekatharra in Western Australia – the highest minimum there ever recorded (33C). Another fell on Wednesday, 2,000 miles away, in Albury, New South Wales – their hottest day (45.6C).
It was 45C or higher for four consecutive days in Broken Hill – another record – and more than 40C for the same time period in Canberra, the nation’s capital. Nine records fell across NSW on Wednesday alone. Back in Port Augusta, Tuesday was the highest temperature since records began in 1962.
In the Niagara Cafe in Gundagai, whose claim to fame is that the former Australian prime minister John Curtin once popped in during the second world war, Tina Loukissas turned off the deep fryer, then the grill.
“It feels like you’ve walked into a sauna,” she said. “When it’s getting up to 43C or 44C, because you have all these machines going, the air conditioning isn’t coping very well.
“We’ve got tables outside that nobody has sat at for the last couple of days … You’d be crazy to sit outside on a day like today.”
In Mildura, Tolga Ozkuzucu, owner of Top Notch Gardens, had the misfortune to be working outdoors.
“It’s been like hell,” he said. “You have to try to leave your tools in the shade. If you don’t, it burns your fingers. There’s not much you can do.
“I try to start as early as I can. I’m not going to risk my body and health. People here are very understanding of that because they know how hot it is … nobody wants to be outside when it’s 46C.”
In South Australia, they declared a “code red” across Adelaide, the state capital. Homelessness services were working overtime and the Red Cross started calling round a list of 750 people who were deemed especially vulnerable.
At the Australian Open in Melbourne, only the sea breeze kept the temperature below 40C. At Adelaide’s Tour Down Under, a bike race, it was 41C.
On Monday last week the hottest spot in New South Wales was Menindee, a river town that feeds the country’s largest water system, the Murray-Darling basin. It was 45C. It climbed to 47C on Wednesday, and by Thursday the fish were gasping.
Australia’s native Murray cod can live for decades under normal conditions, growing all the while. The oldest are a metre long, with heavy white bellies that have to be held with both hands. Last week, hundreds died, choked of oxygen due to an algal bloom that fed and grew in the heat, and collapsed when temperatures dipped.
Blue-green algae flourishes in hot, slow-moving water. Then, when temperatures inevitably drop, the algae dies and becomes a food source for bacteria, who multiply and starve the river of oxygen. The fish rise to the surface.
The mass fish death has reignited a debate over water management in the region, where cotton farmers upstream have been accused of taking more water than they should.
The heat is not the root cause, the locals stress. But the five punishing days settling over the river have not made it better. Last Thursday the cod were up near the surface and struggling. On Friday, it was 45C again. In Menindee, the locals believe the fish kill will happen again, with temperatures in the 40s expected to continue into this week. The water will be running hot.
But away from the Darling, Michelle Coles from Port Augusta says she is used to the heat.
“I didn’t think it was that hot yesterday, if you want an honest answer,” she said last Wednesday, the day after the temperature hit 48.9C.
“Yesterday at the cinema, it was very quiet. People tend to stay home. We’re quite used to it. Once it’s over 40, it’s hot.
“We’re conditioned to it. Honestly, I’d much rather be in 48C heat in Port Augusta than in the city. You’ve got so much concrete and it’s closed in, but here it’s quite open.
“You just don’t stand out in the sun though. That would be stupid.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/19/australia-swelters-as-relentless-hot-weather-smashes-records

Unfortunately; most of these have been ironed out at this stage. So in this way; if you want to know what the worst scenarios are; then you might want to wade through the political stuff in James Hansen's book. However; this is really a confirmation of what Tim Flannery outlines, and its again relating to feedback events - essentially the difference between carbon dioxide and methane. 
So if you want to get to the more extreme possibilities and think about that, then read James Hansen's book; Curt Stagers book and relate that to Tim Flannery's earlier book and then you have most of the details.
The important element which is still not clear is how fast this could happen. I think we should all agree, however, that the risks are very, very big; and considering the world has the money to shift to renewable energy, in many different forms - we should use this money now. Essentially, hydrogen is where we should be spending money right now; we need a wholesale shift from hydrocarbons to hydrogen - and the faster this happens the sooner we stop emissions.

BQEND
Yes they repeatedly upheld their decision.
Lomborg, a non-expert in climate change economics and policy, bases his non-expert opinions on systematic misrepresentations of climate science, according to The Danish Committee for Scientific Dishonesty.
And they are hardly the only scientists who have reviewed Lomborg's representations of climate science and found them fraudulent (see link above).
So why are you bringing up a non-expert who tells lies about climate science?
BQSTART
What is interesting, is that his premise on where is money best spent is given hardly any interest.
BQEND
It is not interesting, because his premise cannot pass review by a single one of his peers. No fellow expert finds any of his theories compelling, which is why he presents them not to his peers but to laymen via his popular science books.
95% of his peers who actually do follow the proper scientific and academic process for scientific debate, disagree with him. All of these individuals are far more qualified on this issue, having actually studied in the field and had their theories pass scientific muster.
BQSTART
Is the academic environment biased against him?
BQEND
It is a moot point, he bypasses academia when publishing his ideas. He refuses to subject himself to the minimum standards of evidence and debate.
BQSTART
Saw that Australian university had to back out from a programme becuase of student disquiet.

Of course, millions of dollars were being given to someone who has no expertise whatsoever in their claimed academic area by a government hostile to the science of climate change.
As I have pointed out ad-nauseum, there are literally thousands of academics far more qualified to run an academic institute dedicated to climate policy - e.g. people who have actually studied it and published on the matter.
As I pointed out above, Lomborg began life basing his musings about climate policy on denial of the Greenhouse Effect - you are talking about the crudest form of science denial. This alone should be enough to colour his musings for good.
So you have someone with no expertise whatsoever in climate science, policy or economics, who refuses to publish their views in scientific journals (as has been basic practice for several centuries), a person whom climate scientists, published literature reviews and independent ethics bodies claim systematically misrepresents climate science, and who is paid $750,000 per year by an unknown list of donors (more than any actual expert in the field) in the context of billions of dollars paid to misrepresent climate science by fossil fuel interests.
But, again, it really comes down to this: Lomborg has never studied climate science, policy or economics and he has never published an academic paper on climate science, policy or economics so... why are you bringing up a non-expert?

How much is it worth spending now to avoid the worst effects of climate change in the future. 
In my opinion it is worth spending a lot to avoid climate change (so, this is called a 'low' discount rate). But the problem today is that the options for just spending money and 'fixing' the problem are very limited; we are still waiting for any country to decarbonise successfully. 
Really; you could say that it is not a straight carbon tax, in my opinion. It is putting in place effective policies; and the main one (which every country will have to do) is to replace methane for heating and industry, with hydrogen. This is going to be a little bit complicated, no matter how we do it; and it will require cooperation between countries to see out successfully, if we are not to try to capitalise on each others efforts.
But this is the central component. This is and the use of hydrogen in transport; which is now well on its way with recent announcements from Hyundai, China and Japan. There will be a flood of cheap fuel cell cars and we should not wait until they arrive to build the infrastructure.
But I believe the damage will be severe, and we should spend money on what we genuinely need to do now because we may not have the money in the future to make the fundamental changes necessary. I also believe that this is a very good reason for the global economy to remain going strong just so that we we have the money to convert all these industrial plants and so on away from fossil fuels. If we are poor, then we will never be able to do this. So its that balance between maintaining a functional economy just until we have all industry, heating etc decarbonised and switched to hydrogen. 
Both CCS and electrolysis will be used in order to decarbonise our gas grids; but the low cost of renewable electricity (and electrolysers) and the use of hydrogen in transport (and fuel cells for heating etc) should necessitate generic use of hydrogen only.

Not according to his national ethics watchdog, The Danish Committee for Scientific Dishonesty. Here's what they had to say about the book:
""[T]he publication is deemed clearly contrary to the standards of good scientific practice... there has been such perversion of the scientific message in the form of systematically biased representation that the objective criteria for upholding scientific dishonesty ... have been met"".
BQSTART
He then looks at what the economic return of each dollar invested in each field is. In principle with a limited investment pool, we should aspire to get the best return, i.e., do the most good. Not surprisingly a dollar invested in clean water, education or malaria prevention has a much larger return on investment than a dollar spent on climate change (mainly renewables).
BQEND
Lomborg has published none of these theories in any academic publication of any kind. His theories do not even reach the minimum standard of evidence we have accepted for several centuries of successful scientific endeavour.
BQSTART
He uses strictly IPCC models.
BQEND
Which IPCC model was Lomborg using when he declared that: ""The greenhouse effect is extremely doubtful""?
Lomborg arbitrarily dismisses all of the mid-to-high level projections from the IPCC. 
BQSTART
His thesis is misunderstood and unreasonably vilified by the activist CC community.
BQEND
His entire body of work has never been published in any form of academic journal. Why even bring him up?
Meanwhile, an actual peer-reviewed summary of his work concluded:
BQSTART
The Skeptical Environmentalist is not a reliable source of information and certainly not a work of science. Too often Lomborg does not seem to be looking for truth and validation but just wants to find support for a particular conviction. In his interactions with reviewers he frequently shows a mere interest to win a debate at any cost rather than to advance – his own and public – knowledge. Of course, given a lack of relevant education and research experience (and peer-reviewed publications) in natural, environmental and social sciences, Lomborg could not be expected to accomplish the formidable task of covering the wide range of themes addressed in his book... it is just a polemic.

But what brings on the demise of ice ages - known as deglaciation - during which the Earth transitions from a glacial period or ice age to an interglacial period such as the one we have been in for the last 9,000 years?
The Earth's irregular combined orbital and axial motions can at times, as at present and for the next 50,000 and more, cause a steady decline in the insolation that occurs due to the angle at which sunlight strikes in summer at high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere (Northern Hemisphere high latitude summer insolation or NHHLSI). This declining insolation produces cooling of the climate at those high northern latitudes and results in incomplete melting of the previous winter's snow and hence gradual build up of snow which eventually results in widespread glaciation at those latitudes burying peatlands, increasing albedo or reflectance, reducing oxidation of those peatlands at the same time as peatlands spread south sequestering more carbon. Reduced albedo and increased Carbon sequestration lead to lower atmospheric CO2, typically a drop from around 280 ppm to around 200 ppm, reducing the Earth's greenhouse effect and causing global cooling.
The demise of the last ice age or glacial period which occurred between 19,000 and 9,000 years ago was initiated by a peak in Northern Hemisphere high latitude summer insolation which caused a meltwater pulse into the North Atlantic from the North American and Eurasian continental glacial ice sheets. This stopped the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, switching off the deep water currents that cool the Southern Ocean, resulting in oxidation of carbon rich oceanic oozes, causing an increase in atmospheric CO2 from 200 ppm to 280 ppm over the next 10,000 years and consequent global warming which caused the bulk of the melting and retreat of the vast glacial ice sheets which covered the high latitudes of North America and Eurasia.

Meanwhile, the crisis grinds on. As DWilliams notes below, a dearth of policy and political will lies at its core. We could be starting the energy transition now on a myriad fronts if governments (national, state, borough, city) functioned properly and worked in tandem. As it is, much sterling effort to curb climate change is sporadic and small; and many governments are in thrall to fossil fuels. A number of national economies are at least partly defined by them (Canada, US, China, India, Nigeria, the Gulf states, parts of Central Asia, Norway, etc etc). 
As with CFC eradication, the effort has to be global. But CFCs were deployed mainly in fridges, freezers and air conditioners. By contrast, petroleum products have seeped into society through transport, energy, manufacturing and beyond; and fossil-fuel companies are corrupt and intractable. Big Ag - a vast source of methane emissions through livestock production - is just as corrupt and intractable. Manufacturing of useless consumables, unnecessary shipping, landfill - there are scores of other emissions sources that will not halt because of a kind of fatal apathy: this is the way it's all set up now, they'll lose money, and all the rest of the business-as-usual litany.
All of that makes the transition to renewables - including, as Nicholas Stern has pointed out, hundreds of thousands of new jobs in innovation and industry - much more difficult than it should be. Governmental and industrial unwillingness and corruption also mean that societies don't have the subsidies they need to afford installing top-notch solar panels, re-engineering their homes for energy efficiency, or make other changes necessary to radically whittle emissions down. 
During WWII, people made the changes necessary (blackout windows, backyard shelters, stockpiling) to survive, and the government conducted a vast public-information campaign to ensure it. Faced with this enemy - us - too many want to pass the buck and too few are are unwilling to take governments to task over the needed large-scale shift.

That word “unprecedented” is coming to define our time. Most of us were short-changed by educations that ignored ecology. We need clear explanations of climate change, what it means and how to cope with it.
Tim Flannery, an Australian mammalogist, is a supple writer with a wide-ranging and questioning mind. His 2005 The Weather-Makers gave lucid and easily understandable explanations of climate change, both a history and a look into what might come next. It is still a basic starting point.
Climate scientist Michael Mann and Washington Post cartoonist Tom Toles collaborated on The Madhouse Effect. It is drawn straight from the frontline of the climate wars. In trenchant sentences the authors skate out, hockey sticks swinging, and scythe the legs from under the cabal of vested interests, venal payola scientists and shadowy political éminences grises. They name names and present a player list as well as the irrefutable tough news. 
The Water Will Come by Jeff Goodell is especially good at showing the daunting complexity of solutions to on-the-ground problems in places such as Miami Beach, Alaska, New York, Venice and remote islands whose residents have nowhere to go. Here are real-world headaches of flood insurance, transportation, nuclear reactors on eroding shorelines, the tendency to rebuild rather than rethink following disasters.
Amitav Ghosh’s The Great Derangement: Climate Change and the Unthinkable is literate and probing. He presents a critical discussion of the Paris Agreement vis-a-vis Pope Francis’s Laudato Si’. As for the “unthinkable” in his book’s title, it is left to the reader to decide which of several dreadful outcomes he means. I concluded one was truly unthinkable.
Charles Wohlforth’s The Whale and the Supercomputer: On the Northern Front of Climate Change looks at two different and sporadically intermeshed groups – science experts from distant universities and local whale-hunter people of the Arctic with millennia of ice experience. The cooperations and rivalries between local residents and academic scientists matters in the way we handle the hellishly complex changes bearing down. Both groups work towards understanding how best to survive.
Peter Brannen’s The Ends of the World is a witty review of Earth’s previous global species extinctions. His discussions with experts present the evidences in the ancient rocks showing that in the vast life collapses of the geologic past CO2 was a major operative and thus a patterned back-story to our present situation; climate change extinction is new to humans but not to the planet. It puts a lid on the hubristic belief that Earth exists solely for human use.
Poet-linguist Robert Bringhurst and classicist philosopher Jan Zwicky offer a meditative approach in their Learning to Die: Wisdom in the Age of Climate Crisis. Bringhurst’s essay The Mind of the Wild outlines the liminal relations between the natural world and humans. Here the wild is the bedrock of human ethical and moral values.
He suggests that to understand what is happening we should individually “practise thinking like an ecosystem ... ” by “spending a day in the wilds – alone with reality, keeping quiet and letting things unfold”. This exercise can clarify our thinking and open windows of perception. Zwicky’s essay A Ship from Delos guides us towards ways to live and know the situation of climate change. Her beautiful recasting of Socratic excellences – awareness, courage, self-control, justice, contemplation and compassion – can profoundly shape our inner selves.

In dollars as well as power...Meanwhile, the mansion continues to burn more and more....

Total heartfelt agreement. The momentum of ""the system"" probably will not be stopped, since we're already half-way down the cliff, telling ourselves the vertigo is just performance anxiety over [insert anxiety here].
So I don't think change can happen at the speed of light, only communication. After that, at least we've informed ourselves a) What the real situation is and why, and b) What are our collective options? 
Most people think they understand the basics of Capitalism, Socialism and Communism, and that's all there is. While perhaps we will choose between variants of these ""known"" economic configurations, we would be shortchanging ourselves by not investigating a 4th way.
It was developed as a ""Middle Path"" between Capitalism(Full private ownership of value-creation) and textbook Socialism(Full public ownership of value-creation). Called ""Economic Democracy"", it has been hailed as the ultimate reconciliation between individualism, collectivism, and environmentalism by no less than Albert Einstein, Winston Churchill, Leo Tolstoy, and Aldous Huxley.
It is described in a free online book, Henry Georges Progress and Poverty, which built upon Adam Smiths 1776 Wealth of Nations to try to explain the failures of Classical Economics which Smith had so lamented: Industrial and Commercial recession, and the problem of persistent poverty amidst almost unimaginable technical progress. The introduction could have been written in 2019:
BQSTART
Yet we must now face facts we cannot mistake. All over the world, we hear complaints of industrial depression: labor condemned to involuntary idleness; capital going to waste; fear and hardship haunting workers. All this dull, deadening pain, this keen, maddening anguish, is summed up in the familiar phrase ""hard times."" ~ Henry George, San Francisco 1879
BQEND
In a nutshell, by scrambling the definitions of Land(aka nature), Wealth(what you want/need) and Money(sharing/trading mechanism) by magically pronouncing them all to be interchangeable forms of Capital(wealth reserved to make more wealth), the linkage between the Earth and real value(usable wealth) is lost.
Capitalism says Land equals Wealth equalsMoney equals Capital, which means pretty much whatever whoever controls the Myrmidons of the rent-takers wants it to mean.
That is of course, until production cannot underwrite the enormous rents, brutally extracted at whatever the market will bear. Then the economy crashes, and the monopoly game starts again on a smaller board.
Economic Democracy rights this obfuscation, by assigning the correct relationship as:Land causes Wealth causes Money with _repeated_ application of Labor, true Capital and Trade.
Nominal owners of natural opportunities should pay for civilization, not those who do the work of building and maintaining it. Economic Democracy suggests a simple market-based mechanism to get the most out of the least land, while the benefits of land ownership accrue to everyone, not just inheritors. Everyone has incentive to make sure land doesn't degrade, and the power to enforce those desires.
If you're interested in further investigation, especially in why no one seems to know about this, or pretends they do and insists it is old hat even though they can't explain why, Here are a few rabbit holes I found fascinating. I've also written a lot in these comments if you have absolutely nothing else better to do. Questions and thoughts most welcome.

Prime Minister Julia Gillard’s correctness in endorsing a carbon tax was resoundingly confirmed by China acting to do so. 
It was the view of twelve senior European and American economists and scientists that the carbon levy will “put Australia in the vanguard of the development of low-carbon technologies”. They obviously didn’t see any real action by the UK and EU, whatever promising targets might have been adopted. 
Rabid Right ideologues should have welcomed Gillard Labor’s carbon pricing, it being a classic price signal. Big Energy indicated at the COP21 Paris Environment summit, and since, that it accepts the need for decarbonisation. That it seeks a market-based mechanism to avoid regulation is only to be expected. 
Ironically, it worked. Pitt&Sherry’s energy analyst found that in its two years of life (2010-2013), emissions from electricity generation fell an exceptional 10.6%, while in next 21 months they’d climbed 5.6%, and have been increasing every quarter since. An abrupt change in the mix of electricity generation “away from hydro and back to brown and black coal as removal of the carbon price changed the relative costs”. What a surprise!
Further, the abbott Misgovernment’s behaviour assured us that saving energy was no longer that important. So does Turnbull, now.

A couple of brief comments: God, the Cloud, the Market (the much mis-quoted 'invisible hand') all have religious undertones of some positive higher power that means we don't have to do stuff, we can just 'trust' someone/thing to look after our best interests.

Economics has steadfastly refused to seriously take into its orbit many of the critiques - from quality of life measures, the distorted economic definition of growth, through paying attention to the roles of ethical production & consumption in human meaning, & stock measures of material wealth rather than flow & throughput. So don't expect any changes from economics. It prefers to leave things out into the area of 'externalities'. In fact, that has been part of the political economy of intentional neolib strategy for slashing public services: cut the services, force or cajole people into voluntary work (from internships through work-for-dole through reciprocality guilt trips)...voila, your average bod gradually replaces some public services whilst the powerful interest focus on what they know best.
As a couple of comments note, the record of both capitalism & socialism hasn't been too flash. Both Smith & Marx were materialist philosophers writing in earlier times, but neither would have been so fixed in thoughts to not be able to question their own writings if they had foreseen historical developments & circumstances of today. But, as Jeff has written elsewhere, we are a little short on practical utopian thoughts these days. And there are the usual 'we'll be back in the caves' comments from those who fear the prospect that, if the cake is finite, we then start to seriously question about who gets what share of it.

Obviously our system of material existence(economics) is destroying the planet. This must be because value has been decoupled from the things which confer it. Otherwise it would not destroy the basis for it's own prosperity, and of our very life/spirit-support. It was a clever trick. 
Folding nature into the capitalist delusion is an equally clever trap, and you are totally right to point at it and blow a loud whistle. But they are caught in their own delusion, and since they are caught in nature regardless, also their own trap.

1946 must have been a big year on the literary scene. In his 1946 introduction to Brave New World, Aldous Huxley describes a vision for humanity he has just read and digested - obviously unknown to him in 1931 - Progress and Poverty by Henry George. He writes:

Yesterday morning I sat under a public rotunda next to the river where I live. It's a truly delightful spot. I looked and listened to the trees. I saw a big squadron of ducks fly in perfect formation and land on the river. A group of Magpies stopped by. A few walked on the floor around my legs. Some sat on the tables behind me. And one very friendly Magpie came right up close and sat on the table beside me.They chirped and sang and chatted loudly to each other. Up and down with their sing-song sounds which to my ear, sounded like the sweetest chorus. Their chorus was so good and so clear that I wished I'd had a device with me to record them.
The reason I thought of recording them was because I wondered how much longer they'd be around for me or anyone to see and hear them up close, personal and first-hand. I wondered how long it would be before the only place I'd see them would be in some select enclosure or zoo or via some documentary or digital vision. And I wondered how long it would be before the only way I could hear their sounds would be on a CD or some App or similar. I wondered how much longer the water would still be running in the river and how much longer the ducks would still be alive and able to fly there in perfect formation.
I prefer to use the yardstick of the Civil Law Courts i.e The BALANCE of PROBABILITIES.So I sat there and thought - on the balance of probabilities?  Still here in 5 years? Probably - but not confident enough to punt the house and the dog on it......10 years? Maybe - but probably nowhere near their current numbers and not anywhere near their current conditions.15 years?  Doubtful. Unlikely. Don't like their chances at all. Wouldn't even punt my breakfast coffee on it.20 years? Very highly probably...dead in the water. Literally. River stale or run dry. Just a memory. No more ducks. No more Magpies.

It's universal. ""all available real-world evidence"" is meaningless hyperbole.""
Resource and energy intensity of GDP can decline all they want (and to be honest, it's a pretty shallow curve) - they are not going to zero, so if you keep increasing GDP overall, then resource use will also continue to grow. On this finite planet, whatever you do, at some point you hit a wall where you can not grow any further without eating into your capital (to use terminology you can relate to). We have hit that wall quite some time ago, and we currently do not have the technology to access resources from off-planet.
Tell me, how do you look at statistics on deforestation, loss of wildlife and biodiversity, declining fish stocks, massive plastic pollution, and still tell yourself that because there's some graphs of 'monotonically declining energy intensity of GDP', the system's obviously just grand.
""And the other real biggie. What do you think that the massive increase in agricultural yields represent if it's not more efficient use of land.""
It represents exactly what I mentioned above - eating into our capital. 
What do you think of the estimated 30% of the planet's arable land having been lost to erosion and pollution? ""The continual ploughing of fields, combined with heavy use of fertilizers, has degraded soils across the world, the research found, with erosion occurring at a pace of up to 100 times greater than the rate of soil formation.""
Is that your idea of efficient? In reality, it's not efficient if it's not sustainable. 
I'm positive you understand this when managing your own life.

That’s George Orwell in his essay Some Thoughts on the Common Toad.
“So long as you are not actually ill, hungry, frightened or immured in a prison or a holiday camp,” he continues, “Spring is still spring. The atom bombs are piling up in the factories, the police are prowling through the cities, the lies are streaming from the loudspeakers, but the earth is still going round the sun, and neither the dictators nor the bureaucrats, deeply as they disapprove of the process, are able to prevent it.”
But, of course, now they have.
Today spring’s no longer spring – at least not in the old way.
With climate change wrecking the seasonal rhythms, scientists find plants emerging from the soil earlier than ever before. Almost everywhere, the ancient patterns have gone awry: last November, for instance, summer temperatures killed a third – yes, a third! – of Australia’s remaining spectacled flying foxes.
The atom bombs, the police, the dictators and the bureaucrats remain with us and, God knows, so do the lies streaming from the loudspeakers. But, as the sociologist John Bellamy Foster noted back in 2002, Orwell’s beloved toads are now vanishingly rare, with some 200 different species of amphibians driven to extinction in the last few decades.
Some Thoughts on the Common Toad appeared in the socialist newspaper Tribune in 1946 just as the planet entered what environmentalists call “The Great Acceleration”: the period in which the human boot, weighing heavily since the industrial revolution, began to stamp on the face of nature.
Throughout the post-war boom, the tremendous expansion of the global economy drew more and more of the world into the circuit of capital. Ocean acidification, biodiversity loss, greenhouse gas emissions: all of these, and other indicators, shot violently upward from the late 1940s on.
The periodisation highlights a fundamental problem in the fight against climate change today.
We know now that scientists understood all the key principles of global warming decades ago. Furthermore, as Nathaniel Rich notes, back in the 1980s a real response seemed eminently feasible as “many prominent Republicans joined Democrats in judging the climate problem to be a rare political winner: non-partisan and of the highest possible stakes”.
But the early consensus for climate action coincided with what Naomi Klein dubs “the absolute zenith of the neoliberal crusade”. As a result, the leaders who committed to fighting warming also ruled out any response to emissions incompatible with their free market dogma.
Thus, in the negotiations that led to the Kyoto Protocol, the US, with the backing of companies like Enron, insisted that international efforts for climate change mitigation rely on business-friendly, market-based mechanisms such as cap and trade schemes. Even though Washington eventually refused to ratify Kyoto, the methodology championed by it (and institutions like the World Bank) became, by the early 2000s, an unassailable political orthodoxy.
Again, the notion that the market offered the best (or indeed the only) mechanism for fighting climate change was always pure ideology. For instance governments can shut down coal-fuelled power stations whenever they like – they don’t need price signals to pass legislation. In the real world, as researcher Jesse Jenkins explained to the New York Times “policies other than carbon pricing have driven the majority of emissions reductions to date”.
The ideologically-determined attempts to generate environmental outcomes through market action thus resembled huge Rube Goldberg machines, dependent on ultra-convoluted systems for results that can also be produced by non-market means.
But those fossil fuel corporations who supported (and sometimes led) the early campaigns for emissions trading systems saw the redundant complexity of market environmentalism as a feature, not a bug. Companies like BP and Shell understood – better than many environmentalists – that, in practice, a trading system could amount to a massive subsidy for big polluters since they could profit hugely by “selling” emissions they didn’t actually require.
Furthermore, because a trade in carbon allowed the purchase of credits associated with carbon offsets (usually in the developing world), tremendous opportunities opened up for creative (and sometimes blatantly dishonest) accounting. An EU study from 2017 found that a full 85% of offset projects actually failed to reduce emissions at all.
Many progressives reluctantly embraced free market environmentalism, judging any action to be better than none – particularly as overt climate change denialism grew.
But that missed something else that the corporates grasped: namely, that the “put a price on carbon” slogan accepted, by definition, the commodification of the environment.
That was, after all, the goal of pricing: transforming nature, in all its complexity and diversity, into an asset legible within a corporate ledger.
Fixing a market value on carbon was never supposed to halt the economic activity underpinning the Great Acceleration. On the contrary, it was intended to speed it up. Even if trading schemes do cut greenhouse gases (which, by and large, they don’t), they’re designed, as pro-business measures, not to limit industrial expansion but to foster it. They’re meant explicitly to encourage more economic growth – and that’s something that’s no longer compatible with the preservation of nature.
As Foster points out, a continuous 3% average annual rate of growth means that world industry doubles every twenty-five years, grows by a factor of sixteen every century, and 4,000 times every three centuries. Given the current state of the planet, how would that not bring utter ruination? The World Wildlife Fund says that populations of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles and amphibians have declined by 60% since 1970. What will be left if we continue economic metastasisation for another half century?
In political terms, the embrace by progressives of mitigation schemes so closely associated with big business has proved utterly disastrous. Over the last decades, an “environmentalism” that rewarded rapacious corporations seemed to many ordinary people less a strategy for preserving the planet they depended upon and more a rhetorical bludgeon wielded by an out-of-touch political class.
Take the experience in France, where President Emmanuel Macron, pledging to Make the Planet Great Again, introduced another neoliberal nostrum – a carbon tax.
A recent study revealed that carbon taxes don’t make a meaningful difference to the climate because governments invariably set them at too low a rate. Why? Well, carbon taxes are innately regressive – they pass the cost of reform onto the consumers who can least afford it – and thus are rarely popular.
In France Macron implemented his levy on fuel as part of a broader austerity package – and spurred the Yellow Vest revolt, a rebellion led by workers living outside the metropolitan centres, and with no choice but to use cars.
In other words, in the name of environmentalism, Macron managed to alienate France’s poorest – the very people who will suffer most in a warming future and so should have been a key constituency for change.
That’s why Thoughts on the Common Toad repays re-reading.
In his essay, Orwell takes for granted an affinity between everyday nature and working class people, who can, he suggests, find an alternative to oppression and exploitation in the environment around them.
“Even in the most sordid street the coming of spring will register itself by some sign or other, if it is only a brighter blue between the chimney pots or the vivid green of an elder sprouting on a blitzed site. Indeed it is remarkable how Nature goes on existing unofficially, as it were, in the very heart of London.”
In other words, Orwell celebrates an uncommodified environment, explicitly because it doesn’t obey the rules of the market.
“[T]he pleasures of spring are available to everybody, and cost nothing,” he explains, before exulting at the thought of birds, in the midst of bourgeois Britain, flagrantly avoiding rent.
The Great Deceleration we require today means deploying our scientific and technical knowledge to undo the damage we’ve wreaked. It means embracing economic planning, so that we use scarce resources for human need rather than corporate profit; it means confronting the military-industrial complex and abandoning the fossil economy; it means involving ordinary people in the decisions that shape their lives.
It means, in other words, constructing a non-market society, as scary as that idea will seem to some
In 1946 Orwell, a lifelong socialist, defended an appreciation of nature as something that made “a peaceful and decent future a little more probable”. The joy that he took in toads and kestrels and other creatures that evaded the market’s invisible hand hinted at an older kind of society – and potentially, a newer one.
The dictators and bureaucrats might be ruining spring, as they force every living organism to bear the consequences for their profits. But for most of human history we did not live under generalised commodity production, an economic order that’s remarkably recent. And if the past was different, the future can be, too.
As we struggle to preserve our only planet, that insight matters more than ever.

His arguments relate specifically to electricity generation in Victoria, but actually they apply pretty much across the board concerning privatisation.
Mr Legge contends that putting electricity generation and distribution into private hands has neither reduced prices nor served the broader public interest. What is more, the facts back him up.
Victoria's State Electricity Commission (SEC) generated and sold power to Victorian consumers from 1926 to 1998. In every single year it reduced the real price of power to customers. This meant that for ordinary households buying electricity took a smaller part of their earnings in each successive year.
Since privatisation, however, electricity prices to the consumer have gone up 50 per cent (2010).
Managing price was undoubtedly the SEC's crowning achievement. 
But the SEC also trained thousands of apprentices in electricity and other workplace skills. Eventually, many of these highly skilled tradesmen found their way into the wider workforce. In a similar manner, the SEC also trained engineers and other skilled workers, not all of whom chose to remain in the commission's employ. Either way, the community got the benefit of skills-training provided by the SEC.
The current privately-owned generating company does none of this. Nor does Stokes HRL which he got for a song after $30million of taxpayers' money was spent on how to try and clean up brown coal at Hazlewood.
As to the matter of safety and security, the old non privitised SEC maintained its generating and delivery systems in pristine condition. The same cannot be said for the private operators. For example, Black Saturday bush-fires, some fires were started by poorly maintained power lines.
But how could the SEC have run a system cheaper and better than the current private operators, especially when we have been told repeatedly over the last 30 years that governments cannot do these things as well as private enterprise?

The announcement of another review satisfies the wishes of anti-wind energy campaigners who have a track record urging more research, while ignoring findings that show wind energy is clean and safe. 
Victoria’s one term Baillieu Napthine Coalition government was right behind the IPA demand of their tool Abbott to stop the renewables industry. Australia’s most active wind farm opposition group, the Waubra Foundation, has links to the Liberal party. Former Liberal politicians Michael Wooldridge and Alby Schultz had or still do have positions at the organisation; thus Hazlewood gets the nod while renewables get the chop.

While some parts of the country that have sweltered today will get some relief tomorrow, others will heat up. The latest forecast is for a high of 44C in Melbourne, 39C in Canberra and 38C in Penrith in western Sydney (the forecast for Sydney is for a high of 29C). Hobart is expected to reach a high of 37C, Brisbane 32C and Darwin 32C.
SA’s Port Augusta, where it hit a maximum of 49.5C earlier today, will still be very hot – 37C.
Menindee, the site of recent fish kills in western New South Wales, is predicted to reach 48C on Friday.
We will bring you the latest on the Tasmanian bushfires and the ongoing heatwave tomorrow.
The heatwave has been hard on animals and humans alike. This image was sent to us by reader Andrew Correll.
The ABC is reporting South Australia’s emergency power generators have been switched on for the first time amid the ongoing heatwave.
It reports: “Temporary diesel power generators owned by the South Australian government have been switched on for the first time, as the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) deals with record-breaking heat conditions across SA and Victoria.
“The state government said AEMO ordered the generators to deal with a supply shortfall in Victoria.”
And here’s how far the heat will stretch tonight. There’s still a lot of 40C spots, as of right now, all across the country. 
As was expected the extreme heat has shifted towards the southeast. The current temperatures again show the vast extent of this heat extending across the country, with large areas above 40 degrees. Take care heading home tonight. #heatwave #scorcher https://t.co/TmC85ZM3UL pic.twitter.com/WoZk7IU1yu
I’m now remembering some ominous words from the mayor of Port Augusta, Brett Benbow, who we spoke to earlier. “[The heat] won’t peak until about 7.30 tonight,” he said. “That heat won’t just disappear, it takes hours.”
For context, the highest temperature ever recorded in Australia is 50.7C, at Oodnadatta airport in South Australia, on 2 January 1960.
At 49.5C, Port Augusta is now equal to the highest ever Queensland temperature, recorded on Christmas Eve 1972 at Birdsville police station, and only 0.2C below the highest NSW temperature – from 10 January 1939 at Menindee post office.
Port Augusta has already beaten the highest temperatures in Victoria, the Northern Territory and Tasmania.
We’ve already watched Port Augusta – the hottest place in Australia today – break its all-time heat record with 49.1C earlier in the day. The previous record was set just 10 days ago (48.9C). 
Now it’s crept up again. Port Augusta has hit 49.5C, as of 4.22pm. 
Hello everyone, Naaman Zhou here, taking over from my colleague Luke. 
Some further clarification has come in on Adelaide’s record-breaking heat. It’s even hotter than you thought. 
That 46.6C figure comes from the bureau’s official temperature gauge for the city, which is at West Terrace. Other parts of Adelaide, by the bureau’s own calculations, are in fact soaring up past that – but can’t be included as the maximum for Adelaide. 
Kent Town, for example, has officially hit 47.4C today. 
While the West Terrace observation is the “official” Adelaide temperature, look at the reading in Kent Town 👁 👁 pic.twitter.com/flRK7bkIXc
The mercury has continued to rise in Adelaide, which can now lay claim to being the hottest capital in Australia – at least for today. 
Its peak temperature on Thursday of 46.6 has eclipsed the record held by Melbourne, which reached 46.4C. 
#Adelaide is now the hottest capital in Australia, having just reached 46.6C at 3:35pm, beating the previous record in #Melbourne of 46.4 @BOM_Vic More records: Whyalla 48.5 (prev. record 48.0), Leigh Creek 46.9 (prev. 46.3), and Port Augusta 49.1 (prev. 48.9) #heatwave
A reminder that Melbourne is expected to drop to an “oppressive” 29C tonight. The overnight record is 30.6C.
The bureau has also revised its forecast up to 44C for tomorrow. As it stands, today’s forecast has also been blown out of the water. The top temperature in central Melbourne was 40.4C at 4pm, according to the bureau. It was only expected to reach 36C. 
An oppressive night ahead for #Melbourne. 🥵 pic.twitter.com/JLnF0kcx4I
I would not recommend this.

All eyes have been on whether Port Augusta, the hottest place in Australia, can break its own record of 48.9C that was set on 15 January. 
It appears to have done so. The Bureau of Meteorology’s observations data says the town hit a peak temperature of 49.1C at 3.15pm. 
Crews battling scores of fires across Tasmania will be without water-bombing aircraft on one of the highest-risk days on record and major national parks will be closed as a precaution.
Fifty fires are burning across the state on Thursday. Two-thirds of them are considered uncontained, and authorities are bracing for worsening conditions.
“On a whole, across the whole part of the state, I haven’t seen conditions at this level,” the Tasmania Fire Service’s regional chief, Jeff Harper, said.
The conditions are set to peak from 5am on Friday, with hours of dry air, temperatures reaching into the high 30s, and 40km/h winds gusting up to 90km/h.
“The weather tomorrow may see that our aerial assets that have been so vital to us over the past week or so not able to fly,” Harper said. “The wind conditions are so turbulent that rotary-wing and fixed-wing aircraft, it’s not safe for them to fly under those conditions.”
Ground crews will be stepped up to try to cover the loss of aircraft, but Harper said human safety and property defence efforts would be prioritised.
Two fires have could threaten communities. One at central Great Pine Tier could bear down on the township of Shannon, and the other the Gell river fire southwest of Hobart which has been burning since December 28.
Residents are being told of the threat and efforts are being made to clear fuel from around the communities. In some cases there is 40 tonnes of fuel each hectare.
One house has been lost near central Miena, and residents remain on alert at Barren Tier, Tods Corner, Penstock Lagoon, Liawenee and Shannon.
A statewide fire ban is in place until Monday.
The government will close some of the state’s major national parks. The road to the pinnacle of Mount Wellington, overlooking Hobart, will be closed from Thursday night.
Other popular sites including Mount Field national park near Hobart, and Hastings Caves, south of the capital, will be closed.
“The government’s priority is community and visitor safety,” the premier, Will Hodgman, said.
They have closed the roof at the tennis. And for good reason. At Rod Laver arena, the on-court temperature is 39C. 
After winning through to the Australian Open final, Petra Kvitova said: “I was happier than the fans that the roof closed.” Understandable. 
So I made it to the Thebarton Ice Arena. pic.twitter.com/YNFIv3ZwVb
Marko Jovanovic-Jozic, 18, brought his cousin Mary to beat the heat.
“My cousin came from Germany for the warm weather,” Marko said. “She came from -38 degree weather and the experience here has gotten a bit much. I told her if you want to cool off, the best place is the ice arena.”
That may be true, but even the chillers at the Thebarton Ice Arena in Adelaide’s west have been struggling in the heat, and the industrial ice is wet. Still, more than 350 people have come through its doors.
Marko, 18, and his cousin Mary say they came to the Thebarton Ice Arena to beat the heat. Four days ago she flew out from Germany where it was -36, for the warm weather of Australia. Today, it got a bit much. #adelaide #heatwave pic.twitter.com/Q5cHlW3xcg
I don’t believe these temperatures have been confirmed by the Bureau of Meteorology but this gives you a sense of how it is in Australia right now.

As South Australia continues to swelter, let’s look ahead briefly to tomorrow when the heat is expected to sweep through to Victoria. 
On Thursday Melbourne eclipsed its forecast top by two degrees, reaching 38C. Earlier I spoke to Jonathan How, a forecaster at the Bureau of Meteorology, who set the scene:
“Victoria will be the hottest place in Australia tomorrow. Places like the Murray will be getting into 45-46C territory; places like Mildura, Swan Hill, Echuca are all going to be 46C. Some of those places will break January records.
“Melbourne is going for a top of 43C but it could get as hot as 44C in some of the suburbs.
“It all depends on the timing of the change coming through. If the change comes through a little bit later it might be higher than 43C. If it comes through earlier it might not get as hot.”
How also noted that Melbourne would drop only to a “humid” 29C overnight.

The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists announced that its symbolic “doomsday clock”, unveiled every year, was stuck at two minutes to midnight, the same as last January. The only other time the Bulletin has judged the world as being this close to catastrophe was 1953, in the early volatile stages of the cold war.
The reasons given by the Bulletin’s panel of experts included the collapse of arms control treaties, and the emphasis in Washington and Moscow on modernising nuclear arsenals rather than dismantling them, and the lack of political will to reverse climate change.
“We are like passengers on the Titanic, ignoring the iceberg ahead, enjoying the fine food and music,” said Jerry Brown, the former governor of California, said. Since leaving office this month, Brown has become the Bulletin’s executive chairman, citing the imminent threats to humanity. “It’s late and it’s getting later. We have to wake people up. And that’s what I intend to do!”
The former US defence secretary William Perry said that the summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore last June, succeeded in calming some of the “hysteria” in the standoff between the two countries, but had not led to any North Korean moves to dismantle its nuclear arsenals.
Perry pointed to Trump’s declared intention to suspend compliance with the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty on 2 February, and serve notice of US withdrawal, as a sign of the erosion of contacts between the world’s most heavily armed nuclear weapons powers.
“When you withdraw from treaties you are losing this important vehicle of dialogue,” Perry said. “We will have only one [arms control] treaty left, the New Start treaty, which could very well go away when it expires in another two years.”
“My own judgment is, relative to a year ago, we are slightly worse off,” Perry said.
Rachel Bronson, the Bulletin’s president, said there should be no comfort taken from the fact that the clock did not move forward over the past year.
“This new abnormal is a pernicious and dangerous departure from the time when the United States sought a leadership role in designing and supporting global agreements that advanced a safer and healthier planet,” Bronson said. “The new abnormal describes a moment in which fact is becoming indistinguishable from fiction, undermining our very abilities to develop and apply solutions to the big problems of our time.”
As governor of California, Brown introduced emissions controls and other regulations aimed in part at mitigating the impact of Trump’s decision to walk out of the Paris Climate accord, but he said that states and businesses could not combat climate change effectively without support from the White House.
“I find that the political response is alarming. It’s akin to sleepwalking,” Brown told reporters on Wednesday night. “We’re headed toward a very bad situation on the climate front and it will drive many more migrants to the border and create more political instability politically. So all the problems we have are going to be made worse and we may have passed a tipping point where we can’t make them better in any reasonable time and so that will undermine the entire basis of democratic governance.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/24/doomsday-clock-2019-two-minutes-midnight-nuclear-war-new-abnormal

The North Atlantic cod stock in the Barents Sea is likely to first rise and then crash, possibly to almost zero before the end of the century if climate change isn’t addressed, says the scientific paper, published by the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme.
The grim forecast is based on the most comprehensive study to date of the effects of climate change on cod, which – for the first time – takes into account ocean acidification as well as warming.
It found larvae mortality rates were 75% higher when exposed to the combined pressures of the two factors – both of which are caused by emissions – than to heating alone. As a result, fish numbers, catches and revenues will decline faster than previously estimated.
The Barents Sea, which is in the Arctic, is a major source of seafood nutrition for northern Europe. Along with Iceland, it is a key source of cod imports into the UK, which has over-fished its own waters. More Atlantic fish are migrating into this region as a result of global warming.
But this ocean has the highest level of acidification in the world because cold water absorbs more carbon dioxide, which changes its pH level. It is also the ocean that is experiencing the fastest rates of heating. While the global average is a rise of 1.1C since the start of the industrial revolution, the coastal breeding grounds of the cod in the Barents Sea have experienced a temperature increase of 3.5C.
Unless the warming trend is controlled, the stocks will see a boom and then a bust.
A temperature rise of up to 4.5C is beneficial to the cod. By this time, catches are projected to be worth 255 million Norwegian kroner per year (£23m). But after this point, the larvae rapidly start to die off. At 6C of warming (less than 3C for the rest of the world), they completely disappear.
Even if nations keep to their Paris commitments, which is currently not the case, global temperatures are on course to rise above 3C, which would mean well over 6C for the Barents Sea.
The numbers, which were released on the fringes of this week’s Arctic Frontiers conference in Tromsø this week, may yet prove an under-assessment of the risk because oxygen depletion – another side-effect of man-made climate change – is not accounted for.
“We are trying to show the magnitude of risk and it looks very significant,” said Martina Stiasny, one of the co-authors. “This is one of the most important fish stocks in the world. It will be a problem for food security.”
Responding to the findings, the Norwegian environment minister, Ola Elvestuen, said the study showed the need for urgent cuts in emissions. “The first task is to stop this happening. This is one more piece of news that shows the need for urgency. We must work to stay within 1.5C. We need to move forward really fast.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/25/cod-stocks-on-course-to-crash-if-ocean-warming-continues

More than 400 supporters wearing striking turquoise “Vote 1 Zali Steggall” T-shirts assembled under a Moreton Bay fig in a park in Balgowlah on Sunday morning as the athlete-turned-barrister launched her campaign as an independent.
“Zali, Zali,” they chanted as kids and dogs milled around the large media pack.
The former alpine skiing Olympian  is taking on one of Australia’s toughest politicians who has held the seat of Warringah for 25 years, something she acknowledged in her launch speech.
But Steggall is also Abbott’s worst fear: a photogenic woman with a strong public profile and deep roots in the electorate – she was born and grew up in Manly, went to school at Queenwood in Mosman (she now serves on its board) and lives in Balgowlah in the heart of the electorate.
As one attendee put it: “You needed to have been wheeled in a pram down the Corso to qualify as local – and she was.”
Steggall’s father was a solicitor in Manly for 30 years and a member of the Manly rugby club – a bastion of Liberal party support.
And as Steggall quipped: she drives the bridge (that’s the Spit bridge for non-locals) and knows the traffic problems facing her electorate.
With a high profile already established, Steggall’s task now is to define what she stands for and to differentiate herself from Abbott without breaking her own promise of a respectful campaign and new-style politics.
“I certainly never started a race at the Olympics thinking I had a sure thing won. [Abbott is] a wily and seasoned politician. He’s been there for many years,” she said.
Warringah has for too long had someone who is set in his ways, unwilling and unable to change
Is Abbott an embarrassment? “Ask the voters,” Steggall said, as the crowd erupted into shouts of “yes”.
Rather, Steggall pointed out that many constituents see Abbott as out of step with their concerns.
Climate change policy provides the starkest contrast, and is a potent issue with progressives in this northern beaches and harbourside electorate.
Steggall said it would be a focus of her campaign. She has enlisted well-known climate change campaigner Tim Flannery as a policy adviser, and he was by her side at Sunday morning’s launch.
“We do not want to be remembered as the generation who had all the facts but failed to act. Climate change is not a political football,” she said.
“Warringah has for too long had someone who is set in his ways, unwilling and unable to change. He does not represent who we are and what we stand for.”
Steggall also promised to tackle mental health issues, and expressed support for Kerryn Phelps’s campaign to bring children to Australia from Nauru and for the humane treatment of refugees.
Phelps is already acting as a sounding board, but the other worry for Abbott is the Manly end of his electorate, which has dallied with independents in the past by electing David Barr and Peter McDonald to state parliament.
There are still shoals to be negotiated. In this wealthy electorate, Steggall was quick to rule out supporting Labor’s changes to negative gearing or its plans to stop people being able to claim back franking credits in excess of the tax paid by companies.
Steggall said she would support stability in the superannuation system and would not back changes where people have put in place investment strategies.
But further announcements from Liberal and Labor during the election campaign, including possible tax cuts, will call into question where she stands on economic issues.
Steggall said she will support tax cuts for small and medium businesses, and appeared to rule out a carbon tax, saying the debate had “moved on” .
There will be constant attempts to either paint Steggall as a Labor plant or a tool of the Liberal moderate faction, which in New South Wales is locked in a vicious war for control of the heart and soul of the party.
Her campaign has signed on Anthony Reed, the former chief of staff to former NSW Labor politician Phil Costa, and she is already being asked about who is funding it.
The former Liberal moderate convener Michael Photios and other former Liberal party members were sighted at anti-Abbott and climate change events in the electorate almost a year ago. Alex Turnbull, the son of Abbott’s bitter rival, former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, has also offered support for the Vote Tony Out campaign.
Steggall said she hoped to attract the support of moderate Liberals – but it was clear she was talking voters, not apparatchiks.
“We have a website – zalisteggall.com.au; there is a donate button, please click on it,” she said.
 So far Steggall’s campaign has been powered by local groups with a uniting goal of just getting rid of Abbott. Now they have a candidate, the campaign could get more willing.
Abbott responded to the day’s events on Twitter, going hyper-local: “I’m going to keep pushing for the northern beaches tunnel to beat the traffic jams and for a safe and prosperous Australia as part of a good government,” he tweeted on Sunday.
The Australia Day weekend is not one for heavy politics but I’m going to keep pushing for the northern beaches tunnel to beat the traffic jams and for a safe and prosperous Australia as part of a good government.
Later in the day, asked about Steggall’s attack on his record on climate change, Abbott said he would “not get into tit-for-tat arguments with any particular candidate”, but argued Australia only contributed 1.3% of global greenhouse gas emissions.
“We could close our economy down tomorrow and it wouldn’t make a scrap of difference,” he said.

brace our legs against the swell, sweeping and mopping around the cabins. Countering the tilt we work quickly and silently, trying not to wake any crew who had been on watch the previous night. Not even celebrities and photographers are spared the daily 8am chores, the ship’s third mate, Amrit Bakshi, tells us later, laughing.
Clockwise from top: The Point Labatt conservation park lookout, mechanic Marc De Fourneaux fixes one of the ship’s small inflatable crafts, Laurence Nicoud from France, the only female cook for the Rainbow Warrior III, and volunteer deckhand Luca Lamont enters the bridge of the ship.
That was our first morning on board the Rainbow Warrior III, one of the world’s most recognisable sailing ships and a symbol of environmental activism. Visiting Australia for only the third time since it was custom-built for Greenpeace in 2011, the ship came to explore the wild and untouched waters of the Great Australian Bight, due south of the Nullarbor Plain.
Clockwise from top: Navigating waters around Greenly Island, Maria Martinez, the chief mate of the Rainbow Warrior III, first engineer Erik Mekenkamp enters the water nearby Massillon Island, and scientist Sam Owen completes his monitoring of marine species.
The bight is our wild, uncompromising underwater backyard. Kilometres of red earth and sand dunes drop off rugged cliffs into great expanses of deep, pristine ocean. A dive in these waters reveals another world. It’s a place where leafy sea dragons live and thousands of cuttlefish aggregate to breed. It’s home to the puppies of the sea – the endangered Australian sea lion – and a highway for the largest creatures in this world, also endangered, the southern right whale.
Clockwise from top: Erik Mekenkamp with an entourage of fish, a seastar nectria macrobrachia among a carpet of life under a ledge on the Great Southern Reef, and the cool waters of the bight which are home to bottom-dwelling plants, seaweeds, coral and sea sponges.
Environmental groups have been fighting to keep big oil companies from drilling in the bight.
To protect these creatures and the isolated fishing communities dotted along this coastline, environmental groups have been fighting to keep big oil companies from drilling in the bight since the Australian government granted BP four offshore exploration permits in 2011. BP has since pulled out, as did Chevron, however Norwegian company Equinor (formerly Statoil) plans to be drilling by October this year. Earlier this month, only days after the Rainbow Warrior left Australian waters, NOPSEMA (the regulatory agency for offshore oil drilling) approved an application for seismic surveys off the coast of Kangaroo Island and Eyre peninsula from 1 September for three months.
Sea Lions around Hopkins Island, South Australia. Sea lions use sound for communication, social interaction and navigation. Sound disturbances such as blasts from seismic testing can cause permanent hearing loss, which can have fatal consequences.
Lending its voice to the now-urgent movement to protect the bight, the Rainbow Warrior III came to showcase the unique marine life of this remote ocean pocket, where 85% of the species are not found anywhere else in the world. We joined the diverse crew of 30 as they sailed from Adelaide and Ceduna, exploring the remarkable but little-known Great Southern Reef.

A turbulent ocean greeted us as we neared Greenly Island. We were 30 kilometres west-south-west of Point Whidbey on Eyre peninsula, South Australia, and an eerie grey cloud clung to the island’s granite peak. As Michaela and the other three divers descended to depths of 30 metres, they found themselves between underwater mountains dressed in kelp that danced with the current. A curious sea lion came to investigate their strange-looking flippers. As they explored the ledges sheltered from the swell surge, an array of sea life was revealed – fish nurseries, rarely seen sponges, corals and an explosion of colour, shape and life.
Videographer Stefan Andrew rests after a dive in the waters around Massillon Island, part of the Nuyts archipelago off the coast near Ceduna, in the Great Australian Bight.
Over the course of a week, dive after dive revealed an abundance of life and plethora of species. Some difficult to identify as these areas have not been well-documented compared with other marine parks in Australia. When the divers surfaced, the questions began. How was the dive? What did you see? Any sharks?
Clockwise from top: Volunteer deckhand and environmental activist Luca Lamont learns the ropes from Manuel Marinelli, the view of the Great Australian Bight from inside the galley, and Lamont.
Similarly, when the underwater remote operated vehicle (ROV) trawled the ocean floor, a genuine interest in those seldom-explored deep underwater environments was palpable among those on board.
Appreciation for this valuable ecosystem permeated the floating micro-community and it was infectious. We found it impossible to remain indifferent after what we witnessed above and below the surface of the Great Australian Bight.

For photographers, unless you’re covering breaking news or sports, it’s rare to work alongside each other for extended periods of time. Looking back now, that first morning cleaning the floors and smelling of vinegar was the beginning of a unique shared experience in the untamed Australian marine environment, one we feel compelled to share.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/28/above-and-below-the-great-australian-bight-a-photo-essay

Yes I see that you are seeing the world through the eyes of an economist. I no doubt, in part, see the world through the eyes of a biologist. As living things we all need to consume. In that respect you are correct. However, it is rampant consumption that is going to damage our planet's environment and lead to the demise of other living species; ultimately including ourselves. Without a radical change in the collective thinking of humans we are on a path to self destruction. Sure we can all say that we need to consume the basics of life but if there are too many of us and we are all saying that that we are entitled war, famine and self destruction will be the outcome. I should also qualify my comment on growth. There is growth in ideas and culture. These are things that you can't physically touch. Ideas and culture do not necessarily stress our planet, yet the have value. The problem with growth comes with things that we can touch. These are things that we usually buy: a new car, washing machine etc. The concept that we can continue with growth as such is a game of intellectual charades. It is an impossibility and every economist should acknowledge this.Having said all this I believe humans can still live good rewarding lives. However, when we purchase something we should make it last. Moreover, anything manufactured should be made to last. How it is possible to get this message through to the major manufacturing corporations I'm not sure.

and since you ask, i'd like us to embrace this new-age of communications and technology and give everyone a bigger (and in some cases voluntary) say over more issues. 
the problem with this system is you vote for an individual, usually based on either fringe issues or overall, or somewhere in between. In some cases, just because you prefer their 'party' over another. 
by its very nature it signals to the recipient of the vote (individual or party) you support ALL of their views, which it simply doesn't.

However, that surface intellectual ""head"" meaning, generated from the forebrain, does not exclude his remark from carrying, at the same time, an emotional double entendre, springing forth from the hindbrain, or better, the brain stem.
That underlying message said, just as clearly, ""kill them"".
This is illicit manipulation: to say one thing overtly, but encourage something entirely different covertly.
I suggest that we are seeing here exactly that duplicitous messaging which saw Trump elected to the White House and Brexiteers win the UK referendum.
Mr Yates would not be the first from the supposedly progressive avant-garde to prove himself later to be a wolf in sheep’s clothing.
He sounds so good on the surface, but this is a very bad start. A small slip of the tongue, yes, but quite possibly indicative of something far more serious.
But more than exhibiting the sort of duplicitous dishonesty people are trying to combat in Morrison et al, there is a second potential betrayal in Mr Yates' bursting onto centre political stage in this way.
I do not discern any tribute paid to the brave women independents who have paved the way for this man.
Men who do not acknowledge those who have gone before are scabs indeed. Those men who do not acknowledge women are worse.
But those who not only fail to acknowledge their predecessors while simultaneously giving women colleagues the cold shoulder—all the while utilising the atavistic language of violence to achieve their ends—these men must be regarded as the pits.
There are lots of words to describe such sold-out caricatures of the true politician: cad, fraud, Machiavelli, etc. The label one prefers depends to some extent on one's age, gender, place of birth, and so on. But the underlying vile male syndrome is the same.
So, Mr Graham Easom, I can tell from the vibes of your comment that you're basically a nice guy, the sort I'd enjoy having a drink with, BUT—you and men like you do really need to wake up, and fast: these are the most serious times, and it no longer suffices for men to excuse, or smooth away, or minimise, the transgressions of their sex.
Mr Yates clearly has loads of ability, and potentially, could do great good in the world.
For myself, I believe any newbie should be given a fair go. Give him a chance!
BUT—I will be keeping a very beady eye on him, and will not hesitate to speak out should he put one tip of a toe out of line henceforth.
Would that not be the cruellest fate of all, if the efforts, the courage, integrity, perseverance and dedication of those independent women who represent true moderate centrism, were to be hijacked by yet another male who cannot keep his power-lusting cock in his pants?', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1548823566000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'16371135', u'in_reply_to': u'125263355', u'id': u'125265049', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'FelixKruell', u'text': u'500%?

The former Macquarie banker, and head of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, who will confirm his intention to run in Kooyong as an independent publicly on Wednesday, says the challenges of climate change are now so serious, so pressing, that citizens need to “take out” their environment ministers when they occupy the portfolio but fail to protect the environment and the climate.
“I want, globally, to hold accountable environment ministers who have disregarded their responsibility to the environment,” Yates tells Guardian Australia.
“I want this to be a worldwide campaign where citizens take out their environment ministers if they do not care for the environment, because clearly they are not doing it anywhere round the world, and citizens are not making any progress in this.
“We all tried as business people. We’ve been good, and managed our positions, but this is serious. It’s a really serious issue that needs to be addressed.”
The newly minted independent candidate dismisses a rationale that Frydenberg, while federal environment and energy minister, did attempt to land a policy that would have reduced emissions in the electricity sector before it was scuttled by the party conservatives who took out Malcolm Turnbull as Liberal leader.
Frydenberg, Yates contends, has policy views that are out of step with the majority of Kooyong electors, and “had plenty of opportunity to stand up in relation to the environment when he was minister, or even now, as a more influential person, but he’s failed to discharge his duty in relation to environmental responsibility”.
He says the only way the Liberal party will get the message is if sensible independents are prepared to enter the arena. “It’s an important aspect of our responsibilities as citizens to take this murky field up, and play the game, to try and deliver a better outcome for each other and the globe.”
As well as sending a signal that citizens have agency when parliaments fail to provide policy leadership, Yates has bigger ambitions. He thinks the time has come to rethink the mechanics of politics in Australia. He points to other parliaments around the world that are less dominated by a rigid two-party system.
He says if he were to win Kooyong at the coming federal election, he would, for example, be open to serving in a newly elected government, or providing policy advice relevant to his professional expertise in finance and climate change policy.
“I don’t think I would able to be bound by caucus or cabinet rules, so it would be quite difficult, however I would openly offer my services. I will do that in any way … that delivers the best outcome for the taxpayer.”
Yates believes people are sufficiently sick of the status quo to be open to new ways of political representation. “I don’t think we can say the way government has operated, or the way parliament has operated in the past, is the way it is going to be going forward. That’s an assumption.
“The hold of the [major] parties when the membership is less than that of the Hawthorn footy club, and the party members don’t get to determine policy, policy is dictated by a central executive of members of parliament – I don’t think the business model under which the Liberal party currently operates is sustainable.
“I don’t want to get ahead of myself, I have a big challenge in this seat, but I think it’s crazy to always think about the world as it has been and you can’t imagine something different.”
He says a collective failure of imagination and innovation is now deadweight on the Liberal party, and has led to “cultural failure”.
“Objecting to everything has left them in a very dark place, psychologically. They won’t look out and embrace change. They resist change. The Liberal party has become a party of resisting change and that’s terribly negative for society – to have a government resist change. Change is coming in every way, and change creates opportunity.”
If Labor wins the coming federal election, and Yates manages to secure a position on the crossbench, he says he’s open to a discussion about negative gearing concessions, but wary about changes to pensions or superannuation.
On negative gearing he says: “The question is: is it right for people to negative gear 100% of their income away and have seven houses? Shouldn’t people always be paying some level of tax as they are receiving some level of services.
“I think the government or the opposition has the right to suggest reforms, and as independents, we’ll be able to offer alternative views or comments or practical changes, which they may find acceptable.”
While the candidate has big ambitions, Yates faces an uphill battle to blast Frydenberg out of the blue ribbon seat he has held since 2010. The treasurer and deputy Liberal leader tends his local turf assiduously, and won the seat in 2016 with a primary vote of 58%, which was a positive swing of 2% on the previous federal contest.
It seems unthinkable that the government would lose Kooyong, long the jewel in the Liberal party crown, and held by three previous party leaders, but last year’s state election delivered a 9% negative swing in the state seat of Hawthorn, with the seat falling ultimately to Labor.
The state seat is within the boundaries of Kooyong. “We saw the turn in Hawthorn and they refuse to listen to that electoral defeat being driven by significant inaction on climate change.”
Yates says state Liberal John Pesutto, who lost Hawthorn last year, had described voters worried about the environment as tribal. “If he wants to describe people who want to protect the environment for the future as tribal then go ahead, because it is the tribe who will take you on.”
He says he will run an open ticket, but expects Labor and the Greens to direct preferences his way. “I’m expecting that sensibly the Greens and Labor would probably understand their probability of winning here is low, and if they’d like to achieve their stated objectives of environmental action then they’d be inclined to support my campaign.
“I would be hopeful I would receive their preferences. I understand it’s an uphill battle … but we need to force this government and future governments into taking climate change seriously because they are beholden to inaction.
“I would like to see Liberals challenged on a seat-by-seat basis until they get the message.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/30/its-time-to-take-out-environment-ministers-who-fail-on-climate-says-oliver-yates

Maybe this will be the road (pun intended) to a new society not bogged down with our barbaric and now defunct economic system (capitalism). An aside: although I must admit only 'the people' suffer this system, the elite operate under a socialist system whereby the government provide nearly unlimited funding as and when their corporations demand it. 
The concept of driverless vehicles interests me greatly because I can envisage a huge number of vehicles that you simply call for and they arrive at your door and take you wherever you wish to go and they simply sit idle until someone else wishes to use them or proceeds to the nearest re-charge or repair/service stations. Like a taxi/uber service without drivers or costs but available to everyone and provided by the govt. 
A lot, lot, lot cheaper than our current system of millions of cars for everyone that are used so little, sucking up our resources to make, run and re-fuel and destroying our environment in the process.
As to lost jobs.... this process has been happening since the industrial revolution.... this time it really could be for the betterment of the people and the planet. If there are no jobs for people then there are no longer any consumers and the elite have shot themselves in the foot.

There are some high tech skills that are paid for by Government even though there is little demand in the popular short term market place. That is because high tech knowledge workers are seen as valuable, otherwise there would be no cutting edge science research and a lot of high academia in the nation's universities would cease to exist. So would cultural activities like opera. Also little infrastructure would get built and cities would be an even greater balls up than they are now. Building the grid, sewers, water pipes and the transport network was done by Government. They did not occur as a result of short term market forces due to popular demand. They occurred as a result of long term planning based on Government priorities.
As for a highly skilled workforce. Perhaps you should look at Sweden. They build planes, trucks, cars, ships and a lot of other high tech gear. Much of that is a result of Government support. Funny Australia can't do any of that even though Sweden has half the population and far fewer resources. Perhaps it is just too easy to dig up rocks and flog them to places like China and India.

“[Electric vehicle] uptake in Australia lags behind that of other comparable countries due to a relative absence of overarching policy direction from Australian governments,” the report said.
The result is that there are only around 7,300 electric cars on Australian roads, with most people unable to afford current models.
This is negligible compared with countries like Norway and New Zealand, which have clear government policies to support the rollout of the new technology.
The committee warned that Australia will miss out on the environmental, health, social and economic benefits of the growing industry should governments fail to act.
“Australia is on the cusp of the most significant disruption and transformation of our transport system since the advent of the internal combustion engine,” the report said.
“Reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, cost savings for vehicle owner-operators, increased job opportunities and economic growth, improved health outcomes and increased fuel security are just some of the benefits that Australia can realise as EV use begins to climb.”
The committee made 17 recommendations including calling for a national plan to manage the rollout of electric cars.
Other recommendations include a dedicated taskforce to develop this plan, a national target to encourage the uptake of electric vehicles on Australian roads, more “coordination” with operators to expand the existing charging network and a national target for government fleets.
There are currently 12,691 vehicles in the commonwealth fleet, but only 12 are electric.
On costings obtained by independent senator Tim Storer, it would cost an extra $5m by 2022 to start converting half the government fleet to electric by 2025, or an extra $2.7m to do the same by 2030.
Behyad Jafari, head of the Electric Vehicle Council, welcomed the report’s findings as a step in the right direction.
“For our part it’s yet another endorsement, this time by the Australian Senate, that there’s a massive amount of evidence to support a mass switch to electric vehicles,” Jafari said.
“The report really emphasises the fact that something should be happening. We welcome the report, but also say the recommendations need to be acted on urgently.”
According to the Climate Council, transport is Australia’s second-largest contributor to greenhouse gas pollution after electricity, contributing 18% in 2018.
This makes electric and other clean-energy transport critical to addressing climate change – a fact not lost on the Australian public.
In polling released Wednesday, the Australia Institute surveyed 1,449 people across the country on specific policies to support the uptake of electric cars.
While most opposed more direct policies such as a ban on the sale of petrol cars after 2030, it found the overwhelming majority were supportive of encouraging their uptake.
Almost four in five people said they wanted the government to expand the network of charging stations and to ensure new cars sold in Australia were more fuel efficient – even if they cost more.
Roughly three in four said they wanted to see the government add more electric cars to its fleet and ensure new apartment blocks were required to install electric car-charging stations.
Richie Merzian, director of the Climate and Energy Program at the Australian Institute, said the results showed the public support was there and it was time Canberra stepped up.
“The appetite for Australians to pay more for their cars if they believe there are core benefits came through quite strongly,” Merzian said. “There’s some really strong support for low-hanging policies that the government could take up.
“All that’s missing now is federal government support.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/30/australias-paltry-electric-car-uptake-will-cost-health-jobs-and-environment-report

The average high temperature in January is -9C, or 15F. In a typical year, the city will experience 109 days of subzero weather.
But this week the nickname seems particularly appropriate.
At 8am on Wednesday, the temperature in International Falls, at the very northern tip of Minnesota, was -36.4F (-38C). The windchill was -58F (-50C).
The National Weather Service warned that it could get even colder here on Wednesday night – potentially down to -65C (-85F). But in this little city of 6,000 people, people were carrying on as usual, using a few tricks they’ve learned from a lifetime of frigid temperatures.
“You gotta have that International Falls shuffle going on,” said Stephanie Heinle, owner of the Coffee Landing Cafe downtown. Heinle demonstrated the manoeuvre by shuffling quickly across the wooden floor of the cafe. It’s a method of walking across ice that minimizes risk, she said.
“Because in this weather you can fall and break a hip and if someone doesn’t see you you freeze to death,” Heinle said.
Forecasters are describing the icy influx sweeping the American midwest as the coldest weather in a generation. On Wednesday, Chicago is predicted to see its lowest “high temperature” – the warmest point of a given day – since records began, and Minneapolis could also see historic lows.
The cold won’t stop there. It’s expected that 75% of the contiguous US will see sub-zero temperatures over the next week, a result of the polar vortex Arctic air pressure system bursting apart in early January. The wind system normally traps cold air at the North Pole, but its splintering has whipped frigid air far further south than normal.
Few have experienced the kind of cold currently occurring in International Falls. The temperature in a commercial freezer is -18C (-0.4F). In New York City the all-time coldest temperature was recorded as -26C (-15F), back in 1934. The record low in the United Kingdom is -27.2C (-17F), which has been reached on three occasions, each time in northern Scotland and most recently in the Highland village of Altnaharra, in 1995.
On Wednesday the thermometer here never made it past -30C (-22F).
Still, at midday Coffee Landing was a hive of activity. There was a birthday party going on in the back, with eight people wearing little strap-on hats, and people bundled in and out, barely mentioning the weather.
“I’m not worried at all,” Heinle said. “Because I know it’ll go away. I know it’ll warm up.”
When she’s walking around town or running errands, Heinle doesn’t even wear a hat and gloves.
“If you’re used to wearing them when it’s only this temperature,” she said – there was a windchill of -45F at this point – “Then when you go snowmobiling or something where you really have windchill, you’re going to be really cold. I know it sounds crazy.”
Heinle offered a personal tip on staying warm: “A little alcohol helps.”
It was a bit early to take Heinle’s advice, so I shuffled soberly out into International Falls’ main street.
International Falls is undeniably beautiful, divided from Canada by the picturesque Rainy river. The paper mill, a big local employer that looms over the city, pumps out steam as it turns wood into pulp, sending cascades of mist down the high street. It covers the trees in a crystalized frost, with the fog creating an other-wordly atmosphere.
But it is preposterously cold. Within seconds of stepping outside my nostril hairs had frozen. After two minutes my moustache was covered in ice.
I’d prepared well, I thought. I was wearing two pairs of long-johns, a pair of thick jeans, thick socks, insulated boots, two long-sleeved undershirts, a wool jumper, a fleece, a ski jacket, a balaclava, a “deep-winter” hat and two pairs of gloves, but still I was surprised to find my teeth literally chattering.
My phone quickly stopped working, as did my voice recorder, and my pen. My hat, purchased for cycling in New York winters, started letting in the cold after about two minutes. My ski-gloves, which my dad found in the back of a rental car in 2006, lasted about 30 seconds.
The winter has its upsides for the city. Tourists come to hunt and ice fish, and to drive the picturesque seven miles route around the frozen Rainy Lake.
Car companies, including Kia, Hyundai and Land Rover, come too, testing new vehicles in the frozen conditions, and on Monday more than a hundred endurance athletes traveled to the area for the Arrowhead 135, a 135-mile race across northern Minnesota on cross-country skis, fat-tyre bicycles or just on foot. The winner, Jordan Wakeley, managed to set a new record in the race, on a bike, although around half of the 146 entrants dropped out in the freezing cold.
It was a boon for the local taxi company, which worked through the night picking up frozen athletes along the trail.
But there is no escaping the fact that it is dangerously cold. In a weather warning issued on Tuesday, the National Weather Service said that the wind chill could cause frostbite on exposed skin in just five minutes.
“Hypothermia can set in quickly, which may lead to death,” the NWS added.
In this weather some households keep their water running nonstop, for months at a time, to prevent pipes from freezing and bursting. People leave their cars running while they eat inside bars and restaurants, to prevent doors from freezing shut and engines conking out. Extra time has to be allocated each morning to pull on layers of clothing, extra money spent on arctic-level jackets and boots.
It might raise the question as to why people choose to live here.
For International Falls’ mayor, Bob Anderson, the answer is easy.
“I love my city,” Anderson said.
“You can go ice-fishing, cross-country skiing. We have a beautiful lake that opens up every May through October, a beautiful river.
“I just really enjoy the birds, the animals. We have very distinctive seasons, we also enjoy that a great deal.”
Anderson, 76, was born and raised in International Falls, and has been mayor since 2012. He worked at the paper mill for 51 years before retiring in 2011, and remembers a nine-day stretch in the 1970s when the temperature never rose above -18C (-0.4F), and a record snowfall in 1996.
When the ice descends on the the city it doesn’t thaw for months. But it doesn’t bother Anderson.
“The cold is probably akin to the heat in the south. I would not want to be where it’s 110F in the summer time. I know I would melt,” he said.
“I enjoy the cold. I’m not bothered by it terribly. You take a few more precautions, do a bit more reading in the winter time, and life goes on.
“And for 120, 130, 140 years it’s always been a white Christmas.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/30/polar-vortex-what-is-it-like-cold-temperatures-midwest-life

The surprise haul of dead crustaceans and tardigrades, also known as “water bears” or “moss piglets”, was made by US researchers on a rare mission to drill into the Mercer subglacial lake which lies nearly 400 miles from the south pole.
David Harwood, a researcher at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and a member of the Salsa (Subglacial Antarctic Lakes Scientific Access) expedition, told the journal Nature that finding carcasses of the small animals – they range in size from 0.1mm to 1.5mm – was “fully unexpected”.
Scientists made the discovery when they inspected mud scraped off an instrument they had lowered into the lake’s icy waters. As expected, the mud contained remnants of photosynthetic algae that lived and died in the area millions of years ago when Antarctica was much warmer.
But the mud also contained the bodies of other, more recent creatures. Researchers found eight-legged tardigrades, the speckled shell of a shrimp-like crustacean with legs dangling from it, and a second shell still bristling with delicate hairs. What at first looked like worms in the mud turned out to be the tendrils of a plant or fungus.
Aware that the creatures might have contaminated other equipment, the scientists cleaned their kit and lowered it into the lake once more. When they hoisted it up and analysed the mud a second time, they found more of the same remains.
It is not clear how the organisms came to be in the ice-covered lake, but scientists believe that they may have lived in nearby ponds and streams during warm periods when the glaciers retreated either 10,000 or 120,000 years ago.
One possibility is that the creatures washed into the lake through rivers under the ice. Alternatively, they may have been carried in after becoming stuck to the underside of an encroaching glacier.
Martin Siegert, co-director of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial College and head of the Lake Ellsworth Consortium, a UK project that aims to explore a subglacial lake under the ice of west Antarctica, said it was “a lovely finding”.
He said: “It hints that life may exist in more complex forms than thought previously underneath the massive ice sheet in Antarctica.”
Siegert said more work was needed to establish whether the organisms had been flushed into the lake from upstream – suggesting there was life under the middle of the Antarctic ice sheet – or from the sea, or by some other route. “Each of these would be intriguing,” he said.
Sandra McInnes, an expert in tardigrades at the British Antarctic Survey, said: “If they can get DNA out of these remains, that would be fantastic.”
If the tardigrade DNA perfectly matches that of species alive today, then scientists will suspect the animal was carried into the lake on contaminated drill equipment.
But the DNA may be far older and indicate an ancient relative of a modern species. Genetic analysis might also confirm whether it was a marine or terrestrial creature, McInnes said.
So far, nothing has been pulled alive from the Mercer subglacial lake. With so much ice overhead, too little light may reach the water to sustain organisms such as photosynthetic algae.
But Byron Adams, a researcher at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, told Nature that he still hoped to find something that had set up home in the lake. “It’s possible that you could still find things that are alive,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jan/18/antarctica-tardigrades-crustaceans-mercer-subglacial-lake

I foresee the pressure on our own western civilisation reaching breaking point, as entire nations land up on our shores, driven here by the advance of desert and drought in their lands.

From cutting back on red meat to taking fewer flights, the Norwich South MP said the public must face up to “real, stark choices” in the years ahead.
“If you want your children and grandchildren to avoid food shortages, to avoid power shortages, to avoid biological degradation, biodiversity loss – if you actually want a planet that’s inhabitable – then we need to make some choices together, now, and some of them are about quite dramatic changes to how we live,” Lewis said in an interview with the Guardian.
Having returned to Labour’s frontbench a year ago, after resigning in protest when Jeremy Corbyn whipped MPs to support the triggering of article 50, Lewis was given the job of examining how a Labour government could champion sustainable economics. He has repeatedly made it clear he regards the issue as a test of political leadership.
“I think there’s a crunch point now coming for politics. You often hear there’s no leadership in politics – and this isn’t a leadership pitch, I promise you – but when you talk about leadership, there’s leadership in different forms,” he said.
On red meat, for example, Lewis said: “I’m not going to sit here and say, yeah, let’s ban red meat … but you can show leadership by asking, well actually, is it right that we publicly subsidise an industry that is contributing so much to greenhouse gas emissions, and often is a very unsustainable practice?”
He said the government’s role should be to “encourage people and show leadership as to how we’re going to shift people’s eating habits on to a more sustainable footing”.
On air travel, he said Labour was starting to come up with options, including a tax “escalator”, which would have the biggest impact on frequent fliers, who tend to be the wealthiest.
In a wide-ranging interview, Lewis also mused about everything from the four-day week to universal basic income, and how to ensure the rapid technological innovation of the “fourth industrial revolution” benefits the wider public.
While many such policies are at an early stage of development, Lewis said the next Labour manifesto should be significantly different to the previous one.
“The 2017 manifesto gave a lot of people a kind of warm, cuddly glow, and it was a great reset of our values and where we are, but it was a base on which to build,” he said. “The next manifesto needs to be a radical manifesto, which builds on the reset, and is 21st-century socialism in action. There’s a hunger for that.”
McDonnell has asked the former head of the civil service Bob Kerslake to examine how to rework the Treasury green book – the manual for government spending decisions.
Lewis said he hoped environmental sustainability could be incorporated into Whitehall thinking as part of that review.
“The Treasury has been the instigator of selling off the green investment bank, of scuppering [the] Swansea tidal [lagoon power plant], of undermining the plastic tax and electric vehicles – because it simply sees things in a very short-term, revenue-generating manner,” he said.
“What we want to do is open out how the Treasury looks at spending and revenue, and looks in a longer term, more holistic and sustainable way – and that is radical.”
Lewis recently secured £17,500 from individual donors to fund his work on sustainable economics, giving him a measure of independence from the party machine.
He argued that developing a more sustainable economic model could allow Britain to take a leadership role in the world after Brexit.
“Leadership and punching above your weight doesn’t necessarily always have to mean gunboat diplomacy and bombing other countries into the stone age. It can actually mean leading by example, and helping other countries,” he said.
Lewis was widely considered a rising star on the left of the party when he arrived in parliament in 2015, and was catapulted on to the frontbench by Corbyn, as many more experienced MPs refused to serve or were sent packing.
But the former army reservist and TV reporter does not fit the mould of a career politician and has repeatedly charged headlong into controversy. In 2016, as shadow defence secretary, he clashed with Corbyn’s close aide Seumas Milne over last-minute changes to a party conference speech.
In late 2017, he apologised after video footage emerged of him using the phrase “get on your knees, bitch” at a party conference fringe event, and was then suspended – and cleared – over accusations that he groped a party member.
Most recently, Lewis was criticised after miming putting a gun in his mouth during a debate in the House of Commons as a Conservative MP interrupted his frontbench colleague Anneliese Dodds.
Lewis, who postponed his wedding to defend a wafer-thin majority in the 2017 general election, and recently became a father for the first time, said he found the BBC documentary Blue Planet too unsettling to watch.
“I couldn’t watch BP for a long time, until I started doing this job, because I knew in my heart that Blue Planet, as beautiful as it was, at the end they would always have the human impact, and I struggled to watch it because I felt so powerless,” he said.
He said he believed countering the human threats to the environment would have to mean junking “the obsession with flat-screen TVs and consumption”.
“On their deathbed, do people think: ‘I wish I’d spent more time with my Ferrari’? Or do they say: ‘I wish I’d spent more time watching my kids grow up, I wish I’d spent more time country walking’?
“It’s about the things that matter in life, and how we have an economy that better reflects that,” he said.
On Brexit, meanwhile, Lewis stuck rigidly to the party line, dismissing questions about what Labour would put in its manifesto if there were to be a snap general election as “hypothetical”.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/01/time-for-politicians-to-make-stark-choices-over-climate-change

With dire predictions that if nothing is done there will be more plastic in the seas by weight than fish by 2050, it has become evident that we cannot recycle our way out of the plastic problem.
More than 8m tonnes of plastic end up in our oceans each year. Meanwhile virgin plastic production continues apace and is set to to leap by 40% over the next 10 years as more products are made from virgin plastic than from recycled.
But consumer pressure can force change. The Guardian revealed this year that  supermarkets alone put 1m tonnes of plastic packaging on to the market.
But they are increasingly aware that if their customers lose faith they will lose money. Almost a quarter of consumers surveyed earlier this year said they were extremely concerned about plastic packaging. More than half said they were doing what they could to reduce their use of plastic.
In Australia, public pressure led many supermarkets this year to announce they were phasing out single-use plastic bags. These include Coles, Woolies and Harris Farm.Just producing plastic uses huge resources – it takes around 12m barrels of oil to make the 100bn plastic bags used annually in the United States alone.
This year Britain’s Iceland supermarket has led the way – and others are beginning to follow suit. Iceland has pledged to eliminate plastic packaging on its own goods in five years.
So what can you do to reduce your own plastic footprint and put pressure on supermarkets and manufacturers to move towards reuseable plastic items and hugely increase the amount of recycled plastic in their products? Here are 10 top tips:
1. Start at home. Do a plastic audit of your household. Shower bottles, deodorants, washing up liquids, shampoo bottles. Aim to make reductions here by ditching shower gel for soap and the plastic cotton buds for biodegradable ones; buy liquid detergent in recycled plastic bottles and find a refill station to fill them up. Shampoo bars and toilet paper in recycled packaging are also available.
2. In the US, 1bn plastic toothbrushes are thrown out each year, creating some 50m pounds of waste. Try using bamboo toothbrushes instead which only take about six months to biodegrade back into the soil when you have to replace your brush.
3. Carry reuseable fabric shopping bags.
4. Try buying wholesale and putting dried products such as rice, pasta andlentils into glass jars to avoid buying products wrapped in plastic.
5. Recycle old plastic children’s toys. Search for a toy library in yourarea to borrow from or donate to. And consider charity shops when looking for gifts.
6. Carry a reuseable coffee cup or flask; 7m plastic-lined coffee cups are thrown away in the UK every day.
7. Say no to plastic cutlery. Carry a fork with you or use a compostable alternative.
8. Ditch cling film wrap for your food. It cannot be recycled in most UK collections. Foil is recyclable, so use foil instead or reuseable plastic boxes.
9. Use an electric razor instead of plastic disposable one.
10. Write to companies whose packaging is non-recyclable, asking them to consider using less destructive materials. Maybe even think about starting a social media campaign to raise awareness. Strength in numbers!
• This article was amended on 3, 4 and 18 January 2019. An earlier version suggested that 12m oil barrels produced 100m plastic bags. That figure is more like 100bn bags. In addition, the estimate of 1bn plastic toothbrushes being thrown out each year relates just to the US, not globally. This has been corrected. It was further amended to remove a reference to a branded product, and to refer to biodegradable cotton buds rather than recyclable ones.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/03/plastics-consumption-reduce-2019-10-easy-ways

Yes. It was tragic. But don’t leverage a tragedy to make a false point. It’s offensive. And it’s the oldest trick in the climate handbook by both sides. Look at one or two years worth of events in their personal experience and say “see, I told you!” This is the same silly argument as Inhofe’s snowball when he claimed climate change is a hoax. 
Attributing fires is an unsettled topic. Yes of course, climate change is a variable. But likely a much more relevant variable is suppression over the last 90 years or so allowing underbrush to overgrow and become explosively ready for any lightning strike or power line failure. 
The worst fires happen when the same acreage hasn’t burned for decades. Case in point the “great fire” of 1910 that spanned eastern WA, northern ID and MT. More than 2 million acres burned in 2 days. 
Or the chinchaga fire in BC/Alberta in 1950. 3 million acres burned. I remember the big fire (Fort Mcmurray fire) in Alberta a few years ago was considered by alarmists in the media as unprecedented because of its latitude illustrating the impacts of climate change.

This summer, just a 2 hour drive from me, the town of Paradise CA was incinerated by the Camp Fire.
It was very smoky here in Sonora CA much of this past summer due to the Ferguson Fire which closed much of Yosemite and other nearby fires.
Fire behavior has been getting more extreme here in California, and around the world as we saw a year or two in Greece. CalFire officials have recently described fire behavior here in California as ""historic and unprecedented.”
The Rocky Fire in 2015 burnt 20,000 acres in one 5-hour period with little wind. That’s a speed normally associated with fires driven by the powerful Santa Ana winds. Fires now expand explosively at night and move downhill fast.
Last summer satellites spotted unusually large fires on Greenland just 40 miles from the ice sheet, dumping black carbon on 7.3 meters of sea level rise equivalent of ice, increasing heat retention and melt rate.
At a rise in temperature of 3 degrees C, a temperature we are quickly losing the ability to avoid, the Amazon Rainforest may burn releasing enough CO2 to push us well into a 4 degree world.
And still in the US we produce 16 tons of CO2 per person per year. You can’t see it, but it’s created an energy imbalance equivalent to exploding 400,000 Hiroshima bombs per day, 365 days per year.

And the chef said ""hold on"", and he entered a bar, asked for the coffee grounds, and said ""with this we have American coffee"" :)', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1546957368000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'12097288', u'in_reply_to': u'124375929', u'id': u'124394026', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Gregory Shearman', u'text': u'Nope.. it means that the Australian coffee I drink is the best I've ever tasted.

Climate change affects disproportionately food-insecure regions, jeopardizing crop and livestock production, fish stocks and fisheries.Satisfying increased demands on agriculture with existing farming practices is likely to lead to more intense competition for natural resources, increased greenhouse gas emissions, and further deforestation and land degradation.

Greg Meenahan, the partnership director at the non-profit institute World Coffee Research, puts it this way: “Demand for coffee is expected to double by the year 2050 and, if nothing is done, more than half of the world’s suitable coffee land will be pushed into unsuitability due to climate change. Without research and development, the coffee sector will need up to 180m more bags of coffee in 2050 than we are likely to have.”
To address this, the organisation is undertaking the international multi-location variety trial, testing 35 coffee types across 23 countries to measure performance in different climates – including in regions not typically associated with coffee production, such as Australia.
In what could be Australia’s most significant contribution to coffee since the flat white, scientists at Southern Cross University will be testing 20 “climate-resistant” varieties.
Prof Graham King, a leading plant science researcher at SCU, says that in January up to 900 plants will be planted at the tropical fruit research station in Alstonville, northern New South Wales. According to King, climate change is expected to devastate the world’s major coffee-growing regions through extreme weather and by increasing attacks by crop pests and diseases.
“Many current mountainous tropical production areas of the world are likely to become untenable for coffee as climate change progresses,” he says. “Within Australia we currently have the benefit of no coffee rust or cherry borer, or other major pests and disease. This is quite unique compared with most production areas of the world.”
The impact is already being felt. As detailed in a 2016 report by Fairtrade Australia, in 2012 Central America was hit by a wave of coffee leaf rust (Hemileia vastatrix) after unusually high temperatures and high-altitude rains, causing US$500m in crop damages and putting nearly 350,000 labourers out of work.
Droughts and frequent storms have led to Costa Rican farmers giving up coffee for orange plantations. Outside Latin America, the coffee berry borer (Hypothenemus hampei) – which used to only appear at a maximum altitude of 1,500 metres above sea level – is being found above this limit, thanks to unseasonably hot conditions and higher rainfall on plantations from Tanzania to Indonesia. On Mount Kilimanjaro plantations, the beetle is now found 300 metres higher than last century.
The future of coffee … and the livelihood and wellbeing of coffee farmers, workers and their families is at stake
Not only is Australia free of these blights, says King, but climate change could open up more Australian regions for growing coffee cherries owing to reduced frost damage in winter.
King warns that the trial will need at least five years to reap results, but funding from the federal government-funded AgriFutures Australia runs out in May. He says it has offered “pretty poor engagement” on the issue.
AgriFutures’ business development manager, Duncan Farquhar, says the coffee sector has been provided with funding for developing new varieties since 2014. “Emerging industries, including the coffee industry” have been invited to compete for a new round of funding, he says.
The organisation’s figures indicate that local coffee production has a long way to go to meet domestic demand. In 2011–12, just under 50 Australian growers produced about 1,000 tonnes of dry green beans, while about 67,000 tonnes were imported. Its experts say Australian coffee is 10% to 15% lower in caffeine than much overseas coffee because it is grown in a low-stress environment. Caffeine is produced by coffee plants as a defence mechanism against threats from pests and diseases.
An agronomist and coffee industry adviser, David Peasley, says rising temperatures could hurt coffee growing in north Queensland but agrees that in subtropical coffee growing regions they could help. He cautions that climate change could leave Australian plantations more vulnerable to pests and diseases and that extreme weather events will present a challenge.
Indeed, without hardier varieties, Australian growers may find climate change brings more challenges than benefits. A grower, Zeta Grealy, says conditions have become increasingly difficult since she created her Zeta’s Coffee plantation on the border of NSW and Queensland in 1994.
“In the past we had fabulous conditions, a lovely microclimate for coffee,” she says. “It used to look rainforest-y around here, now it’s very sparse. It has been a gradual change – where once we’d be getting two metres of rainfall, [across 2018] we had less than one.
“Our crop actually didn’t happen this time, we had overripe cherries and completely green cherries, flowers on the tree – not what we want. So we decided to strip the trees and get them ready for next year.”
The crop was down to 19kg from a typical year of about a tonne. Grealy is hopeful that the trials lead to access to varieties that can cope with lower rainfall.
World Coffee Research is encouraging the industry to do its bit to safeguard the crop’s global future by contributing to its Checkoff program, in which roasters can donate up to 0.20 cents a kilogram of green coffee from participating suppliers to help fund initiatives such as the global trial.
Supporters include Single O’s director of coffee, Wendy De Jong, whose company will be the first roaster to import a full container of “future-friendly” coffees to Australia.
“[We] are calling on Australian roasters and importers to do their part to fund the critical research and development needed for coffee and farmers alike by signing up to the WCR Checkoff program,” she says.
Fairtrade Australia’s chief executive, Molly Harriss Olson, welcomes research into hardier varieties, noting that by 2080 wild coffee – a vital bedrock of genetic diversity for developing new varieties – could become extinct. She notes that expanding Australian plantations won’t prevent climate change’s impact on coffee growers in other countries.
“More frequent and severe drought is associated with a deep and disturbing sense of failure, loss, powerlessness, heightened anxiety, stress, depression and an increased suicide rate among farmers,” she says.
Harriss Olson urged coffee consumers to educate themselves about the challenges facing growers, seek out brands that are both carbon-neutral and help producers to adapt to a changing climate, and urge businesses and governments to pursue a carbon-neutral economy.
“It’s crucial that we all take action now,” she says. “Because the future of coffee, one of the world’s favourite commodities, and the livelihood and wellbeing of millions of coffee farmers, workers and their families is at stake.”

We’ve been seeing numerous impacts catching many scientists by surprise with how soon they are occurring. In 2014 two independent teams of scientists reported that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is likely irreversibly retreating. 3.3 meters of sea level rise equivalent of ice there is being destabilized by a warming ocean and energy is going into the net melting of ice all over the planet. 
The paleoclimate record indicates that increasing global temperature by just 1.5-2°C above preindustrial temperature commits the system to an eventual 6-9m of sea level rise, a large fraction of which could arrive within the next 100 years.
Corals may not survive this century of warming and acidifying oceans, and droughts and floods linked to global warming—and conflict linked to those droughts—have already caused four countries to face famine.
Because of the decades to millennial long lag between a climate forcing and our feeling the full effect, due to the thermal inertia of the ocean and response time of the ice sheets, the effects we are feeling now are largely just the beginning of the result of emissions from the 20th century. And emissions have been increasing steadily for decades.
We are also seeing numerous amplifying feedbacks: loss of albedo (heat reflectivity) from ice melt, permafrost melt, methane release and massive wildfires; the Earth is starting to wrest any possible further human control of the climate away.

If, as Credlin says, “climate change remains Malcolm Turnbull’s kryptonite”, then her preselection could just be the Liberal party’s dynamite. The split already exists, but for now, it’s being held together with sticky tape and string. And Credlin’s preselection could well be the spark that lights the fuse, and blows the whole thing up.
The Liberal party is suffering an existential crisis. And no other issue defines this crisis like the looming threat to our safety and security caused by inaction on climate change. Credlin understands this and has used her position as a climate change-denying, hard-right mouthpiece of the Murdoch empire to advance her own political interests, and the interests of the coal industry.

She’s consistently claimed climate change is a political hoax, and used her position in the media to undermine a sitting prime minister and any energy policy supported by the Coalition party room that does not involve more coal and the end of renewables.
She doesn’t represent real liberal views, and if she appeals to what’s left of the “base”, then many people who used to vote Liberal will keep moving for the exits.
Inspired by Donald Trump, Credlin has argued Australia should tear up the Paris agreement, tear up any sensible national energy guarantee. Credlin has demanded taxpayers’ money go to the Adani coalmine and be used to build new coal-fired power stations. It’s madness.
Australians don’t want this. We would prefer a Great Barrier Reef, renewable energy and a future we can survive and thrive in.
These views are so ignorant – their political manifestation through Tony Abbott, Craig Kelly and their ilk – that it presents a grave economic and security threat to Australia’s future. And it could be the final death knell to the Liberal party.
Credlin’s demonstrated lack of understanding of the serious climate emergency we face, or even the basic economics of power production costs are breathtaking. She promotes the view that climate change is some leftwing conspiracy and that the science is rubbish.
These views need to be called for what they are: dangerous.
In her media roles, Credlin has even attacked the scientific foundation for energy and climate policy. From the desk at Sky, she announced her displeasure that former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull asked chief scientist Alan Finkel for real consideration of the climate change transition and energy policy. Instead she demanded a manufactured report devoid of reality.
It is essential now that real liberals stand against this reckless game of Russian roulette
“What started out as a report designed to expose the South Australian Labor government’s catastrophic handling of energy policy leading up to last year’s blackouts” – promoting the lie that the blackouts were caused by renewables – “is now a report that threatens the tense equilibrium of the Coalition party room”, warned Credlin.
Heaven help us if facts were allowed to get in the way of the stability of the party room or facts should reach the people!
We should be deeply concerned that the Liberal party is once again seeking to preselect people who are prepared to sprout deranged conspiracy theories.
“Green ideology has trumped sensible economics. Affordable power, from abundant coal and gas, is Australia’s principal competitive advantage and in recent years, we’ve given it away in the name of saving the planet.”
Good luck finding a bank, or anyone under 35, to agree with you.
The job of any politician should be to put the long-term wellbeing of the public before cheap and dangerous political point-scoring. People are sick to death of it. This kind of pandering to the hard-right’s views did not serve Matthew Guy well in Victoria, and it will not serve the Liberals well at national level either.
Australians know it’s getting hotter every summer and see the increases in extreme weather. Report after report, overflowing with scientific evidence, traditionally a solid foundation for investment and public policy making, has been abandoned by the federal Liberal party. We understand how this will threaten our families, economy and security, and we must act to provide people with a real liberal alternative.
Credlin, Abbott and the rest of the hard-right’s “commitment to coal” is entirely political. The calculation they’ve made is that their short-term political interests, and the interests of the coal industry, are more important than the future of our country, our people and holistically the environment we all share.
It is essential now that real liberals stand against this reckless game of Russian roulette the hard right are playing with our future. If not, they too will adorn the walls as climate change deniers, who, despite all the evidence, refused to act.

Jair Messias Bolsonaro’s Brazil is not just another country that elected a far-right president at a time when the world’s most powerful nation is led by Donald Trump. It’s not just South America’s version of the current trend of countries sliding into authoritarianism, like we’ve seen in Hungary, Poland, Turkey and the Philippines. It’s not simply a peripheral nation with a pathetic leader. Brazil has become the apocalyptic vanguard that signals how radical this moment is – one with the power to worsen the climate crisis at top speed and blight the entire planet.
Bolsonaro was elected in October, on his pledge to go back ‘50 years'. Brazil lived under a military dictatorship then
The election of Bolsonaro is a response to what we might call civilisation’s new discontent. Maybe people can’t identify the source of their anxiety, which has driven up the consumption of tranquillisers and sedatives. The average citizen might apply more familiar labels to the corrosion of their quality of life, air, and water; to a relentless fear of the “other”; to the feeling they’re walking in quicksand. But what’s underpinning this new discontent pervading all areas of human experience is our climate crisis.
Bolsonaro was elected in October, on his pledge to go back “50 years”. Fifty years ago, Brazil lived under a military dictatorship. For Bolsonaro and his followers, who are outright defenders of torture and the elimination of adversaries, it was a glorious era. Despite the terrifying menace of nuclear war, the world was still a place where science promised nothing but progress and solutions – it delivered no bad news, like global warming, that led to limitations on an individual’s daily life or on government actions. It was a time when white, heterosexual men held power and knew precisely who they were. They may have faced some resistance from minorities, but they still enjoyed absolute hegemony.
We cannot comprehend what is now happening in Brazil – and around the world – unless we understand that our culture wars are tightly bound up with humanity’s need to say goodbye to 20th-century illusions of power and face a planet made more hostile by human hand. Things will soon reach catastrophic levels if nations and their residents do not unite in a global effort to do something extremely hard and unpopular: impose limits on ourselves to counteract global warming.
The election of Bolsonaro ties all this together like no other event. The Bolsonaro administration promises a “new era” – a return to a time free of doubts and insecurity, with certainty about what a man is and what a woman is and a clear sense who’s in charge of the public sphere and the family. Their ultra-conservatism is at times corny, at times biblical – but never innocent.
Soon after Bolsonaro’s inauguration last week, the minister of women, family, and human rights, Damares Alves – an evangelical pastor – stated in a video that now “girls wear pink and boys, blue”. Beside her, a supporter held an Israeli flag. Some neo-Pentecostals likewise waved Israeli flags at the inauguration. These religious groups, who are growing numerically and wielding greater power in Brazil, voted overwhelmingly for Bolsonaro.
A significant portion of them believe Jews will play a role in fulfilling scriptural prophesies about the return of the Messiah. It must be remembered that Bolsonaro was baptised in the River Jordan, in Israel, a couple of years before the presidential campaign. Now in power, he has announced that Brazil will move its embassy to Jerusalem, which, say these evangelicals, will be the “stage for Armageddon”. In a recent visit to Brazil, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, declared: “We have no better friends in the world than the evangelical community.”
Ernesto Araújo, the dogmatic foreign minister, said Bolsonaro’s rise will be marked by “God through the nation”. He has also written that climate change is an “ideology” dreamed up so imperialist nations could determine Brazil’s future. “The people who say there are no men and women are the same ones who preach that countries don’t have the right to protect their borders,” Araújo stated in his inaugural speech.
This Brazil, stitched from a patchwork of dogmas, might be a fascinating topic of study if it didn’t put the whole planet at risk. Ideological discourse serves to instil the notion of destiny and to ensure cohesion within a population frightened about everything it might lose, from salaries and jobs to symbolic positions in the realms of race, gender, and sexual orientation. When Bolsonaro says he’s going to “free Brazil from political correctness”, he’s pledging to break both the “chains” that force people to respect minorities and those that curtail devastation of the Amazon forest.
In his first days in power, the president shifted responsibility for demarcation of indigenous and quilombola territory – which makes up a large part of the protected Amazon – to the agriculture ministry. This government sector is controlled by agribusiness, responsible for much of deforestation and eager to get their hands on the remaining forest. Bolsonaro promised to turn the public land occupied by indigenous peoples into private land where mining and agribusiness concerns can reap profits. The goal is to make more forest land available for capitalist speculation: cattle, soybeans, mining, and major construction projects.
This is why government ideologues fabricated the idea that “communism” – a system never implemented in Brazil and now largely irrelevant worldwide – is a looming threat to Brazilians. The supposed “international Marxist plot” serves to justify turning the forest into a commodity. In this fantasy, indigenous peoples, who are the chief barrier to destruction of the Amazon, are portrayed as a “threat to national sovereignty”.
The deforestation rate for 2018 was the highest in a decade. The mere possibility that Bolsonaro might win had a liberating effect on deforesters and further inflamed conflicts in a country where more environmental defenders are killed than in any other.
Without the world’s biggest tropical forest, there is no way to control global warming. If Bolsonaro’s messianic capitalism is not stopped, life on this planet will be much worse for everyone. For a contingent of neo-Pentecostal evangelicals, this may be welcomed as an apocalypse preceding the final salvation of “true believers”. For most of humanity, it will bring nothing but horror and suffering – perpetuated by the stupidity of a species with delusions of grandeur.

Although there won't be a ""new normal"" for millennia at the earliest, chaotic is a good term for a climate which is no longer relatively stable, like the last 10-12,000 years which roughly coincided with the development of agriculture, cities and civilization.
For a very long time now we've dialed in a lot of change. The paper below, published recently, raises an interesting question regarding adaptation to long-term climate change.
From the abstract:
BQSTART
Adaptation is the process of adjusting to climate change in order to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities associated with it. Most adaptation strategies are designed to adjust to a new climate state. However, despite our best efforts to curtail greenhouse gas emissions, climate is likely to continue changing far into the future.
BQEND
The paper uses the example of sea level rise, currently around 4.4mm per year, to show one example of long-term, continuous change in climate.
BQSTART
Over the next 1000 years, sea-level is projected to rise at an average rate of 3.44 cm yr−1, if all available fossil fuel resources are combusted and the CO2 released to the atmosphere.
BQEND
Where would we rebuild our coastal cities, naval facilities and sea ports? There’d be no stable shoreline in any time scale of interest to humans.

Absolutely - the developing countries should be able to make use of renewables and avoid the mistakes the developed countries have made.
The deniers like to play a tinny piano and squeaky violin and tone troll claiming environmentalists are trying to stop development of the developing countries but it simply doesn't wash.

And now the climate changed and they need to get a thousand miles somewhere else and how do they get there? And so probably the initial real issues are how it combines with the other things that we're doing.

I didn’t really take anything from the soil for over a decade, I grew in raised beds/pots using bought in soil (which I needed to replace the contaminated soil bulk anyway) and really the small garden was used to keep my rabbits and chickens happy in the main. I also have a clay soil, grey leading to red. I live on what was a floodplain, the land was recovered over the last 200 years. Worms do the main work in ‘no dig’ and I saw a massive increase in worms.
Rather than grass lawn I went with herbs and I was happy to put up with a work in progress for a decade. I have a small garden, maybe 5M square which made the work manageable.
The worms have mixed the clay in with the improved soil and general composting keeps on top of things by adding soil volume each year.
One benefit has been our council has adopted strict recycling targets which means you HAVE to compost because the bins are just far too small to just recycle. A rabbit turns a large amount of green waste into ready to use compost and he takes up much less space than a recycling/compost bin and that is important in my small garden and it cuts down on flies and associated problems with composting which are also problematic in smaller gardens.
My rabbit (and chickens when I kept them) are free range, raised beds protect the crops I really care about. Chickens destroy everything but I’ve found rabbits tend to calm down over time and don’t destroy everything- I grow kale just for the rabbit, the rabbit loves dandelions so they are absent from the garden, and we agree to share things like sorrel and similar salad crops.
And of course a rabbit is a cheap pet. He also hates cats so keeps our garden free from cats which encourages the birds. It is funny to watch the birds group around the rabbit in the garden for protection while they fill up on insects.

Marie and Tony Newton’s back garden is filled with summery colour: miniature mauve cyclamens, frilly red camellias, graceful hellebores, seasonal snowdrops and the bright green sheaths of bulbs promising more flowers to come. A few winters back, their first daffodil bloomed on Boxing Day.
“It’s basically chaotic,” says Tony of the new climatic normal. “It’s non-stop flowers from now on. Winters are milder on average and there’s every opportunity to have a riot of lovely flowers from December right through till spring.”
Deadly floods in Bangladesh, devastating wildfires in California, melting glaciers in Greenland, coral bleaching in the oceans – this is climate change in action. Highlighting far more benign changes in Britain, long blessed with a moderate climate, may appear trivial or downright insensitive. Our gentle extremes – the beast from the east, or summer 2018 being England’s hottest ever – are far from drastic. But they still pose challenges, and there is more change coming.
Britain’s 27 million gardeners could be the canaries in our coalmine. How are gardeners experiencing climate change in Britain and how is it transforming our gardens? And can adapting our gardening styles mitigate the negative impacts of climate change?
Marie and Tony couldn’t see their garden when they first viewed the house in 1982 because it was covered by a snowdrift. In the years since, as their south-facing quarter-acre evolved from a children’s play-space to a “four-seasons garden” with an all-year-round rainbow of flowers, shrubs and trees, they have witnessed the Midlands climate become steadily milder. Autumn frosts are much later, if they strike at all, and September is a summer month now. Their begonias continue until October. “That would never have happened in the past; we’d barely get through September without air frosts,” says Tony. “Although it’s warming up, you’ve got to plan for the extremes. We’re still going to get very severe winters and it will wipe out many gardeners’ new species.”
They know about this only too well. Their garden features a jungle area of bamboo, palm trees, a banana tree and the stumps of several Tasmanian tree ferns. These ferns survived the winter of 2009, the coldest for 30 years, but a run of -15C nights and sub-zero days the following December killed them off. “It’s a mortgage to replace them,” grimaces Marie. Climate change is encouraging many gardeners to buy exotic plants but “we still need truly hardy varieties,” says Tony. Their banana is wrapped in black cloth over winter. He ensures that whenever they add a shrub to the 3,000 in their garden it can survive at -15C.
Marie and Tony’s garden fared better during last summer’s drought. Their clay soils retain moisture, which helps, but they didn’t lose a single plant to the weather, despite being on holiday for two weeks. This may be because they are obsessive mulchers. Mulch is material added to the surface of the soil to increase organic matter and repress weeds. The Newtons have added 108 cubic metres of tree bark to their soil over the years; each year they also compost all their garden leaves and cuttings, reapplying this to their soil. This organic matter has steadily improved soil quality and, crucially, helps it retain moisture.
When Liam Shoesmith, deputy parks manager of Truro city council, saw how dry 2018 summer’s long-term forecast looked, he suggested the city’s gardeners should plant succulents and cacti for their Britain in Bloom competition entry. “It was a bit of a joke really,” he says. But the community group that organises Truro’s displays took his advice. In what the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) described as the “toughest year for community gardening in 54 years”, Truro’s blend of exotic, drought-tolerant plants, including palms and Mediterranean herbs, serviced by a solar-powered rainwater-harvesting system, thrived. And Truro won the Britain in Bloom competition for the first time.
Shoesmith is currently dispatching his team to mow parkland grass: milder winters mean Truro’s grass grows all year round. He began gardening as a boy in the 1980s. “It’s definitely milder and wetter,” he says. “The difficult thing we have with the climate is the more changeable weather. Last winter was probably one of the wettest on record here and then we went into one of the driest summers. The capricious nature of the weather is very hard to anticipate and work with.”
We don’t think of mild winters as extreme weather events, but December 2015 was the most anomalous month ever recorded, 5.1C above average, and the warmest in the Met Office’s central England temperature dataset, which stretches back to 1659. Shoesmith notices how pollinating insects, such as solitary bees, often emerge during these mild midwinters. If there are no flowers, and no nectar, they will perish. “Climate change is a big issue and as gardeners we can all do our bit to help by planting the garden so it’s flowering throughout the year,” he says. “We all want that anyway.”
Wildlife-friendly gardening focuses on native flowers, but Shoesmith argues we have long had non-native plants – particularly in milder Cornwall – and many exotic species are just as attractive to pollinators. In general, Britain’s 400,000 garden plant species provide genetic diversity, enabling more selection and breeding to adapt to future extremes. But Shoesmith also has a motto – “don’t go silly buying too much frilly” – because certain varieties of exotic flowers with lots of petals lose their nectar-holding sexual organs and so become useless for pollinators. Daisies, aconites, crocus, hellebores are good for winter-waking bees.
Allotment holders are also adapting to the increasingly capricious climate. Mandy Barber has turned to growing perennial produce on her plot in Ashburton, Devon. “Annual vegetables needed a lot more watering and it was touch and go whether they would make it last summer, but perennial vegetables have a lot more resilience to temperature changes,” she says. Barber is experimenting with crops including Taunton Deane kale; poireau perpétuel, a perennial leek; and Hablitzia tamnoides, or Caucasian spinach, which is grown in Scandinavia and can survive -25C. “The Hablitzia tamnoides plants go on for decades, they are like a rampant triffid, but you get a crop between February and June every year and the leaves are a bit like baby spinach,” says Barber. She also propagates and sells these perennials.
Every gardener I speak to agrees that milder winters are enabling more pests to survive and encouraging new pest species. Allan Trigg has been growing vegetables for more than 40 years and has an allotment in Chelmsford, Essex. “This is my little patch of England,” he smiles. Fewer frosts means his fellow allotment holders plant out runner beans, sweetcorn and potatoes earlier. With an extended growing season, Trigg can grow more, and second crops, although last year he grew less because he was spending so much time watering his vegetables. The dry weather produced lower yields of crops such as potatoes. After 2017, his potatoes lasted him and his wife through to February; this winter, they were eaten by November. And allium leaf miner and leek moth are a growing problem. “I used to grow loads of leeks but now I don’t bother,” he says. He pulls one up to show the damage below ground. “We never used to have this trouble years ago.”
In Walsall the Newtons are accepting of their growing losses to pests such as the lily beetle and the lace bug. “It went absolutely berserk after the hot summer,” says Tony. “I thought it was going to kill all the plants in the garden.” Barber is beset by voles (which survive the milder winters), while in Cornwall, Shoesmith has noticed the spread of fuchsia gall mite along the hedges. “It had the opportunity to come to Britain for decades, but only arrived this century because of the milder winters,” he says. “We don’t have the same amount of frosts now and so we get many more fungal problems.”
These observations precisely match the more scientific language of Gardening in a Changing Climate, a 2017 RHS report that outlines the challenges – milder winters, more unpredictable extremes and more pests – posed by climate change. But the RHS also asks how gardeners might help save the planet. The way we garden is still sometimes part of the problem – using precious water in pursuit of a perfect lawn during a drought springs to mind – but it can be part of the solution. Gardeners can reduce carbon dioxide emissions, mitigate pollution and flooding, and help increase their neighbourhood’s resilience.
“Water use in gardens is going to be a major issue in the future,” says Alistair Griffith, director of science at the RHS. London is forecast to require 100m litres a day more than it can supply in 2020, with this deficit rising to 400m litres a day by 2040. The use of energy-intensive mains water on gardens is still socially acceptable and Britain lags behind more water-stressed countries where grey-water recycling is commonplace. But hosepipe bans could become perpetual for some regions in coming decades.
Apart from using only rainwater – even a small balcony can catch and store rainwater with a mini-reservoir – Griffith recommends gardeners provide “as much greenery as possible”. He suggests planting hedges instead of fencing and planting trees. Trees not only dispel pollution but can alleviate flash flooding and provide shade for a home during heatwaves. Perhaps the most overlooked way gardening can benefit the climate is via the soil: adding organic matter (mulch from home-composting, not peat) can create a soil that stores more carbon and retains more water, also making gardens more resilient in flood and droughts.
Griffith’s final practical suggestion for climate-friendly gardening is to make everything permeable. Unfortunately, paving gardens for parking continues (in 2015, the RHS found that the number of paved, plant-free front gardens had tripled in 10 years from 1.5m to 4.6m). Even car park gardens can be permeable and planted with trees and shrubs around the edge. But, according to Griffith, people resist, citing a lack of time and a nervousness about failing at gardening. “Gardening is always trial and error,” he says. “Give it a go.”
Gardening won’t stop climate change, but it could make our local communities more resilient when faced with extreme floods, heat – and mild weather. In troubled times, it is also a fundamentally optimistic gesture.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jan/14/growing-pains-how-the-climate-crisis-is-changing-british-gardens

Thus Owen Jones (Opinion, 10 January) discusses Labour’s Brexit choices and the need to reverse austerity, with no recognition that redistribution must now be within an economy focused on reducing emissions to net zero by 2030, not on “good” growth.

The key to the measurements is the oceans. Oceans absorb more than 90% of the heat that results from greenhouse gases, so if you want to measure global warming you really have to measure ocean warming.
There are other ways to measure climate change, but none are as convincing as the oceans. Air temperatures are most commonly reported in the media as evidence of global warming, but the problem with these is they are very erratic. While there is certainly a long-term trend of higher air temperatures, any given year may be warmer or colder than the last.
So oceans are key, and they are telling us a clear story. The last five years were the five hottest on record. The numbers are huge: in 2018 the extra ocean heat compared to a 1981-2010 baseline amounted to 196,700,000,000,000,000,000,000 joules. The current rate of ocean warming is equivalent to five Hiroshima-size atomic bombs exploding every second.
The measurements have been published in the journal Advances in Atmospheric Sciences in an article by Lijing Cheng, the lead author, and his colleagues from the Institute for Atmospheric Physics in China. His collaborators, of which I am one, included researchers from around the world. The article charts ocean heat back to the late 1950s, showing a steady increase.
Ocean warming is incontrovertible proof of global warming, and there are real consequences to a warming ocean. Firstly, warmer water expands, and this expansion causes sea levels to rise. Approximately a third of the rise in ocean waters is a result of the heat absorbed by the oceans. Scientists expect about one metre of sea level rise by the end of the century, which would be enough to displace 150 million people worldwide. 
The warming waters also make storms more powerful. In the US recently, we have seen hurricanes pass over extremely warm ocean waters, which has supercharged them and increased the damage they cause. Other kinds of storms are also being made stronger. Heavier downpours of rainfall are increasing flooding around the world. Simply put, our emissions of greenhouse gases have caused loss of life and property. We are all responsible, but the people who have denied the science and the solutions own a special responsibility that history will judge harshly.
It isn’t just humans that are suffering and will suffer more in the future. The heating of oceans is causing tremendous problems for sea life, particularly coral reefs. If we continue to warm the planet, we can expect to lose much of these reefs. We can also anticipate reductions in fish and sea life populations. 
We scientists sound like a broken record. Every year we present the science and plead for action. Not nearly enough is being done. We can still tackle climate change, but we must act immediately. We have the means to make a difference, we lack only the will.

No they don't. From 19,000 to 9,000 years ago the rise in global ocean temperatures followed the rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide.
At 33 degrees C I don't have much experience with Coke, but the tonic in my G&T follows the same principle. However even if I return the tonic water to the fridge but leave its lid off, it still goes flat. Pressure change over time plays a greater role in determining whether your fizzy drink will go flat. Temperature largely affects the rate at which this happens. When you remove your fizzy drink from the fridge, and unscrew the cap, it fizzes immediately, not due to the temperature change of the bottles contents - there has not been sufficient time for that, even at 33 degrees C - but due to the sudden pressure decrease.
Similarly in the ocean, while the ability of sea water to dissolve CO2 decrease with temperature, increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration and partial pressure is causing more CO2 to dissolve in the oceans reducing their pH. While some of this CO2 may come from the oceans, most of the net increase comes from the known combustion of fossil fuels.', u'recommendation_count': u'2', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1547781777000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'the temperature change of the bottles contents', u'effect': u'when you remove your fizzy drink from the fridge it fizzes immediately there has not been sufficient time for that'}, {u'cause': u'the sudden pressure decrease', u'effect': u'even at 33 degrees c but'}, {u'cause': u'the ability of sea water to dissolve co2 decrease with temperature increasing atmospheric co2 concentration and partial pressure', u'effect': u'more co2 to dissolve in the oceans reducing their'}], u'author_id': u'12483673', u'in_reply_to': u'124751993', u'id': u'124809361', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'IanGeorge', u'text': u'I'm sorry.

You need around 30 years of data to measure climate temperature. 20 years of data is not enough.
Satellites measure the temperature of the upper troposphere high above where humans live. Satellite data requires considerable adjustment (tampering) before it provides you with a measure of the temperature of the upper troposphere.

Mean ocean surface levels are measured using radar based satellites not by photographic means. Such satellite based measures are not affected by tectonism or geological instability.

Published IPCC graphs past and present illustrate this to be true but the emails were icing on the cake."" On land global temperature data is based on measurements made by meteorological organisations such as the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. In determining which sites more accurately reflect regional as distinct from local and urban climate temperature meteorologists take into account such factors as the urban heat island affect, changes in shading and wind tunneling from buildings as well as changes in vegetation in both urban, suburban and agricultural areas. They don't falsify data but remove sites or adjust data from sites to remove these cooling and biases in the measure of the regional climate temperature. Sites have removed or adjustments made which result in the cooling of the data, not always in a increase in the climate temperature shown by the data. Removal of a site or adjustment of the data from a site to remove the bias produced by an urban heat island will result in decrease in the temperatures shown by the data.
These data sources are not guessed at, nor are they closed but can be accessed on line. Adjustments are made and sites abandoned, in the determination of regional climate temperature, for objective reasons reflecting the factors discussed in the preceding paragraph. Ships and buoys measure ocean temperatures while sparsely populated countries such as Australia have a good coverage of meteorological stations. Any shortfall in central Asia would reflect the policies of the current Russian and US administrations.

Enormous amounts of work have been done in numerous disciplines in my lifetime. Collectively it has provided us with very good ideas of what has happened through history going back millions of years. The carbon cycle is not one of the parameters having any significant causal role in determining the climate.""
Your last sentence is wrong. The carbon cycle was the major factor in causing the global warming which led to the end of the last glacial period or ""ice age"" over the 10,000 years of deglaciation between 19,000 and 9,000 years ago. The carbon cycle was also the cause of the early mid-Pliocene warming around 5 million years ago and the Palaeocene Eocene thermal maximum 55.5 million years ago.
""The current state of knowledge is that a significant number of periodic variables in the solar system and the sun itself drive the planet's climate.""
The sun's energy output as a star has been increasing very slowly through the 4.543 billion years of the Earth's existence. This rate of increase is far to slow to have any noticeable impact on the Earth's climate in times spans of a couple of million to a couple of centuries over which which we have observed recent and Pleistocene climate change.
Periodic changes in the Earth's axial tilt, eccentricity of rotation and the point in the planets orbit where it is closest to the sun cause cycles in Northern Hemisphere high latitude summer insolation (NHHLSI) over periods of 10,000 to 100,000 years. A peak in NHHLSI 19,000 years ago produced some melting of the North American and north Eurasian glacial continental ice sheets which at that time extended as far south as the regions of Yosemite, Chicago, New York, London, Milan and Belgrade.
This produced a large meltwater pulse in the North Atlantic shutting the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) which cools the Southern Ocean, which led to oxidation of oceanic oozes in the Southern Ocean increasing atmospheric CO2 resulting in global greenhouse warming over the next 10,000 years causing the Northern Hemisphere continental glacial ice sheets to retreat to their current levels.
Atmospheric CO2 reached 280 ppm 8,000 years ago on the shoulder of that NHHLSI peak. NHHLSI has declined slowly since then and will continue to do so for the next 50,000 years, at which time, if atmospheric CO2 had remained at the usual interglacial level of around 280 ppm, the glacial period or ""ice age"" would have started. If atmospheric CO2 is still at, near or above current levels of 410 ppm that next glacial period will not occur.

These “orbital perturbations” caused huge changes in climate due to amplifying feedbacks like ice melt and release of CO2 from warming oceans and methane from permafrost.
From PNAS in 2014: “Using satellite measurements, this analysis directly quantifies how much the Arctic as viewed from space has darkened in response to the recent sea ice retreat. We find that this decline has caused 6.4 ± 0.9 W/m2 of radiative heating since 1979, considerably larger than expectations from models and recent less direct estimates. Averaged globally, this albedo change is equivalent to 25% of the direct forcing from CO2 during the past 30 y.” https://www.pnas.org/content/111/9/3322
As the other half of the surface area of Arctic sea ice largely goes away by mid-century, that amplifying feedback will increase substantially. And the loss of seasonal snow cover in the North adds a similar amplifying feedback.

Their top line: slightly higher sea level rise than was predicted in the last major IPCC report of 2013. Fourteen more centimetres this century for the upper end of the worst case scenario, raising it to 112 cm by 2100.

Insurance - forget it! Unless the private owner wants to stump up the premium. 
About 35 years ago, I believe that at least one Council refused to indemnify private owners with respect to any development they sought - and the Council approved - in the known coastal erosion zone. Not sure how that panned out. The coastal ratepayers also forked out goodly amounts of rate revenue to Councils. And wanted to see value for money, too.
Part of the problem is that the developments are often dense & consolidated on ever smaller pieces of land, as owners become more & more greedy & the pieces of land diminish with continued - & likely escalating - erosion. See the aerial photo.
For decades, it has been known that currents carry sand from eroded beaches along the NSW & SE Qld coast as far as Fraser Island.
It's a widespread problem - Wamberal Beach on the Central Coast. Noosa, where ugly sand pumps were (still are?) used to stop its famous beach & the Hastings Street tourist mecca, from disappearing &/or going under.

I survey a gorgeous, curved slice of coast where swell dispatched from the far reaches of the Southern and Pacific oceans reaches a final, spectacular resignation.
Collaroy-Narrabeen on Sydney’s northern beaches is arguably as well known for its peerless status in Australian surfing culture as it is the pinup for rising sea levels due to climate change.
There cannot be a beach in Australia that has been more studied by experts and fought over by homeowners, beach users and grandstanding politicians than Collaroy-Narrabeen.
At 2.6km it’s Sydney’s second-longest stretch of golden sand and pounding surf (Cronulla, at 4.8km is the longest). It’s also classified as the most at-risk beach from erosion in New South Wales and the third most at-risk in the nation.
Collaroy takes its name from an 1881 shipwreck. The paddle steamer Collaroy, that plied its trade between Newcastle and Sydney as a passenger vessel, grounded at the end of my street, according records in the State Library of NSW.
As for “Narrabeen”, its name is disputed as meaning either “source of fresh water” or “swan”. Camaraigal descendant and historian Dennis Foley, describes the idyllic shores and waterway of Narrabeen Lagoon, “the heart of our world” before British settlement.
Collaroy-Narrabeen is mecca for international surfers. A bucket-list wave.
Quick trivia question: which is the only non-American surf spot mentioned in the Beach Boys’ Surfin’ USA? It’s Narra-beyaaan… There you go. Look it up. (You owe me a chop from your next triumphant meat tray.)
World-renowned surfing legends Simon Anderson, Terry Fitzgerald, Nat Young, Damien Hardman, Laura Enever, Mark Warren, Col Smith and Ozzie Wright had their pick of waves along the stretch – from the powerful beach break at Collaroy to the fabled left-hander at North Narrabeen known as “northy”.
Surf writer Nick Carroll says: “It is possible that more surfers learned to pull vertical off-the-lips here than any other surf spot in the world.” Standards and expectations are high and routinely met.
Master the hassle at “northy” and you’ll survive any competitive break on earth, my surfing husband Brendan Donohoe reckons. He’s been the president of the northern beaches branch of Surfrider Australia since 1999 (also former chair of the board) and through him I’ve had a front-row seat to observe the pitched battles fought over Collaroy-Narrabeen.
For those not immersed in surfing culture, the beach is that one in those ubiquitous news pictures of smashed houses, tangled timber and a swimming pool wrenched from its moorings – all flung to the sand in the wild winter storm of 2016 which swallowed 50m of coastline, 150m of sand and dumped it in the surf zone.
The images don’t surprise anyone with a passing local knowledge. Storms have been claiming houses and various bits of the beach’s four surf life saving clubs regularly since the first recorded image of splintered timber in 1920. Ask the old-timers.
Question is, can a man-made seawall hold back the tides?
One thing is absolutely certain according to coastal scientists worldwide: seawalls protect land property in the short-term but, eventually, destroy beaches.
Think of the dunes of a beach as its precious lungs … breathing in and out with the tides. Sand is accreted, washed away. Breathe in. Breathe out. For the vast swathes of Australia’s uninhabited shoreline it’s a dynamic, natural process.
When humans build houses in the dunes or breakwalls and seawalls on beaches and rivers, they harden the coast and its ability to recover naturally. Such structures have the inevitable effect of reflecting and concentrating wave energy and accelerating erosion.
Eventually, the beach narrows and disappears.
In 2002, the Surfrider Foundation called on the beach-loving residents of Collaroy-Narrabeen to protest the building of a seawall more than a kilometre long proposed by the then Warringah council. Also noted was that seawalls are eye-wateringly expensive to maintain, adding huge imposts to council rates.
Thousands gathered, held hands, drew a “line in the sand”. Said “No to seawalls” and the audacious engineering project was scrapped.
Decades earlier the council had committed to a “buyback” of properties in the wave impact zone. A strategic retreat from the worst of it. A handful of properties were purchased, but the policy was abandoned in 2007, deemed as “unsustainable” into the future, estimated to cost hundreds of millions of dollars by the MP for Pittwater, Rob Stokes.
In 2013 Tony Abbott, member for Warringah, declared that a “green army” would build seawalls up and down the coast. The rising waters would be forever thwarted! Northern beaches mayors said “yeah, nah”. “It’s the opposite of the direction councils are going in.”
The science is in. And it’s not that simple.
The new, amalgamated Northern Beaches council now has a policy of approving partial seawall reinforcements with costs largely borne by the homeowners themselves.
It’s seen as unfair by some. No comfort to the many thousands of homeowners along Australia’s vast, settled coastline whose precious properties (built in good faith) are now subject to the merciless forces of evermore destructive coastal surges due to climate change.
So, what’s the answer?
Coastal municipalities have been tackling the problem with a suite of measures. For some it will be a strategic retreat with assets that can be moved, for others it will be building partial seawalls, cliff reinforcement and revegetation. As is happening in other parts of the world, the costs of defence will sometimes be calculated as too onerous and properties will be abandoned to topple into the sea.
What about pumping more sand to replenish the beach? I hear you ask. Good question!
It’s what Surfrider Australia and others (including Rob Stokes) have been advocating for decades.
After all, it’s been done on the southern Gold Coast since 1976 after breakwalls built in the 60s on the Tweed River disturbed the natural flow of sand, leaving local beaches bare and bereft. Sand is pumped through pipes on to the beaches, to the point where many now complain there’s too much of the stuff.
However, the topography of threatened beaches in NSW is very different to the Goldie. Most of our eroding beaches are locked between headlands and sand is washed directly offshore to deep water, making restoration of our beaches a much more expensive and tricky proposition.
In October 2017, a technical report on sand nourishment was prepared by the University of NSW’s Water Research Laboratory for the state Office of Environment and Heritage.
It notes that in the US the trend since the 1960s has been to move away from fixed structures for coastal protection. These days some 80%-93% of US Army Corps of Engineers’ expenditure is directed to replenishing sand.
The detailed report covers the waterfront in its analysis: the optimum width of beaches that sun-lovers expect; the sourcing of suitable sand with the right grain size; how to get it on to our beaches by either road or via a variety of offshore sand dredges and the attendant environmental impacts.
It’s well worth a read if you’re wondering if sea-level rise is coming to a beach near you. Spoiler alert: it is.
There’s increasing clamour from coastal experts for the NSW government to invest in a dredging vessel (or two) that could ply our coast and continually pump sand on to our most at-risk beaches.
We could name one Beachy McBeachface!
Renting sand-pumping vessels is also an option – there’s plenty of spare global capacity. The cost would be considerable, the oversight demanding and, no doubt, the science and technology is continually evolving. But the utter negligence of government(s) to not act, or even model future solutions, is unfathomable.
The sheer volume of reports commissioned and left mouldering in bottom drawers could in themselves be a handy bulwark in the face of gathering storms.
And those increasingly ferocious maelstroms are coming. Leaving in their wake another round of useless hand-wringing and blame. Hearts and homes broken.
Ask yourself, what is a beach worth? To our economy, tourism and our adored beach-going and surfing culture?
On Collaroy-Narrabeen, at least, the cost of doing something has been estimated.
Too high a price to pay?
The loss of my beloved beach, and yours – and it could happen in our children’s lifetime – is incalculable.
It’s way past time to act.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/17/holding-back-the-tides-sydneys-battle-against-coastal-erosion

However, those ambitions have yielded only one project under construction, Hinkley Point C in Somerset, south-west England.
The past two months have dealt serious blows to hopes for more, with Toshiba abandoning its plans for Moorside in Cumbria and Hitachi scrapping its Wylfa plant on Anglesey. Wylfa’s death means a second Hitachi plant planned for Oldbury, Gloucestershire, is doomed, too.
Together the three projects would have provided 15% of today’s electricity demand.
That begs the question: is it time to rethink plans for new nuclear or redouble our nuclear efforts? With the cost of wind, solar and batteries dropping rapidly, have renewables and smart technologies matured enough to fill the gap?
What is not in question is the UK’s need for more low-carbon power. Coal and old nuclear plants are shutting in the 2020s and tough climate targets are looming.
The Green party and groups such as Greenpeace advocate ditching nuclear in favour of more renewables, energy efficiency and flexibility through imports, batteries and other technologies.
However, most energy industry experts think the future involves some new nuclear. The government has already restated its commitment to new nuclear power.
“It’s difficult to see a low-carbon energy system in the future which has no new nuclear,” says George Day, the head of policy and regulation at the government-funded Energy Systems Catapult.
“If you try to rely on just renewables and storage, without carbon capture and storage or nuclear, you are looking at a very challenging transition and one that is more costly than a balanced mix [of supplies].”
All of National Grid’s four future energy scenarios envisage some new nuclear, although the amounts differ considerably.
Peter Atherton, an analyst at Cornwall Insight, said it was hard to imagine an energy system without the baseload power – or continuous electricity supply – provided by nuclear.
“There is a school of thought that says baseload is a 20th century thing. They might be right – but it would be a big call by government to bet baseload won’t be a thing by 2025.”
The government has already downgraded the amount of new nuclear it expects to be built in the future. It assumes 13 gigawatts of new nuclear capacity by 2035, implying three further nuclear power stations in addition to the 3.2GW plant at Hinkley.
There are now only two firms in the running, which are both involved in plans for two new plants.
French state-owned EDF Energy, which is behind Hinkley, wants to start building a carbon copy of that project at Sizewell, on the Suffolk coast, in 2021. Chinese state-owned CGN, meanwhile, is accelerating work on a Chinese-designed reactor for Bradwell in Essex, with the aim of being operational around 2030.
Hitachi’s withdrawal suggests the financing model used for Hinkley, and proposed for Wylfa, is dead. The government will likely junk that approach – of offering a guaranteed price of power for 35 years – for an alternative known as the “regulated asset base” (RAB) model.
The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has created a whole division to develop RAB, where a regulator would set a fixed sum for the power station’s costs and fixed returns for the developer, paid for by energy billpayers or taxpayers. Officials are assessing RAB’s viability, with a decision expected this year.
But critics say the approach loads the risk of nuclear plant construction delays, such as those seen in France and Finland, on citizens. Returns would also be paid for years before any electricity was generated.
EDF Energy backs the RAB model and the Chinese have said they would look at it. The influential government adviser Dieter Helm, professor of energy policy at Oxford University, has called it “plausible and preferable” to the Hinkley approach if the UK wants new nuclear. Day believes it could produce the power stations that ministers want.
Labour, which is pro-nuclear, has branded the approach risky and reckless but has not put forward an alternative.
Given the uncertainty over new nuclear, could the UK manage without it? Maybe. The obvious route is a lot more renewable power capacity than currently planned.
The government’s climate change advisers last year hiked up the amount of renewables they expected four years ago, to 45-60% of electricity supplies by 2030, up from 40-55% previously. Both are a big increase from the 33% level today.
The Committee on Climate Change said there is evidence the energy system could cope with as much as 60% of supplies coming from intermittent renewables.
Filling the 9.2GW-sized hole left by Moorside, Wylfa and Oldbury would require 14GW of offshore wind power, according to the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank. That is equivalent to more than 20 of the world’s biggest offshore windfarm, which consists of 87 turbines.
According to Atherton, the only way renewables and storage could plausibly fill the nuclear gap would be to “spend a vast amount of money on saturating the UK with offshore wind”. That could end up with enough turbines in enough different locations to replicate the “always-on” nature of nuclear.
Large-scale batteries will help with the variable nature of renewables and are expanding fast. But they will not address the fact that electricity demand is much higher in winter than summer, or solve long windless spells.
The other big techno fix in the arsenal of low-carbon energy options is carbon capture and storage (CCS). However, many years of government efforts to kickstart it failed and ministers have switched their focus away from CCS for power stations to CCS for industrial uses.
Day said gas power stations with CCS still looked “pretty promising” but significant policy changes would be needed to enable firms to invest in it.
Others, however, are more dismissive. Atherton said: “People have been working on CCS gas for 20 years and nobody has got within a mile of it yet. People will tell you the technology works … that doesn’t mean I can do it on a budget.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/17/does-the-hitachi-decision-mean-the-end-of-the-uks-nuclear-dream

Before the referendum, civil servants warned that such a task – untangling 40 years of legal agreements, ripping out a delicate web of connections that had become embedded – would consume all their energies. Naturally, their warnings were dismissed as Project Fear. But even the head of Vote Leave, Dominic Cummings, before he took on the form of Benedict Cumberbatch, conceded via Twitter that leaving the European Union would present the British state with the “hardest job since beating Nazis”.
Just think of what else we could have done with all that time and money, including the £4bn we’re spending to guard against the entirely avoidable and self-inflicted calamity of a no-deal crash-out from the EU. The effort we could have made for jobs or housing, or to repair the damage inflicted by austerity; the work that could have been done to improve life for those left behind by three decades of change, globalisation and automation. But Whitehall didn’t have the bandwidth. Governments might be able to walk and chew gum at the same time, but walking while shooting yourself in both feet – that, it turns out, is impossible.
It’s not just the machinery of state that has seized up since June 2016, all but paralysed by Brexit. It’s affected what you might call the attention economy too: both the news media and its consumers, those who shape the collective conversation and those who take part in it. So enveloped are we in Brexit that we hardly have the space to contemplate anything else. Our gaze is turned inward, and we can barely see what’s going on around us.
If news bulletins, front pages and social media feeds were your guide, you’d think climate change had gone away, quietly resolved while we were obsessing over the Northern Ireland backstop. Not so. It barely made a ripple, but last week came word that the oceans are warming at a rate some 40% faster than previously understood. Remember, it’s the seas that absorb most of the extra heat going into the climate system, and the dangers posed by a rise in ocean temperature are clear and present, whether it’s fuelling ever more extreme storms and hurricanes or increasing sea levels, thereby flooding low-lying areas and rendering potentially hundreds of millions homeless. It’s just one more sign, along with melting ice-sheets or the drying up of the Rhine, Europe’s most critical waterway – where low water is rendering whole stretches impassable – that while the government tears itself apart trying to fulfil a nostalgic fantasy of taking back control, global temperatures are getting relentlessly out of control.
Perhaps it’s harsh to blame Brexit for our apathy about climate change, which long predates the 2016 referendum. But even those subjects that we used to discuss barely get a look-in now. The war in Syria rages on. This week, as MPs were debating their confidence in Theresa May, the UN reported that at least 15 infants, including eight babies, had died for lack of medical care and from extreme cold. Most of their families had fled the fighting to seek refuge on the Jordanian border. It’s a reminder that the world has not stopped turning just because we’ve stopped looking.
More pertinent for Britons, perhaps, given our government’s still warm relations with the country, is that Saudi Arabia’s dirty war in Yemen goes on, causing what the UN has repeatedly called the world’s worst humanitarian disaster. It is a war so dirty that even the perpetrators are victims: the Saudis are recruiting young survivors of the horrors of Darfur to serve as child soldiers on the front line.
In the 1980s, pictures of starving children in Ethiopia prompted global outrage and determination to act. Now, footage from Yemen of emaciated babies and wizened toddlers, and a toll of 85,000 children dead through hunger, induces no more than a shrug. And yet, the famine in Yemen should offend us morally at least as much as the suffering of three decades ago, for this catastrophe is entirely manmade, and therefore avoidable.
Perhaps it’s giving ourselves too much credit, but I’d like to think that, were we not so distracted by the customs union and Norway plus, we would at least have registered that China is currently holding an estimated 1 million Uighur Muslims in the Xinjiang region in what seem to be Mao-style “re-education camps”. Forced to listen to hours of Communist party propaganda aimed at their “rehabilitation and redemption”, inmates are held in squalid conditions and subject to brutal interrogations. There are reports of prisoners taking what, in their despair, they conclude is the only way out: suicide. One former captive describes being held still in a “metal device” that kept him entirely rigid. That rather puts our debates about “free movement” into perspective, doesn’t it?
The Chinese authorities call these places, which satellite photographs reveal have dramatically expanded, “vocational training centres”. But they are behind barbed wire and high perimeter walls. The authorities say they inoculate “trainees” against the lure of terrorism. The truth is they represent state persecution of a reviled religious minority. The historical resonances are obvious, and should have provoked fierce condemnation from our leaders. But they, and we, are all too busy.
Even those stories that not long ago commanded our attention now struggle to be noticed. Last year, Israel’s use of live ammunition against protesters at the Gaza frontier rightly made big news, as did the presence of antisemitism within Labour’s ranks. You might imagine both issues had faded away, given how rarely they’re now discussed. But the Gaza protests continue and the anguish of daily life there has not receded: witness, by way of an exception, Mishal Husain’s BBC report from a hospital struggling to function.
Meanwhile, every day brings fresh evidence that within Labour’s ranks there remain some deeply suspect attitudes toward Jews: note the Labour councillor in Fife who reckoned concerns about anti-Jewish racism were all part of a Mossad-orchestrated plot – in other words, a Jewish conspiracy. She was briefly suspended but is now safely back in the Labour fold.
Or you could look to the United States, where the former Trump campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, has admitted sharing polling data with the Russians – as slam-dunk a proof of collusion as you could wish for. So conclusive is it that Trump’s own lawyer, the once credible Rudy Giuliani, has reversed his previous line of defence: now he all but admits there was collusion, but says Trump himself was not involved. It’s all happening out there, but our minds are elsewhere. It means we don’t even have to wait to leave the European Union to see that the notion that Brexit would forge a global Britain, eager to head “out and into the world” was bogus. We can already see that it’s doing the opposite to us, turning our gaze ever more inward, shrinking our horizons – and ourselves.

Appreciate the reply. I agree that the backing bending the currency can be aggregated production (which includes stored wealth as well as new production) however disagree that this is solely a factor of available working citizens. Given currency is just a claim on wealth increases in investments can impact it. In addition available citizens arn’t the only limiting factor as resources, capital and production facilities are also required. MMT is subject to all these real word factors. 
I haven’t pointed out a block in production as a cause of inflation - merely the obvious fact that more money chasing same amount of goods and services will be inflationary. It doesn’t matter if the spend is reckless or not (although made worse by reckless spending).
Taxation doesn’t reduce the money supply unless it is used as a form of quantitative tightening (so called) by removing currency from the system by shrinking central bank balance sheets. When the government just taxes money out of the private sector and then puts it straight back (just a transfer payment ultimately) it isn’t even really reducing the velocity of money but just changing it’s location.
There is no free lunch - and MMT will end up being inflationary if the money supply is increased faster than the productive economy is. Taxation in a deficit spending situation won’t solve that problem. Whether or not the government is able to ensure that the economy grows faster than the money supply through a deficit spending MMT model is a different question - obviously I don’t believe they can.
Agree totally with your comment about governments inflating asset bubbles - my views on that are very clear.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1548118475000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'13552149', u'in_reply_to': u'124876035', u'id': u'124947915', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Peggy Sanders', u'text': u'https://www.enhancetv.com.au/video/national-press-club-address-brendan-o-connor/55321', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1548117903000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'15722162', u'in_reply_to': u'124947308', u'id': u'124947804', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Peggy Sanders', u'text': u'CoralSeeNQ.

“The darkest hour, they say, is just before dawn. And it just may be that a glimmer of light is appearing in the five year nightmare of the Abbot-Turnbull-Morrison dynasty. 
Something more important seems to be happening - a re-awakening of the conscience of Australia. A renaissance of the rationality and decency that appeared to be all but destroyed by the relentless campaign of fear and division promulgated by the right-wing rump of the coalitionists and their elite allies. 
They remain in their own excrement, but perhaps - just perhaps - the nation is moving past them. The rump claims to be conservative, but is in fact deeply reactionary, pining for a largely mythical past based on the values which have served them so well - the monarchy, patriarchy, the established churches, the American alliance, and the political and economic domination from which they have gained their power and influence. 
The paragium included racism, homophobia, and male superiority. These were after challenged by the cultural revolutions of fifty-plus years since, and in the 1970’s and 1980’s progress was made, but then came the Howard years, and for more than a decade, we were encased behind the white picket fence. 
It wasn’t all football, meat pies, kangaroos and Holden cars, but Howard boasted he was the most conservative leader the country had ever had. Republicanism was thwarted, indigenous rights debased, gender issues ignored, and any taint of progressive policies firmly discouraged. 
And, if there is any lingering doubt, the Swedish teenager, Greta Thunberg spelled it out to the delegates in Katowice. “We have not come here to beg, world leaders to care,” she said. “you have ignored us in the past and you will ignore us again.” “We have run out of excuses and we are running out of time.

can Labor put principle before politics?
BQEND
If they try to it is unlikely, remembering Gough Whitlam, that they will be permitted to govern.
More likely Labor will do a deal with the devil in order to gain power, and will put principal before principle.
If they don't, they might antagonise the 26 people who own half of the world's wealth
https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/21/world-26-richest-people-own-as-much-as-poorest-50-per-cent-oxfam-report
While Cambridge Analytica gets all the media attention, it may be that a quasi-'Oxford Analytica' is equally adept at protecting the wealth of the wealthiest 26. 
Presumably 'national security' in modern parlance is an arms-length sub-contracted function of 'multinational security'. 
If Labor tries to stick to its founding principle of moderating the excesses of capitalism, it will struggle to deal with interminable, multinationally-funded internal factional wrangles.
Not to mention the mines, the nuclear lobby, arms manufacturers and traffickers, the media and global financiers.

It will require a Herculean effort to clean out the greed, corrupt sense of entitlement, selfishness and ideological blindness at the “commanding heights” of Australia’s government, economy and society. The Banking Royal Commission has exposed mearly the tip of the ugly reality. In business, in the professions, in the media and in politics, many of those at the top are the custodians and reproducers of a culture that is morally fetid. They remain obsessed with themselves, and their own importance, their cronies, their salaries and bonuses, their perks of office. 
The moral environment which has been created by these mainly men, in which the commanders of Australia’s economy, the professions and their fetid self serving policy, is based on a crude understanding of individualism which is self-regarding and venal. It embraces the flashy parenu, the shonky business type, those ambitious only for themselves, those who treat others (associates, colleagues, family) as only a means to their own selfish ends. Their relationships are primarily authoritarian. 
Most have backgrounds that lack ethical content, literary breadth and philosophical depth. Most are graduates in business administration, finance and accounting and A1, all characterised by a pedagogy of training rather than education, in the richest meaning of the word. 
The notion of social justice is foreign to them. They live by the gaudy belief that it is right for the winner to take all and right to create a narcissistic culture that normalises cruelty, poverty, homelessness and slavery by debt and want.

After years of being worried of the tainted brush of high interest rates and recession, it embraced their reforms and dared the Coalition to run its scare campaign about interest rates and economic management in the face of concerns about economic ructions occurring overseas.
So wedded was the Coalition to these scare tactics that, in the run-up to the 2013 election, it was still saying interest rates would always be lower under the Liberal party, even though the cash rate was then over 4% points lower than it had been when the Howard government lost office.
It’s a good reminder that reality will never stop the scare campaign, and that the Coalition is very slow to change – it will keep banging out its fear until well after anyone has stopped caring or listening.
2007 was also a good year for the ALP to push the issue of climate change. The nation was in drought and the push to reduce emissions and be active on the international stage was prominent.
This year economic ructions overseas are again present and so too is a drought and the need to take action on climate change. And where the 2007 opposition stopped being afraid of the economic legacy of the last ALP government so too should the current opposition not run from the climate change policies of the Gillard government. Because, as interest rates showed, regardless of the ALP’s policy, you can be sure the Coalition will keep shouting about carbon tax bogeymen.
It’s always amazing how things repeat themselves. Now, a decade on from the GFC, the worrying signs from overseas are there again just as we see the ALP looking set to take office.
The yield for US five-year treasury bonds is now lower than for one-year bonds – suggesting investors believe the economy is going to get worse.
This doesn’t necessarily indicate than the US will go into a recession, it’s just that when bond yields acted this way at the end of the 1960s, in the mid-1970s, the early 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, and before the GFC, a recession followed every time.
But hey, I’m sure Donald Trump will respond in a calm and well-thought-out way.
And while we remain more dependent upon China than the US, it too is showing signs of concern. The Chinese government has responded to the ructions of the trade war with the US by injecting $83bn into its financial system to avoid a credit crunch. That our largest trading partner is having to inject a record amount of money into its financial system does not exactly bring Marie Kondo levels of joy.
The Commonwealth Bank’s senior currency strategist, Joseph Capurso, suggests that “China’s economic miracle is over” and that its annual GDP growth will fall to around 4% over the next decade rather than the current average level of 6.5%.
This does not mean Australia is about to head into a recession – we are a very long way from such a thing. But it does serve as a reminder that projections of glorious revenue and growth that were found in the midyear economic and fiscal outlook over the next 10 years are rather hopeful.
It is now so long since the last recession that no one under 45 has really experienced it in their working life. Such a long stretch of time can lead to complacency and the type of dumb commentary that suggests “we need a recession to ...”
Recessions wreak destruction on families and lives. To measure them I prefer to focus on employment rather than GDP growth.
In the 1990s recession the percentage of the adult population employed fell 3.2% points in 18 months – the equivalent of 400,000 fewer people in work.
In recessions, masses of people in their 50s lose work and never return to the labour force. The overall unemployment rate rose from 6% at the start of 1990 to above 10% within two years; for men aged 55-64 it went from 6% to 14% in four years.
In the space of a year, real household disposable income fell on average by 2%.
Recessions are horrific. And while we should not talk ourselves into such a negative condition, the chances are that whoever is in power for the next three to five years will likely have to deal with an international economic slowdown. That does focus the mind, and yet what should also be at the forefront of our brains is another issue high on the agenda in 2007 – climate change.
Back in 2007 we were suffering from a drought, there was a push to reduce emissions and competing ways to do it as well as a desire from within the LNP to ignore international agreements.
Climate change policy became an election issue in 2007 because it fit with the new versus old difference of Rudd and Howard, and people could feel the change in the drought and heatwaves. Now people feel it still and also see it in the dying fish and terrible water management of the federal and the New South Wales governments. And they can see it in the division and idiocy that the government displays on climate change.
Climate change is now an issue that doesn’t so much differentiate old versus new thinking as it does between parties that are able to think with those utterly incapable of doing so.
And on this issue the ALP, like it did in 2007 with economics, should embrace its past.
Forget stale arguments over whether or not Rudd or the Greens did the right thing with the ETS. The Gillard government did introduce a carbon price – and it worked. It brought with it the long-term stability companies and their lobbyists such as the BCA now say they so desire. It reduces emissions.
The carbon price did not lose the election. It was lost because the ALP was a basket case of a party so riven with discord that the electorate voted for someone so disliked as was Tony Abbott to be prime minister.
For now, the ALP is adopting a measured approach to emissions – focusing on electricity but fearfully doing all it can not to utter carbon and price (let alone tax) in the same sentence. And maybe a copy of the Gillard carbon price is not achievable now, but they should not cower – because regardless what they do the Coalition will cry “carbon tax”.
Now, like 2007, is a time in which the electorate can feel the need for action. It needs to be grasped. And it is not a time to be fearful. Given the economic ructions accruing, the easy way is to play safe and seek caution, but that will achieve nothing except someone in a decade’s time noting once again we’re in an election year during a time of drought and a country without a decent climate change policy.

Speaking at the start of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, the 92-year-old naturalist and broadcaster warned that human activity has taken the world into a new era, threatening to undermine civilisation.
“I am quite literally from another age,” Attenborough told an audience of business leaders, politicians and other delegates. “I was born during the Holocene – the 12,000 [year] period of climatic stability that allowed humans to settle, farm, and create civilisations.” That led to trade in ideas and goods, and made us the “globally connected species we are today”.
Davos is a Swiss ski resort now more famous for hosting the annual four-day conference for the World Economic Forum. For participants it is a festival of networking. Getting an invitation is a sign you have made it – and the elaborate system of badges reveals your place in the Davos hierarchy.
For critics, “Davos man” is shorthand for the globe-trotting elite, disconnected from their home countries after spending too much time in the club-class lounge. Others just wonder if it is all a big waste of time.Who is there?
More than 2,500 people – business leaders, world leaders, diplomats and the odd celebrity, such as Matt Damon – will fly in for the 49th annual Davos meeting. Most delegates are men, and although the forum boasts delegates from more than 100 countries, most hail from western Europe, followed by the US. Sir David Attenborough is one of the most notable attendees in 2019, while Donald Trump, Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron all pulled out at short notice to focus on more pressing issues at home.
That stability allowed businesses to grow, nations to co-operate and people to share ideas, Attenborough explained, before warning sombrely: “In the space of my lifetime, all that has changed.
“The Holocene has ended. The Garden of Eden is no more. We have changed the world so much that scientists say we are in a new geological age: the Anthropocene, the age of humans,” he declared.
In a stark warning to the world leaders and business chiefs flocking to the WEF this week, Attenborough warned that the only conditions that humans have known are changing fast.
“We need to move beyond guilt or blame, and get on with the practical tasks at hand.”
A survey conducted before the WEF found that environmental threats are now the biggest danger to the global economy, and concern is mounting that co-operation between countries on the issue is breaking down.
Attenborough admitted that even he has been surprised by the speed of the damage caused to the environment during his career making TV programmes showing life on earth.
In response, Attenborough – recently voted Britain’s most trustworthy celebrity – said humans must use their expert problem-solving skills. “If people can truly understand what is at stake, I believe they will give permission for business and governments to get on with the practical solutions,” he told the WEF.
Get it right, he argued, and humans can create a world with clean air and water, unlimited energy and sustainable fish stocks, but only if decisive action is taken now.
“Over the next two years there will be United Nations decisions on climate change, sustainable development and a new deal for nature. Together these will form our species’ plan for a route through the Anthropocene.
“What we do now, and in the next few years, will profoundly affect the next few thousand years,” he added.
Speaking to journalists after his speech, Attenborough warned that economic models needed to change. “Growth is going to come to an end, either suddenly or in a controlled way,” he explained, citing the old joke that anyone who thinks you can have infinite growth in finite circumstances is “either a madman or an economist”.
He is also hopeful that he can change hearts and minds during his trip to Davos, pointing out that some delegates have more power than a nation state. “The enormity of the problem has only just dawned on quite a lot of people ... Unless we sort ourselves out in the next decade or so we are dooming our children and our grandchildren to an appalling future.”
Before he spoke, Attenborough received the Crystal award from the WEF for his work. Saudi Arabia’s first female film-maker, Haifaa al-Mansour, and conductor Marin Alsop of the Baltimore Symphony were also honoured for their work.
Prince William is due to appear with Attenborough to discuss environmental issues at the WEF on Tuesday.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/21/david-attenborough-tells-davos-the-garden-of-eden-is-no-more

The artist has painted roughly 200 bodies of water in 22 countries, from the Arctic to the Mediterranean, for her 20-year project One Artist Five Oceans. The goal is to raise awareness about ocean pollution and climate change.
“I have always been a huge environmentalist, I’ve screamed at people and tried to get the message across in so many ways,” said Eubank, on the phone from her Los Angeles studio. “I prefer to show people, ‘Hey look, this is our world, let’s take care of it. Don’t destroy it.’ It’s something very precious, something we all share.”
On 28 February, Eubank embarks on a long journey south to the Antarctic Circle for the last leg of her ocean painting project. She will depart from Ushuaia, Argentina, to the Antarctic Peninsula to paint the Southern Ocean.
It all started 20 years ago when Eubank was visiting the Doñana national park in Huelva, in the south of Spain, where she spent her days painting on the beach with her back to the water.
“Coming from California, I abhorred water paintings,” said Eubank. “For me, I could only see ideas other people had before me – crashing waves, dolphins and mermaids, I just couldn’t get into it.”
But that all changed when, after spending days painting the park, she turned to the Atlantic Ocean. “I painted the dunes and got fed up and turned around at sunrise, in the morning,” she said. “I was faced with the water and nothing else. From that first point on, that’s all I wanted to paint – water.”
She painted the Arctic Ocean from Svalbard, Norway. “What I noticed about the Arctic, is that the polar ice caps were melting in October,” she said. “The rate the oceans are warming up is the most frightening thing I can think of. Oceans are getting warmer.”
When she painted the Indian Ocean, she noticed the illustrious hues. “The Indian Ocean is the most beautiful, it has the most difference in colors,” said Eubank. “It has times when its more golden and aqua, at times. There’s a lot of variations.”
Though her series started in Spain, Eubank considers the Pacific the ocean her “home ocean. “I grew up in northern California near the coast,” she said.
Having sailed the seven seas and (so far) four oceans, Eubank has visited most of these bodies of water by sea. Not in any kind of boats, but by old-fashioned ships, including one called the Borobudur, a wooden replica of an eighth-century vessel. In a sense, Eubank is honoring a time-worn tradition.
“Explorers all had expedition artists; look at Captain Cook, he had William Hodges,” she said. “Back then, because people didn’t have cameras, they would take artists or do sketches themselves to document what they saw.”
Sailing by in a showy replica of an ancient boat does get a lot of attention. “Private boats would wave as they passed by,” said Eubank. “When we would come into port, sometimes there would be lines of people along the quay.”
As she packs for Antarctica, Eubank will be painting with oils, pencils and below-zero ink in her sketchbooks, which will be clipped to her jacket so they don’t fly into the ocean. “It hopefully will help people look at things in a new way,” she said.
The United Nations Environmental Program claims that 80% of all marine pollution is plastic, and that every year, over 8m tons of plastic ends up in the oceans. Apparently by 2050, oceans will carry more plastic than fish, just as the world’s oceans keep getting warmer.
Upon returning from Antarctica, Eubank will put together a book of all her ocean paintings and open an exhibition of selected paintings on 24 May at Kwan Fong Gallery in Thousand Oaks, California.
Instead of painting piles of garbage, she also hopes her viewers will relish the beauty of these bodies of water, as well.
“Our own actions affect what goes into the oceans,” said Eubank. “There’s a lot we can do; like if everyone ate less meat each week, rode a bike, walked and took public transit, it would make an impact. Hang dry your clothes. People are surprised how easy it is to help the oceans and help the climate.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jan/22/its-something-very-precious-painting-oceans-to-showcase-climate-change

Prince William also took world leaders to task at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, asking Attenborough why those in key positions have “taken so long” to address climate change.
Attenborough said the connection between the natural world and urban societies had been “remote and widening” since the industrial revolution, meaning humans do not realise the effect their actions have on the global ecosystem. The 92-year-old broadcaster added that it was “difficult to overstate” the urgency of the environmental crisis.
Davos is a Swiss ski resort now more famous for hosting the annual four-day conference for the World Economic Forum. For participants it is a festival of networking. Getting an invitation is a sign you have made it – and the elaborate system of badges reveals your place in the Davos hierarchy.
For critics, “Davos man” is shorthand for the globe-trotting elite, disconnected from their home countries after spending too much time in the club-class lounge. Others just wonder if it is all a big waste of time.Who is there?
More than 2,500 people – business leaders, world leaders, diplomats and the odd celebrity, such as Matt Damon – will fly in for the 49th annual Davos meeting. Most delegates are men, and although the forum boasts delegates from more than 100 countries, most hail from western Europe, followed by the US. Sir David Attenborough is one of the most notable attendees in 2019, while Donald Trump, Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron all pulled out at short notice to focus on more pressing issues at home.
“We’re now so numerous, so powerful, so all-pervasive, the mechanisms we have for destruction are so wholesale and so frightening, that we can actually exterminate whole ecosystems without even noticing it. We have to now be really aware of the dangers of what we’re doing, and we already know that of course the plastic problem in the seas is wreaking appalling damage upon marine life, the extent of which we don’t yet fully know.”
He stressed that the natural world “is not just a matter of beauty, interest and wonder” but a coherent ecosystem on which we depend for “every breath we take, every mouthful of food we take.” A healthy planet, Attenborough added, is an essential part of human life.
“If we don’t recognise the kind of connections I’ve been describing, then the whole planet comes in hazard, and we are destroying the natural world and with it ourselves.”
William pressed Attenborough for a key message for the politicians and business leaders gathered in Davos this week.
“Care for the natural world. Not only care for the natural world but treat it with a degree of respect and reverence,” Attenborough said, adding that there was a worrying tendency to waste resources.
“The thing that I really care for in our ordinary daily lives is not to waste the riches of the natural world on which we depend. And it’s not just energy ,which of course is very important, but it’s also dealing with the natural world with a degree of respect. Not to throw away food, not to throw away power – just care for the natural world of which you’re an essential part.”
The Duke of Cambridge started and ended the session by congratulating Attenborough for winning the Crystal award, which recognises individuals who have helped make the world a better place, at the World Economic Forum on Monday night. William added it was a “personal treat” to be asking Attenborough questions, and quipped that it was a good change of pace from being the subject of interviews himself.
Asking why global leaders have taken so long to react to climate change, William said: ““Why do you think world leaders and those in key positions of leadership; why do think they’ve taken so long … there have been quite a few faltering steps to act on environmental challenges?”
Comparisons were also drawn between the broadcaster’s burgeoning BBC career in the 1950s, compared with his latest project that sees him team up with Netflix and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) for an upcoming series called “Our Planet” to be released on the online TV streaming site.
Attenborough said his early work in the mid-1950s involved himself, one camera and one cameraman, and it was relatively “easy” to impress Britons simply by televising an armadillo. Now the systems are “unbelievable”, taking viewers to the sky and depths of the ocean in ways that 50 years ago, “people couldn’t imagine”.
Prince William noted Attenborough’s late shift to environmental activism, noting that for many years the presenter “held back from speaking publicly about environmental issues”.
Attenborough said that at the start of his career, it was nearly inconceivable that the environment would be in such a state of crisis and even pockets of animal extinction seemed like the exception rather than the norm.
“To be truthful I don’t think there was anyone in the mid-50s who thought there was a danger that we would annihilate parts of the natural world. There were animals that were in danger, that’s true and there were animals that we could see if we didn’t do something they were going to become extinct.
“And the notion that human beings might exterminate a whole species … you just hadn’t thought about it,” he said.
“Now of course we’re only too well aware that the whole of the natural world is at our disposal, as it were. We can do things accidentally that exterminate a whole area of the natural world and species that live within it.”

A total of 72% of polled Americans now say global warming is personally important to them, according to the Yale program on climate change communication. This is the highest level of concern since Yale starting polling the question in 2008.
Overall, 73% of Americans accept that global warming is happening, outnumbering those who don’t by five to one. This acceptance has strengthened in recent years, rising by 10% since March 2015. The proportion that grasps that humans are the primary cause of warming is smaller, with 62% understanding this to be the case.
About two-thirds of Americans believe that global warming is influencing the weather, in the wake of a string of deadly extreme events in the US. About half say the disastrous wildfires in California and Hurricanes Florence and Michael, which flattened parts of North Carolina and Florida, were worsened because of rising global temperatures.
“Global warming used to be viewed as a problem distant in time and space,” said report co-lead researcher Ed Maibach, a climate change and public health communications expert at George Mason University.
“But Americans increasingly understand that global warming is here and now and are growing concerned about the threat to themselves, their communities and the nation.”
The Yale polling, which was conducted in November and December, is backed by findings from separate new research by the University of Chicago and the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.
That poll found similarly wide acceptance that climate change is happening, among seven in 10 Americans. A stark political divide on the science still exists, however: while 86% of Democrats say climate change is happening, just 52% of Republicans concur.
Climate change has become an increasingly animating cause for progressive Democrats, with campaigning by emerging grassroots groups and figures such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the newly elected congresswoman from New York, pushing for a “Green New Deal”.
While this concept has yet to be fully fleshed out, its broad goal of transitioning to 100% renewable energy has energized younger activists and has gained a foothold among established Democrats.
The sense of urgency has been highlighted by a series of sobering reports released by scientists over the past year. A landmark United Nations report from last year warned that the world has little more than a decade to limit catastrophic climate change, which will involve millions of people displaced by sea level rise or subjected to deadly heatwaves, as well as the loss of almost all of the planet’s coral reefs.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/22/climate-change-concern-americans-poll

Scientific facts are not ""alleged facts"" as they are based on the proof of existence provided by evidence. The high probability that Brisbane's maximum temperature will be in the range of 30 to 31 degrees is not a statement of ignorance but instead is based on a knowledge of how weather systems work. The probability describes both what we know and what we don't know. In most scientific papers the source of this uncertainty or what we don't know is discussed and in so doing provides a guide to future experimental investigations. The first step to coming to know something is to realise you don't know it.

The experiment of a 40% increase in CO2 has been performed and the result has be a 1 degree C increase in global climate temperature. This result fits within the expected 0.88 to 1.36 degrees C with a central tendency of 1.12 degrees C expected from an ECS of 2.2 to 3.4 degrees C with a central tendency of 2.8 degrees. So this experiment did not falsify the ECS with a central tendency of 2.8 degrees C but in fact produced a result close to the central tendency. As the Earth's climate system is unlikely to have yet reached equilibrium for a 40% increase in atmospheric CO2 the slightly lower value is to be expected.

That's not a reasonable answer since it elevates all scientific knowledge - even the most sketchy kind - to status of being as secure as knowledge can be (a fact).
It's an ultra-naive epistemology.
Also you seem to be confusing facts with facts about alleged facts. It's certainly true that it's a fact that probability X asserts Y, but the probability itself does not assert a fact more a statement of ignorance according to say Popper; it asserts what we don't know, it's a proposition containing doubt.

The 2.2 - 3.4 degree ECS with a central tendency is a measure of the response of the Earth's climate system to an increase in atmospheric CO2 of 100%. The same principle applies fractionally to a 40% increase in atmospheric CO2 which would be expected to produce a a temperature rise of 0.88 to 1.36 degrees C with a central tendency of 1.12 degrees.
The experiment of a 40% increase in CO2 has been performed and the result has be a 1 degree C increase in global climate temperature. This result fits within the expected 0.88 to 1.36 degrees C with a central tendency of 1.12 degrees C expected from an ECS of 2.2 to 3.4 degrees C with a central tendency of 2.8 degrees. So this experiment did not falsify the ECS with a central tendency of 2.8 degrees C but in fact produced a result close to the central tendency. As the Earth's climate system is unlikely to have yet reached equilibrium for a 40% increase in atmospheric CO2 the slightly lower value is to be expected.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1548421770000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'12483673', u'in_reply_to': u'125075883', u'id': u'125083119', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Walsunda', u'text': u'""According to what epistemology does an inference, an estimate or a probability have the status of being a fact.""
A fact is a thing that is known or proved to be true. In science we know things to be true based on observations of which measurements are a subset - these provide the evidence that something exists and what size it is.
An inference is a conclusion based on evidence and reasoning. Scientific facts are based on evidence and reasoning. So scientific facts can be inferences.
An estimate is an approximate calculation. Calculation of Earth's ECS to CO2 based on observations and measurement produces an approximate result with a central tendency of 2.8 degrees C and a 'likely' range of 2.2 to 3.4 degrees C. That estimate is a fact.
A probability is the extent to which something is likely to happen or be the case. The likely probability is that the ECS discussed above is between 2.2 and 3.4 degrees C with the highest likelihood occurring occurring near the central tendency of 2.8 degrees C. Probabilities things that are known and can be proved to be true based on evidence, observation and measurements and are therefore also facts.
""That is to say the status of the most secure form of knowledge about the natural world we have"".
The most secure form of knowledge about the natural world is scientific knowledge which involves conclusions based on evidence and reasoning (inferences), approximate calculations (estimates) and descriptions of the likelihood that something is likely to happen or be the case (probabilities) - all of which are facts.
By examining the synoptic weather data over my continent meteorologists can infer that the temperature in my city will reach 31 degrees C on a day which is partly cloudy. This is an approximate result or estimate. Depending on whether there is more or less cloud the maximum temperature may be plus or minus a degree. The probability that the maximum temperature tomorrow will be between 30 and 32 degrees is very high particularly when the blocking high is taken into consideration.

Were it not for the moon (and by extension the tide) it is unlikely that humans or human civilization could have evolved. Because the moon does an amazing job in stabilizing the climate of our planet. (The physics is a bit complex, but in effect, our moon stop Earth from doing as our sister-planet Mars does - radically tilting its axes because of lack of a tidally locked big mass in orbit). 
That our distant moon has such a twice a day effect on sea-level is also a worry - because much closer we know that the ice-sheets of Greenland and Antarctica does not only lock up more than 60 meters of sea-level - they also pull sea-level towards them because of their gravitational effects. 
So - if Greenland start to melt first - it will first introduce more water to the ocean - but it will also have reduced mass that performs gravitational pull water towards it. So the effect of that extra water will be biggest in the tropics and in the southern hemisphere. When Antarctica melt - the opposite happens - it will introduce water to the ocean - but also have reduced pulling-effect on the water that already is in the ocean - so making the effect larger in the tropics and in the northern hemisphere. 
If we get back to the effect on the moon - some places the effect of tides are measured in tens of meters - other places hardly noticable. It is all fine. But because of physics - same effects are in operation when ice melts - the stuff that cause trend on top of variability. 
(Importantly, our dear Luna and the tides also have a trend when we discuss geological time scales - just like the influence of the Sun also has a trend over long time-scales - and even more importantly - climate science takes potential reasons of climate trend so seriously that climate science still take the 18.6 year lunar cycle into account as part of reality (although not as crazy as some blogger who heard about it in 1970 still does to ""prove"" that Co2 is radiative neutral/just gas of life).

The re-insurance companies (the global companies that insure (spread liability) our insurance companies) are as we write here discussing what they do not want to insure even in the best regulated nations on the planet as they look at trends. 
Insurance companies never promised to insure a ""space"" for eternity. They insure a place with 1:500 or 1:2000 risk. 
This means that everyone who built their house on a lot with an estimated risk of a flood, wildfire, saltwater intrusion, hurricane (etc) that now is seeing lowering of reoccurrence intervals should start to worry very fast. Because when your property/value no longer is worthy of insurance - it means that the lot one own suddenly drop to zero. 
For most people - we can afford to move if we get an OK price for our current place. But the moment insurance no longer will cover for a risk that grows too large - most of us are left with a perfect zero. Or even worse - because we may have a mortgage on our home. And the banks have no obligation to pity for us. They just see that the safety on the loan was reduced to zero. And they will do that even with a fair warning of decades of time. 
These are people who will be given two choices - to sit on the property and pray (and die there) - or to move and be very very angry because their entire fortune (perhaps made over generations) has been reduced to zero and for being forced to live as tramps with perhaps generations of value being given over to the ""Anthropocene"". It will not be the rich that can afford a house going to zero value that will get this message first. 
This is an expected reality that will make the sub-prime issue feel like the kindest summer breeze. Because even when the banks close the mortgage and leave people with nothing in deep depth - even the banks will see the money as lost. Including the money lost at them oil-refining terminals, handily located near sea-level to allow oil-tankers to arrive must start moving. 
So a lot of big money lost from big economy - and a lost of small money gone leaving honest hard working people with way less than nothing. 
Whenever I think about this fact I can not help myself but to think about Forest Gump. Investing in the fine self-owned industry of a prawn-boat from Bubbas advice. How many such family companies exists? The harbor is lost. Maybe them with boat can find a new harbor. But then the terminal is gone. And the school for the kids is gone. And the bus route is gone. And the doctor is gone. And we can hope they all just rented. 
For those who care for a family farm as first of fifth generation - what land is available for them for the price of zero dollars?

Yes - it always was pissing pants to keep warm in the arctic. Because if we had started reduction and increased efficiency back in the 80s - we would be in a much better place now. 
USA has started to move some local communities out of harms way. The cost per person is measured in 100s of thousands of dollars. If you want that approach you better love to pay taxes. Relocation and even controlling measurements add up to billions for the tiniest thing that must be done on local scales - long before we start to think about doing that for an entire planet. 
In fact - you are arguing that one should spent hundreds of trillions of tax money to fix a problem that the Earth never provided us with - just so we can power our cars with petrol and heat our houses with coal. Both that are quite expensive and inefficient 19th century ideas in the first place. 
PS - to relocate food production may sound easy - but it so happens that vegetation respond to other things than mean annual temperature. They respond to seasonal amplitude of temperature - how precipitation is distributed over the year - how cold it gets, what soil there is, how much sun is available during summer and winter - during day and night. Many things. 
Now we can probably invent GMO solutions for that - but again - that costs a lot of money because Monsanto and other will of course claim a healthy profit that will trickle down to you. And it does bring about some other worries - for example for them bees and the vegetation that exists on the planet not used for commercial food production. 
Even when it comes to limits to living-areas above sea-level things are complex. Because floodings are mostly caused by increase in rain and run-off from above. Remember, sea level will never reach its potential maximum of ca 200 ft above present. Not even in 10,000 years. And when you think about it - how happy would you be high and ""safe"" up in the hills of Hollywood or southern Europe when those explosive forest-fires sprint down the hill from above? 
The problem with the engineering solution is that once one have come up with a solution for sea-level, rain, storms and wind, drought and fire (etc) there is that other thing that one must consider. 
The Chinese tested weather modification over their ""bread-basket"" areas some decades ago. Triggering rainfall where it mattered most - as a good solution. 
The problem was that they discovered rapid desertification and stuff down-stream - because already boundary level moisture.levels was artificially reduced upstream. 
To understand how serious ""climate regulation"" is - I suggest to read up on the very complex and sensitive deals that define the regulation of the big multi-national rivers of the Nile and Eufrat etc. Including how much one can spend on irrigation upstream. 
Even Span struggle with this, because rerouting of water to make nice green lawns and golf resorts and swimming pools in the touristy southern Spain has several times ended up with Catalonia needing to import freshwater. And the Catalan is always discussing becoming own nation. 
Even in the US this is an issue when it comes to regulation, when the Colorado River simply is empty before it reach the coast.

Overall, human manipulations of land hydrology withhold a volume of water of 328±162 km3/yr -- equivalent to 0.9±0.5 mm/yr -- from the sea. This net increase in terrestrial water storage represents a nearly 1% annual reduction of runoff to the ocean, but around 9% of the yearly volume of freshwater used by people (3760 km3/yr)

We are at risk of pushing our climate system toward abrupt, unpredictable, and potentially irreversible changes with highly damaging impacts. Earth’s climate is on a path to warm beyond the range of what has been experienced over the past millions of years.[ii] 
The range of uncertainty for the warming along the current emissions path is wide enough to encompass massively disruptive consequences to societies and ecosystems: as global temperatures rise, there is a real risk, however small, that one or more critical parts of the Earth’s climate system will experience abrupt, unpredictable and potentially irreversible changes. 
Disturbingly, scientists do not know how much warming is required to trigger such changes to the climate system.

If you look at things like the rate of loss of sea ice, shrinking glaciers and ice sheets, and changes to the permafrost region, the northern polar jet stream and deep ocean circulation, it could be argued we are seeing the beginning of such changes now, long before feeling the full effects of a rise in temperature of just 1 degree C, due to lags in the system.

Where did I talk about the equilibrium climate sensitivity of this planet, that is the eventual temperature rise resulting from a doubling of atmospheric CO2, being a fact? You're the one doing that.
Epistemology is the theory of knowledge, especially with regard to it methods, validity and scope, and the distinction between justified belief and opinion. Scientific knowledge is based on observation through experimentation which encompasses both direct and indirect measurement.
Living in the humid subtropics I find that some of the nearly 50 year old eucalypt wood steps in the front of our high set house have rotted at the edges causing them to slip from the risers. Using a steel tape I directly measured the old step at 833 mm in length, got a replacement cut at my local hardware store and knocked in the new step with my old fossil collecting dumpy hammer.
Not all measures of reality in science are direct. Satellite temperature measures of the upper troposphere are one such example being derived from a range of measures of different atmospheric properties. Measures of equilibrium climate sensitivity to the greenhouse gas CO2 are also indirect measures being derived from measures of atmospheric CO2, global climate temperatures and the pattern of interaction of the ocean/atmosphere global climate system.
 Scientific knowledge is based on observations of reality which includes both direct and indirect measurements. I know that my front steps exist because I have observed them and tested their strength with my weight many times over the last 15 years. I know that the fungal wood-rot exists because I have observed it. I know the length of the step because I have measured it.
I know that the temperature now in Brisbane is 29 degrees C because I have access to a reliable measure. We can similarly gain access to reliable measures of global climate temperature and global atmospheric CO2 levels and use those somewhat more direct measures, in conjunction with our observation and measurement based knowledge of how the oceans and atmosphere interact, to produce a measure of equilibrium climate sensitivity for Earth in response to atmospheric levels of the greenhouse gas CO2.
You have talked about facts. What are facts? Facts are what we can observe about the world and universe around us. It's a fact that my front steps exist because I can observe and measure them. It's a fact that the temperature in my city now is 29 degrees C because I have access to a reliable measure. It's a fact that global climate temperatures have increased because we have access to reliable measures of them. It's a fact that atmospheric CO2 concentrations have increased because we have access to reliable measures of them.

I can change temperature from 260 to 290. This sounds like not a big effect. But it is the same as changing mean annual temperature for Greenland from current conditions to the mean conditions of the French Riviera (approximately). That I gave numbers in Kelvin does not contradict that for the ice or anything alive on Greenland, such a ""small"" change could have some shocking effects. 
Look at UK. The islands have an annual temperature cycle of only 12 degrees. 
It is fair to say that the UK is radically different as it shift from 280 to 292 K as in one state one risk snow and sleet and storms and in the other mean state one risk heatwaves and drought and all sorts of stuff - while having space enough for the 2 seasons of spring and fall to fit in as well. 
Even the seasons of England does not really behave very linear to a change of one degree. Good bathing temperatures for example lag by more than a month. And how you are going to plot flowering on a mean change of a degree is beyond me - because England has heated up by just about a degree and flowers and bees and birds and stuff is already getting confused. 
When you go from 1 degree to 2 degree you do more than step effect up by one. 
A diver will understand this. When you move from 10 to 20 to 30 depth in your dive - it is more than a linear increase of use of air and time spent getting rid of nitrogen on the way back up. One must calculate time spent at different depths and even consider if one has been flying recently and if one has dived before recently. 30 is more than a third more than 20. 
For a British -minus one degree is not twice has hard as 15 degrees. That would be 7 degrees if you like to make Celsius your linear scale. Minus two would make reality worse than a black hole - because you would live in negative energy by existing in minus two. 
I hope I have clarified that a 1 degree change in anomaly from the zero of normal is not a linear scale. And that it should not be thought of as ""percentage"". We humans will still go to work with a fever of just 311 Kelvin. But we will be in hospital at 313. Even though the change is just 2. We will also be in hospital at 308. Because of hyptothermia. 
Fever and hypothermia sounds a lot more impressive when we use C and F scales compared with Kelvin. If we used Kelvin we would say ""do not be a sissy - you are just off by 2 from mean of 311. Typical man-flu. Making a fuss about being just two away from a number well above 300. Being off mean way below a percent as measured in Kelvin. 
A local sea level change of 1 mm per year from a 20th century that had a median half degree warming over the observation record in question does not indicate that you should expect that sea-level will just be 8 mm per year with additional 2 degrees of median warming in the 21st century as global mean forcing.

You may of course think that a 1-degree global warming scale linearly to a 3 degree warming. But I am afraid that I must disagree with you on that. 
Here is a hint - if temperature scale linearly to effect you would feel half bad only if your body-temperature is doubled from your normal 37 degrees. While a doctor would be worried for your life if your body temperature increase with only 3 degrees. 
It would also mean that ice would remain ""half-frozen"" once you ""double the temperature from minus 18 to +18 degrees (in trying to illustrate that it is kind of silly to talk about ""doubling of temperature"" on a Celsius or Farenheith temperature scale. 
Water, for example behaves very different at minus one and plus one C. Is that a doubling of Kelvin - or is it just an addition of 2 K? 
Similarly, we can easily sit in air that is 30 degrees C. We can also bath in water that is 30 degrees hot. 
What would you rather do next - to sit in a sauna at 100 C or sit in boiling that is 100 C?
Do you now understand that you can not scale effect of 1 degree during the last century warming to another 2 degrees change this century as a linear solution? 
Because if you do not get this - I will start to bath you in 15 degree water - that you may find a bit chilly. And ""double"" it to 30 degrees.

This paper reports on sea-level changes at the Changjiang river mouth since the early 1920's, with a special emphasis on recent local tectonic movement, ground subsidence, and river discharge. Historical studies and mathematical correlations are used to examine the establishment and historical changes of tidal gauges and related bench markers as well as to establish the reliability of tidal records. In the past, some Chinese scientists proposed that sea-level has declined since 1950 while other foreign scientists attributed sea-level rise in the East China Sea to crustal and isostatic sinking. This study concludes that sea-level is rising at a rate about 1.0 mm a year, which is comparable to that of global sea- level rise. Meanwhile, it is found that the increase of the annual mean high tide level is remarkably greater, reflecting the estuarine morphological and hydro-dynamic effect on sea-level rise. The evidence suggests that the component of tectonic sinking accounts for only Vs or less of the relative sea level (RSL) rise. In contrast to the viewpoint of sea-level declining since 1950, this study shows a rising trend from 1951 to 1987, which is a continuation of sea-level rise since the beginning of this century.

Believers are those who have a belief which is an acceptance that something exists or is true, especially one without proof. In science the proof of the existence of something lies in the evidence of its existence. Anthropogenic global warming is a physical phenomenon, of which there is ample evidence as to its existence. I can't see how believers and their beliefs can be applied to anthropogenic global warming.
Deniers are people who deny something, especially those who refuse to admit the truth of a proposition that is supported by the majority of scientific and historical evidence. Anthropogenic global warming deniers refuse to admit the truth of the existence of such warming and/or its cause and consequences and how that warming can be managed.
""fantasists and skeptics"".
Fantasists are people who imagine or dream about something which is desired. Few people desire global warming with the possible exception of some deniers who live in cold climates and misunderstand the consequences of global warming's effect on weather patterns.
Skeptics is the American spelling for the English word sceptics. A sceptic is a person who doubts the truth of an idea or belief. As explained above science does not deal in belief but instead deals in ideas about what exists based on the gathering of evidence by experimental means. Scientists will investigate their doubts concerning an idea about the existence of something by means of an experiment. Scientists doubt until that have sufficient evidence. They are sceptics of the real world. 
Deniers persist with their beliefs in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary.

I can't find the words 'horror' or 'doom' in the article above, though I can find them in your post.
However, global warming is causing an increase in extreme weather events such as extreme precipitation events with associated flask flooding as occurred seven years ago in the upstream reaches of the river system that flows through my city. Certainly for those who successfully fled that flash flood but saw love-ones perish , and for those who were not successful in that endeavor and met their doom, the words 'horror' and 'doom' were most certainly not absurd.

Concerns surrounding the risk of melting ice causing sea levels to rise were previously focused mainly on large glaciers. But scientists have discovered that the largest recent losses from Greenland’s vast ice sheet, which is two miles thick in places, have occurred in the island’s largely glacier-free south-west. Combined with recent analysis of retreating Antarctic glaciers that were previously thought to be stable, this new research makes unnerving reading. This is because of what it tells us about the extent of likely sea level rises, and warming seas linked to coral die-off and chaotic weather, but also because it highlights the difficulty of fully understanding the climate system.
Last year the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change urged governments to work towards the most ambitious targets in the 2015 Paris agreement, and a global temperature rise not greater than 1.5C. Many experts fear that factors including the election of Donald Trump in the US and Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil mean that even the more modest goal of sticking to current commitments, putting the world on course for a 3C rise, remains a huge challenge. Currently, global carbon emissions are still rising. But if people all over the world are getting used to the idea that higher temperatures and increased frequency of extreme weather events are the new normal – recent polling in the US suggests 72% of Americans believe global warming is important, the highest-ever figure – we are arguably less advanced in our understanding of warming oceans.
The sea level rises that scientists expect to accompany a temperature rise of 3C would submerge cities including Shanghai, Osaka and Miami along with parts of Rio de Janeiro and Alexandria – less than a century from now. Among nations, Bangladesh will be particularly severely affected, with one estimate suggesting that 250,000 people are already forced to move each year, making them environmental refugees. Such facts on the ground, as well as predictions, are why climate activists have long linked their cause to wider concerns around social justice. Just as carbon emissions must be limited to protect the livelihoods of people already struggling in areas vulnerable to drought and desertification, sea level rises must be restricted to protect the millions of people who live on coasts and in low-lying areas. The movement of peoples around the world, including but not limited to refugees, is in some cases a direct consequence of changes to the environment.
Weather and climate systems are complex, and sea levels are hard to predict confidently. Already, ice sheets and glaciers are surprising scientists by behaving in unexpected ways. But while trying to limit future emissions remains the most pressing task, these ominous findings highlight the need to address the consequences of carbon already emitted. Sea level rises will continue long after emissions have peaked. We will have to adapt to our world’s changing shape.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/22/the-guardian-view-on-rising-sea-levels-a-warning-from-greenland

That so-called unpaid sentry is now literally melting away, opening up shipping lanes and geo-security challenges, said delegates at the Arctic Frontiers conference, the polar circle’s biggest talking shop, who debated a series of recent escalations.
Russia is reopening and strengthening cold war bases on the Kola peninsula in the far north-west of the country. Norway is beefing up its military presence in the high Arctic.
Last October, Nato staged Trident Juncture with 40,000 troops, its biggest military exercise in Norway in more than a decade. A month earlier Britain announced a new “Defence Arctic Strategy” and promised a 10-year deployment of 800 commandos to Norway and four RAF Typhoons to patrol Icelandic skies. The US is also sending hundreds more marines to the region on long-term rotations and has threatened to send naval vessels through Arctic shipping lanes for the first time.
While these strategic moves have echoes of the cold war, the modest buildup falls far short of that era, and there remains a strong spirit of cooperation in many areas. The current tensions are a result of a world warmed by industrial emissions. The Arctic is heating up twice as fast as the rest of the planet, shrinking sea ice and exposing more water and territory to exploitation and access.
“Right now, the reasons we are seeing more military activity is that countries are worried by the spectre of open water,” one of the speakers, Klaus Dodds, a professor of geopolitics at Royal Holloway, University of London, told the Guardian. “The unique Arctic security architecture has shape and form that come from natural extremities. If the Arctic becomes just another ocean, this breaks down. It’s elemental.”
The Arctic’s unique characteristics are under attack from all sides. Below, the once-frozen ocean is now mixed with warmer, more saline Atlantic waters. In the skies above, the polar vortex above is weakening, allowing intrusions of balmy air currents from the south.
Sea ice is being lost at a rate of more than 10,000 tonnes per second, according to Tore Furevik, a professor at the Geophysical Institute at the University of Bergen. “We’re heading for a new and uncertain Arctic with ramifications for nature and politics,” he said. “We should strive to be less suspicious, less hostile and more open-minded if we are to deal with a problem that we have so recklessly created.”
By 2035, the Arctic is forecast to be free of ice during summer, which will allow ships to sail across the north pole.
Business interest is growing. For the first time, last summer, a Maersk container ship navigated the northern sea route from Asia to Europe carrying fish and electronic goods. Energy companies are exploring new oil and gas fields.
Once remote regions are becoming geopolitical hotspots. Tromsø, in Norway, which hosted the conference, was once a tiny trading post. Today, it’s a tourism hub and a gateway to the mineral-rich north. “Now we have a historically strange situation with political and economic activity in the Arctic. So many people are knocking on our door, including business and state representatives from China, Pakistan, Singapore and Morocco,” the mayor, Kristin Røymo, told the Guardian. “There is also a very obvious increased naval presence.”
This concerns many conference participants, who highlight the peaceful history of cross-border cooperation in the far north. Even during the cold war, there were agreements on fishing, scientific research and reindeer herding that continue today.
Norwegian politicians were at pains to downplay the significance of the current military buildup. “There is no direct link between climate change and conflict,” the former defence minister Espen Barth Eide said. “It’s not because there is an immediate threat, it’s that, as an area becomes more important, it’s natural to have a heightened military presence.”
He compared the situation to the South China Sea, where China, the US and other nations compete, not by firing weapons, but by demonstrating capacity and presence. “To some extent that is happening now in the Arctic,” he said, although he stressed there were no territorial disputes to inflame passions.
The build-up is portrayed almost as a form of climate adaptation – strengthening the military presence along with infrastructure affected by melting permafrost.
However, there are tensions. In a keynote speech, the Norwegian foreign minister, Ine Marie Eriksen Søreide, complained about communications interference by Russia in the far north. She plans to arrange a meeting with the Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, to discuss the allegation. “Most important is to open political dialogue and talk not just about what we agree on but what we do not agree on,” she said.
Norway is also contributing to the climate problem and the strategic tensions. It has just approved a raft of new oil exploration licenses in the Barents Sea and one of its citizens has been caught spying in Russia.
Russia is uneasy about recent Nato exercises that have pushed deep into the north, according to Teimuraz Ramishvili, the ambassador to Norway. He told the Guardian the military modernisation on the Russian side was overdue after 20 years of neglect and its significance should not be overstated.
“In Europe, you have military installations that are used for peaceful purposes. Why it that OK in Europe, but not in Russia?” he asked. He said Moscow put a high priority on the northern region, where the potential was so great that some talk enthusiastically of an “Arctic age”.
“For us, this is a matter of sustainable development of Russian territory. This is not open water, it is Russian territory,” said Ramishvili. “The Arctic isn’t a nature resort. It’s a place where Russians have lived for a long time.”
Currently, cargo companies that use the northern shipping lanes need to pay Russia. But this will change as the sea ice recedes and Arctic routes open up in international waters. China, which has declared itself a “near-Arctic nation”, is among the countries exploring this area. Last year, it launched a second Snow Dragon ice breaker and released an Arctic white paper that explored the potential for infrastructure investments in a Polar Silk Road.
The US, by comparison, is lagging behind. Although its nuclear submarines have operated under the ice for decades, its surface navy is ill-equipped for the Arctic. “Everyone’s up there but us,” the navy secretary, Richard Spencer, complained last month.
“The threat is back on. This is an area … we need to focus on,” he said. Spencer has called for a strategic Arctic port in Alaska and US naval vessels to conduct navigation operations later this year in northern shipping lanes so they have the capacity to conduct emergency operations if necessary. “Can you imagine a Carnival line cruise ship having a problem, and the Russians do the search and do the extraction?” he said.
The prospect of a US warship sailing near Russia’s vast northern border would certainly amplify unease, as well as highlighting the geopolitical challenges caused by global heating.
Lisa Murkowski, a US senator for Alaska, did not expect the US navy to enter Russian waters, but, considering everything else that is going on, she said any freedom of navigation mission in the region would raise sensitivity.
“It’s important for the US to project military strength, but there should be no intention to be unduly provocative,” she told the conference. The problem, she said, was that the White House had not updated its strategy to deal with a fast-changing region. “Under this administration, we are not assigning a significant priority to our role as an Arctic nation. There is a void,” she said.
Environmentalists at the conference highlighted the dual role of oil in worsening the tension: both as a driver of climate change and of the push for more resource extraction from the still largely pristine Arctic. Norway came under fire for approving 83 new exploration licenses last week, more than a dozen of which were in the Barents Sea.
“The false narrative of this conference is that Arctic countries are doing sustainable development,” said Martin Sommerkorn, head of conservation of the WWF Arctic Programme. “You can’t say that just days after you grant 83 new licenses.

Energy minister Lily D’Ambrosio told 3AW radio on Friday morning that she “can’t rule out brown-outs” with three generators across the Yallourn and Loy Yang A power stations out of action, meaning the state is down more than 1000MW of power generation capacity.
“We have aging coal-fired power stations,” D’Ambrosio said. “They are becoming less reliable.”
Between 5,000 and 10,000 homes lost power for a few hours overnight, but those faults have been attributed to localised issues.
The Alcoa aluminium smelter at Portland in western Victoria also reduced production for an hour on Thursday night to reduce demand, and South Australia — which experienced a record breaking heatwave on Thursday including a high of 46.6C in Adelaide — switched on emergency diesel generators for the first time.
However the Australian Energy Market Operator said it was not expecting blackouts on Friday.
Temperatures in Melbourne reached 35C by 8am on Friday, and hovered around 30C overnight.
Bureau of Meteorology duty forecaster Chris Godfred said the sweltering night would have set records for high minimum overnight temperatures, but for a slightly cooler morning on Thursday.
BoM records are taken in 24-hour intervals from 9am to 9am, and in some places — such as Shepparton in northeast Victoria, which was 27.8C at 9am on Thursday but did not dip below 29.1C overnight — that meant minimum temperature records remained intact.
According to the Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO, Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910, and temperatures will increase in the future.
So how will climate change affect future heatwaves in Australia?
The CSIRO and BoM have compiled different models for predicting the outcome of climate change in Australia to produce a guide to how different regions will likely be affected.
They found that every part of Australia will continue to experience increases in average temperature, and will have a higher frequency of hot days.
The duration of hot spells will increase in every region. In many areas in the northern half of Australia, the average number of days above 35C could increase by two to three times.
Late in the century, towns such as Darwin, Alice Springs and Broome  may experience days with temperatures above 35C for about a third of the year.
These higher temperatures will also result in higher evaporation, which will continue to make drought conditions worse.
Melbourne was forecast to reach 44C by mid-afternoon, approaching the all-time hottest day of 46.4C on 7 February 2009, when Australia’s deadliest bushfires killed 173 people, burned through 450,000 hectares and destroyed more than 2,000 homes.
A cool change was expected to bring relief by 4pm but gusty north and north-westerly winds were predicted to sweep across the western districts of the state, with a chance of dry lightning, before hitting the capital city in the afternoon.
The combination, coming after months of drought in northern areas, has created a very high fire risk.
Firefighters in Victoria and Tasmania are on high alert and have warned campers and bushwalkers to rethink their plans to head out early for the long weekend. Large swaths of the Tasmanian wilderness are already burning.
Victorian emergency management commissioner Andrew Crisp told ABC News Breakfast he had 500 firefighters in control centres across the state and 60 aircraft on standby.
“We are ready,” he said. “What I keep saying is are you, as the community of Victoria, ready? Have you downloaded your Vic Emergency app? Do you know who the emergency broadcaster is? Because if you’re travelling around and you’re enjoying the last of the holidays, you need to be able to access good information to make good decisions.”
Crisp urged people to be sensible in the heat and said that since December emergency services had received more than 300 callouts for people or animals who had been left in hot cars — averaging about 10 a day on really hot days.
There is a total fire ban in both states. The fire danger for parts of south-east Tasmania, around Hobart, has been set at severe.
The fire danger rating for the Mallee and Northern Country districts of Victoria is extreme on Friday, with a severe rating for the Wimmera, South West, Central and Western and Southern Gippsland areas.
Heatwaves and prolonged drought have caused mass fish kills in western NSW as well as mass deaths of feral camels and horses in central Australia, renewing already loud calls for Australia to take serious action on climate change.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/25/melbourne-heatwave-city-expecting-44c-as-victoria-faces-hottest-day-since-black-saturday

I am here to say, our house is on fire.
According to the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), we are less than 12 years away from not being able to undo our mistakes. In that time, unprecedented changes in all aspects of society need to have taken place, including a reduction of our CO2 emissions by at least 50%.
And please note that those numbers do not include the aspect of equity, which is absolutely necessary to make the Paris agreement work on a global scale. Nor does it include tipping points or feedback loops like the extremely powerful methane gas released from the thawing Arctic permafrost.
At places like Davos, people like to tell success stories. But their financial success has come with an unthinkable price tag. And on climate change, we have to acknowledge we have failed. All political movements in their present form have done so, and the media has failed to create broad public awareness.
But Homo sapiens have not yet failed. Yes, we are failing, but there is still time to turn everything around. We can still fix this. We still have everything in our own hands. But unless we recognise the overall failures of our current systems, we most probably don’t stand a chance.
We are facing a disaster of unspoken sufferings for enormous amounts of people. And now is not the time for speaking politely or focusing on what we can or cannot say. Now is the time to speak clearly.
Solving the climate crisis is the greatest and most complex challenge that Homo sapiens have ever faced. The main solution, however, is so simple that even a small child can understand it. We have to stop our emissions of greenhouse gases.
Either we do that or we don’t.
You say nothing in life is black or white. But that is a lie. A very dangerous lie. Either we prevent 1.5C of warming or we don’t. Either we avoid setting off that irreversible chain reaction beyond human control or we don’t.
Either we choose to go on as a civilisation or we don’t. That is as black or white as it gets. There are no grey areas when it comes to survival.
We all have a choice. We can create transformational action that will safeguard the living conditions for future generations. Or we can continue with our business as usual and fail.
That is up to you and me.
Some say we should not engage in activism. Instead we should leave everything to our politicians and just vote for a change instead. But what do we do when there is no political will? What do we do when the politics needed are nowhere in sight?
Here in Davos – just like everywhere else – everyone is talking about money. It seems money and growth are our only main concerns.
And since the climate crisis has never once been treated as a crisis, people are simply not aware of the full consequences on our everyday life. People are not aware that there is such a thing as a carbon budget, and just how incredibly small that remaining carbon budget is. That needs to change today.
No other current challenge can match the importance of establishing a wide, public awareness and understanding of our rapidly disappearing carbon budget, that should and must become our new global currency and the very heart of our future and present economics.
We are at a time in history where everyone with any insight of the climate crisis that threatens our civilisation – and the entire biosphere – must speak out in clear language, no matter how uncomfortable and unprofitable that may be.
We must change almost everything in our current societies. The bigger your carbon footprint, the bigger your moral duty. The bigger your platform, the bigger your responsibility.
Adults keep saying: “We owe it to the young people to give them hope.” But I don’t want your hope. I don’t want you to be hopeful. I want you to panic. I want you to feel the fear I feel every day. And then I want you to act.
I want you to act as you would in a crisis. I want you to act as if our house is on fire. Because it is.

People seem to think that producing animals for food and the waste involved contributes to climate change primarily but they forget how much waste from food overall contributes to climate change-especially vegetable waste. No on ever wants to really look at the flip side of this because it's doesn't juice up the blog hit numbers.
-Vegetarian and 'healthy' diets are more harmful to the environmenteating a vegetarian diet could contribute to climate change.
In fact, according to new research from Carnegie Mellon University, following the USDA recommendations to consume more fruits, vegetables, dairy and seafood is more harmful to the environment because those foods have relatively high resource uses and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per calorie. Published in Environment Systems and Decisions, the study measured the changes in energy use, blue water footprint and GHG emissions associated with U.S. food consumption patterns.
""Eating lettuce is over three times worse in greenhouse gas emissions than eating bacon,"" said Paul Fischbeck, professor of social and decisions sciences and engineering and public policy. ""Lots of common vegetables require more resources per calorie than you would think. Eggplant, celery and cucumbers look particularly bad when compared to pork or chicken.""
""There's a complex relationship between diet and the environment,"" Tom said. ""What is good for us health-wise isn't always what's best for the environment. That's important for public officials to know and for them to be cognizant of these tradeoffs as they develop or continue to develop dietary guidelines in the future.""reported in phys org.
A posted asked how people can kill an animal how can people kill plants with the new data coming out that shows that plant life experiences pain. -New research on plant intelligence may forever change how you think about plants:Michael Pollan, author of such books as ""The Omnivore's Dilemma"" and ""The Botany of Desire,"" stated new research, he says, is in a field called plant neurobiology.""They have analagous structures,"" Pollan explains. ""They (plants) have ways of taking all the sensory data they gather in their everyday lives ... integrate it and then behave in an appropriate way in response. And they do this without brains, which, in a way, is what's incredible about it, because we automatically assume you need a brain to process information."" 
Plants don't have similar nervous systems as animals but they have something that is equal to animal intelligence. An example: Pollan, played a recording of a caterpillar munching on a leaf to plants — and the plants react. They begin to secrete defensive chemicals — even though the plant isn't really threatened, Pollan says. ""It is somehow hearing what is, to it, a terrifying sound of a caterpillar munching on its leaves."" Another observation is when a plant is being eaten by an insect the plants next to it will actually began to lean away from the attacked plant which some researchers say is a fear reaction. Lots of research over the last decade on plant life intelligence. Just because you can't hear them scream doesn't mean they don't feel pain when they are chopped up or yanked from the ground. 
My point. Stop judging other people. You don't want to eat meat that's fine-do your thang but stop thinking that make you a better person than those who do chose to eat meat. Your lifestyle choice contributes to climate change more than you want to believe if you read scientific articles that are based on studies & testing. Just think about all the articles on Halloween pumpkins last year and how they contribute to an increase in methane gas. Millions of pounds of pumpkins destined for landfills, adding to more than 254 million tons of municipal solid waste (MSW) produced in the United States every year that turn into methane gas. Landfills contribute nearly 20% of all methane emissions in the States and pumpkin carbon footprint estimated range from 139 g to 448 g.

It concluded that we need to halve global meat consumption, and more than double the volume of whole grains, pulses, nuts, fruit and vegetables we eat.
BQEND
In order to achieve that, perhaps we need to find out why some people consume so much meat. Is it a cultural issue, or have they been brainwashed to think eating meat is good (despite the consequences), is it just a taste issue, or is it a belief that meat is an irreplacable aspect of their diet? 
We are living in an era, where a lot of boys and girls have become health-conscious or conscious of their looks and therefore hitting the gym on a regular basis. A lot of them have adopted high protein diets, simply because of the benefits that have been sold to them, in terms of muscle building and fat loss. Unfortunately, these people have not been told that they are also helping to destroy the planet. 
Once we get to know the reasons behind eating meat, those assumptions that people are making can be challenged.

True - famine almost all occurs in ""peasant and village"" subsistence farming societies. Adequate (indeeed, over-adequate) nutrition is almost always associated with large scale industrialised agriculture. Ever wonder why?
They aren’t the ones wasting half the food being produced (as we do in Canada).
No, they're wasting far more, when you include things like losses to insects and other pests in the field, and food going off after harvest and before it can be consumed. 1/3rd is lost in storage and transport alone.
 They aren’t consuming more meat/sugar/etc than they need to the detriment of their health.
True - instead they're suffering from a range of things like reduced growth due to protein inadequacy, various afflictions due to shortage of key vitamins and minerals, and so on. 
 They aren’t transporting food thousands of miles away from where it’s produced.
No, and that's why we see things like those protein and vitamin deficiencies, and there's still risk of famine. Why you think we wouldn't - for example - see mass starvation in France if there was poor grain harvest for a couple of years? 
Because we have effective storage, and because we transport food over long distances.
 We have enough food to go around, but just like every other resource it’s being distributed unequally.
Yes. But then ask why.

If it all sounds too gloomy, it’s worth remembering that the modern western diet is a recent invention. The separation of livestock from the land only took off in the 1950s, thanks to cheap energy to keep animals housed, to synthetic fertilisers increasing grain production for feed, and to mass production of antibiotics to control disease.

One of its special commissions reported earlier this month that civilisation itself was at risk from the effects of the current food system on both human health and the Earth’s ecosystems. This week comes the next instalment from another special Lancet commission which finds that pandemics of obesity and malnutrition are interacting with climate change in a feedback loop and represent an existential threat to humans and the planet. The modern western diet has become a highly damaging thing that needs a complete overhaul if we are to avoid potential ecological catastrophe. It concluded that we need to halve global meat consumption, and more than double the volume of whole grains, pulses, nuts, fruit and vegetables we eat.
Cue howls of indignation from big food and its cheerleaders, the libertarian right. Those nanny statists have gone nuts eating their own double dose of nuts! Cue cries of distress from champions of local, low-impact agriculture who include grass-fed animals, and their meat and manure, in their sustainable mix. These self-appointed experts don’t understand farming! Cue grim food wheels with only a quarter of a rasher of bacon or a fifth of an egg a day. Those miserabilist medics want us all to go vegan!
Yet the evidence that our diets are the largest cause of climate change and biodiversity loss is now overwhelming. The global food system is responsible for up to 30% of total greenhouse gas emissions, the livestock sector on its own accounting for about half of that total or 14.5%. The modern western way of eating is also making very large numbers of people fat and sick as other parts of the world adopt it. Diet-related diseases now cause roughly 11 million deaths a year as preventable cancers, heart disease and strokes, obesity and diabetes have spread along with our way of eating. More than 800 million people are estimated to be chronically undernourished, and 2 billion suffer from micronutrient deficiencies, yet at the same time 2 billion are overweight or obese. In poorer counties you can even find obesity and stunting within the same family as calorie-heavy but nutrient-light processed industrialised foods are adopted.
In other words, something has gone horribly wrong and we don’t have much time to fix it. The so-called “reference diet”, published in the first Lancet report, has caused uproar in some quarters. This is a theoretical attempt to answer the Malthusian question: if the global population reaches 10 billion by 2050 (as is anticipated), will there be enough food to meet everyone’s basic nutritional needs without cutting down more forest, polluting more water courses and generally destroying the planet? The answer it comes up with is yes, but only if we share things out differently, and stop feeding a quarter of the world’s grain to animals.
The reference diet models each person globally having 14g of red meat a day, 29g of chicken, a fraction of an egg, 250g of dairy, a little fat or oil, very little sugar, and lots of grains and lentils, vegetables and nuts. And here’s where the trouble begins, because calculated day by day and universally these allocations make for a pretty depressing plateful. They contain some odd judgments. Why favour industrialised chicken? Why palm oil? They are plain weird if you try to interpret them as daily instructions without thinking about the diet as a whole or what’s available to people locally – hence the one-fifth of an egg, the quarter rasher of bacon. People don’t shop and eat by numbers and fractions. And the fact that nutrition epidemiology – the study of patterns in diet and disease – has got it wrong before does not help. Remember when fears about dietary cholesterol were used to condemn eggs? These instructions sound top down and, worse, appear to throw responsibility back to the individual.
More than 800 million people are estimated to be chronically undernourished, yet 2 billion are overweight or obese
But that is to miss the point of these instructions. They are calculations that give a sense of the scale of the problem and a science-based framework for political action. Contrary to some claims, the Lancet commission that undertook the modelling, supported by the philanthropic EAT Foundation, received no funding from industry. And the uncomfortable truth is that meat, and specifically the meat from intensively-fed livestock, processed in the way it generally is in the western diet, is a hotspot when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions and ill health. Well-produced meat and dairy can have a place, but it will be a small one, and it is expensive.
Our diets are out of kilter with what’s good for both us and the planet because powerful vested interests and misplaced economic incentives have driven them in that direction, and this is the thesis underlying the commission’s findings. The equivalent of $500bn in agricultural subsidies goes each year to the wrong sort of food – corn, soya, meat and dairy, as cheap raw materials for intensive livestock production and for highly processed foods. About $5tn a year goes in subsidies to the fossil fuels which industrialised agriculture uses so profligately. Big food has spent hundreds of millions advertising unhealthy food and lobbying to block the sort of measures that might help shift consumption.
Although individuals can make a difference by modifying their diets, and send clear demands for action to politicians , we cannot redraw the food system on our own. That will require not just governments, but global agreement.
The Lancet says the problem is so big and so urgent that we need an intergovernmental convention to agree a way forward, in the way that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change or the World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control have. Expect plenty of hysterical, dark-money opposition to that. The Lancet, founded in the 19th century, caused uproar back then by publishing the unwelcomenews that food was routinely adulterated. It has once again kickstarted a vital debate about how we eat. If it all sounds too gloomy, it’s worth remembering that the modern western diet is a recent invention. The separation of livestock from the land only took off in the 1950s, thanks to cheap energy to keep animals housed, to synthetic fertilisers increasing grain production for feed, and to mass production of antibiotics to control disease. It’s not so very long since most people ate in the way we now need to rediscover.

Frans Timmermans, the European commission’s vice-president, said the movement, first triggered by a proposed rise in fuel tax in France, highlighted the need to share the burden.
He was also critical of people and groups who condemned attempts by the EU and national governments to encourage changes such as dropping single-use plastics or driving cars with lower emissions.
“This is the game of those who deny climate change or who deny the need for sustainability,” he said. “They say: ‘They are going to take everything away from us. They are going to take our cars away from us, they are going to take our steaks from us, they are going to take all the things that make life nice away from us. So let’s not go there.’
“It is a false contradiction. If we put our policies in the right order, we have a sustainable society without lowering but even increasing our levels of wellbeing. Is wellbeing only economic growth? Only salaries? Or is wellbeing also being able to breathe clean air and drink clean water?”
Speaking before the publication on Wednesday of a “reflections paper” on the EU’s next steps in changing the way Europeans live and work in order to protect the environment, Timmermans said the challenge was to bring about reform in a way that was equitable.
“The most important thing the gilets jaunes and others ask themselves is: is this fair, are people taking a fair share of the burden or are [the elites] unburdening all that on us? If you create the impression, rightly or wrongly, that this is just a burden on citizens unloaded by companies that don’t do anything, then people will just block it,” he said.
“Politically speaking, one of the most important tasks will be to show that this is something we are doing together in an equitable way, a fair way.”
On Monday a second French gilets jaunes leader announced she was founding a political party. Its programme calls for removing privileges from elected representatives, developing “charity houses” paid for by donations from chief executives, a reduction in VAT on essential products and higher taxes for higher earners.
Timmermans said there were calls for the EU and member states to slow down in making major societal changes in favour of sustainability, but he warned: “The time is now.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/29/elites-must-not-burden-gilets-jaunes-with-climate-change-says-eu-official

Just reading it gave me hope for the first time in a long time.
The ubiquity of Liberal breakaway and other independents points to the obviousness of the next stage. Clearly the Liberals have lost the plot and are incapable of giving Australia good government.

Former Clean Energy finance chief Oliver Yates slams Turnbull government's 'immoral' climate policies
A Liberal Party veteran and former head of the federal government's green bank has unleashed on his party's ""immoral"" climate change policies, saying they ""knowingly and willingly inflict damage on others"".
Ex-Macquarie banker Oliver Yates, chief executive of the government's $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation until April this year, said far-right members had hijacked the party and that ""reform from the outside"" may be required – in the form of a rival party that better reflects core Liberal values.
His comments follow a stunt by Victorian Liberal senator Jane Hume at a party fundraiser last Thursday night, in which she presented a mock lump of brown coal to Treasurer Scott Morrison. Mr Yates stood up and loudly objected to the stunt before angrily leaving the $10,000-a-table event at Melbourne venue Glasshouse.
Mr Yates told Fairfax Media that climate change was ""not a laughing matter"" and the stunt was ""flagrantly immoral"".
""If we don't address climate change and start to reduce our emissions, then it's likely that billions of families could be forced to move home unnecessarily,"" Mr Yates said.
He ""cannot understand how Liberals would knowingly inflict damage on others when they have a perfectly workable economic cure in front of them"" – the adoption of clean energy.
Mr Yates lives in the inner-Melbourne electorate of Kooyong, held by Environment and Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg. A life-long member of the Liberal Party, he is the son of former federal Liberal MP William Yates and began campaigning for the party at the age of nine. He is the independent director of several emerging renewable energy companies.
Mr Yates said last week's stunt capped off a ""pattern of behaviour"" by the government. He cited a recent review of the national electricity market by Chief Scientist Alan Finkel, who was asked by the government to provide advice using emissions reduction calculations which Mr Yates said were at odds with the internationally agreed goal of limiting global warming to below 2 degrees.
Mr Yates lamented ""ignorance"" from the party's far right, which had ""hijacked"" the party.
""I'm saddened that the party has drifted so far away from core Liberal values,"" Mr Yates said, adding that many in the party shared his views.
""If the party will not reform itself from the inside then potentially it has to be reformed from the outside ... there is a meaningful option to create another party which does appear to better reflect Liberal views.""', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1548884502000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'100805943', u'in_reply_to': u'125276491', u'id': u'125311370', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'youwillbenext', u'text': u'My suggestion is why bother.

Ok, so you regulate “traditional” media. What are you doing about Facebook, Twitter, Buzzfeed, HuffPo, etc?
BQEND
A bit of straw in that bale mate. I never advocated regulation, just diversification of ownership.Buzzfeed and Huff unlike NewsLtd are small players, there should be more of them.Facebook and Twitter overwhelmingly source their news from traditional sources. It's the source that's the problem, not the carriage.

I was particularly disappointed that Obama didn't support Assad in Syria, rather than the illusion that was the ""Arab Spring"".
Unfortunately ""democracy"" in many Middle East countries, that Obama might have been naively hoping for, means that Muslims get the upper hand.
As has happened in Turkey. Where democracy with the Muslim support for Erdogan is further away than ever.
Assad is a moderate leader. Even if a dictator, unfortunately what must be accepted. Allowed Christians, non religious people protection in Syria.
But Obama, who had likely never visited, or any of his advisors, decided we should disrupt a peaceful country. Where the majority of its citizens were content.
Rather than fighting the rebels, he decided to bomb civilians in Syria.
But all US leaders are the same. Since WWII. To support the US business interests will go anywhere, cause destruction, kill civilians anywhere in the world, for this cause.
Australia needs to grow up and separate ourselves from the rogue USA. The US is not a model of "" democracy"" we should be following.

The message can still have climate change at its heart, but will be sold more successfully with, say, colourful images of fish and coral reefs, or views of unspoiled river banks, lakes and wetlands populated with birds such as we once had.

It’s a good question but perhaps not the right one. Politics in Australia, as it currently operates, isn’t something immediately appealing to anyone in their right mind. I’ve had a successful business career; my kids are all but grown-up.
But the time has come when I’m compelled to act as the situation we face is so dire, and the quality of the actors so poor, and the unwillingness of the Liberal party to reform is so evident that the right question is “how can you just sit there and not stand?”
We have to change the way politics is done in Australia so we can address climate change, restore political integrity and ensure business operates within society’s expectations and not as an entity unto itself.
Unfortunately, the current Liberal party has lost the plot. Its failure to deal with these issues threatens to sell out the future of all Australians. Without environmental and public assets and public confidence in our politics we’re unable to deal with a warming climate, a growing and ageing population and an unequal economy.
Growing up, I learned what it takes to be elected to parliament, door-knocking Doveton to Kooweerup for my father, the Liberal member for Holt, the late Bill Yates.
But despite being a member for most of my life, I am done with this form of the Liberal party. Seeing the now prime minister, Scott Morrison, wave around a lump of coal in parliament, and witnessing a follow-up act with brown coal at a Victorian fundraiser made me angry. Environmentally it’s like waving asbestos.
If this is the Liberal party, then it has no place for me. I can’t quite explain what has happened but the Liberal party’s culture is sick. Ten years of negative policy actions have created a black hole around the leadership, surrounding them in impenetrable darkness. They’ve ignored or denied claims of bullying, which is evident to all. Now there’s a flood of cabinet ministers rushing for the backdoor. Family reasons aside, the environment in Canberra within the Liberal party is toxic.
We need real people with real experience to sit in Canberra
Faced with this, and when it is made clear that the “broad church” in Kooyong won’t extend to other Liberals with environmental concerns, the time comes to offer an alternative way so that the people of Kooyong can have a voice and be represented in Canberra.
The majority of them want action on climate, fair treatment for asylum seekers, businesses to consider people and the environment, and politicians to act with integrity. Currently they feel let down.
The Liberal government’s blindness to the dangers of climate change is sickening. It’s about 28 years since the first international report called on governments to act to reduce carbon emission as a known threat to the environment. Since then, global emissions have risen more than 60%. The current government is delaying action, and encouraging global inaction.
We can’t afford that. How can Liberals not see this?
The Liberal party put the interests of the coal and fossil fuel industry ahead of just about every other industry, and source of employment, in Australia.
Our beautiful reefs, right through to our southern wilderness, are being destroyed as you read this. Our rivers and everything that relies on them are dying. Communities are facing crippling droughts and fires. Meanwhile, the government continue to peddle dangerous nonsense that we need new coal-fired power stations, or talking up Adani.
Having run the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, and as an investor in renewable projects, I understand the jobs, economic benefits and new industries that can emerge while we reduce pollution. I can’t understand why the Liberal party, which prides itself on its economic credentials, fails to see the economic opportunities.
The treasurer Josh Frydenberg’s recent speech to the Sydney Institute should mark another point of intense disappointment. It highlights how seriously the Liberal party has lost its way. Now its leadership can’t even make moral sense of its own values and belief.
Frydenberg said: “Fairness is achieved through equality of opportunity, not equality of outcomes”, and “intergenerational equity requires fiscal discipline as the next generation should not have to pick up the tab for the last”.
If he seriously believes current Liberal policies reflect these two values, then he is totally deluded.
The government’s policies are preventing individuals having “equality of opportunity”. Inequality of wealth is growing. Wealth has a direct relationship with the opportunities an individual has from birth. The outcome will not be fair if government policies fail to address the massive financial inequality individuals face.
Policies that constantly increase the benefits of those who can afford to pay versus those less well off layer this government’s thinking. Poor suburbs have poor schools, hospitals and services in contrast to wealthy suburbs. I don’t want an American-style split society. Menzies did not suggest it, and it grinds against the identity I thought we shared as Australians, which had pride in egalitarianism and mateship.
Secondly, intergenerational equity applies to the climate and our natural resources not just the budget. Those retiring today are leaving oceans filled with plastic, mines that have not been rehabilitated, soil depleted, ecosystems destroyed and our climate in ruins. The tab is being left to the next generation without care or regard. How a Liberal government cannot see the scale of this is breathtaking.
We must return integrity to politics. We need real people with real experience to sit in Canberra. We can’t afford another generation of party hacks who believe politics is a game of numbers, slogans and spin.
The public have lost trust in their political leaders. We need an integrity commission, proper political donations reforms and a bill of rights that enshrines what it means to be Australian. And we need to stop ignoring the concerns of Australia’s first people before we can become a mature country.
We need a strong business sector that works with society. Currently there are deep cultural problems. Corporations and CEOs are there to act in the collective interests of people. They cannot continue to claim that their only job is to maximise profits. They need to understand that they must act in the same way we expect an individual to act as part of a heathy society that protects and cares for each other.
Government and business love free trade. But it doesn’t always benefit the people. My first public run-in with the Howard government was over the US-Australian free-trade agreement. The PM’s office called my employer to suggest it was not in my employers’ best interest that I continue to point out the deficiencies of the agreement.
It triggered my disbelief in our politicians, and highlighted our lack of individual rights to speak and debate views, as all citizens must do, if they care about their country. Our trade agreements need to be carefully considered to ensure the benefit for our economy and society. We shouldn’t be signing up to deals that could harm Australia’s economic interests or impose major social costs. I will fight to bring greater transparency to the negotiation of international trade deals and to ensure that the economic and social merits of all future deals are independently assessed by the Productivity Commission before the parliament is asked to vote on them.
Having said all that, winning this seat will not be easy. But then again, you never know – moderate Liberal, Greens and Labor electors might welcome the chance to have a member in Canberra that reports to them rather than someone who represents a party most of us cannot understand.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/30/the-liberal-party-has-lost-the-plot-thats-why-im-running-as-an-independent

The president has called climate science “bullshit”, donned a coalminer’s helmet at rallies and defenestrated federal rules designed to cut planet-warming emissions.
It is becoming harder, however, for Trump to swat away the unfolding crises caused by global warming. American lives are increasingly ravaged by flooding and wildfires and Democrats have seized the initiative with the Green New Deal resolution, which proposes full-scale societal and economic change to eliminate carbon emissions while investing in education, health, transport and a federal jobs guarantee.
Now, younger Republicans are breaking with Trump in an attempt to haul their party towards scientific reality.
“There’s disagreement there with Donald Trump,” said Tex Fischer, a 22-year-old conservative Ohioan with a head of unruly hair. “I don’t personally know anyone involved in young, right-of-center politics that doesn’t believe climate change is an issue.
“I think conservatives for a long time have been too willing to just let this be a leftwing issue. We can talk about this. Conservatives that care about the environment do exist.”
Fischer heads campus operations for the American Conservation Coalition (ACC), a Republican youth group founded 18 months ago but already with a presence in 125 colleges across the US, holding events and organizing campaigns. In January, 41 state college Republican chairs signed an ACC letter to GOP leaders urging “action on clean energy and environmental issues” to ensure “conservative values are not lost on the next generation”.
On a recent Monday night, the ACC held a campus event at Temple University to extol the virtues of renewable energy. Temple is a predominantly liberal institution based in a city – Philadelphia – that’s of a similar mien. The panel discussion mustered around a dozen attendees, with one wearing a red “Keep America Great” hat.
Young Temple conservatives are “subject to severe ridicule and a lot of vitriol from their peers”, said Christopher Smith, president of Temple’s student Republican group. Smith, who is 20, comes from Allentown, Pennsylvania, and sports a sober combination of navy suit, combed hair and sensible spectacles. “People call you white supremacists, Nazis. We’ve all been called that at some point. It’s not nice.”
Very few of these taunts are based upon the sharp differences between senior Democrats and Republicans over climate change, however, pointing to a divide that is partially generational. “Trump’s views are definitely more typical of older Republicans than us,” Smith conceded.
Almost 60% of millennial Republicans, a cohort that has never experienced a reality other than of record hot years and collapsing glaciers, agree that climate change is already having some effect on the US, according to Pew Research Center polling. Nearly half believe the government isn’t doing enough to ameliorate the damage.
Older Republicans, the core of Trump’s support, are substantially less likely to back these stances and are much more enthusiastic about coalmining and offshore oil and gas drilling, with the latter proposition supported by 75% of boomer GOP voters compared with 44% of millennial Republicans.
There is no guarantee, of course, that these positions will remain steadfast rather than shift rightward as the newest generation of GOP voters age. With record numbers of Americans expressing alarm over global warming, however, it may be that flat denial of climate science is becoming unmoored from political expediency.
The major divisions occur, crucially, when it comes to how to respond to climate change. While the Green New Deal, spearheaded by the charismatic Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, calls for a “10-year national mobilization” on a scale not seen since the second world war to decarbonize the economy, the college Republicans are far more reticent.
ACC literature at Temple University calls for a “broad range of limited government and market-based policies”. A booklet called How to Be a Conservative Environmentalist promotes cutting regulations, as well as subsidies, for solar and wind power and allowing the market to continue to grow the clean energy sector.
“With Ocasio-Cortez there is this sort of alarmism, like ‘We’re all gonna die in 12 years,’” said Fischer. “We have a more methodical, slower approach … The conversation has been so politicized and so leftwing-dominated that it has put people off. That gives us an opportunity to offer a sensible alternative.”
Much like superstitious actors talking backstage at a production of Macbeth, the protagonists in the Temple climate change event dare not mention the subject of their gathering. “Climate change” is not uttered in an hour of discussion, rejected in favour of uncontroversial bromides such as job-creating “energy diversification”, the conservation accomplishments of Teddy Roosevelt and the national security benefits of American-sourced energy.
“We love it when market forces produce a better product, right?” said Chad Forcey, head of a conservative clean energy organization, to vigorous nods as he flicked through slides showing the plummeting cost of solar energy. The Green New Deal, Forcey said, is “ridiculous. They’ve blended it with socialism and identity politics. What we’re trying to do is something a lot more practical.”
Trump has naturally gone further, falsely claiming the Green New Deal would mean “no more airplanes, no more cows, one car per family”. Republican alternative plans have sprouted from Senator Mike Lee, who suggested having larger families will somehow solve climate change, and his House colleague Matt Gaetz, whose “Green Real Deal” would slash regulations and set no emissions targets. Ocasio-Cortez dismissed Gaetz’s plan as “just so weak” and “so lame”.
A major UN report last year found the world must cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 to avoid calamitous warming, a task that will require an enormous upheaval in the way societies create energy, raise food and transport people.
The US has been rattled by record hurricanes and wildfires in the past two years, with government scientists predicting increasingly punishing storms, crop failures and coastal inundation. Thousands of people are set to perish in heatwaves.
The US Government Accountability Office calculates climate impacts cost the federal government $350bn in the past decade, with economic losses on course to hit $500bn every year by the close of the century. A modest tax on carbon emissions, backed by some conservatives, is unlikely to be enough to dodge this future.
“If there was a free market solution to the climate crisis we would’ve seen it in the last 40 years,” said Varshini Prakash, the 25-year-old founder of Sunrise Movement, the youth-led group allied to Ocasio-Cortez that helped spawn the Green New Deal. “We don’t have decades to wait, we need to do it in the next decade.
“People are dying from the climate crisis right now. The truly irrational thing to do would be continue on the current trajectory and allow 150 million climate refugees and the complete obliteration of coral reefs.”
Prakash was a campus climate activist herself while at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. “There wasn’t really a robust conversation” with college Republicans on the issue, she recalls.
There’s a realization on both sides, however, that the Green New Deal and growing public concern has cracked open the debate, to the odd degree that Trump reportedly will attempt to campaign on climate change in the 2020 presidential election.
“Young people see the denialism and corruption of Republicans and the insufficiency of action by Democrats. They are fed up with it and want to call it out,” Prakash said.
“This is a generational thing. People saying ‘wait your turn, we’ve got this’ frankly don’t see the urgency because they won’t be around for it. It’s quite obvious that they haven’t got it.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/11/we-can-talk-about-this-millennial-republicans-take-a-methodical-approach-to-climate-change

First of all the climate crisis will not be solved by individual actions - even when those individual actions are lumped together. It requires a wholesale system change in the way we run our society and economy. That's way governments and big businsses go on about getting rid of plastic straws or reminding us to turn off lights/turn down the heating slightly. It serves as a distraction from the real villians of the piece and takes away responsibility from society as a whole and down to the level of the individual.
Also these critics are using a logical fallacy called Tu Quoque (French for 'You Also'). This is where an argument is discredited by pointing out the failure of the protestor to take actions based to their own demands. So ""I think we should do something to tackle climate change"" is responded with ""I'll bet you eat meat, drive a car and occasionally hop on planes"". The problem is that this reply is irrelevent to the validity of the argument made by the protestor. It's a sub-set of the ad hominem fallacy in which arguments are rejected based on the character of the person making the argument.

It’s been pretty bleak, if I’m honest, as the deadly impacts scientists have long predicted have spiralled into a horror carousel of heatwaves and wildfires, floods and hurricanes, droughts and famines.
For some the response is pessimism, fatalism and paralysis. In Dune, the main character declares: “The concept of progress acts as a protective mechanism to shield us from the terrors of the future.” With so little progress on climate, it’s little wonder we so fear what lies ahead. But two big rays of sunshine have broken through the clouds in recent months, dispelling the gloom and instilling a sense of renewed hope.
The youth strikers arrived on the climate politics scene in February like gatecrashers at a premature funeral, smashing in through the window in a shower of glass to announce to the hushed congregation that the patient is in fact still alive. Seeing these kids thronging the streets of Westminster and my own city of Norwich has been a thrilling and timely reminder of how real change happens. Meanwhile, the newly minted superstar congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the youth-led Sunrise Movement have busted open the tired assumptions of a hollowed-out US political system to demand good jobs and a liveable future, under the banner of a Green New Deal. 
Friday’s declaration from the UK youth climate strikers calling for a Green New Deal in the UK brings these two strands together, and marks a shift from the oppositional to the propositional for the youth strikers. It is now up to all British politicians to heed their call.
The time for incrementalism has passed. The young people striking today recognise this. They know that their only hope of a decent future is if government works with the people to throw everything we have got at this problem before it’s too late. But they also have the vision to see that the life-saving work of tackling climate change offers a golden chance to fix so many of the other things in our society and economy that decades of neoliberal dogma have broken.
The youth strikers are calling for a government-led, 10-year mobilisation to completely modernise every aspect of our infrastructure and built environment, to reshape the public realm, restore threatened habitats and carbon sinks and prepare communities for the climate impacts we can no longer avoid. This epic transformation would create millions of good jobs across every corner of Britain, breathing new life into places that haven’t seen inward investment for decades. YouGov polling data released on Friday shows that these proposals are highly popular, enjoying more than two-thirds public support. People in Britain might not have heard of a Green New Deal yet, but they seem to really love the idea of it when they understand what it would mean in practice.
Maybe Labour still isn’t entirely where it needs to be on this issue – but, with my encouragement, we are getting there fast. While the Conservatives dither, Jeremy Corbyn has committed to achieving net-zero emissions in the UK before the middle of the century. My boss, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, is rewriting the Treasury rulebook to ensure all future public investment is green, and is looking at moving Britain towards a four-day working week, which could improve lives and reduce pressure on the environment. The Treasury under Labour would become the driver of positive environmental policy instead of a block in the system, working with each secretary of state to develop a departmental carbon budget alongside a financial budget at each spending review. Last month, the shadow environment secretary, Sue Hayman, declared a climate and environment emergency in parliament, and the shadow business, energy and industrial strategy secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, has announced plans for a green industrial revolution that would see the UK lead the world in tidal energy, recapture our crown in offshore wind and recruit a carbon army of local workers to insulate millions of leaky homes.
For those who say we can’t afford to do this, I say we can’t afford not to. Dealing with the horrors of unmitigated climate change will be incalculably more costly than intervening now to prevent them. It requires a massive public investment, but that would pay for itself many times over in the years ahead through the good quality work it would create. There are huge economic opportunities in renewable technologies and energy efficiency that are currently passing Britain by as a blinkered Tory government looks the other way. Money supply is quite literally the least of our worries. As Keynes said: “Anything we can actually do we can afford.”
As the UK’s youth climate strikers geared up for their action on Friday, Theresa May was refusing to even meet the Nobel peace prize-nominee Greta Thunberg when she visits parliament later this month. My message to Thunberg and all of her British counterparts is simple: the Labour party’s door is open. We hear you, and we will work with you to do what needs to be done.

Most seem happy with the deal.
“I told a 72-year-old volunteer that he will probably be targeted by police,” said Ruiz, who is based in Eureka, California and is helping organize the first US rollout of Extinction Rebellion, a group founded in the UK that has grabbed attention through disruptive protests leading to mass arrests.
“He paused and then said: ‘OK, yes.’”
Following a foray into New York in January, several thousand protestors will aim to cause similar mischief in dozens of US cities next week.
“This is a coordinated rebellion that targets industry and government indefinitely, to shut the country down,” Ruiz said. “In my 30 years plus of activism I’ve never seen so many everyday people worried in such a visceral way, for themselves, their children, their grandchildren. It’s unprecedented.”
Some activists hope the arrival of Extinction Rebellion will be a watershed moment for the US environmental movement, shifting it from what they see as a tepid response to the cavalcade of disasters threatening the livability of the planet. Extinction Rebellion is aimed at spurring a muscular, punkish outpouring of civil disobedience, snarling cities and frogmarching politicians towards meaningful action.
In the UK, Extinction Rebellion members have caused uproar by halting traffic on bridges in central London, stripping naked in parliament and blockading the BBC. Last week, protestors glued themselves to the entrance of a fracking conference.
“Troublemakers change the world,” said Roger Hallam, one the group’s founders.
Elsewhere in Europe, Swedish teen Greta Thunberg sparked a series of walkout strikes by schoolchildren over the sclerotic response by adults to climate change.
Such sustained protest, in countries where planet-warming emissions are sharply falling and gasoline-powered cars are increasingly banned from city streets, is unusual in the US, where the Trump administration has promoted fossil fuels, dismantled climate regulations and overseen a rise in emissions.
American protesters have shown willingness to chain themselves to oil drills or, in the case of the Keystone XL pipeline, be rounded up outside the White House. Native Americans, regularly subject to the collateral damage of extractive industry, rose up in the face of savage policing during the Standing Rock protests of 2017. But some activists feel forceful confrontation needs to become the norm.
We have no time left, we have no time for incrementalism
“The mainstream environmental movement has been asking so little of people here, whereas we are saying, ‘We are in danger and we are asking you to act accordingly, to put your lives on the line,’” said Ruiz. “Very commonly, the big environmental groups will send emails saying, ‘Donate $5 today, call your congressman’ and then ask for very symbolic action where people won’t be held for long.
“We want to remind people that people in civil resistance in the past have been willing to risk their lives. The Freedom Riders [of the 1960s civil rights movement] signed their wills before they got on the buses. We have no time left, we have no time for incrementalism.”
Differences in policing approaches could be a factor in the varying intensity of protests. Extinction Rebellion, which cites nonviolent disobedience in the mold of Mahatma Gandhi, triggered dozens of arrests but no fights when activists shut down five London bridges in November. By contrast, police in North Dakota deployed water cannon and rubber bullets against protestors at Standing Rock.
“We are incredibly lucky in England to have a police force that isn’t perfect but is honourable and maintains peaceful protests,” said Tiana Jacout, a UK-based Extinction Rebellion organizer. “You can be willing to martyr yourself by going to prison here but it’s a different ball game in America.
“It’s easier to protest when you’re not being brutally beaten. I just hope they can get the revolutionary bug again.”
Some experienced climate campaigners reject the idea that their actions have not matched the fervor shown by their European counterparts, pointing to a raft of marches and other actions to decry Trump’s disdain for climate science and its dire implications for millions of Americans who risk being upended by flooding, wildfires, extreme heat and water insecurity.
Trump’s term has also seen cities such as San Francisco declare a “climate emergency” and the emergence of the Green New Deal, a Democrat resolution urging a second world war-level effort to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. Activists are nagged by the timed nature of the challenge, however: according to a landmark United Nations report the world has little more than a decade to avert disastrous ravages from climate change.
“I think it’s crazy that we have to do this in order to get politicians to act on the greatest crisis we face but manifestly we do,” said Bill McKibben, the co-founder of climate group 350.org and a Guardian contributor who estimates he has been put in handcuffs “seven or eight times”.
“Nonviolent direct action is never an end in itself, but carefully used it underlines the moral urgency of the moment. I think it mostly needs to become bigger, everywhere. And dramatic action – conducted with care, so that people aren’t turned off – has a serious role to play in that.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/apr/13/extinction-rebellion-heads-to-america-climate-change-protest

But that can only work if you're living in a city where your work is AND you can pay the rent (or buy a house). If you can't find a home and/or no work where you live - then the problem starts. Public bus and train services are a far cry from being perfect. Working at ""Home Offices"" deprive you of the social world that you enjoy (or loathe) with colleagues.
But this one sentence was always true: There cannot be eternal growth on ONE planet not growing eternally.
Basically it's our system that's based on growth that must be changed. But most people have few ideas what this would mean, and if, they might fight any change. And they are voters ... so politicians will act only once the last blockhead understand what climate change means - ca. 2050. Politicians of today shy away from taking responsibility, because they fear being thrown out at the next election. They want to be forced by the public: in this case they are most willing to act. Because they can present themselves as the executors of the electorate.
So I personally feel that we're about to see an inevitable loss of what we call ""democracy"" in mid-term as it acts to slow in all important issues, especially climate change. Maybe China will be faster in deciding for the right measures - and the western style of government will even more be de-legitimized. 
Mankind thought it hat removed itself from blind ecological processes (like massive dying of illnesses, drought etc.) only to find that that had been only a short reprieve.
Medicines help people to survive, but with no more changes an ever growing mankind will use up all places to settle and eat up everything that's available. At the start of the end all edible animals and plants will be gone, and mankind will be alone with itself. And in the end mankind will eat itself up.Curtain.

Everywhere I look, I see people engaged in furious attempts to fend off the moral challenge it presents.
The commonest current excuse is this: “I bet those protesters have phones/go on holiday/wear leather shoes.” In other words, we won’t listen to anyone who is not living naked in a barrel, subsisting only on murky water. Of course, if you are living naked in a barrel we will dismiss you too, because you’re a hippie weirdo. Every messenger, and every message they bear, is disqualified on the grounds of either impurity or purity.
As the environmental crisis accelerates, and as protest movements like YouthStrike4Climate and Extinction Rebellion make it harder not to see what we face, people discover more inventive means of shutting their eyes and shedding responsibility. Underlying these excuses is a deep-rooted belief that if we really are in trouble, someone somewhere will come to our rescue: “they” won’t let it happen. But there is no they, just us.
Extinction Rebellion is an international protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues. Demonstration have included blocking bridges to traffic in London and a semi-naked protest inside the House of Commons. 
The group says climate breakdown threatens all life on Earth, and so it is rebelling against politicians who 'have failed us', to provoke radical change that will stave off a climate emergency.
The political class, as anyone who has followed its progress over the past three years can surely now see, is chaotic, unwilling and, in isolation, strategically incapable of addressing even short-term crises, let alone a vast existential predicament. Yet a widespread and wilful naivety prevails: the belief that voting is the only political action required to change a system. Unless it is accompanied by the concentrated power of protest – articulating precise demands and creating space in which new political factions can grow – voting, while essential, remains a blunt and feeble instrument.
The media, with a few exceptions, is actively hostile. Even when broadcasters cover these issues, they carefully avoid any mention of power, talking about environmental collapse as if it is driven by mysterious, passive forces, and proposing microscopic fixes for vast structural problems. The BBC’s Blue Planet Live series exemplified this tendency.
Those who govern the nation and shape public discourse cannot be trusted with the preservation of life on Earth. There is no benign authority preserving us from harm. No one is coming to save us. None of us can justifiably avoid the call to come together to save ourselves.
I see despair as another variety of disavowal. By throwing up our hands about the calamities that could one day afflict us, we disguise and distance them, converting concrete choices into indecipherable dread. We might relieve ourselves of moral agency by claiming that it’s already too late to act, but in doing so we condemn others to destitution or death. Catastrophe afflicts people now and, unlike those in the rich world who can still afford to wallow in despair, they are forced to respond in practical ways. In Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi, devastated by Cyclone Idai, in Syria, Libya and Yemen, where climate chaos has contributed to civil war, in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador,, where crop failure, drought and the collapse of fisheries have driven people from their homes, despair is not an option. Our inaction has forced them into action, as they respond to terrifying circumstances caused primarily by the rich world’s consumption. The Christians are right: despair is a sin.
As the author Jeremy Lent points out in a recent essay, it is almost certainly too late to save some of the world’s great living wonders, such as coral reefs and monarch butterflies. It might also be too late to prevent many of the world’s most vulnerable people from losing their homes. But, he argues, with every increment of global heating, with every rise in material resource consumption, we will have to accept still greater losses, many of which can still be prevented through radical transformation.
Every nonlinear transformation in history has taken people by surprise. As Alexei Yurchak explains in his book about the collapse of the Soviet Union – Everything Was Forever, Until It Was No More – systems look immutable until they suddenly disintegrate. As soon as they do, the disintegration retrospectively looks inevitable. Our system – characterised by perpetual economic growth on a planet that is not growing – will inevitably implode. The only question is whether the transformation is planned or unplanned. Our task is to ensure it is planned, and fast. We need to conceive and build a new system based on the principle that every generation, everywhere has an equal right to enjoy natural wealth.
This is less daunting than we might imagine. As Erica Chenoweth’s historical research reveals, for a peaceful mass movement to succeed, a maximum of 3.5% of the population needs to mobilise. Humans are ultra-social mammals, constantly if subliminally aware of shifting social currents. Once we perceive that the status quo has changed, we flip suddenly from support for one state of being to support for another. When a committed and vocal 3.5% unites behind the demand for a new system, the social avalanche that follows becomes irresistible. Giving up before we have reached this threshold is worse than despair: it is defeatism.
Today, Extinction Rebellion takes to streets around the world in defence of our life-support systems. Through daring, disruptive, nonviolent action, it forces our environmental predicament on to the political agenda. Who are these people? Another “they”, who might rescue us from our follies? The success of this mobilisation depends on us. It will reach the critical threshold only if enough of us cast aside denial and despair, and join this exuberant, proliferating movement. The time for excuses is over. The struggle to overthrow our life-denying system has begun.

The centre-left SDP looks set to keep out the nationalist Finns party, which it beat by just 6,800 votes, and is likely instead to try to form a government with parties of the left and centre-right.
The SDP, led by Antti Rinne, a 56-year-old former trade union leader, will have 40 MPs in a fragmented 200-seat Eduskunta (parliament) after winning 17.7% of the vote after a fierce anti-austerity campaign.
Nevertheless, the far-right, anti-immigration and increasingly radical Finns party did better than expected, winning 17.5% and 39 seats – almost exactly the same as its total in elections in 2011 and 2015, but significantly more than it might have hoped for earlier this year.
On a good night generally for the left, the SDP finished with six more MPs than in the previous parliament, while the Greens gained five and the more radical Left Alliance four. Voters chose between 2,500 candidates from 19 political parties and movements.
The result was further evidence of a modest social democratic fightback in Nordic countries, with left-leaning prime ministers now in power in Sweden and Iceland, and the Social Democrats leading in the polls in Denmark, where elections are due this summer.
The biggest loser was the Centre party of the outgoing prime minister Juha Sipilä, who blamed the slump in its support – to 13.8% of the vote and fourth place – on the “difficult economic decisions” his government had had to make.
Ninety-two of the 200 MPs in the new parliament are women, the second highest proportion in Europe after Iceland.
Although the SDP’s victory is its first in 20 years, with no party winning more than 20% of the vote and deep divisions within all mainstream parties over the future of Finland’s widely admired welfare system – which the left want to preserve by increasing taxes, and the right to streamline because of rising costs – the centre-left party may find it hard to build a sustainable coalition.
Final results will be published on Wednesday, with formal coalition talks likely to start on 25 April. The leader of the party with the most seats traditionally has the first stab at forming a government.
Political analysts expect a coalition led by the Social Democrats, possibly including the conservative National Coalition, a junior member of the outgoing coalition, which won 38 seats, the Greens and the Swedish People’s party.
The more radical Left Alliance might also seek to join the cabinet, but the Centre party’s heavy defeat is likely to exclude it. All parties have said they would find it difficult, if not impossible, to share power with the Finns party and its hardline leader, Jussi Halla-aho, who has shifted the party firmly to the right since a 2017 split that saw half its MPs leave.
Rinne said his party disagreed with the Finns party on immigration, the EU, and economic policy, as well as, most importantly, in their core values. “I don’t think we can work with the Finns because of those differences,” he told Agence France-Presse, adding that he expected to be able to instead strike a deal with either the conservative National Coalition or the Centre party.
“It’s very hard to see that the other parties would say no to the Social Democrats, because then we would be in a situation with Halla-aho trying to form a government and I just don’t see that happening,” said a political commentator, Sini Korpinen.
Markku Jokisipilä, professor of political history at the University of Turku, said other parties were “at present rejecting the possibility of being in the same government with the Finns party. But it remains to be seen, because Finnish politics is rather pragmatic.”
Halla-aho told the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper that although he could be interested in the job of interior minister, he would not repeat the mistakes his party made in 2015 when it haemorrhaged support after entering government and had to compromise on immigration and EU bailouts.
“I don’t see it as possible that the Finns party would take part in a government which doesn’t clearly commit to reducing humanitarian migration,” he said.
The strong finish by the Finns party, which was in fifth place in the polls less than six months ago, echoed similar recent performances by hard-right, anti-immigration parties across Europe.
Halla-aho, who has transformed the party from being a populist Eurosceptic movement to a far more explicitly nationalist, far-right organisation that aims to cut immigration to “almost zero” and questions the need for tough action on climate change, ended up winning the most votes of any candidate in the election.
Halla-aho, 47, who was fined by the supreme court in 2012 for blog comments linking Islam to paedophilia and Somalis to theft, has said the next government should not speed up cutting carbon emissions but instead pursue a “more moderate climate policy that does not chase industries away from Finland to countries like China”.
The Finns party is among a number of populist far-right parties, including Germany’s far-right AfD, Italy’s League and the Danish People’s party, to announce plans to join forces after the European parliamentary elections on 23-26 May in an attempt to transform EU policies on migration, families and the environment.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/15/finlands-sdp-tries-to-build-coalition-after-narrow-election-win

Other Republicans on the Democrat-initiated panel have publicly doubted climate change science. Donald Trump has called global warming a hoax and the party as a whole is seen by many as an obstacle to tackling climate change.
But not Graves. The third-term lawmaker sees rising temperatures as a direct and urgent threat to his state and district, which stretches from the capital, Baton Rouge, to the Gulf coast. He acknowledges fossils fuels are heating the planet, though he thinks Democrats’ plans to quickly shift away from them are unrealistic, and he hasn’t yet offered alternative proposals of his own.
Speaking in his Capitol Hill office – with signed football helmets for both Louisiana State University and the New Orleans Saints behind him – Graves chooses his words carefully. He leans over occasionally to whisper to his press aide about the most diplomatic way to phrase a thought, a skill that will be critical to his mission.
“Years ago I said that I thought the Republican position on climate change is unsustainable,” Graves said. “Just sitting around totally denying the science is an unsustainable position.”
Given his home state, Graves’s deviation from his party is perhaps not surprising. Louisiana is losing a football field of land every 100 minutes as its shoreline is sinking and seas are rising – a reality Graves can’t ignore. Damage from hurricanes and more intense flooding are already costing the state.
Graves said people worried about climate change could emphasize conservation, efficiency and innovation, which he sees as Republican principles. They could talk about cutting electricity bills, rather than just cutting emissions. They could focus on proposals that wouldn’t undercut US competitiveness, which he said Trump is “laser-focused” on promoting.
“We can be talking about the exact same thing but explaining it differently,” he said.
Graves supports planning to adapt to climate change and to protect people from its worst effects. He wants to prepare Louisiana for a changed world. Graves once introduced an amendment to count his state’s Cajuns as an endangered species to overcome regulatory hurdles to coastal restoration efforts. And he acknowledges pollution reductions are also necessary.
But at the same time, he represents an oil and gas state. He declined to specify how much or how quickly he thinks the US should cut fossil fuel use or say whether natural gas should ever be phased out.
More and more Republicans may find themselves walking that fine line, as Americans see climate change in daily life and Democrats aim to make it a 2020 election issue.
Graves said he accepted the committee position on the issue so he could ensure that Congress is planning for the risks Louisiana is already facing. He likens the idea of fighting climate change without also preparing for it, to standing on railroad tracks facing a swiftly approaching train.
He said he found Trump receptive to planning for extreme weather when he talked to him at a bill signing ceremony at the White House.
“The president is a numbers person. When you look at Harvey, Maria, Michael, Florence, you look at what’s happening in the midwest right now with the rivers … the president doesn’t deny the economics of making principled flood protection strategies,” he said.
Graves, 47, was appointed by a Republican governor to run the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, where he negotiated with oil company BP over damages from the Gulf oil spill.
Graves was born near the bayou but loves the mountains. His children are named after favorite peaks. In 1990, he stopped eating meat as part of a bet when he was at a base camp. He outlasted his friends, eventually adding back in seafood because he said there’s “only so much tofu and cottage cheese” a person can eat, particularly in Louisiana.
But even though he stands out in the Republican party, he is hardly likely to embrace such Democratic policies as the Green New Deal (GND) any time soon. On the committee, Graves said Republicans plan to push Democrats to consider the costs and effectiveness of specific proposals, and he criticized the GND that many Democratic presidential contenders have endorsed as “utopian”.
Despite Graves’s love of nature, he still got a 0 out of 100 on the League of Conservation Voters’ scorecard.
The oil and gas industry is huge to Louisiana. And the “all-of-the-above” energy strategy that Graves and House Republican leaders promote includes burning natural gas, which is less damaging than coal but still heats the planet.
Asked when the US might transition away from natural gas, Graves said “that’s crystal ball material” and that “natural gas is going to play a vital role in our energy policy for decades”.
He thinks the international Paris agreement – which Trump plans to exit – would have been bad for US competitiveness because China and India will keep burning coal.
But on the core science behind global warming Graves has little doubt.
Even if the US used only renewable power starting next year, he said “the seas are still going to rise, according to climate models.

Peter Ridd, who was the head of the physics department at the institution from 2009 until 2016, took legal action against his dismissal.
Judge Salvatore Vasta ruled on Tuesday the 17 findings made by the university, the two speech directions, the five confidentiality directions, the no satire direction, the censure, the final censure and the termination of Ridd’s employment were all unlawful.
“Some have thought that this trial was about freedom of speech and intellectual freedom. Media reports have considered that this trial was about silencing persons with controversial or unpopular views,” Vasta said in his judgement.
“Rather, this trial was purely and simply about the proper construction of a clause in an enterprise agreement.”
The judgement noted Ridd had been in trouble with university management for contacting a News Corp journalist and making media appearances on Sky News after dark claiming he had breached a code of conduct.
Ridd had started a GoFundMe page asking for donations to fund his legal expenses and he also published material from the internal disciplinary process on a blog.
A number of media articles were also published where it was obvious that Prof Ridd had spoken to the journalist involved, the judgment said.
“Professionally, Professor Ridd had been concerned with the quality of the scientific research that had been published about the state of health of the Great Barrier Reef,” the judgment said.
“He had published a number of papers on the need for better quality assurance. In his opinion, the health of the Great Barrier Reef had been frequently misrepresented.”
Judge Vasta said the university has not understood the whole concept of intellectual freedom.
“[The] university has ‘played the man and not the ball’,” he said.
“Intellectual freedom is so important. It allows academics to express their opinions without fear of reprisals. It allows a Charles Darwin to break free of the constraints of creationism. It allows an Albert Einstein to break free of the constraints of Newtonian physics. It allows the human race to question conventional wisdom in the never-ending search for knowledge and truth.”
The Townsville-based university’s provost professor, Chris Cocklin, noted the judgment does not refer to any case law.
“We disagree with the judgment and we maintain we have not taken issue with Dr Ridd’s nor any other employee’s rights to academic freedom,” Cocklin said in a statement.
“Dr Ridd was not sacked because of his scientific views. Dr Ridd was never gagged or silenced about his scientific views, a matter which was admitted during the court hearing.”
The case has been adjourned for a further hearing to award a penalty.
Comment was sought from Ridd.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/16/james-cook-university-professor-peter-ridds-sacking-ruled-unlawful

Hundreds of people had occupied the crossing and three other sites in the capital since Monday morning.
Over Monday night, officers tried to clear the bridge, arresting 113 people, but the blockade remained in place. Just after 12.30pm on Tuesday, officers moved in again and began to carry people away.
The protests are part of a global campaign organised by the British climate group Extinction Rebellion, with demonstrations planned in 80 cities across 33 countries in the coming days.
The group has called on the UK government to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025 and establish a citizens’ assembly to devise an emergency plan of action to tackle climate breakdown and biodiversity loss.
Extinction Rebellion is an international protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues. Demonstration have included blocking bridges to traffic in London and a semi-naked protest inside the House of Commons. 
The group says climate breakdown threatens all life on Earth, and so it is rebelling against politicians who 'have failed us', to provoke radical change that will stave off a climate emergency.
One of those facing arrest was Angie Zealter, 67, from Knighton in Wales. “It will take the police some time to clear all these people and more will come here to support us,” she said.
“But this is a very import moment in history – it should have happened 50 years ago but at least it is starting to happen now. We are running out of time and our government must listen.”
Several hundred people remained on the bridge, some of them locked or glued to a lorry parked across the carriageway.
One of those glued to the underside of the van, Ben Moss, 42, a company director from Bristol, said he had been there since midnight. “It’s drastic times and drastic times need drastic measures. I am taking personal action and personal responsibility for the ecological and climate crisis,” he said.
Moss said he was breaking the law for the sake of future generations. “I feel really sorry for the inconvenience we are causing and it is nothing personal, but the inconvenience we will all face if we don’t tackle this will be much, much worse,” he said.
On Tuesday afternoon, police said they were taking “positive action” on the demonstration, which the Metropolitan police said was causing “serious disruptions to public transport, local businesses and Londoners who wish to go about their daily business”.
In a statement circulated to the press, Ch Supt Colin Wingrove reiterated the section 14 order issued late on Monday that instructed protesters to continue their demonstration at Marble Arch and clear all other areas.
On Tuesday evening, police turned their attention away from Waterloo Bridge and to Oxford Circus, where hundreds of people were dancing to music.
Officers circulated around the crowd in groups, informing people that if they stayed they were at risk of arrest. The Guardian witnessed at least one person being carried away, while others left the crowd after speaking to police.
“We are peaceful, what about you?” they chanted as police made an arrest. About two dozen people sat beside the stage, a pink boat, next to signs warning they were glued on and could not be moved.
Jane Forbes, an activist of pension age who spoke to the Guardian on the escalator leaving Oxford Circus station, said she and three friends, all of a similar age, had come to be arrested. “We’re the gruesome grannies,” she joked, adding that she had come from the Marble Arch campsite specifically to be arrested.
Earlier, at Parliament Square, protesters and tourists milled around in about equal numbers, with most concentrated around roadblocks. In the middle, people played with juggling sticks or diablos, or danced at small sound systems. Children played with oversize bouncy balls.
On the junction with Parliament Street, Sarah Reddyhoff, an artist from Chesham, Buckinghamshire, had drawn a large montage on the street in chalk. She had come to visit the demonstration after meeting some people taking part while on the tube on Monday.
“I think everyone wants the planet to thrive,” she said, pointing to her mural. “I have a child here, and the child is crying.” Pointing to another part, she added: “Blue planet – I put that there, because that David Attenborough film was vital to let everyone know what’s going on.”

Roger Hallam, one of the movement’s leaders, said nothing like this had been seen on the streets of London for decades. “What’s amazing about this is for 30 years you have just had that closing up of public space: ‘You can’t do this, you can’t do that, you’ve got to finish then’, he said.
“Suddenly, what Extinction Rebellion has done is actually say: ‘We are doing this.’ And the state is so weak through austerity that they can’t stop us.”
An Extinction Rebellion spokesman said though police had also issued a section 14 notice to protesters blocking the roads around Parliament Square, no arrests had been made there. “There’s a couple of police on site but it doesn’t look like they are moving at all,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/apr/16/more-than-100-people-arrested-in-london-climate-change-protests-extinction-rebellion

In a clarion call to Europe’s political leaders ahead of European parliament elections in May, the founder of the school strike movement said if politicians were serious about tackling climate change they would not spend all their time “talking about taxes or Brexit”.
In a typically blunt speech, she said politicians were failing to take enough action on climate change and the threats to the natural world.
“Our house is falling apart and our leaders need to start acting accordingly because at the moment they are not,” the 16-year old schoolgirl from Sweden told a standing room-only meeting of MEPs and EU officials in Strasbourg.
“If our house was falling apart our leaders wouldn’t go on like we do today,” she said. “If our house was falling apart, you wouldn’t hold three emergency Brexit summits and no emergency summit regarding the breakdown of the climate and the environment.”
While climate change is sometimes discussed at the EU’s regular summits, the issue has never dominated because Brexit, migration or the eurozone crisis have monopolised the attention of Europe’s top leaders.
Thunberg (16) began a solo climate protest by striking from school in Sweden in August 2018. She has since been joined by tens of thousands of school and university students in Australia, Belgium, Germany, the United States, Japan and more than a dozen other countries.
Speaking at the United Nations climate conference in December 2018, she berated world leaders for behaving like irresponsible children. And in January 2019 she rounded on the global business elite in Davos: “Some people, some companies, some decision-makers in particular, have known exactly what priceless values they have been sacrificing to continue making unimaginable amounts of money. And I think many of you here today belong to that group of people.”
Veteran climate campaigners are astonished by what has been achieved in such a short time. Thunberg has described the rapid spread of school strikes for climate around the world as amazing. “It proves you are never too small to make a difference,” she said. Her protests were inspired by US students who staged walk-outs to demand better gun controls in the wake of multiple school shootings.
Her mother, Malena Ernman, has given up her international career as an opera singer because of the climate effects of aviation. Her father is actor Svante Thunber. Greta has Asperger’s syndrome, which in the past has affected her health, he says. She sees her condition not as a disability but as a gift which has helped open her eyes to the climate crisis.

Greta’s 10-minute speech was interrupted by frequent applause and ended with a 30-second standing ovation.
Before she began speaking, many in the room rose to their feet to applaud and take photos of her as she sat on the podium surrounded by cameras.
As the young climate activist spoke of a “sixth mass extinction”, her voice faltered. “The extinction rate is up to 10,000 times faster than what is considered normal, with up to 200 species becoming extinct every single day,” she said. “Erosion of fertile topsoil, deforestation of the rainforest, toxic air pollution, loss of insects and wildlife, acidification of our oceans – these are all disastrous trends.”
She was applauded after getting to the end of the passage and continued the speech without faltering again.
Greta had previously addressed the UN climate change summit in Poland and the World Economic Forum in Davos since her lone protest outside the Swedish parliament last August triggered a worldwide school strike movement to raise the alarm about climate change.Neither was it the first time Greta had taken her uncompromising message to the EU institutions. In February, she told an audience including the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, the EU needed to double the ambition of its climate targets.
At that time, the parliament’s senior leaders, led by the European parliament president, Antonio Tajani, decided against inviting Greta to address MEPs in the parliament’s debating chamber. Centre-right and liberal groups argued against the invitation, which had been proposed by the Greens. Objections ranged from the potential vulnerability of a child exposed to the chamber to a desire to reserve the plenary address for politicians or senior officials.
The meeting took place in the more low-key setting of a special meeting of the European parliament’s environment committee.
Noting the imminent European elections and the fact that her generation could not vote, Greta urged MEPs to listen to scientists and millions of children who had taken part in school strikes. “In this election, you vote for the future living conditions of humankind,” she said.
Referring to Monday’s fire at Notre Dame in Paris in her speech, Greta called for “cathedral thinking” to tackle climate change.
“It is still not too late to act. It will take a far-reaching vision, it will take courage, it will take fierce, fierce determination to act now, to lay the foundations where we may not know all the details about how to shape the ceiling,” she said. “In other words it will take cathedral thinking. I ask you to please wake up and make changes required possible.”
• This article was amended on 17 April 2019 because an earlier version misquoted Greta Thunberg as saying: “The extinction rate is up to six times faster than what is considered normal”.

He said he would be surprised if he made it to the end of the week without getting arrested. “I’ve had a couple of warnings from the police already,” he said. “But I’ve had training so I know my rights, I know what to do, so it’s not like this terrifying thing.”
Asked what his parents thought, Nathan said they were not particularly pleased. “They were like: ‘We are glad you’re fighting for a cause, but if you get a fine we are going to be mad.’”
Spindel had been in London since Sunday and said she was supporting friends who were prepared to be arrested, although she had decided to try not to be arrested herself.
“I am just terrified that we will wipe our species out and take many others with us,” she said at Waterloo Bridge. “I feel like our politicians are simply not doing nearly enough. We have been peacefully demonstrating about this issue for so long with no impact that I think this is our last chance to do something in time.
“I have discussed this with my family and they are very proud and fully agree with my stance on this, although they are worried about me getting arrested.”
Clarke said she hoped the protest would encourage politicians “to engage with the facts and begin to create the space to take meaningful action”.
“There is nothing else left to do,” she said at Waterloo Bridge. “We have tried protesting and we have tried making our case to the government calmly but they don’t listen. Now I feel we have to take part in civil disobedience in an attempt to meet the huge challenge we face. But because of Brexit it is very difficult at the moment to get our voice heard. It is frustrating because when you take a step back it is clear Brexit will be nothing if we don’t save the planet. Few people seem to realise that but that is genuinely the scale of what we are talking about here.
“I hear some people in government and politics do get this … If ordinary people like me – I am not a hardcore environmentalist or activist – are prepared to take a stand and even get arrested then surely that has to count for something?”
Kennedy was handing out Penguin biscuits to protesters as part of her duties as a wellbeing steward at the Extinction Rebellion event in Edinburgh. “I’m here because I’ve got grandchildren and I really think something has to be done,” she said.
This was Kennedy’s first environmental protest, although she also marched against the Iraq war, and she commended the “really lovely” atmosphere. It was the significance of the protest that had brought her here, she said. “This is just so important. You have to be here – or be dead.”
She said her role was to help maintain the atmosphere, keeping an eye out for anyone who looked like they were becoming upset or angry, and intervening before things escalated.
Noting Monday’s protests in London, she said: “It’s not just happening across the UK but across the world and I don’t see it ending any time soon. It’s going to take a lot to make governments wake up to their responsibilities.”
“The main reason I am doing this is because our government is lying,” said Griffiths, who was taking part in the blockade of Waterloo Bridge in London. “They are lying about issues on which there is concrete scientific consensus. For me it is totally unacceptable to lie against scientists who have spent their careers painstakingly researching this stuff.
“Protests around these environmental issues have been going on for decades and nothing has created meaningful proportionate change. I don’t want to be arrested but I am prepared to do that because what else is there? Write a letter to my MP, join Greenpeace – none of it seems to make much difference, so I feel there is no option but to take a stand.”
Finegan, also at Waterloo Bridge, said it was the first time he had been on this sort of protest, and it was “really positive and interesting”.
“I am freaking out about the climate, to be honest,” he said. “There have been so many warnings from scientists about what we are facing, it is quite shocking. The government is not facing up to the evidence of what is happening, so I am here to try my best to get them to respond.
“My family and friends sort of agree about the climate stuff but don’t really want to face it properly and many of them are not the sort of people to take part in something like this, though I wish they would. But I am terrified. It is quite a terrifying prospect when you look at the facts. That’s why I’m here.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/16/im-terrified-extinction-rebellion-activists-on-why-they-are-protesting

Today, the CO2 level is the highest it has been for several million years. Back then, temperatures were 3-4C hotter, sea level was 15-20 metres higher and trees grew at the south pole. Worse, billions of tonnes of carbon pollution continues to pour into the air every year and at a rate 10 times faster than for 66m years.
At the dawn of the industrial revolution, CO2 was at 280 parts per million (ppm) in the atmosphere. By 1958, when the first measurements were made at Mauna Loa in Hawaii, it had reached 315ppm. It raced past 350ppm in 1986 and 400ppm in 2013.
The Guardian will now publish the Mauna Loa carbon count, the global benchmark, on the weather page of the paper every day.
“When I read the letter from Guardian reader Daniel Scharf encouraging us to include information on climate change in our weather forecasts, we thought it was a fantastic idea,” said the Guardian’s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner.
“Levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have risen so dramatically, and including a measure of that in our daily weather report is symbolic of what human activity is doing to our climate. People need reminding that the climate crisis is no longer a future problem – we need to tackle it now, and every day matters.”
While weather changes daily, climate changes over years and decades. So alongside the daily carbon count, we will publish the level in previous years for comparison, as well as the pre-industrial baseline of 280ppm, and the level seen as manageable in the long term of 350ppm.
Year-on-year comparisons are important because each year there is a natural rise and fall of CO2 levels, rather like the planet breathing. Trees and plants absorb carbon and release oxygen as they grow, lowering atmospheric CO2.
As most plants are in the northern hemisphere, CO2 reaches its lowest level each year at the end of the growing season in October. Then it begins to rise as dying plants decay, reaching a peak in May or June.
While the CO2 level is an important and symbolic measure of the global warming caused by humanity, it is a simple one. The increases in temperature the world experiences, and the heatwaves, storms and droughts that strike, also depend on how fast emissions rise or fall and how long they remain at high levels. The 350ppm level was proposed in 2008 by Nasa’s Prof James Hansen as a suitable target.
However we measure climate change, one thing is clear: to keep below 1.5C of warming, the aspiration of the world’s nations, we need to halve emissions by 2030 and reach zero by mid century. It is also likely we will need to remove CO2 from the atmosphere, perhaps by the large-scale restoration of nature.
It is a huge task, but we hope that tracking the daily rise of CO2 will help to maintain attention on it. When the 400ppm milestone was passed, Prof Ralph Keeling, who oversees the Mauna Loa measurements begun by his father, said: “It is symbolic, a point to pause and think about where we have been and where we are going.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/05/why-the-guardian-is-putting-global-co2-levels-in-the-weather-forecast

The study found that woodlands, whose shade was expected to protect species from warming temperatures, are just as affected by climate change as open grasslands.
The research examined records of the first springtime flights of butterflies, moths and aphids and the first eggs of birds between 1965 and 2012. As average temperatures have risen, aphids are now emerging a month earlier, and birds are laying eggs a week earlier. The scientists said this could mean animals were becoming “out of sync” with their prey, with potentially serious ramifications for ecosystems.
Researchers are increasingly concerned about dramatic drops in populations of insects, which underpin much of nature. In February it was said that these falls could lead to a “catastrophic collapse of nature’s ecosystems”, and in March there was further evidence of widespread loss of pollinating insects in recent decades in Britain.
Other studies, from Germany and Puerto Rico, have shown falling numbers in the last 25 to 35 years. Another showed butterflies in the Netherlands had declined by at least 84% over the last 130 years.
James Bell, at Rothamsted Research institute, who led the woodlands research, said: “Under global warming you would expect woodlands to have some protection for insects, a buffer against change. But we didn’t see that. It is the major surprise and is disturbing. There is really no place to hide against the effects of global warming if you are an insect in the UK.”
Another surprise was that insects and birds living in farmland are emerging later in the spring, not earlier as expected. “We can only assume this is to do with other, non-climate factors,” Bell said. The loss of wild areas and changing crop types could be among the factors, he said, along with declining food availability leading to delayed breeding.
James Pearce-Higgins, of the British Trust for Ornithology, said: “Birds are at the top of many food chains and are sensitive to the impacts of climate change on the availability of their insect prey.”
A separate new study found that populations of birds that rely on insects for food fell by 13% across Europe between 1990 and 2015, and by 28% in Denmark, which the scientists used as a national case study. The omnivorous birds assessed did not show a decline.
The UK research, published in the journal Global Change Biology, found that the shift to earlier emergence or egg-laying varied considerably according to the type of habitat and how far north the species lives. Aphids breed very rapidly and can adapt to changing temperatures quickly. Their first flight is now an average of 30 days earlier than 50 years ago. Birds, butterflies and moths are appearing one to two weeks earlier.
Bell said the changing timings were affecting farming, with aphids arriving earlier but potato crops being planted later due to wetter winters. This combination meant the aphids, which transmit viruses, were attacking much younger plants. “Plants are just like babies, with very poorly developed immune systems, so when a virus is transmitted into a young potato plant it has a much greater effect,” he said.
Jon Pickup, of the Science and Advice for Scottish Agriculture division of the Scottish government, said: “As pests, it remains a concern that aphid migrations are getting earlier at a dramatic rate and this piece of work shows us that signal across the UK very clearly.”
Bell said timing mismatches were also affecting wildlife. “For example, the leafing date of the oak tree determines when the caterpillars will appear, and that determines when blue tits that feed on caterpillars lay their first egg,” he said. “If they become desynchronised, it has cascading effects through the food chain, leading to fewer eggs, and this has been seen.”
During February’s exceptionally warm weather there were sightings of rooks nesting, ladybirds mating and dozens of migratory swallows arriving along the south-west coast, all more than a month ahead of schedule.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/01/insects-have-no-place-to-hide-from-climate-change-study-warns

I don't think that this superiority complex is higher than in Britain or in the US.
BQEND
You're quite right here. Rest assured, I haven't encountered pan-European nationalism or superiority that quite rivals American, British or Australian nationalism or superiority.

BQSTART
There are merits and faults in any of them. 
BQEND
Very true.
BQSTART
you must have dealt with unpleasant people
BQEND
'Let me be clear' (as Theresa May would say lol), this was only a minority of people. Most European people whom I've met are very open-minded. Most people haven't got a sense of superiority. And one can just as easily argue that I've got a sense of superiority in shouting up the benefits of British liberalism..
BQSTART
Today, I'm not really impressed by the way two major Anglo-Saxon countries are dealing with politics, foreign relations and inner problems.
BQEND
Tell me about it. I think the United States (for all its good things) has been a terrible way from the beginning. Australia was not dissimilar in the way we treated our Indigenous people not too long ago. Still they're not treated as they deserve to be (but it's better than before).
But I do think our systems can be praised for their stability. That's one of their strengths. And I think that has everything to do with the focus on the individual (to a greater extent) than focus on social prosperity.

If you go to Germany next year, please visit in Strasbourg where I live. Just cross the Rhine river, even by bike.

I don't feel presently the rise of a European nationalism. It might of course one day. History is full of twists. What I observe, it is the emergence of a welcome sense of kinship together with, sadly, the rancid resurgence of petty nationalism in many Member States.
Now, about a sense of superiority, you must have dealt with unpleasant people. I don't think that this superiority complex is higher than in Britain or in the US. You praise the Anglo-Saxon vs the Continental approach. I would be more nuanced as there is no superior system. There are merits and faults in any of them. Today, I'm not really impressed by the way two major Anglo-Saxon countries are dealing with politics, foreign relations and inner problems. Give me the German constitution which is the most balanced one in Europe.
I understand your distrust about blocks and would-be empires. Europe, if it exists, is far from an imperial construct. Too cumbersome, too varied/quarrel-prone and too weak, humbled by its atrocious deeds in the last century and, for many of its countries, by its colonial past. Indeed, the temptation of being a big Switzerland is still very strong in our societies.
What I mean to say is that Europe (as a work in progress) is seen as a means to keep some prosperity and peace among ourselves, but above all as one to save us from our worse tendencies moderated by our neighbours' input. As such, I don't see it as a danger for others but as a safeguard for ourselves. Don't forget it is a collection of small countries who could hardly survive on their own in a world with more unified continent-sized countries such as the blocks you mentioned in your posts. You come from a huge country. France, one of the largest countries in the EU, is smaller than Texas.

Thanks for replying. Some very good points which are very thought-provoking. I'll try to engage with some of them.
BQSTART
[Europe] has a long experience of ""national"" nationalism of all sorts, that almost killed her in the last century.
BQEND
Very true. Those from the Locke, Mill school of constitutional liberalism would argue that this wouldn't have happened with robust constitutional systems in place (in France, Germany last century) in order to protect the individuals rights. This, we argue, ensures political stability and prevents the likes of Hitler coming to power.
BQSTART
The problem with Europe is that she doesn't suffer yet from a European nationalism
BQEND
Are you quite sure? I respectfully disagree with you on this point. I think it's necessary to look at it from both the outside and the inside here. I've known plenty of European people who talk about Europe with a sense of superiority (compared to the rest of the world) and think of their continent as being distinct (and thereby opposed) to the rest of the world. Think of Edward Said's works.
But let's suppose you're right- there is not yet any form of European nationalism (or supranationalism). However, the argument is for a unified European state to make sure to prevent war. Let's look take history as our guide to what the future holds.
Germany (or German states) were divided pre 1871. The Hessians fought the Prussians. Did German nationalism exist pre 1871? Not exactly, insofar as Germany wasn't a unified nation. It was more a case of Prussian nationalism. The idea of German nationalism then is comparable to European (supra)nationalism now.
Then go to 1914 ... you bet German nationalism exists, alongside French nationalism, etc.
Do you discern a pattern here?
If we simply redraw national boundaries so that they include all of Europe, that won't get rid of nationalism and war. It will simply give rise to a brand new form of nationalism - European vs the Other. So we'll have Europe vs China vs Russia vs India vs USA. And with that, the risk of war remains as strong as ever (if not stronger).
BQSTART
As a continental European, I bless the European construction for having spent a whole life in a peaceful environment which is unprecedented on our shores.
BQEND
We can be very thankful for that peace (even if we may partially disagree on what it ought be ascribed to).
BQSTART
What threatens us is not unity, it is division.
BQEND
If I may be so bold, I think this brings into sharp focus another different perspective; continental European vs Anglo-Saxon.
British liberals welcome division with open arms. Our political system thrives off it and has the flexibility to accommodate it. We do not want everybody to have the same goals, views and values.
We want plurality of opinion, voices, religions, etc. One individual may be a Thatcherite neo-liberal, another a communist. It's up to them and that's no problem. One person may be a Muslim, another a Jew and another an atheist. It's up to the individual. Our system gives primacy to their (human) rights as an individual. We welcome people from all over the world. Black, white, Vietnamese, Venezuelan, whatever. We're all human beings (that's the unity and that's what accords us our innate human rights). Beyond that, division is to be welcomed.
BQSTART
I wish you the best too. Come anytime to visit us. You will honour us by doing so.
BQEND

In parliament, no less. And what they had to say was that they wanted to take almost all their kit off and protest against climate change instead.
Time management. They probably reckoned there was more chance of the world’s politicians agreeing on plans to save the planet than anyone coming up with a Brexit solution that the government was prepared to implement.
The protest began three-quarters of an hour into the latest iteration of the indicative vote process, aka IV2, with 12 men and women in the public gallery stripping down to their pants to reveal climate change slogans on bodies that were far from beach-ready. Well, almost all of them. One bloke either lost his bottle or suddenly realised he had come out dressed commando and chose to keep his trousers on. Spoilsport.
Most rushed to the front and glued their hands to the glass barrier, while a woman, daubed in grey body paint and wearing a pair of elephant ears and trunk, indulged in some unusual interpretive dance. The police were called but didn’t seem entirely sure where to look. Or touch. So what followed was a very awkward, very British standoff. In its way, the perfect Brexit statement.
The dirty dozen would occasionally self-consciously wiggle their bums and then stop, as if waiting for something to happen. Knowing how to end a protest is always much harder than starting one. The police initially appeared to just hope the men and women would get bored and wander off, but once they realised they were going to have to get hands-on, a few officers reluctantly rolled up their sleeves.
First to be removed from the gallery was the elephant woman who got carried out horizontally while waving goodbye with her trunk. Eventually, just a man and a woman were left and officials were sent off to find some substance to remove the glue from their hands. That seemed to do the trick and, half an hour after it had begun, the protest was over. All that remained were a few stains on the glass.
Twelve semi-naked men and women in their pants was rather more entertaining and no weirder than anything else that happens in parliament these days and a few MPs greeted the disturbance as a welcome distraction. Peter Kyle snarfed about a cheeky intervention, Justine Greening asked him to flesh things out while Nick Boles wondered if Bernard Jenkin was among the protesters. Bernie’s naturism – he’s a legend in his own lunchbox – is by far his cleanest and most endearing pastime. Anything to relieve the tedium.
But mostly everyone in the chamber chose to keep their heads down and plod on. IV2 more closely resembled an IV drip of liquid valium with MPs mindlessly repeating what they had said in the first round of debates the previous Wednesday. There was little else they could do. Everything that could possibly be said about Brexit has long since been said. Again and again.
The sense of Brexit being an endless loop in space-time is now inescapable. After insisting the prime minister was keen to work constructively with parliament, Andrea Leadsom went out of her to do precisely the opposite by saying that the government would be whipping against the business motion to allow further indicative votes. Time was now of the essence and it was up to the government to run down the clock by failing to get its own deal passed and not up to MPs to try to find some kind of consensus.
Thereafter we just got stuck in an existential hell with MPs reduced to playing caricature versions of themselves. Edward Leigh merely suggested that now was not the time for the country to have a general election because the Conservatives would lose, while the Grand Wizard of Mogg himself chose to lecture the house on the meaning of shame. 
Having traded his principles for the party line and refused to take responsibility for retweeting far-right politicians, Jacob Rees-Mogg increasingly resembles the badly behaved prep school boy who has been found out by his peers and sent to the naughty step. Edward Leigh was Edward Leigh. That bad.
Things did improve when the debate proper began. But only marginally. Most MPs are sick and tired of being sick and tired. No one said anything unexpected or did much to suggest they had changed their minds. No one wanted to be the person who blinked first. Everyone was now waiting on a miracle. That never came.
The opposition benches were full at 10pm for the results of the indicative votes. The government benches were barely half-full. It was only Brexit, after all. Yet again parliament was unable to find anything which for which it was in favour. Seemingly natural allies proved to be deadly enemies, as the remainer purists outdid one another to shoot down the possibility of a soft Brexit. The Life of Brian’s Time’s Arrow once again. The People’s Front of Judea versus the Judean People’s Front. First as farce, then as tragedy.
Theresa May seemed amazed. Her deal had the flicker of a pulse. Never let the perfect be the enemy of the wee bit shit. For Nick Boles, enough was enough. Having received almost no support from his own party for his common market 2.0 option, he made an emotional speech in which he resigned the Conservative whip. It was the most effective protest of the day.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/01/wiggling-buttocks-enliven-existential-hell-of-brexit-debate

So it has a bit more experience with extreme climate than modern humans who have been around only around 200,000 years in a world that went from 180-280ppm atmospheric CO2 over about 10,000 years.
And we've done more change than that in 100 years. Around 10 times the rate of change during the PETM, 56 million years ago, which changed species and ecosystems dramatically.
Over the last two million years ( graph of the last 500 million years of global temperature ) there have been large oscillations in climate driven by very weak orbital cycles which operate on time scales of tens to hundreds of thousands of years.
These orbital cycles change the distribution of sun light on the planet. When there’s more sunlight in the North ice sheets shrink. A darker hemisphere absorbs more heat which melts more ice and causes more warming.
A warmer ocean releases CO2, and more CO2 causes more warming. So CO2, methane, and ice sheets were feedbacks that amplified global temperature change causing these ancient climate oscillations to be huge, even though the climate change was initiated by a very weak forcing.
The physics doesn’t change with our strong and rapid forcing.

They’ll soon wither, after they’ve released their payload of spores. Then forests of green, corrugated stems and whorls of thread-like leaves, shaped like miniature Christmas trees, will rise from their creeping underground stems.
It’s a prehistoric scene that could have been repeated annually since the Carboniferous period, a living reminder of geological events that produced coal, once the mainstay of the local economy.
Equisetum is considered to be the most durable plant genus, a survivor of extreme climatic events with an evolutionary history stretching back 300m years, to tropical swamps where its ancestors reached tree-like proportions. Its stems accumulate silica and decay slowly, leaving exquisite fossils.
Coal trimmers who, until 50 years ago, loaded holds of colliers a mile upriver from here at Dunston Staiths, shipping 140,000 tonnes of coal each week in the early 20th century, would have had no trouble in matching fossil imprints in their cargo with today’s plants on the quayside.
The plant’s tenacious underground stems, almost impossible to eradicate and so infuriating to gardeners, must be one reason why horsetails have survived so long. But when I took a fertile shoot home to examine under a microscope, another became obvious.
Overnight, the cone released thousands of spores, each about a 20th of a millimetre in diameter. I scraped some on to a microscope slide and, magnified 400 times, could see that each had four arms wrapped around it. These slender structures, freed at last from confinement and experiencing dry air for the first time, uncoiled into long threads, appropriately called elaters, providing aerial buoyancy to carry their spore away on a gust of wind.
The genus Equisetum has already weathered three great mass extinctions that wiped out vast swathes of life on Earth; now, burning coal from those Carboniferous swamps has contributed to climate change and it may be on the threshold of another. But it’s well prepared, with tough subterranean stems and billions of airborne spores that will surely always find safe landfall somewhere.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/03/country-diary-field-horsetail-shoots-rise-and-prepare-to-swish

Animal populations have fallen by 60% since 1970, suggesting a sixth mass extinction of life on Earth is under way, and it is very likely that carbon dioxide will have to be removed from the atmosphere to avoid the worst impacts of global warming. Trees and plants suck carbon dioxide from the air as they grow and also provide vital habitat for animals.
“The world faces two existential crises, developing with terrifying speed: climate breakdown and ecological breakdown,” the group writes in a letter to the Guardian. “Neither is being addressed with the urgency needed to prevent our life-support systems from spiralling into collapse.
“We are championing a thrilling but neglected approach to averting climate chaos while defending the living world: natural climate solutions. Defending the living world and defending the climate are, in many cases, one and the same.”
The signatories include the school strikes activist Greta Thunberg, the climate scientist Prof Michael Mann, the writers Margaret Atwood, Naomi Klein and Philip Pullman and the campaigners Bill McKibben and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall.
Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury, Mohamed Nasheed, the former president of the Maldives, and the musician Brian Eno are also among the signatories of the letter, which was instigated by the Guardian writer George Monbiot.
The group emphasises that natural climate solutions are not an alternative to the rapid decarbonisation of energy, transport and farming. Both are needed, the campaigners say.
The United Nations announced a Decade of Ecosystem Restoration at the start of March. “The degradation of our ecosystems has had a devastating impact on both people and the environment,” said Joyce Msuya, the head of the UN Environment Programme. “Nature is our best bet to tackle climate change and secure the future.”
Recent research indicates that about a third of the greenhouse gas reductions needed by 2030 can be provided by the restoration of natural habitats, but such solutions have attracted just 2.5% of the funding for tackling emissions.
The greatest impact is likely to come from the restoration of forests, particularly areas in the tropics that were razed for cattle ranching, palm oil plantations and timber. But natural climate solutions must not compete with the need to feed the world’s growing population, the letter says, and must be implemented with the consent of local communities.
Effective ways of restoring habitat often overlap with the conservation of wildlife, the group says. Boosting the populations of forest elephants and rhinos in Africa and Asia would help spread the seeds of trees that have a high carbon content, for example, while more wolves would lead to fewer plants being eaten by moose.
The fastest accumulation of carbon occurs in vegetated coastal habitats such as mangroves, saltmarshes and seagrass beds, research shows, which also protect communities from storms. Here, carbon can be sequestered 40 times faster than in tropical forests. Peatlands must also be protected and restored, the group says, as they store one-third of all soil carbon despite covering just 3% of the world’s land.
Other suggested ways of removing carbon dioxide from the air include burning wood to generate electricity and burying the emissions, but to work at scale this would require vast amounts of land.
A website, Natural Climate Solutions, is launched on Wednesday calling on governments to back such measures and “to create a better world for wildlife and a better world for people”.

The study, ahead of a historic vote at the UN, sets out the first detailed plan of how countries can protect over a third of the world’s oceans by 2030, a target scientists and policy makers say is crucial in order to safeguard marine ecosystems and help mitigate the impacts of a rapidly heating world.
“The speed at which the high seas have been depleted of some of their most spectacular and iconic wildlife has taken the world by surprise,” said co-author Prof Callum Roberts from the University of York.
“This report shows how protected areas could be rolled out across international waters to create a net of protection that will help save species from extinction and help them survive in our fast-changing world.”
The campaign to protect to protect 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030 was backed by the UK government last year. The environment secretary, Michael Gove, welcomed the report, which is the result of a year-long collaboration between academics at York and Oxford universities and environmental group Greenpeace.
“From climate change to overfishing, the world’s oceans are facing an unprecedented set of challenges,” said Gove. “It is now more important than ever to take action and ensure our seas are healthy, abundant and resilient. I join Greenpeace in calling for the UK and other countries to work together towards a UN High Seas Treaty that would pave the way to protect at least 30% of the world’s ocean by 2030.”
Experts say that in addition to a wealth of marine life and complex ecosystems, the high seas – those waters beyond national boundaries – play a key role in regulating the earth’s climate, driving the ocean’s biological pump that captures huge amounts of carbon at the surface and stores it in the oceans’ depths. Without this process, they warn the atmosphere would contain 50% more carbon dioxide and become too hot to support human life.
However, in recent decades, oceans have faced growing exploitation from a handful of mainly wealthy nations with intensive fishing and deep seabed mining combining with climate change, acidification and pollution to put marine ecosystems under serious threat – with potentially devastating consequences for the survival of humanity.
The report breaks global oceans – which cover almost half the planet – into 25,000 squares of 100x100 km, and then maps 458 different conservation features including wildlife, habitats and key oceanographic features. Finally academics have modelled hundreds of scenarios for what a planet-wide network of ocean sanctuaries, free from harmful human activity, would look like.
The move comes as the UN is hammering out the details of a new Global Ocean Treaty – a legal framework which would allow the creation of high seas ocean sanctuaries. The first of four UN meetings was held in September 2018, and a final decision on the treaty is expected next year.
Report co-author Prof Alex Rogers, from the University of Oxford, said: “Creating marine reserves is critical to protecting and conserving the diversity of marine life. The report puts forward a credible design for a global network of marine protected areas in the high seas based on knowledge accumulated over years by marine ecologists on the distribution of species, including those threatened with extinction, habitats known to be hotspots of biodiversity and unique ecosystems.”
Speaking from negotiations at the UN, Dr Sandra Schoettner from Greenpeace’s global ocean sanctuaries campaignsaid climate change, ocean acidification, overfishing and pollution, meant oceans “are under threat like never before”.
“We urgently need to protect at least a third of our oceans by 2030, and what’s so exciting about this research is that it shows it is entirely possible to design and create a robust, planet-wide network of ocean sanctuaries,” she said.
“This is a blueprint for ocean protection that would safeguard the full spectrum of marine life, help tackle the crisis facing our oceans and enable their recovery.”
Schoettner said passing a UN Ocean Treaty next year would be a huge step in creating a sustainable planet as long as it has “the teeth to realise a network of ocean sanctuaries” that were “off-limits to harmful human activities”.
“This would give wildlife and habitats space not only to recover but to flourish,” said Schoettner. “Our oceans are in crisis, but all we need is the political will to protect them before it’s too late.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/04/campaign-to-save-oceans-maps-out-global-network-of-sanctuaries

Campaigners accuse Ineos, owned by the UK’s richest man, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, of endangering the wellbeing of future generations through its fracking activities and plastics production.
On Saturday the executive of the National Education Union will debate a call for the schools to oppose Ineos’s sponsorship of the event, which sees tens of thousands of children take part in an outdoor run each week.
The campaign is being supported by the UK Student Climate Network, which helped coordinate the recent school strikes that saw more than a million young people take part in demonstrations over the escalating global warming crisis.
Anna Taylor, 18, co-founder of the group, said: “Climate criminals like Ineos, with their fracking for plastics agenda, are already destroying our environment and fuelling climate change for profit.
“Allowing them unfettered access to classrooms and attempting to normalise their fossil fuels ‘extractivism’ with our generation is totally and utterly unacceptable and must be outlawed.”
The Daily Mile is promoted as “a social physical activity, with children running or jogging – at their own pace – in the fresh air with friends”. But campaigners say its promotion of “fresh air and a healthy lifestyle” is at odds with the reality of Ineos’s operations.
Two primary schools in Strensall and Copmanthorpe, York – both of which are within areas licensed for fracking – have withdrawn form the Daily Mile after the link was highlighted by local campaigners.
Adrian Palmer, a parent from the Copmanthorpe school, said: “Our schools are unwittingly falling foul of these Ineos PR stunts as they don’t have time to research and make the connection between the Daily Mile and its controversial petrochemical fracking company backers … Having this Ineos PR in our schools is akin to a tobacco company sponsoring the school’s sports day.”
An Ineos spokesperson said: “Ineos has supported the Daily Mile for many years and has seen this project grow from modest beginnings to a global success. We are proud of the role we have played in this growth and we intend to go on supporting the charity, which helps improve children’s health and wellbeing across the world.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/05/ineos-daily-mile-sponsorship-teaching-union

On the flip side, “129 million trees have died across the state [California] due to drought and bark beetles since 2010”
This is at 1 degree C above preindustrial temperature and a former head of the IPCC science assessment unit, David Griggs, said recently that he thinks we are going to warm the planet substantially above 2 degrees C.
Perhaps someone could also address the fact that trees are part of short term carbon cycles and we’re disrupting long term carbon cycles by burning fossil fuels laid down over hundreds of millions of years in a few hundred years.

The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has been on a relentless upward trend but things would be far worse if countries in the northern hemisphere were not planting forests and restoring natural habitats. Measurements taken over 60 years of the uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during the growing season show that, north of the equator, plants are absorbing more carbon than they used to.
This is not enough to halt global warming but it is at least slowing it down. The increase in uptake became apparent in the 1990s but has again grown significantly since the turn of the century. Sadly, this has not been replicated in the southern hemisphere, where many tropical forests are still being destroyed at an alarming rate. The figures from the north have surprised scientists, who had not anticipated this so-called carbon sink in their climate models. Some contributions are from the use of extra fertiliser in Asia, but the scientists believe that the main driver is the growth of young forests, particularly in China and North America, which is locking the carbon in young trees. It proves that planting trees and restoring forests works.

The billionaire co-founder and chief executive of Australian software company Atlassian is announcing on Wednesday the company will become 100% renewable by 2025.
Atlassian is the third Australian company, and first tech company, to make the pledge as part of the RE100, a global initiative to get big corporations to commit to 100% renewable electricity.
“Australia has the highest household solar take-up in the world. So households, you would argue, are doing their bit,” Cannon-Brookes said.
“I think Australian corporations could be doing more to set great examples … so we hope to start a bit of a trend there and set an example as an Australian company.”
Cannon-Brookes has a huge social media following and has used that profile to take Australian political parties to task on matters related to energy policy and cutting carbon pollution. He famously prompted Tesla boss Elon Musk in a Twitter exchange to promise he could build a 100MW battery for South Australia’s power network in 100 days or he would deliver it free. Last week, Cannon-Brookes defended Labor’s EV proposal in the face of a Coalition campaign against it.
Scott Morrison had tried to attack Labor’s policy by claiming “Bill Shorten wants to end the weekend” for Australians who love four-wheel drives. But the government’s own modelling for how it will achieve its obligations under the Paris agreement assume a similar target and the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, spoke enthusiastically about EVs when he was the environment minister.
“The last few days we’ve seen the Liberal party tying themselves in knots on EVs,” Cannon-Brookes said.
“Six months ago and 12 months ago they were highly supportive and today they’re not and their press releases from five months ago look really silly.
“Fifty per cent by 2030 is not ambitious. I think that will be very achievable…Most of the automakers are charging hard in this direction.”
Cannon-Brookes likened Morrison’s weekend remarks to past comments by Barnaby Joyce that inaccurately claimed Labor’s carbon price would push the price of a lamb roast to $100.
He said the government’s sudden attacks also weakened the appearance of the work it had done in this area by investing millions to build a rapid charging network for electric vehicles.
“That’s taxpayer money, so either the taxpayer money was wasted or it was sensibly spent and we have a charging network. You can’t have it both ways.”
Cannon-Brookes said the science and economics of taking action on climate change were aligned and he expected that after Australia’s summer of natural disasters it would be a dominant issue for voters in May.
He said Labor’s climate policy, including its 45% emissions reduction target, “is a pretty sensible package. I don’t think it’s ambitious but it’s certainly a very good step forward for a major party.”
But he thought any government needed to develop a policy to reach net zero emissions, with clear steps for how to get there over time.
“I do think there’s a lot of climate anger out there. I think it will be a heavily climate-dominated election,” he said. “It’s not an issue that’s going to turn around the other way.”
Atlassian has 10 offices it will need to make fully renewable to reach its 100% target. Some of its offices, such as its Mountain View office in California, are already there.
Cannon-Brookes said the company would also look at energy use in some of its indirect operations, such as its cloud data centres.
“We’ve done all the maths and we think we can get there across all our sites by 2025, that’s why we’ve put the target and we’re going to make it,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/apr/10/coalition-tying-themselves-in-knots-on-electric-vehicles-mike-cannon-brookes-says

The Earth will be around.
However, the window of opportunity for changing the direction of the trend in CO2 emissions is about right - globally, the CO2 concentration graph needs to start turning within a decade or so.
The current rate of rise in CO2 is faster than during the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum.
The fossil record in rocks formed around the equator during the PETM is really poor, and that's an indication that life in the tropics was extremely stressed.
New research:
""Temporal Scaling of Carbon Emission and Accumulation Rates: Modern Anthropogenic Emissions Compared to Estimates of PETM‐Onset Accumulation"" - Gingerich, 2019
confirms and builds on what was already known about the PETM:

""The Paleocene‐Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) is a global greenhouse warming event that happened 56 million years ago, causing extinction in the world's oceans and accelerated evolution on the continents.......

Without that, his idea was no more than an idea; it did not have enough evidence to support it.

The key discoveries that turned a very loose concept of continental drift into plate tectonics were only possible after the development of new technology.
The ocean floors, with their spreading ridges, and trenches over subduction zones, got sorted out in the 1950s (following the development of excellent sonar in WW2, plus magnetometry).
The key detail of the interior (the Low Velocity Zone/aesthenosphere) was discovered at the end of the same decade (following the setting up of high quality seismic networks to detect nuclear tests).
The LVZ allowed for lateral movement of crust, which had been the most important problem with continental drift.

They pride themselves on leading global treaties like the Paris accord and decry Trump’s announcement that America will pull out. So it’s more than a little ironic when the continent that seemed to be steering the process is, in fact, lagging badly behind America — even as a climate change–denier occupies the White House and dinosaur conservative lawmakers continue to ignore the crisis and the policies required to deal with it.
Despite Trump’s reckless dismissal of recent dire warnings from the IPCC and 13 federal agencies predicting the disastrous impacts of accelerated climate change — increased droughts, fires, super storms and floods; mass crop failure and water scarcity, and hundreds of millions of people displaced by rising seas; and projected costs of more than $500 billion annually to the U.S. economy alone — the U.S. managed to slash its CO2 emissions by 42 million tons in 2016–’17. It was the largest cut of any nation. By contrast, in the same period, the E.U. increased its CO2 emissions by 43 million tons — the world’s fourth-highest rise, behind China (120 million tons), India (93 million tons) and Turkey (45 million tons). From 2014 to 2017, U.S. emissions fell by 5%, while E.U. emissions grew by 3%.
Going back to the 1997 Kyoto protocol, and up until just a few years ago, Europe was considered the boldest decision maker when it came to setting carbon-cutting goals; as former European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said in 2014: “No player in the world is as ambitious as the E.U.” How did the tables turn so quickly on Europe’s clean energy leaders? It’s certainly not the result of climate-friendly policies advanced by team Trump or the Republicans. Instead, it’s economics, plain and simple: American utilities, investors and energy companies understood last decade that coal no longer makes long-term financial sense due to price-competitive alternatives, so they jumped on the low-cost gas and renewables train to move a greater share of the U.S. economy toward cleaner power. The country has since seen a raft of coal plant closures and a flood of cheap gas and renewables enter the market. Which is to say that emissions regulations didn’t drive the change — money did. In the process, the industry has saved consumers money, lowered emissions and laid the groundwork for a more sustainable energy future.
In 2017, we suggested that Donald Trump could become an “accidental climate hero” thanks to the rapid replacement of coal with renewables and gas. We didn’t think our prediction would bear out this quickly. But as the U.S. climate delegation reveals its numbers this week in Poland at COP24 — a follow-up to the Paris accords — it will be hard to argue against Trump’s hands-off, free-market strategy that has done more than Europe’s regulatory and subsidy framework to fight climate change. America’s clean-energy transition was already well underway when Trump took office; between 2014 and 2017, 34 Gigawatts of coal-fired power plants were retired, assisted though not driven by Obama-era tax credits for wind and solar projects. Now, a record-breaking 16 Gigawatts of coal plants have been taken offline in the U.S. this year alone, the equivalent of powering 12 million homes, while the country’s overall coal power emissions have fallen by one-third since 2010.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1554906368000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'price competitive alternatives', u'effect': u'long term financial sense'}], u'author_id': u'14548114', u'in_reply_to': u'127939164', u'id': u'127943649', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'GiftedTryHarder', u'text': u'I rather think that Mt St Helens had more to do with late 20th Century Climate than the Montreal Protocol.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1554908347000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'18320617', u'in_reply_to': u'127944708', u'id': u'127945234', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'rockyrex', u'text': u'Please cite published scientific papers that made those predictions for the year 2019 or earlier.

Time to get radical before it's too late | Bill McKibben,article,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/10/glaciers-arctic-ice-vanishing-radical-politics,0,"Forget “early warning signs” and “canaries in coalmines” – we’re now well into the middle of the climate change era, with its epic reshaping of our home planet. Monday’s news, from two separate studies, made it clear that the frozen portions of the Earth are now in violent and dramatic flux.
The first, led by the veteran Greenland glaciologist Jason Box, looked across the Arctic at everything from “increased tundra biomass” to deepening thaw of the permafrost layer. Their conclusion: “the Arctic biophysical system is now clearly trending away from its 20th century state and into an unprecedented state, with implications not only within but beyond the Arctic.” To invent a word, the north is rapidly slushifying, with more rainfall and fewer days of hard freeze; the latest data shows that after a month of record temperatures in the Bering Sea, ocean ice in the Arctic is at an all-time record low for the date, crushing the record set … last April.
The other study looked at the great mountain ranges of the planet, and found that their glaciers were melting much faster than scientists had expected. By the end of the century many of those alpine glaciers would be gone entirely; the Alps may lose 90% of their ice. From the Caucasus to the South Island of New Zealand, mountains are losing more than 1% of their ice each year now: “At the current glacier loss rate, the glaciers will not survive the century,” said Michael Zemp, who runs the World Glacier Monitoring Service from his office at the University of Zurich.
The respectable have punted; so now it’s up to the scruffy, the young, the marginal, the angry to do the necessary work
One could list the “consequences” of these changes in great detail. They range from the catastrophic (Andean cities with no obvious source of water supply once the glaciers have melted) to the merely bitter (no one is going to die from a lack of skiing, but to lose the season when friction disappears will make many lives sadder). For the moment, though, don’t worry about the “effects”, just focus on what it means that some of the largest systems on Earth are now in seismic shift.
What it means, I think, is that no one should be shocked when Extinction Rebellion activists engage in mass civil disobedience. No one should be annoyed when school kids start leaving class en masse. No one should be surprised that Green New Deal advocates are now calling for dramatic overhaul of American society. In fact we should be deeply grateful: these activists, and the scientists producing these reports, are the only people on the planet who seem to understand the scale of the problem.
Not our political leaders. Obviously not Trump, but even most of the theoretically engaged premiers and presidents let themselves constantly be distracted by much smaller questions. (Brexit would seem like a silly charade at the best of times; at the moment it seems actively obscene). Not our business leaders, who make occasional greenwashing noises but continue passively belonging to organizations like the Chamber of Commerce that continue to fight serious change. Not those pension fund trustees still clinging to fossil fuel stocks even as they lose money.
The respectable have punted; so now it’s up to the scruffy, the young, the marginal, the angry to do the necessary work. Their discipline and good humor and profound nonviolence are remarkable, from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to Greta Thunberg. They are what’s left of our fighting chance.
The biggest physical features on the planet are now changing in ways they haven’t since long before the dawn of human history. On the most distant poles, and on the highest peaks, we see almost unfathomable shifts. The only question is whether a similar shift is possible in our politics. Planet Earth is miles outside its comfort zone; how many of us will go beyond ours?

Speaking at a candidates’ forum hosted by the local environment group Lighter Footprints at Hawthorn Arts Centre on Thursday night, Frydenberg said the project still had to pass nine more approvals after the environment minister, Melissa Price, granted the latest approval on Tuesday, of which he said the “most fundamental” were with the Queensland government.
“In this case on the water issue, we took the advice of the CSIRO, of Geosciences Australia, and that is why it has gone to the next stage,” he said.
Labor has indicated it may push for a review of the approval decision because the timing of the election announcement meant a planned estimates hearing where the CSIRO would explain the extent of its advice did not go ahead.
The Adani coalmine is expected to cause difficulties for Frydenberg in Kooyong. Of the six candidates at the forum – also there were Labor’s Jana Stewart, the Greens’ Julian Burnside and the independents Oliver Yates, Bill Chandler and Angelina Zubac – he was the only one who did not criticise the project.
About a quarter of the 260 questions submitted by the audience in the packed venue were about Adani.
Yates, a former Liberal party member and chief executive of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, said the project had lost all social licence.
“For a government that represents its people and for a member who represents this audience to be continuing to support a project that its electors in this area do not support is an extraordinary position for a local member to take,” he said.
Burnside said suggestions that voters in Kooyong would vote solely on economic rather than environmental issues was “a mark of the contempt with which the Liberal party see this electorate”.
“They can’t even imagine the possibility that this electorate would turf them out.”
He dismissed concerns of sovereign risk over the Adani project as “a meaningless expression as a matter of law”.
“I would say if there’s a contract which Adani could enforce I would hold to account those members of the outgoing Liberal government who signed the contract,” he said.
Yates, Burnside and Chandler had the strongest support from the crowd.
Stewart said she “personally [didn’t] agree with Adani” but that Labor would take a “balanced approach”, prompting Chandler to hop to his feet and step from side to side, saying: “This is Labor jumping from one foot to another on Adani, they keep moving on it all the time.”
At a separate climate change forum in Mildura, the Nationals candidate for the western Victorian seat of Mallee, Anne Webster, engaged in some heavy product differentiation from her Queensland party colleagues.
“The only people I’m beholden to are the voters of the Mallee electorate,” she said.
“Some of you possibly thought I would come tonight and talk about climate change not being real … I want to assure you that I make up my own mind, have my own opinions and I’m not afraid to stand up to others.”
While four independent candidates at the forum emphatically panned the Adani project, Webster said: “Renewables ought to be our focus.”
She said she would not be afraid to cross the floor of parliament on a range of issues.
Webster is seeking to continue the Nationals’ hold over the seat after it was vacated by Andrew Broad following allegations of inappropriate conduct during an official government trip overseas.
The forum was divided on whether there needed to be a federal royal commission into the Murray-Darling basin plan, with Webster and the independent Cecilia Moar, a former farmer, opposed, and the independents Jason Modica, Allen Ridgeway and Ray Kingston in support.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/apr/12/josh-frydenberg-back-foot-adani-kooyong-mallee-election-forum

The 2025 target, of course, doesn't address the issue of retrofitting all the existing homes and other buildings that have gas heating (& hot water)

If it is successful it will be costly for the demonstrators, some of whom plan to be arrested, burdensome for bus passengers who can’t get to work, and vexing for car drivers who (unlike those in emergency vehicles) will be held up. And yet, should it fail, the long-term costs of climate change will be immense for almost everybody now alive and for all our descendents, too.
In the short term, the rage of the frustrated motorist remains one of the most powerful political forces in countries like ours. The gilets jaunes movement in France started off in part as a protest against price rises on petrol; the Blair government sustained its first big defeat at the hands of lorry drivers in the fuel protests of 2000, which destroyed a sensible and ecologically necessary plan to raise fuel taxes steadily over time to discourage the use of fossil fuels.
Any movement towards ecological sanity will have to confront this anger. The drivers’ blockades were effective direct action in support of the destruction of the planet. The challenge today is to find means of direct action that work towards its preservation while winning the same kind of social acceptance and political force.
The idea that we can change the whole basis of our planetary economy without pain and inconvenience for the global middle classes is simply false. The enormous political challenge is to ensure that the pain of adjustment towards a carbon-neutral economy is fairly distributed. At the moment the pain is concentrated on those least able to bear it. This is true between countries, in as much as it is sub-Saharan Africa where the destabilising effects of climate change are most visible and painful. It is also true within the rich countries which consume more than they sustainably can. In the west it is the poor who will be hit worst by rising prices for food and fuel. Yet a future of less consumption and less convenience is inevitable. We can choose to some extent how and when to face it, but it cannot be indefinitely postponed.
The purpose of climate activism is to make that choice consciously and deliberately, with planning and forethought, rather than have it forced upon us in a series of improvisations between catastrophes. The activists of Extinction Rebellion use the metaphor of war, and this is not entirely exaggerated. Although one of the purposes of groups like Extinction Rebellion is to avert wars over resources, this may – paradoxically – require the kind of social and political mobilisation only otherwise seen in wartime. The sense of a common purpose, and of suffering borne in common, which has so often and so fraudulently been invoked in the rhetoric of the political right since the financial crisis must now be appropriated and given real meaning.
Yet it is not enough for climate change to remain solely a cause of the left. This is a cause that must ultimately transcend left-right distinctions. To achieve such an escape from traditional politics will not be easy. It will be fiercely resisted, because there are many powerful forces that benefit, in the short term, from smugness and inaction. But the movement needs to isolate and expose them.
The protests are intended as the start of a global movement, as they must be. By themselves, they will accomplish little. Yet the longest journey begins with the first step – even if this is the step taken by a driver who climbs out of their gridlocked car and tries to find some other way of continuing their journey.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/14/the-guardian-view-on-extinction-rebellion-one-small-step

I disagree.
Over the last 20-30 years we have seen many attempts at education surrounding climate change where those attempts have had huge world wide coverage..
A few examples for you.
1. David Attenborough has done many documentaries that have charted the way that climate change is changing the planet. One he did was called Are We Changing Planet Earth?  which was filmed over 10 years ago in 2006.
Another one he did was called State of the planet and was released around 20 years ago.
2. Al Gore has played a major global role in raising awareness of the dangers of climate change since his 2007 film An Inconvenient TruthAn Inconvenient TruthAn Inconvenient Truth.
3. NASA has repeatedly released photos of the melting ice caps. They have even released time laps photos of the melting ice caps. The first images I remember seeing personally was on the news back in the late 1980s.
4. The number of news articles that we have seen on climate change over the last 30 or so years is not small by any means. The number of times we have seen freak weather events reported where the news has claimed that climate change is increasing the frequency of the these events is also not small by any means.
5. According to some sources climate change is already being taught in schools as the following quote points out
BQSTART
Geography teachers will rightly point to the unequivocal requirements within the geography national curriculum and its GCSE and A level specifications that pupils learn about our climate and how it has changed – alongside wider environmental and ecological issues.
BQEND
https://www.tes.com/news/climate-change-already-taught-schools
The films that two individuals I have mentioned have made have had global coverage and yet here we are with some people still claiming that education is what is needed.
I could find many more examples of high profile figures that have made films around climate change than just these two.
Now if the high profile figures that I have mentioned here have not managed to turn education around climate change into action what practical use is handing out a few leaflets going to achieve?
Our own government have a woeful record on tackling climate change. Despite the fact that it is one of the most pressing issues facing our own country and the wider world at large the number of debates that our own government have had on the issue over the last 6-10 years has been staggeringly bad.
If our democratically elected representatives who are supposed to be amongst the most educated people in our country are willing to sweep this issue under the carpet then how on earth is more education going to help?
I would argue that it is not education that we need as most people have at least a basic understanding that climate change is going to have a huge effect on us all. Most people are fully aware that runaway climate change has the potential to wipe out our species.
What we really need is positive action to tackle climate change. We need to force our governments to take the needed action to tackle the issue rather than allow them to sweep it under the carpet. More education is not going to ensure that our government gets off its backside and deals with the issue.', u'recommendation_count': u'19', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1555351011000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'10085855', u'in_reply_to': u'128093553', u'id': u'128096823', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'mf m', u'text': u'What's your suggestion?', u'recommendation_count': u'2', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1555350297000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'100368422', u'in_reply_to': u'128094146', u'id': u'128096547', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'OnMeBiker', u'text': u'Irony.

You had to refuse that they take fingerprints and they had to get a court order, which they never got round to in those days, though in order to justify their existence now in our police state I guess this could have changed and DNA tests taken, which of course is worse than fingerprints.
My experience of the law taught me not to get  stuffing the police state, and that the police are lazy, inefficient, and stupid.

I was being led from the front wheel of a deportation charter flight that I’d helped blockade at Stansted airport in March 2017. There were 15 of us in total, four around the wheel and 10 around a tripod behind the left wing. One of our number had been arrested before locking on. As an officer put handcuffs on me and walked me to the waiting bus, he started to arrest me. “I am arresting you on suspicion of aggravated trespass. You do not have to say anything – ”. When I rounded the corner, glimpsing the collection of my fellow activists, who I’d not seen since we’d cut through the fence many hours before, we all cheered, obscuring the words. Once I was arrested though, and sat alone in a police cell for hours on end, those cheers rang hollow. When we were released, and eventually charged with a terrorism-related offence – one carrying a maximum sentence of life imprisonment – that jubilance was replaced by endless worry, stress and pain.
We must be wary of glorifying arrests and incarceration as the only valid way of engaging with a movement
Today, and in the coming days, weeks and months, hundreds – perhaps thousands – of activists hope to be arrested. Some hope to go to prison. They are part of Extinction Rebellion, a group seeking urgent action on climate change in the 12 years we have left to avert cataclysmic ecological breakdown. As part of their International Rebellion, they are seeking to “shut down” areas of central London today for as long as possible to “disrupt the ‘business as usual’ which is sending our species on a one way track to extinction”.
These are laudable and righteous aims, ones that I agree with. There is no doubt in my mind that we need to move faster on climate change. Nor is there any doubt that most people would quite like to avoid a mass extinction event. Underneath it all, though, I can’t help but feel deeply concerned.
In a recent video for the Guardian, the founder of the group, Roger Hallam, tells a police officer that “arrests aren’t happening quickly enough”. Later, he’s seen telling a town hall meeting that “letters, emailing, marches don’t work. You need about 400 people to go to prison. About two to three thousand people to be arrested.” After a blood-pouring action outside Downing Street, protesters bemoaned the lack of arrests. In a recent article, one protester talks about giving up their training as a dancer to devote their full time to activism.
There’s undoubtedly something sexy about direct action. As activists we spend our life trying to agitate for change in a system built to resist it. Wins are rare, and the day-to-day grind of trying to transform the world into a better place – one that works for everyone – bears down on all of us. To take part in something material, that feels real, as if you’re actually doing something, is overwhelmingly attractive. But the reality is, direct action and becoming entombed in the endless bureaucracy of our glacial criminal justice system because of it, should make up only a tiny portion of our work as activists.
There is an inherent privilege in being able to be arrested for protesting. The hugely disproportionate number of BAME people in prisons for relatively minor offences shouldn’t be underestimated here. To have people like Roger Hallam speaking of prison so casually undermines those who are the poorest or most oppressed in our society whose lives are ripped apart by it.
There isn’t a day that goes by that I don’t feel guilty about our trial and subsequent conviction (no pun intended). Not because what we did was wrong – far from it. But because even though 11 people remain in Britain because of our action, the two years that followed the action saw an unfathomable amount of resources, time, money and energy from across the movement poured into helping us fight our case, to helping us stay afloat, and avoid a life incarcerated. It took valuable resources away from those at the sharp edges of the hostile environment that we were protesting about.
This is the issue with Extinction Rebellion’s ethos. The notion that 2,000 arrests will evoke the kind of systemic change needed to fight climate change is naive at best. At a time when the government has cracked down on protest, to not see that this could go the other way, and be used simply as a way of increasing already draconian anti-protest legislation and prosecutions, is shortsighted and irresponsible. But beyond that, the cost to individual activists, and the movement as a whole, would be huge.
That so many people are involved and excited about activism is great – but we must be wary of glorifying arrests and incarceration as the only valid way of engaging with a movement. A movement, particularly one seeking to change society as we know it, should not be a coterie of privileged activists who can afford the expense and time getting arrested. 
It should be about as many people as possible being brought on board. About making noise from all parts of society that’s so deafening, there is no option for those in power but to listen to our demands. It remains a mystery how wrapping up a whole new generation of activists in lengthy and costly court battles will achieve the changes we so urgently need.

These are some of the findings from the Grattan Institute’s Orange Book published on Tuesday night, which sets policy reform priorities for the next government and rates Australia’s performance in areas such as health, housing, education, and energy.
There is also a crisis of trust in politicians, the report says, which over time risked undermining representative democracy.
“Australian cynicism is now at an all time high ... Widespread loss of trust can make legislating policy change more complex, because it is harder for governments without political capital to enact ‘difficult but necessary’ reforms,” the report says.
“While there are many causes of falling trust and exasperation with the political establishment, one is the growing sense that people in government look after their own interests, or those of powerful groups, rather than the public interest.”
Grattan chief executive and lead author of the report John Daly said there were some positives, with retirement incomes generally sufficient [except for renters], and affordable health and education. But on many social issues, Australia rated poorly.
“These are evidence-based policy recommendations designed to serve the interests of all Australians rather than sectional interests,” Daly said.
The report says the next federal government should focus on tax reform, with some current tax arrangements “a big drag on economic growth”.
Income tax should be reduced, while welfare and childcare means tests should be modified to remove barriers and increase incentives for women and older people to participate in the workforce.
The report says that to pay for these changes and avoid other tax increases, the capital gains tax discount should be cut from 50% to 25%, while negative gearing should be wound back through quarantining wage and salary income so that passive investment losses can only be written off against other investment income. The GST should also be increased or broadened.
To increase workforce participation of older Australians, the report suggests investigating the costs and benefits of raising the pension age to 70.
Despite a push from various politicians for people to look beyond major cities and move to regional and rural areas, the Grattan Institute says the federal government should instead be lobbying the states to change planning laws to allow more medium-density housing in established suburbs.
“It is not that people will not move to the regions: they did so in large numbers when the mining investment boom presented attractive job opportunities. However, it seems that the living and employment conditions currently on offer in some regional areas are not attractive enough to Australians to induce more internal or overseas migrants.”
Carolyn Whitzman. a professor of urban planning at the university of Melbourne, said people would always prefer to live where jobs and opportunities were.
“The strong preference is always going to be for the central city and there is a certain lock-the-gate aspect, with lots of people moving into the cities and then saying ‘there’s no more room’.
“This issue isn’t a failure of immigration policy; it’s a failure of planning.”
The Orange Book calls for a universal dental care scheme, and a comprehensive review of the private health sector, including private health insurance.
It says rates of complications and questionable care in hospitals should be made public, a move also being called for by the Consumers Health Forum.
The report said pharmacists should be able to provide repeat prescriptions with the agreement of doctors and patients, and work with doctors to help patients manage chronic conditions. But it said overall, the health system was affordable and resulting in Australians living longer.
A health policy analyst with the Centre for Policy Development, Jennifer Doggett, said the Grattan report needed to be stronger on health equity.
“Yes, our health system performs well overall but the gap between those of us who get the best outcomes and those who miss out is huge. The gap between the life expectancy of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and non-Indigenous people means that Indigenous Australians have a life expectancy less than that of people in North Korea,” she said.
“This is not just a health system problem but part of the solution needs to involve an explicit focus within the health system on addressing inequity.”
She said though the health system worked well “on paper” this was partly due to the uncounted time and resources that consumers and their carers were forced to contribute to coordinating and managing their care.
Doggett welcomed the call for powerful lobby groups to be held to account but said that would involve the government of the day taking on these groups. “It is not clear that either side of politics is prepared to do this,” she said.
The government must “finish the job” on school funding by reintroducing the demand-driven higher education system, and control costs by increasing repayment of HELP debt.
It also says entry into teaching should be made more prestigious, partly by pushing for prospective teachers to have an Atar (Australian tertiary admission rank) of about 80 or above. Prospective students should also be given more information about their chances of course completion, the report says. “Dis-enrol students who are not engaged with their studies so they don’t incur HELP debt.”
The deputy opposition leader Tanya Plibersek has said if universities did not move to lift standards, a Labor government would move to make Atar caps mandatory.
New school reform initiatives should be avoided unless evidence shows they are a good idea, and any government intervention should help and not hinder, the report said.
A co-author of the Grattan report, Dr Peter Goss, said over the course of decades the academic backgrounds of teachers had weakened.
“As a result of feminism women had more career choices so bright women were no longer pushed into teaching, which is great, but not good for schools,” Goss said.
“We’re concerned less about how do you cut off the lowest-ranked teachers, and much more concerned about how to send a signal to young people that education is a course for high achievers and career opportunities.”
The report calls for a code of conduct to be introduced for all parliamentarians on conflicts of interest. A Commonwealth Integrity Commission should be established to investigate corrupt and high-risk misconduct in the public sector, and investigate tip-offs.
“Cap expenditure on political advertising during election campaigns, and lower the donations disclosure threshold to $5,000,” the report says. “Require political parties to aggregate donations below the threshold, and introduce ‘real time’ disclosure of donations. Publish ministerial diaries.”
All lobbyists who enter parliament house should be subject to the Lobbying Code of Conduct, which should be enforced by criminal penalties, the report says.
The report urges the incoming government to develop a credible climate change policy.
“Our political leaders must be honest with voters: Australia needs to move to a low-emissions economy, and that transition will cost money,” the report says. “A raft of reforms to electricity generation, distribution and retailing are also required to push down energy costs.”
While economy-wide carbon price would be the best way to reduce emissions, in the absence of the political consensus needed to implement the best policy, “we should work with what we have,” it says.
“The work of the past two years means the incoming federal government, whether Coalition or Labor, will have the content and should have the political opportunity to introduce a stable and credible emissions reduction policy for the electricity sector. Reverting to subsidies and direct government funding would almost certainly be less effective and less efficient.”

Flagging the party’s readiness to negotiate over energy policy if Labor wins the election, the Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young said the party was not afraid to use its numbers on the crossbench to extract stronger commitments from Bill Shorten on the environment.
The Labor leader has announced a baseline and credit scheme for polluters emitting more than 25,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year using the existing safeguard mechanism, but the party has also promised to provide concessions to trade-exposed heavy industries such as steel, aluminium and LNG.
The Greens, whose support may be critical for Labor to pass its climate policy through the Senate even if it wins a majority in the House of Representatives, say the scheme does not go far enough. It wants Labor to scrap plans to allow polluters to buy carbon credits from overseas, while also forcing them to pay for their damage to the environment.
The party is also pushing for a ban on all new coal mines, and wants existing approvals for the controversial Adani project reviewed.
The Greens climate change spokesman, Adam Bandt, has already expressed frustration with the shadow climate change spokesman, Mark Butler, who declared before the election was called the Australian parliament must end the current stalemate and back Labor’s climate policy in the event of a Shorten victory, otherwise politicians will betray the next generation. Bandt says Labor is in no position to issue ultimatums.
Hanson-Young, who is fighting to keep her South Australian Senate position at next month’s election, will unveil the Greens’ environment policy on Wednesday along with leader Richard Di Natale .
The centrepiece of the policy is the new nature fund, which would invest $2bn a year to protect Australian flora and fauna from invasive species, create new safe havens for threatened mammals and fund the development of recovery plans for at-risk species. The fund will also pay for 10,000 qualified “environment managers”, and boost the number of Indigenous rangers.
“In any negotiation with Labor over climate and the environment, we are going to be putting front and centre our extinction crisis and the need to protect and restore our environment,” Hanson-Young told Guardian Australia.
“What we are putting very clearly today is that this has to be part of the climate conversation.”
She said big polluters should be forced to invest in environmental programs because “they are the ones wrecking the joint”.
Hanson-Young said there was an expectation from voters that Labor’s environment policy was better than the Liberal party’s, but the opposition needed to come under more pressure to flesh out its plans.
“Really they haven’t been held to account over it at all yet; they have got no detail, they haven’t put any money on the table.”
At Labor’s national conference last year, Shorten committed to introducing a new environment act and creating a new commonwealth environmental protection authority after coming under pressure from the party’s Labor Environment Action Network, but is yet to provide details.
The Wilderness Society has called on the major parties and potential crossbenchers to commit to an overhaul of environmental protection laws and the establishment of new independent regulatory agencies before Australians cast their votes on 18 May.
Hanson-Young said the Greens in the Senate would “hold the Labor party to its promises on the environment”.

From Smeed et al, 2018:
Previous observations of the AMOC found a 0.6 Sv year−1 decrease over the period from 2007 to 2011 (Smeed et al., 2014). This is an order of magnitude larger than the long‐term forced trend predicted by Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 coupled models (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2013), and Smeed et al., (2014) concluded the observed changes were most likely caused by decadal change rather than a long‐term decline. A part of the change may be forced by anthropogenic warming, but the observational record is not yet long enough to separate long‐term forced changes from decadal‐scale internal variability...
...Our results show that the previously reported decline of the AMOC (Smeed et al., 2014) has been arrested, but the length of the observational record of the AMOC is still short relative to the time scales of important decadal variations that exist in the Atlantic. Understanding is therefore constantly evolving. What we identify as a changed state of the AMOC in this study may well prove to be part of a decadal oscillation superposed on a multidecadal cycle. Overlaying these oscillations is the impact of anthropogenic change that is predicted to weaken the AMOC over the next century. The continuation of measurements from the RAPID 26°N array and similar observations elsewhere in the Atlantic (Lozier et al., 2017; Meinen et al., 2013) will enable us to unravel and reveal the role of ocean circulation in the changing Atlantic climate in the coming decades.

Surface waters of the ocean are warmer and hence less dense than waters at depth. So it takes a lot of energy to turn the ocean over. As the surface warms faster now than at depth it takes more energy to drive deep ocean circulation so the ocean gets more strongly stratified.
The flow of nutrient rich waters from the deep which feed great fisheries like the anchoveta slow, and oxygen rich surface waters slow their journey to the depths and the ocean turns to desert.
The loss of filter feeders and nitrogen from agricultural runoff create a dead-zonification of the coastal ocean.
And in a 2016 paper, James Hansen suggested that the shut down of deep ocean circulation was perhaps more sensitive to meltwater off of the ice sheets than the models have suggested.
""Winter of '17/18 was unusually cold and snowy in the UK""
The northern polar jet stream has been changing, perhaps due to Arctic ice decline, and this has slowed those winds, causing the jet stream to meander in wavy patterns which cause weather patterns to persist and bleed heat north and cold south.
Harvey's stall over Houston may have been influenced by the changes in the jet stream.

Spring was beginning on average six to eight days earlier than it did 30 years ago, the researchers said.In regions such as Spain, which saw the greatest increases in temperatures, the season began up to two weeks earlier.The findings were based on what was described as the world's largest study of changes in recurring natural events, such as when plants flowered.The team of researchers also found that the onset of autumn has been delayed by an average of three days over the same period.The study, published in the journal Global Change Biology, shows changes to the continent's climate were shifting the timing of the seasons, the scientists said. One of the paper's lead authors, Tim Sparks from the UK's Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH), said the findings did not go as far as pointing the finger of blame at human-induced climate change.

The delicate green of tree leaves in spring is remarkable and perhaps the greatest spectacle is the flush of new beech leaves that are so translucent they cast a green glow across woodland floors.
This green colour comes from the chlorophyll pigment in the leaf chloroplasts, the tiny cell bodies that perform photosynthesis. As the young leaves are still developing their chloroplasts, the leaves tend to be a lighter green. The new leaves are also thinner, with fewer waxy or tough layers, making them more translucent. What’s more, the leaves look brighter because they tend to have fewer additional pigments other than chlorophyll, so the green colour can shine through more clearly. But this is only a passing phase before the leaves turn darker green as their chloroplasts mature and the leaves grow thicker and more opaque.
Another striking feature is how the trees in springtime have been tending to come into leaf earlier over recent decades, and that reflects how average spring temperatures across the UK have risen by about 1C over the last few decades. Spring even moves up the country faster for many plants and animals, averaging 1.2mph between 1891 and 1947, and 1.8mph between 1998 and 2014.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/apr/16/plantwatch-leaves-spring-ever-faster-as-temperatures-rise

That’s because Dr Joanne Chory is too perfect for the role to be believable.
The esteemed scientist – who has long banged the climate drum and now leads a project that could lower the Earth’s temperature – is perhaps the world’s leading botanist and is on the cusp of something so big that it could truly change our planet.
She’s also a woman in her 60s who is fighting a disease sapping her very life. In 2004, Chory was diagnosed with Parkinson’s, which makes the timetable for success all the more tenuous.
“We’re trying to do something that’s a huge, complicated thing even though it sounds so simple,” Chory says. “Plants evolved to suck up CO2 and they’re really good at it. And they concentrate it, which no machine can do, and they make it into useful materials, like sugar. They suck up all the CO2, they fix it, then it goes back up into the atmosphere.”
She is now working to design plants capable of storing even more carbon dioxide in their roots. Her Ideal Plant project uses gene editing – via traditional horticulture and Crispr – to do so. On a large scale, this could suck enough carbon out of the atmosphere to slow down climate change.
This concept basically splices the genes of regular crops and everyday plants like beans, corn and cotton, with a new compound that makes them absorb more carbon. Their roots then transfer it to the soil to keep it there. 
This approach essentially supercharges what nature already does.
“I get worked up when I talk about the project,” Chory tells me in an office at the Salk Institute, a revered bio research campus at the edge of the Pacific Ocean in southern California. Her desk is full of posies, awards, family photos and framed magazine covers from science journals. “We have to find a way to take CO2 out of the atmosphere and I think plants are the only way to do that affordably,” Chory says.
“I feel like I have the weight of the world on my shoulders,” she says, letting out a laugh. “It is a lot of pressure.”
Born in Boston to Lebanese parents, the third of six children, Chory received a PhD studying photosynthetic bacteria at the University of Illinois. She spent her postdoctoral years as a Harvard Medical School researcher, then joined the institute in 1988. Along the way, she’s discovered how plants respond to everything from light and environment to how they regulate size and growth.
“It’s a philosophical issue, too,” she says, explaining why so many kick the can of global warming. “If I take pain now, maybe my great-grandchildren might see a benefit. People choose no pain now, that’s why we’ve done nothing about climate change.”
Every now and then as we speak, Chory’s symptoms pop up like an uninvited guest, another stark reminder of time. Struggling to maintain control and ever aware of the implied humor in her movements, she doesn’t shy from the elephant in the room.
“When I get excited I really get moving,” she mock-apologizes, letting out a coy chuckle. “I’m a lot better on Saturdays.” She pauses, collects her thoughts. “That’s why I want to do something that won’t cause pain to people. You never know when you’re making a global change. I don’t know if we can do it, but we have to try.”
Temperatures are already at alarming levels even if we reach the Paris agreement of curbing a rise of 2C. The world is headed for major upheaval, it’s merely a question of the scale. If we have any chance as a species, Salk contends, it’s with big ideas like this.
Right now, the institute is negotiating with seed companies and prepping tests on nine agricultural crops to introduce Ideal Plants on farms around the world. Field-testing begins later this year with wheat, soybeans, corn and cotton.
Developing these Ideal Plants is step one in the Harnessing Plants Initiative, which amplifies root systems and production of suberin – which is essentially cork, or the rind on your cantaloupe, the magic key to plants holding more of that carbon – before transferring these genetic traits to row and cover crops. Given the right resources, and funding, prototypes of each crop are expected to be ready in the next five years.
A $2m gift by Howard Newman, a Salk board member and private equity veteran who has invested in oil and gas, jump-started the project last June. In April, Salk received a TED Audacious grant totaling $35m to support the plan.
Chory says these new plants will have deeper and stronger root systems that will also stop erosion, another byproduct of warming temperatures, which will make soil more healthy and boost production. When normal plants die, they release large amounts of CO2 back into the air; when Ideal Plants die, significantly less CO2 will be re-released due to more carbon being stored in deeper roots and soil for longer periods, and suberin’s natural ability as a carbon polymer to resist short-term decomposition.
The first two meters of the Earth’s soil holds over three times the amount of carbon as the atmosphere, and can hold even more. Fossil fuel use was predicted to rise nearly 2% last year. Each year, we produce 18 more gigatons of CO2 than the Earth can currently handle; Salk believes their solution can achieve as much as a 46% annual reduction in excess CO2 emissions produced by humans.
It’s an extremely ambitious idea full of so many unknowns – how to get global buy-in from farmers, how many years will it take for plants to reach maturity and will it then be too late, how will mother nature react to such genetic modification and how will these crops taste – that none of Salk’s brains have the answers to.
The institute was founded in 1960 by Jonas Salk, a biologist who discovered the cure for polio in 1955, two years before my own father’s identical twin died of the disease in communist Romania, a place where politics kept science at bay.
Standing at the edge of the seaside campus designed by Louis Kahn, a sprawl of ominous cement towers and dramatic ocean views, it all feels straight out of the mind of Philip K Dick. Part Gattaca, part Logan’s Run, it’s easy to see why numerous films have been shot here.
But there’s also an optimism in these labs that feels so far from the stark structures and climate narrative I’m used to. Many scientists have told me their role is something akin to historian, documenting the last days of a species or system. Not so here.
“There is hope in dreams, in imagination and in the courage of those who dare to make dreams into reality,” Jonas Salk once said.
Inside these modernist blocks, they’re dreamers too, but rooted in reality. The biological research center, funded by government grants and private donors, has spent decades inching towards cures for everything from cancer to Alzheimer’s. In 1968, Robert W Holley, Salk Cancer Center’s founding director, won a Nobel prize; in 1975, Institute staff won another Nobel, and again in 1977 and 2002.
More recently, Chory was awarded a $3m breakthrough prize for discovering how plants optimize their growth, development and cellular structure to transform sunlight into chemical energy.
I see the optimism on a tour with Dr Joseph Noel, a biochemist focused on harnessing suberin, the project’s linchpin. He shows me seed-planting robots, which can bang out a day’s work in the time it would take a human weeks; state-of-the-art grow rooms capable of simulating almost any environmental condition; greenhouses sitting atop dramatic bluffs. All the while he breaks down the importance of cork. “It’s a spongy barrier that helps a plant regulate water coming in and out, gas exchange coming in and out. Think of it like a protective plastic around certain cells in the plant.”
The institute’s founder, Jonas, once said “our greatest responsibility is to be good ancestors,” and I think about the quote’s relevance as Noel shows me rows of simulation rooms full of cattails, marsh grasses, Lotus japonicus legumes and weed-like Arabidopsis thaliana, all in various states of growth as LEDs shine and humid air blasts while I take notes.
“Instead of just growing in a greenhouse or artificial lights in a lab, we wanted to have the ability to simulate a particular climactic zone: quality of light, seasonal changes, cloud cover, temperatures,” Noel says.
Since Arabidopsis “can go from seed to seed in six weeks” and its genome is entirely sequenced and resembles so many other species, the little mustard flower has become the project’s veritable Rosetta Stone.
“It’s very easy to change the genetics of it on a massive scale,” he continues. “If we change a particular gene, we can find out if the roots get deeper, do they get more extensive, does the suberin content change. Their early ancestors have been doing photosynthesis for about 2.8bn years.”
Without plants, life as we know it wouldn’t exist. The question is whether these ones will become our saviors.
There’s a growing field of carbon dioxide removal projects which include machines pulling C02 out of the sky, known as direct air capture. There’s Bill Gates-backed Carbon Engineering and the Zurich startup Climeworks, and about 20 commercial carbon capture and storage facilities worldwide, but they’re price prohibitive. 
There have been notable failures: Sir Richard Branson tried a $25m prize for carbon removal but never found a solution. Carbon removal initiatives are also criticized for preserving the status quo and big energy business models.
“Ultimately, we all know that humanity’s response to climate change will, as the Ideal Plant project states, make or break our future,” says David Stern, the president and CEO of the Boyce Thompson Institute, a leading plant research facility in New York, who calls Chory a fearless, creative and open-minded scientist. “Given the complexities and scale of the problem, many types of solutions will be needed. Sequestration is undoubtedly one of them.”
One big problem, Stern notes, is winning hearts and minds. Genetically modifying organisms saving the planet might be a tough sell in an era when GMO has become the antithesis for the green, organic movement.
“While they are not proposing traditional transgenic lines nor are they proposing to do their work in food crops, the issue will still come up,” Stern adds.
Chory maintains that plants have been modified for millennia – selecting the best strains to cultivate and taking a hand in their development is a form of genetic modification, after all – and the nutritional and yield values of such tweaked products still outweigh the drawbacks. Salk doesn’t introduce foreign genetic material in its plants, unlike many GMO products. The European Union outlawing modified organisms, plus crops with Crispr traits (as a result, the plants might not make it to the EU). Another issue is seed pricing and getting it to farmers around the world, so the wide-scale use is in question.
“As with any GMO crop the big question is how do the changes affect nutritional quality and whether small farmers in developing countries would be able to buy the seeds on a large enough scale to make a difference?” wonders Dan Wenny, a senior biologist who studies land-bird seed dispersal at the San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory.
Right now, the Mississippi delta in Louisiana is a test zone for a first batch of Ideal Plants in the wild, a major step to see if improved root systems can mitigate sea level rise. Still, Salk researchers are sober to the odds.
“Any restoration effort, unlike our Arabidopsis that can grow from seed to seed in six weeks, these systems you plant them and then you wait. You wait a long time,” Noel laments. “We can’t afford to have these experiments not work.”
Are we past the point of no return? “The world’s not going to be the world we live in right now,” Chory says. “I don’t know if we’re going to eliminate the whole human species, but I think if we don’t do something soon we will go that route. The misery index of humidity plus the heat will get so high mammals can’t live.”
The Union of Concerned Scientists says the tipping point is here.
“I don’t think it’s here yet,” Chory counters. Still, she concedes that “migration is already happening. Canada is going to make out well in this. The United States is not. We’re going to have a lot of changes in our agriculture.”

Climate science is based on a vast mass of evidence, from research done in dozens of countries.
Tens of thousands of pieces of research in geochemistry, palaeontology, oceanography, atmospheric physics, and many more fields of study, starting in the 19th century, have resulted in this overall concept.
In fact, climate change is probably the most scrutinised area of science ever, and the current scientific position meets the standards of other scientific paradigms like evolution, plate tectonics, and relativity.
Of course it can't predict every short-term fluctuation, any more than plate tectonics predicts the timing and scale of every earthquake or volcanic eruption.
Climate science is very much like plate tectonics, in that it gives an overall framework to investigations of processes in a range of earth systems.

Greta Thunberg is in fact thoroughly well-informed, on this topic, and notably capable of holding her own in any discussion with anyone, including world leaders - she's simply not impressed by hauteur or titles or anything else apart from a mutual respect for the best of the accurate science. 
Theresa May will avoid a meeting, as she does not have a clue how to respond anyway, as a matter of urgency; also assumes it would annoy core voters and corporate sponsors - political calculations that are probably now way out of kilter with how fast the issue is moving in public perception - especially among younger voters.
 Greta Thunberg looks younger than 16 in photos but don't let this mislead you, she's impressive; but still only one voice in what is now a long line of brave and articulate voices, over the past several decades.

However, Extinction Rebellion have not communicated why there is a urgent need for declaring a global Climate Emergency. 
The Arctic ice sheet is rapidly disappearing. Since 2007 there is an accelerating rise in sea level and a new problem of large amounts of frozen methane escaping from the sea bed. Methane that has been there for 100,000s of years. Now belching millions of tons per year and increasing, exponentially! The Arctic ice changes are responsible for all the recent freak weather events.
Methane is 20 times more potent than CO2. As we warm the planet we are triggering positive feedback loops which in the Arctic are very close, if not actually already over, a catastrophic tipping point. We are now facing runaway global warming threatening ABRUPT climate change. Abrupt meaning that in 10 to 20 years we could face world food shortages, death, mass migration, even conflict. Within 20 to 100 years our planet may not be habitable. Real human extinction! Something we may not be able to stop if we don't act with everything we got now, today, immediately. 
XR are protesting because they know this science. So do G20 leaders who were warned of this Climate Emergency in July 2017. Here is a very scary scientific letter and press release to the world leaders from the Artic Methane Emergency Group. Please read it carefully.

From blistering heatwaves in North America to typhoons in south-east Asia and droughts in Africa and Australia, no country or community is immune. These events damage infrastructure and private property, negatively affect health, decrease productivity and destroy wealth. And they are extremely costly: insured losses have risen five-fold in the past three decades. The enormous human and financial costs of climate change are having a devastating effect on our collective wellbeing.
The impact of climate change has compelled governments to act. Catalysed by the Paris agreement, governments around the world are putting policies in place to limit the global rise in temperatures to 2C, and preferably as close to 1.5C as possible. The actions undertaken by individual countries will deliver a collective transition to a low-carbon economy. But this transition brings its own risks. Carbon emissions have to decline by 45% from 2010 levels over the next decade in order to reach net zero by 2050. This requires a massive reallocation of capital. If some companies and industries fail to adjust to this new world, they will fail to exist.
The prime responsibility for climate policy will continue to sit with governments. And the private sector will determine the success of the adjustment. But as financial policymakers and prudential supervisors, we cannot ignore the obvious risks before our eyes.
That is why 34 central banks and supervisors – representing five continents, half of global greenhouse gas emissions and the supervision of two-thirds of the global systemically important banks and insurers – joined forces in 2017 to create a coalition of the willing: the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS).
On Wednesday, this coalition’s first comprehensive report seeks to translate commitments to act on climate-related financial risks into concrete action. The four recommendations in the report provide all central banks, supervisors and the financial community with deliverable goals that will help to ensure a smooth transition to a low-carbon economy. We therefore call on policymakers and the financial sector to do the following.
First, integrate the monitoring of climate-related financial risks into day-to-day supervisory work, financial stability monitoring and board risk management. Supervisors are encouraged to set expectations to ensure financial firms are adequately addressing the financial risks from climate change, including by conducting scenario analysis to assess their strategic resilience to climate change policy. Firms are encouraged to take a long-term, strategic approach to the consideration of these risks, and to embed them into their business-as-usual governance and risk-management frameworks.
Second, lead by example, specifically central banks are encouraged to integrate sustainability into their own portfolio management.
Third, collaborate to bridge the data gaps to enhance the assessment of climate-related risks. Public authorities should share and if possible make publicly available any climate-risk data.
Fourth, build in-house capacity and share knowledge with other stakeholders on management of climate-related financial risks. An important element to achieving effective consideration of climate risks across the financial system is to support internal and external collaboration.
The success of these recommendations relies on two important factors, which lead to two broader calls to action on disclosure and classification of climate-related financial risks. First, to support the market and regulators in adequately assessing the risks and opportunities from climate change, robust and internationally consistent disclosure is vital. The market and policymakers must continue to work together to determine the most decision-useful metrics for climate-related financial disclosures.
Second, the NGFS encourages regulators to develop an adequate classification system to identify which economic activities contribute to the transition to a green and low-carbon economy. This will be particularly valuable in supporting financial actors to make sustainable investment and lending decisions.
If the financial community acts on these recommendations we will be two big steps closer to ensuring an orderly transition to a low-carbon economy. We recognise that the challenges we face are unprecedented, urgent and analytically difficult. The stakes are undoubtedly high, but the commitment of all actors in the financial system to act on these recommendations will help avoid a climate-driven “Minsky moment” – the term we use to refer to a sudden collapse in asset prices.
As long as temperatures and sea levels continue to rise and with them climate-related financial risks, central banks, supervisors and financial institutions will continue to raise the bar to address these climate-related risks and to “green” the financial system. We need collective leadership and action across countries and we need to be ambitious. The NGFS is the core of the response of central banks and supervisors. But climate change is a global problem, which requires global solutions, in which the whole financial sector has a crucial role to play.

Lorries are the latest target of attempts to radically reduce vehicle emissions and force the automotive industry to move away from fossil fuels amid increased concern over global warming and air pollution.
The European parliament on Thursday will vote on laws that would force lorry makers to cut carbon emissions from new trucks by 15% by 2025 and by 30% by 2030.
Lorries, buses and coaches produce more than a quarter of the EU’s CO2 emissions from road transport and about 6% of total CO2 emissions, according to EU data.
It is thought to be highly likely that the proposals will pass the parliamentary vote. The new rules would apply to the UK after Brexit, as the government is committed to emissions standards that are at least as ambitious as current arrangements governed by the EU.
Separately, the National Infrastructure Commission (NIC), which is appointed by the Treasury, on Wednesday said British ministers should ban the sale of new petrol and diesel heavy goods vehicles no later than 2040, matching a similar ban on internal combustion engine cars.
The vast majority of goods vehicles on British roads run on diesel because of its higher fuel efficiency. However, the NIC said that the industry would be able to move to hydrogen fuel cell and battery lorries in the early 2020s.
The haulage industry and business groups have strongly objected to the NIC’s proposals. Richard Burnett, chief executive of the Road Haulage Association, described the proposed ban as “simplistic”, not realistic and not credible given the lack of alternative fuel sources for long-haul heavy goods vehicles.
The tougher attitude towards lorries comes amid a crackdown on carbon emissions across the road transport sector. From 2021, EU carmakers will have to meet an average CO2 emissions target for new cars of 95g per kilometre.
The looming deadline has raised the prospect of carmakers paying billions in fines for failing to improve their carbon footprint. Only Tesla and Smart already meet the target out of 50 major brands, according to analysis by Jato Dynamics, a data company. Jato suggested the car industry could pay as much as €33.6bn (£29bn) in fines from 2021 if it remained at 2018 emissions levels.
However, Transport &amp; Environment (T&amp;E), a Brussels-based campaign group, has raised multiple concerns that carmakers are using loopholes to game the system, avoiding the penalties.
T&amp;E highlighted the potential for carmakers to sell “fake” electric cars, hybrids that mainly rely on petrol power alongside a little-used, low-range electric motor. Selling more electric vehicles means carmakers are allowed to meet less stringent carbon-reduction measures.
Fiat Chrysler is planning to use another loophole to avoid a big fine for producing dirty cars, reportedly paying Tesla hundreds of millions of euros so that the US carmaker’s electric vehicles – with zero direct carbon emissions – are included in its fleet.
Pooling emissions in this way is legal but means that the carmaker’s overall carbon emissions will likely fall more slowly than if it stopped producing cars that run on fossil fuels.
An Fiat Chrysler spokesman said: “The purchase pool provides flexibility to deliver products our customers are willing to buy while managing compliance with the lowest-cost approach.”
Julia Poliscanova, T&amp;E’s manager of clean vehicles and emobility, said: “Fiat bet excessively on diesel technology and now is paying the cost of declining diesel sales due to the air pollution crisis in our cities.
“They could have followed other paths to make cleaner cars and thus meet the CO2 targets, like accelerating sales of electric cars or converting some of their heavy-polluting SUVs as plug-in hybrids. At one point, bad business choices come back to haunt you.”
Miriam Dalli, a Maltese Labour MEP who was part of the negotiations on the EU carbon limits, told the Guardian the rules had faced fierce opposition from the industry and some member states, including industry-backed studies with “unrealistic assumptions that led to totally misleading results”.
She added that the European commission would also test cars under real-world conditions to avoid a repeat of the “dieselgate” emissions cheating scandal, in which Volkswagen installed software to trick emissions tests.
… we can’t turn away from climate change. The Guardian’s environmental coverage reports the scientific facts, social consequences and political choices that are shaping the fate of our planet. As the world's leaders turn their backs on the environment, we are at a crisis point. Individual consumer choices are important, but we need collective action to achieve the systemic change that will really make a difference. Our pioneering and our fearless reporting on the environment can play a vital role in that. But we need our readers’ support.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as $1 – and it only takes a minute. Thank you.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/17/european-parliament-carbon-dioxide-emission-truck-2035

The governor of the Bank of England and his French counterpart warned that the global financial system faces an existential threat from climate change. Writing in the Guardian, they told companies: “Fail to adjust … fail to exist.”.
There could hardly be a greater contrast than between Mr Carney’s intervention and the thousands of Extinction Rebellion activists disrupting central London and other cities worldwide. Earlier this month they grabbed attention by supergluing themselves to the public gallery in the House of Commons, semi-naked. Mr Carney is unlikely to shed his suit for the cause. But the activists’ peaceful campaign of civil disobedience is essentially a louder, brighter, less genteel version of the same essential message: “This is an emergency.”
Who is more likely to save us? Even supporters of Extinction Rebellion have voiced doubt about specific tactics, including the intention to use mass arrests as leverage for change. But a bigger debate underlies these. It has dogged the activism from which the movement explicitly draws inspiration, including the suffragettes and the civil rights movement in the US. The question is whether real change is achieved on the streets or in the corridors of power; whether moderates or militants prevail; and whether progress is made through careful negotiation and the pursuit of acceptable compromises, or radical demands which rupture the status quo. The truth is that both are needed.
Young people have led the way. The 1.4 million who took part in last month’s school strikes have grown up learning that climate change is a fact, not a theory; it is built into their worldview. They know that they will pay the price for our inaction. They bat away excuses. That sense of impatience always pushes social change, but is all the more critical in this case, when every delay increases the risk of disaster.
But their urgency is felt more broadly. Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury, was an early backer of Extinction Rebellion. An 80-year-old woman locked herself to the bottom of a lorry because, she said, “I refuse to leave a barren and broken world for my beautiful grandchildren.” Even inconvenienced drivers have voiced support. The shift can be seen at an institutional level too. Businesses are waking up to the costs, financial and physical, of the changes. Whether for reasons of strategy, sympathy or both, the police approach to these largely white and middle-class protesters has been unusually light-touch: hundreds of arrests, but made gradually, and with plenty of amicable chat on the sidelines.
Yet most politicians remain shockingly timid. Labour’s declaration of a climate emergency and promise of a “green industrial revolution” is encouraging; on Wednesday protesters chained themselves to a fence outside Jeremy Corbyn’s house, saying they hoped to persuade him to go further. True, voters who voice alarm at rising temperatures can be equally vocal about rising fuel prices. But the public mood is shifting. Though the climate change deniers are entrenched, and have drawn encouragement from the election and actions of Donald Trump, Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro and others, the alarm about global warming is rising worldwide. According to Pew research, Britons now list it as the top threat to the UK. The evidence is mounting, and each grain of it is more alarming. The changes are felt, as well as read about, in the form of heatwaves, storms and other extreme weather.
There is nothing moderate about the approaching catastrophe. Adaptation to rising temperatures is inevitable; accommodation with the forces fuelling them will be disastrous. Social movements exert pressure on internal processes of change, which are inherently incremental and cautious. That parts of the establishment are now pressing for action on climate change is critical. That others are pushing from the outside is at least equally so.
… in the fight to protect the environment. By keeping the Guardian’s environmental coverage open and accessible, we can report on the changes needed to avoid climate and natural catastrophe. The choices made by individuals are important, but we need to work together for the systemic transformation that will make a real difference. As well as reporting the facts about what is happening now, we investigate the causes and talk to the people trying to make the future better. But we need our readers’ support.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account.

Turnbull took exception to a column at the weekend characterising the national energy guarantee as “Malcolm Turnbull’s Neg”, pointing out the policy had strong support within the cabinet, “including and especially the current PM and treasurer”.
The former prime minister took to social media over the weekend to argue that a majority in the government wanted the policy to proceed but “a right wing minority in the party room refused to accept the majority position and threatened to cross the floor and defeat their own government”.
“That is the only reason it has been abandoned by the government,” Turnbull said. “The consequence is no integration of energy and climate policy, uncertainty continues to discourage investment with the consequence, as I have often warned, of both higher emissions and higher electricity prices.
“I am simply stating the truth: the Neg was designed and demonstrated to reduce electricity prices. So dumping it means prices will be higher than if it had been retained.”
Labor has resolved to try to preserve the framework of the Neg, which imposes security and emissions reduction obligations on the energy sector, if it wins on 18 May. The government proposed an emissions reduction target of 26% and Labor is proposing a target of 45%.
Labor is also proposing to keep another government policy mechanism, the safeguard framework, to drive down pollution in heavy industry, again with a higher emissions reduction target.
A debate over climate and energy policy has dominated the opening full week of the campaign with Labor facing questions over the cost of its policies and the Coalition blasting Labor’s decision to use international permits, even though the government in 2017 supported their use.
Labor has not done new economic modelling to outline the costs of its climate policies, but draws on work already in the public domain to argue the economy will continue to grow with higher pollution targets.
Scott Morrison continued to blast Labor’s decision to use international permits over the weekend even though the Liberals had previously resolved to use them in its suite of climate policies and their use is widely supported by the business community.
“Bill Shorten has a plan to reduce emissions by 1.3bn tonnes,” the Liberal leader said. “Now, one of the questions he won’t answer is what proportion of that 1.3bn tonnes is going to be satisfied by buying foreign carbon credits?
“Now, today those credits cost about 43 Australian bucks per credit, OK? For those credits, that will go to $52 by 2030. Now, our best estimate is around half of him meeting that target will be through carbon credits purchased offshore. Now, that’s about $35bn.
“It shouldn’t be hard for Bill Shorten to explain this simple question – of your 1.3bn, Bill, what share of those are going to be achieved by purchasing foreign carbon credits and at what price?”
Shorten expressed his growing frustration with the trajectory of the debate over the weekend. “This has been a 10-year torture on climate change, where the climate has got worse, the extreme weather events have got worse, and this government is still trying to delay and discourage,” the Labor leader said.
“Here is a bet, here’s a bet I’ll make you. Future generations are going to despise the politicians right now who refuse to take action on climate change”.

Here’s why | André Spicer,article,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/19/extinction-rebellion-climate-change-protests-london,370,"Over the past few days, I have watched members of the Extinction Rebellion movement block bridges, disrupt public transport and lock themselves to lorries. I have been moved by their bravery and inspired by their message, but puzzled by their strategy. On the face of it, the rebels have been effective. They have disrupted major cities, gained publicity and built bonds of solidarity. But are they achieving their aim of building a more sustainable world?
According to Stanford University’s Doug McAdam, the climate change movement has historically been a failure when compared with other movements. Climate activists have struggled to engage politicians, been unable to build influential organisations, and failed to connect with the wider public. The Extinction Rebellion may mark a turning point. The rebels have injected a sense of urgency and emotion back into the issue of climate change, but creating meaningful and long-lasting change requires more. A movement must reach out beyond true believers and connect with a wider base of potential supporters – wherever they might be found on the political spectrum.
Extinction Rebellion is an international protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues. Demonstration have included blocking bridges to traffic in London and a semi-naked protest inside the House of Commons. 
The group says climate breakdown threatens all life on Earth, and so it is rebelling against politicians who 'have failed us', to provoke radical change that will stave off a climate emergency.
Climate activists talk about saving the natural environment from “harm”, “caring” for the planet and working towards climate “justice”. Such language appeals to the left but antagonises the right. Researchers have found that conservatives heed messages about climate change when they are couched in values they hold dear – that means talking about saving the climate as obeying authority, preserving the purity of nature or defending your country. A recent study published in the journal Nature: Climate Change found that “interventions that increase angry opposition to action on climate change are especially problematic”. The only sound way forward was to “transform intergroup relations”. That meant being able to reach out beyond one’s political tribe and draw in other groups. You do that through their values, their language and their rituals.
Extinction Rebellion’s call for “ecological justice” will appeal to people on the left, but it will miss out those in the centre and alienate folks on the right. If the rebels want to reach out, they could instead talk about “preserving the purity of nature” or “saving our national natural heritage”. Their tactics are also likely to push away many potential supporters. Acts of civil disobedience such as occupying bridges, guerrilla gardening and protest puppetry may appeal to seasoned activists, but are a turnoff for thousands of potential supporters who might walk past such occupations. If the rebels want to reach out, they should use social rituals which other groups are familiar with – instead of glueing themselves to DLR trains, they might hold tea parties at local fetes.
The identity offered by the Extinction Rebellion movement will resonate with would-be rebels, but the majority of people who could potentially be won over to their cause don’t see themselves as “rebels”. Instead they identify as parents, workers, neighbours, members of ethnic or religious groups and many other things. To effectively reach out, the climate change movement needs to connect with these identities. After all, one of the main reasons people change their minds is when they have an extended conversation with someone who is like them but who has changed an opinion.
But perhaps the Extinction Rebels do not want to reach out. Their avowed aim is to encourage 3.5% of population to undertake system change. If the Extinction Rebels continue to focus on attracting a relatively small group of activists they will open up a space for a mass movement which can appeal across political boundaries. If such a mass movement does indeed come about, the Extinction Rebels are likely to provide an important service. This will be due to what’s called the radical flank effect. This is when more extreme groups make us aware of the problem, in turn forcing the authorities to work with more moderate movements to create the solutions.

The activists, all born after 1990, unfurled a banner asking: “Are we the the last generation?” as dozens of police prevented them from blocking the road.
The protesters said they were risking arrest to highlight the dangers of climate change. “To everyone reading about this, I’m here because I love you and fear for your future and my future,” said Oscar Idle, 17, from Bristol. “It’s that love and that fear that gives me courage.”
About 20 protesters were moved on to the pavement by police at one of the road entrances to the airport. Protesters stood by the tunnel that leads to terminals two and three, but all roads around the roundabout were open and there was no disruption to motor traffic as the group remained surrounded by police.
Extinction Rebellion is an international protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues. Demonstration have included blocking bridges to traffic in London and a semi-naked protest inside the House of Commons. 
The group says climate breakdown threatens all life on Earth, and so it is rebelling against politicians who 'have failed us', to provoke radical change that will stave off a climate emergency.
About 25 police, some of them reportedly brought in from Cardiff and other regions, repeatedly warned the teenage protesters they could be arrested if they did not move on, but four of the activists refused to budge for more than an hour.
The representatives of Extinction Rebellion Youth, which operates with some autonomy from the wider organisation, said they never planned to disrupt flights, though they had planned to block traffic intermittently. Several among the group chanted “People power” and: “We are the youth and we’re doing what’s right. We are the youth and we are fighting for our lives.”
Some were in tears but held their ground. They said they were crying as much because of the climate crisis as the stress of the standoff. “We are consistently being punched in the face by the truth, but nobody is doing anything,” said Savannah Lovelock, a 19-year-old student from the University of Falmouth. “I just want to go home. But we have no choice. If other people stood up for the next generation, we wouldn’t have to.”
“I shouldn’t be here, I should be revising for my end-of-year exams,” said Talia Woodin, 19, who is at Goldsmiths. “But I have to be here. What good is a degree if there is a possibility that there is no future?”
“We know the risks and they are worth taking. I’m incredibly proud to be here with the others,” said Samar, 14. “We’re facing a complete disaster and I refuse to stand by and watch this happen without doing something.”
At about 10am, the four activists moved on, holding hands with their arms raised.
The action came as the number of arrests from Extinction Rebellion’s week of protest passed the 500 mark. Despite the detentions, activists have held roadblocks at four locations in central London since Monday and expect more to join them on Friday, the start of the Easter weekend holiday.
They believe the BBC programme Climate Change: the Facts, which aired on Thursday night, will strengthen their cause.
“The David Attenborough documentary will have a huge impact,” predicted Ronan McNern, a spokesman for Extinction Rebellion. He said the group’s disruptions over the past six months were shifting the debate. “We are creating conversations. For the first time people are talking at the breakfast table, in pubs and on the tube about the climate crisis. That’s what this is all about.”
They have been boosted by wide media coverage and endorsements from prominent figures in the science community and entertainment world. In an open letter on Friday, the former Nasa scientist James Hansen spelled out the growing dangers of climate change and noted that he too has conducted “highly respectful acts of nonviolent civil disobedience – on occasion leading even to my arrest”.
The latest high-profile supporter is the actor Emma Thompson, who joined the Oxford Circus camp on Friday morning. Hundreds of people sat in the street and listened to poetry readings. When dozens of police officers moved in to try to disperse them, Thompson – who was on top of a boat in the middle of the junction – joked: “I want to remind the police that Nanny McPhee is up here, and I have my stick with me.” 
The home secretary, Sajid Javid – considered a contender in the Conservative party’s leadership race – called for police to use “the full force of the law” against the demonstrators.
On Thursday night the Metropolitan police said they had cancelled leave for some officers over Easter.
“This is putting a strain on the Met and we have now asked officers on the boroughs to work 12-hour shifts; we have cancelled rest days and our violent crime taskforce have had their leave cancelled,” the force said in a statement.
The linguist and activist Noam Chomsky is among those who have sent a statement of support. “It is impossible to exaggerate the awesome nature of the challenge we face: to determine, within the next few years, whether organised human society can survive in anything like its present form,” he said.
“The activists of Extinction Rebellion are leading the way in confronting this immense challenge, with courage and integrity, an achievement of historic significance that must be amplified with urgency.”

The bright pop of green stands out against her flowing white dress. It’s as if she’s just stepped out of one of her own artworks – perhaps the one in which endangered rainforest plants are grown in beakers of laboratory glass, with lines of transparent tubing connecting the plants’ roots.
“All my life I’ve been very empathetic with other species,” she says. “I have incredibly vivid memories of always being very caring of things in nature, of plants and other animals.”
Meeting Laurence feels startlingly serendipitous. The Australian artist’s work has been exhibited in Paris, London, Berlin and is held by museums the world over. Her career spans more than three decades, yet the concerns at the centre of her art have never been more urgent – climate change, environmental destruction, humanity’s failure to adequately reassess its relationship with nature.
Laurence’s art feels like a project that’s more important than ever, especially for those of us who have desperately tried to make sense of the catastrophe we’re facing – extreme weather events becoming alarmingly more frequent, pollution infiltrating the deepest oceans and highest mountains, governmental failure to address any of it – and fretted about how to reconcile that with our daily lives.
But her work hasn’t always been well received.
“When I first started making art and wanting to work with nature, I was really criticised a lot for it,” she tells Guardian Australia. “In the feminist era I was told, you shouldn’t work with nature.” To do so would be to reiterate reductive ideas about women as nurturers – as opposed to men, who were, well, everything else. “It was very odd.”
After Nature, now showing at Sydney’s Museum of Contemporary Art, is the first major survey of Laurence’s work. The title, a reference to the nature writer WG Sebald’s prose poem of the same name, evokes both the idea of a time post-nature, and an homage to it – threads that Laurence’s work deals with simultaneously. While she sees herself as part of the fight against the destruction of the natural world, she’s equally concerned with our ability to transcend the very concept – to do away with the artificial separation between humanity and the rest of the living earth.
The installation of endangered rainforest plants, Cellular Gardens (where breathing begins), forms part of the retrospective. In a room nearby is Deep Breathing: Resuscitation for the Reef: coral and fish skeletons are tagged, wrapped in brightly coloured thread, sewn into translucent pouches and held in glass vials inside stacked perspex boxes, while footage of the living – for now – Great Barrier Reef is projected onto the surrounding walls. It was Laurence’s – and Australia’s – contribution to the Artists 4 Paris Climate Exhibition that was held alongside the 2015 climate change conference.
In the Theatre of Trees, a new installation created for MCA, a flowing fabric structure of concentric rings, like the growth rings of a tree, fills the centre of the room. Walking through it in the dappled, moving light, you can hear birds, the breeze, leaves falling. Outside the tree in the corners of the room are three smaller installations: Knowledge, Wonder and Desire.
The first is a partly interactive reading room full of works that Laurence says have inspired her. (She cites the writing of Luce Irigaray, Deborah Bird Rose, Judith Wright as influences; she singles out Amitav Ghosh’s “beautifully explicit” book The Great Derangement in particular.) The second is a herbarium; the third an “elixir lab” in which audiences can book tasting sessions to sample liquid infusions of different Australian trees: ginger, a native mint, Davidson plum, lemon myrtle and pine pollen.
Laurence’s work is, before everything, very beautiful. The beauty of it is partly to entice an audience. “I am very aware in my practice of creating an attraction to enter a space,” she says. “I want you to linger.”
This aesthetic is tightly coupled with politics; hers is an activist practice. Yet her work feels less like a polemic than a way of angling the light to catch the filmy webs that connect, say, the breath of a sleeping tiger to human vulnerability; blood vessels to the seedling of an endangered plant; and things as disparate as a taxidermied owl, a fallen tree, test tubes and bandages.
If all this seems to border on the mystical, that’s not entirely an accident. In the 90s, Laurence’s work focused on alchemy and the transformation of matter; over the last decade, she has interrogated the potential of medicinal and psychotropic plants as a way to overturn archaic modes of understanding the world. We’re so accustomed to associating nature with the unknowable, the “other”; to thinking about civilisation and the natural world as two opposing concepts, rather than interconnecting parts of the same whole. That division, Laurence says, has been “culturally enforced and religiously enforced for so long, it’s the biggest obstacle we have”.
“We have to get back in touch with nature in order to care for it. We’ll all be lost if we don’t do that,” she says. “There’s an amazing groundswell of activity happening, of caring for the planet happening, but how can we deal with this enormous global capitalist force that’s still so powerful? And it’s almost incomprehensible how it’s still so powerful. So I do believe it’s going to take probably something almost disastrous to break that.”
It would be easy to give in to despair in the face of that, but Laurence says her resilience comes, in part, from her art. “Because I’m involved in what I think of as an activist practice and because by acting we get hope, I don’t feel overwhelmed by those forces myself,” she says. “But I know they’re there.”
There is an inspiring honesty about the blur between Laurence’s work and how she tries to live her life. During our conversation, she tells me that she gardens a piece of public land on Sydney Harbour. It now includes two enormous bay trees that began life in a hospital for native plants she created for the 2010 Sydney biennale, called Waiting: A Medicinal Garden for Ailing Plants, full of damaged or impaired seedlings and saplings covered in bandages and gauze. The plants that died were preserved and used as part of a subsequent artwork; those that survived, she planted.
“I want to bring you into an intimacy with nature. I feel the most important thing we have to do today on the planet is care for it and recognise our interconnection with it. And of course, what are we fighting against? We know the weight of our civilisation.”

… in the fight to protect the environment. By keeping the Guardian’s environmental coverage open and accessible, we can report on the changes needed to avoid climate and natural catastrophe. The choices made by individuals are important, but we need to work together for the systemic transformation that will make a real difference. As well as reporting the facts about what is happening now, we investigate the causes and talk to the people trying to make the future better. But we need our readers’ support.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism.

A bright pink boat, named Berta Cáceres after the murdered Honduran environmental activist, was being pulled carefully through the traffic, eventually coming to a halt in the middle of one of London’s busiest thoroughfares.
Extinction Rebellion is an international protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues. Demonstration have included blocking bridges to traffic in London and a semi-naked protest inside the House of Commons. 
The group says climate breakdown threatens all life on Earth, and so it is rebelling against politicians who 'have failed us', to provoke radical change that will stave off a climate emergency.
Bemused onlookers watched as activists secured “Berta” to the road, while others glued themselves to its garish hull. And with this act of flamboyant defiance, Extinction Rebellion’s climate protests had begun.
In the five days that followed, thousand of people, from pensioners to young parents with toddlers, scientists to city workers, teenagers to teachers, have occupied four landmarks in the capital, defying repeated police attempts to remove them and causing widespread disruption. Smaller disruptive events have taken place across the UK and in 33 other countries.
By late Friday evening police were saying that 682 people had been arrested in London. Three supporters who glued themselves to a train on Wednesday have been imprisoned. That same day four more attached themselves to the fence outside Jeremy Corbyn’s house, declaring the Labour leader “the best hope this country has got” to meet the challenges of the unfolding climate crisis.
And on Friday about 20 young protesters, all born after 1990, unfurled a banner on a road outside Heathrow airport, asking: “Are we the the last generation?”
But perhaps the protesters’ biggest achievement is that millions of people have heard their message that the world is in a spiralling climate emergency that demands transformative change to avoid catastrophe.
Through hundreds of articles, editorials, and radio and TV interviews, including some hostile critiques of its tactics, Extinction Rebellion’s message has gone mainstream.
“It’s been a resounding success,” said one of the group’s organisers, Howard Rees, surveying the scene on Waterloo Bridge on Thursday afternoon. “What are we on? Day four? We are holding all the sites, we are attracting loads of new members, everybody’s having a great time, there’s a party atmosphere everywhere … the police are generally positive and friendly towards us and agree with what we’re doing. And we are getting our message out there. It couldn’t be going better, really.”
The four occupied sites, Marble Arch, Oxford Circus, Waterloo Bridge and Parliament Square, were all blockaded in quick succession on Monday morning, bringing widespread disruption to central London.
And although activists gathering in the sunshine on Waterloo Bridge had no idea how long they would be there – or what the police reaction would be – there was a jubilant atmosphere as they swarmed on to the road.
“I am so worried about what’s happening to the planet,” said Laura Sorensen, a retired teacher from Somerset. “We are on a knife-edge now and I felt strongly that I needed to get out and show myself, rather than just talk about it in the pub.”
A little further along Waterloo Bridge was Josiah Finegan, a 22-year-old who had never been on a protest before.
“I am freaking out about the climate, to be honest,” he said. “There have been so many warnings from scientists about what we are facing, it is quite shocking.”
Before going to join the protest, Finegan added: “I have no idea what to expect or what might happen … I just heard about it and felt I had to come.”
Police mingled with protesters, chatting and watching as flowers, trees in large tubs, a mini skate ramp and even a lorry were dragged into place on the normally traffic-choked bridge.
Looking on, one senior officer said the police response would be proportionate.
“These people are explicitly peaceful, they have liaised closely with us over their plans and have a legitimate cause. We all have a limit on what we think is the right level of action to take but I think everyone is worried about climate change.”
Over the ensuing days, the success, tactics and sheer determination of the demonstrations took many by surprise, even though they had been more than a year in the planning.
The strategy of peaceful mass disruption was tested in a much smaller series of protests over air pollution last year, with activists blocking busy junctions for 10 to 20 minutes at a time. The group hopes such protests act in two ways: they put economic pressure on the government by disrupting the infrastructure, and they force people to confront the reality of the climate emergency by interrupting their daily lives.
Once they had honed the process, organisers spent months holding public meetings around the country. Thousands of people gathered in libraries and meeting halls, cafes and universities, pubs and churches to hear dire warnings about the consequences of the climate emergency and what they could do about it, with hundreds signing up to take part in larger-scale rebellions and be arrested.
Speaking to the Guardian after a meeting last summer, Roger Hallam, one of the key figures behind this week’s protests, said: “It feels like we are tapping into something very powerful in terms of the frustration and urgency many people are feeling as the evidence mounts of the scale of the climate emergency we are facing.”
Ten months later, it seems he was right.
The group’s success this week has not come without internal tensions, exacerbated by the non-hierarchical structure of the group. The decision to block trains, and potentially tubes, was hotly debated long into the night on Tuesday. A similar discussion took place over the plan to hit Heathrow.
And as the week has gone on, and the attention of the world’s media has slowly turned to the protests, the pressure on the volunteers trying to organise and control it has only increased.
“The phones never stop ringing, we have press inquiries round the clock from media around the world … it wasn’t like this at my old job,” said one of Extinction Rebellion’s young media team, who took a break from her career to volunteer a few months ago. “But this has been one of the most exhausting, exhilarating weeks of my life.”
Extinction Rebellion says thousands of people are signing up every day. The group’s rise to prominence has come amid mounting evidence of climate breakdown, from floods to heatwaves, melting ice sheets to poor harvests.
Its message about the scale of the climate crisis has resonated because it is backed up with science. On Thursday night David Attenborough presented a primetime documentary on the BBC, Climate Change: The Facts, supporting Extinction Rebellion’s central claim that the world is in a climate emergency. Earlier in the week, Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said the global financial system faces an existential threat from climate change and must take urgent steps to reform.
As the sun goes down on Waterloo Bridge on Thursday night, Finegan is dancing and laughing with a group of 20 or so people of all ages and backgrounds, accompanied by a collection of drummers and other musicians.
“It’s been insane, amazing,” he says. “I have been worrying about this stuff so much but the last few days, well, I feel like this has changed everything.”

Temperatures reached 25C (77F) on Good Friday and were forcecast to hit 27C on Monday.
The Met Office forecaster Helen Roberts said there would be dry, sunny and very warm conditions with temperatures continuing to rise slightly on Saturday and Sunday to a possible 27C on Easter Monday.
The Met Office said it would be “a glorious day” in most areas, but that outbursts of rain might clip north-west Scotland on Saturday.
On Saturday, temperatures broke records in Scotland and Northern Ireland, with both areas seeing their warmest ever Easter Saturday. Temperatures reached 23.2C in Scotland, compared to a previous record high of 21.4C. For Northern Ireland it was 21C on Saturday, compared to the previous record of 19.4C. Easter Sunday and Monday records are likely to be broken, according to the Met Office.
The warmest Easter on record was on Easter Sunday in 1949, when the temperature was recorded at 29.4C in Camden Square, north London.In 2011, the temperature reached 26.9C at St James’s Park in central London on Good Friday, and 25.3C on Easter Sunday and 24C on Easter Monday, both in the Solent. Roberts said these last two temperatures were the ones that could beexceeded this weekend. She said the highest temperature on Friday was 24.5C, recorded at Wisley in Surrey. Southern England and south Wales could experience mist and fog, but that would dissipate pretty quickly in the morning with the strong sunshine. Roberts said cloud and rain would disappear by Monday. The warmest Easter Mondays recorded nationally were 21.4C in Culzean Castle, Scotland, in 2014, 23.2C in Nantmoor, Wales, in 1984, and 21.1C in Knockarevan, Northern Ireland, also in 1984.
One person tweeted: “Last night is the very first night this year I’ve slept with the window open. And how did I spend the hottest day of the year so far? At work!”
Others expressed concern about the high temperatures, with one person tweeting: “I think the new story here is the fact that the planet is about to be incinerated with climate change.”
Hundreds of demonstrators were in London this weekend as part of the Extinction Rebellion protest over climate change. The Metropolitan police said 106 people had been arrested on Friday, bringing the total number of arrests to 682 since the action started on Monday.
Emma Thompson, who joined the climate action protest, told activists her generation had failed young people.
… we can’t turn away from climate change. For The Guardian, reporting on the environment is a  priority.  We give climate, nature and pollution stories the prominence they deserve, stories which often go unreported by others in the mainstream media. At this critical time for our species and our planet, we are determined to inform readers about threats, consequences and solutions based on scientific facts, not political prejudice or business interests. But we need your support to grow our coverage, to travel to the remote frontlines of change and to cover vital conferences that affect us all.

With more than 1,500 officers on duty at the protests, Dick has asked demonstrators to move to an officially designated site in Marble Arch or go home.
Later on Saturday, hundreds of police officers were clearing activists from a blockade on Waterloo Bridge, where protesters have been since the Extinction Rebellion disruption campaign started five days ago.
The Press Association reported that by 6pm officers had removed six campaigners who had been chained and glued to the underside of a lorry on the bridge in an operation that took almost six hours.

Earlier, crowds clapped and cheered as activists who had been chained to the road at Oxford Circus were lifted into police vans.
Police drafted in 200 extra officers to deal with the protests, which began on Monday and have resulted in more than 750 arrests. Officers said they would try to clear Oxford Circus by the end of the Saturday.
Speaking to Sky News, Cressida Dick said that “lots of people have had miserable disruption to their lives” because of the anti-climate change movement.
“I’ve got one message for the protesters: please, go to Marble Arch where you can protest lawfully, stop your unlawful protests, and if you don’t want to go to Marble Arch then go home.”
An Extinction Rebellion spokesman at Waterloo Bridge said there were more than 100 officers on the bridge, with 14 police vans and a large tow truck at its south end and more vans at the north. “It looks like they are making a concerted effort to clear the bridge,” the spokesman said.
A video of police dragging demonstrators along the ground in an operation to remove a pink boat from Oxford Circus on Friday prompted concerns about police tactics against protesters, who have been polite and apologetic throughout.
Officers used angle grinders to cut through the bars below the hull of the Berta Cáceres boat, named after the murdered Honduran environmental activist, to which protesters had chained and glued themselves.
The intersection was calm on Saturday as bank holiday shoppers mingled with protesters, asking questions about the movement and its tactics.
Of the 750 people arrested in connection with the campaign as of 4pm on Saturday, which has included protests at Marble Arch and Parliament Square, 28 have been charged.
Extinction Rebellion is an international protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues. Demonstration have included blocking bridges to traffic in London and a semi-naked protest inside the House of Commons. 
The group says climate breakdown threatens all life on Earth, and so it is rebelling against politicians who 'have failed us', to provoke radical change that will stave off a climate emergency.
The Met said most of the arrests had been for breaching section 14 orders, which are in place in all the protest areas except Marble Arch. The force announced that on Friday it had renewed the order requiring protesters to clear Waterloo Bridge for a further three days.
On Saturday, police were accused of intimidating protesters, many of whom are young people, in an attempt to crush the movement. Mike Schwarz of Bindmans solicitors in London said he was concerned about elements of police conduct and tactics.
Schwarz, who is representing a large number of protesters, told the Observer that officers appeared to be attempting to scare people at the demonstrations, many of whom faced being arrested for the first time. By Saturday afternoon, only 28 people had been charged with an offence out of 750 arrested by 4pm.
“Police tactics, perhaps deliberately, run the risk of intimidating activists in the hope of subduing the protest,” Schwarz said. “Many of the arrests have been first-timers. The policing often appears disproportionate.”
He added: “There is concern about police conduct at the stations. They have been detaining people for hours – why are they keeping them in cells for so long? What is behind this? It might be a lack of resources, a lack of coordination and, simply, a war of attrition, where they are desperate to get people off the sites.”
Extinction Rebellion designated Oxford Circus a place to discuss the campaign with members of the public who have questions. On Saturday, bank holiday shoppers were keen to engage.
Michelle, 30, and Lee, 31, from St Helens in Merseyside, were eager to speak to activists during an Easter break in London after watching the campaign unfold on TV during the week.
“I agree with some of the points but I disagree with the methods,” Michelle said after a lengthy discussion with an activist, adding that the movement appeared quite London-centric.
“It wouldn’t happen in St Helens,” added her partner.
Milo, seven, was in Oxford Circus with his father and said he thought the protests were a good thing.

If climate change is not avoided, “it’s going to get so hot like Venus. Everyone is going to die and there’s going to be a total extinction. If the government listens, they might fly less planes and drive less cars,” he said.
Nick, a 56-year-old civil servant who was chained to the road at Oxford Circus, said it was “an unusual way to spend his annual leave”. He said he was not happy to be there and he did not take the possibility of being arrested lightly “but I’m going to be here as long as it takes”.
After actor Emma Thompson’s appearance at Oxford Circus on Friday, Olympic gold medalist Etienne Stott was among the latest celebrities to lend their support to the demonstrators. The London 2012 canoe slalom champion turned up at Waterloo Bridge after joining protests in Nottingham, and told the Press Association: “I joined the protests because I don’t think there is anything more meaningful that I could be doing in my life right now.
“The climate emergency is just such a serious thing, and for me I’m willing to put in as much time and energy as I can spare and try and use everything I can to try and make the situation better.”
The singer Charlotte Church tweeted her support saying that she would join the protesters in the future.
@ExtinctionR I'll be with you for the next one. I wanted to watch for a while, sorry not super brave,  but having seen how peaceful,creative, purposeful and family friendly your protest was I will join you next time. Thank you for your giving. Xx
Late on Saturday, just before midnight, there still appeared to be significant numbers of activists at three London sites – Waterloo Bridge, Oxford Circus and Parliament Square – despite the call from the Met chief to confine their demonstration to Marble Arch. 
Thanks for the support @charlottechurch and by the way the Rebellion has not finished. Our Rebels in London are still rebelling for life. So please do go there if you can because it would be great to have you there and you do not have to get arrested if you do not want to. 🌴🌻🍄 https://t.co/QeIMY3yGna

Climate change will cost trillions.
For example, what will it cost later this century to build a new much longer and higher Thames Barrier further downstream?
Many billions.
What about every other major city at or near sea level around the world?
Most of the biggest cities are in that category.
Can they all be defended? Or will they end up abandoned, with mass relocations?
What about the cost of mass migrations from the tropics?
Far far bigger than any of the recent migrations.
The geological record contains evidence of previous warming events related to high greenhouse gas concentrations due to the release of sequestered carbon.
People need to read about some previous warming events, like the end-Permian, the PETM, the Toarcian, and the ETM2. They are seen in the geochemical record as negative carbon isotope excursions.
These NCIEs mark sudden releases of sequestered carbon, are always associated with global warming, and with extinction events of varying severity.
At least one mass extinction is associated with lots of CO2 being formed by burning fossil fuel.
It was volcanic action that burned coal then, in Siberia.
There are a number of papers on that such as:
""Initial pulse of Siberian Traps sills as the trigger of the end-Permian mass extinction"" - Burgess et al, 2017

Flying’s an easy one. Simply add up the number of miles flown per year, divide it in two then divide that by the population and make that each person’s yearly ration. Or perhaps better, ration the fuel use similarly because long haul flights probably use less fuel per mile than short haul. 
Transport. Fossil fuel powered car miles will probably have to be cut by 75% because it’s hard to see us doing without lorries and it’s hard to see how lorries are going to be powered by batteries any time soon. Fortunately 90% of car journeys are less than 30 miles. These could be done in a new generation of very basic electric powered city cars. We could start with a two seater shopper extendable for more seats or as a van or flat bed. Max 30 mph, removable standard batteries exchangeable on the high street or chargeable at home.

For decades, political leaders have invoked rousing rhetoric in the face of this challenge while failing to act to avert catastrophe. Climate change is an existential risk to the future and the window available to prevent disastrous overheating is closing rapidly.
Only now, almost 30 years after the International Panel on Climate Change published its first report setting out the scientific evidence, is there any sense that something may be shifting in popular and political perceptions. Extinction Rebellion protesters have brought parts of central London to a standstill, their action coming in the wake of the school climate strikes, when more than 1.4 million young people took part globally. For his part, the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, warned the financial sector last week that it must take the threat seriously, framing the argument in terms that it understands best: that in a heated world there is a real risk to profit margins.
These are different responses to the same hard facts. The 20 warmest years since records began occurred in the past 22 years and the IPCC estimates we are likely to reach 1.5C above temperatures in pre-industrial times as early as 2030 on current trends. If we are to have any chance of keeping global warming to well below 2C, as set out in the Paris agreement, the world needs to reach net zero-carbon emissions by the middle of this century. The UN secretary general has warned that we have one year to change course to avoid missing this target.
The need for action is critical. The rate at which the world is warming is rapidly increasing and scientists fear we will soon reach a tipping point. One example would be the disappearance of Arctic sea ice in summer, an event that would impair Earth’s ability to reflect solar radiation and lead to even more warming and devastation. Global warming is already inflicting huge damage. We are seeing more extreme weather events – heatwaves, floods and droughts – with increasing cost to human, animal and plant life. Scientists believe 8% of the world’s species are at risk of extinction. A quarter of the world’s coral reefs have already died as a result of the warming of our oceans.
It will be the world’s poorest nations that will bear the brunt of the devastation to come, even though they have the least responsibility – they have made a negligible contribution to historic emissions, and the poorest half of the world is responsible for just 10% of annual emissions. Yet the consequences will continue to fall on these underprivileged countries.
However, there has been some progress. Carbon emissions are falling in many countries; in the UK, they have been cut to 19th-century levels. But these reductions have not come quickly enough and what has been achieved so far has been the gathering of the low-hanging fruit, such as closing coal-fired power stations, changes that have not required big lifestyle alterations.
Since 2015 the British government has performed a series of dizzying U-turns on climate change policy, sacrificing commitments such as zero-carbon homes and investment in carbon capture storage on the altar of austerity. Now Brexit is distracting us even more from the impending crisis. As a result, the UK is on course to decisively miss its own legally binding emissions targets for 2027 and 2032. Internationally, the election of President Trump has seen the United States withdraw from the Paris agreement, and the election of rightwing populists such as Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil poses a further threat to global progress.
The ratcheting up of the discourse reflects the ratcheting up of the stakes. Extinction Rebellion is a movement born of desperation, showcasing the determination of activists to use whatever peaceful tactics are necessary to get politicians to take the threat seriously. They enjoyed real success last week, forcing climate change into the headlines when it would otherwise have been ignored.
But there are limits to the effectiveness of this approach. Limiting global warming requires widespread lifestyle change among the world’s richest populations. Proposals for a green new deal developed on both sides of the Atlantic illustrate how much government can do with political commitment. But action is far more likely if voters are applying pressure on government to take the radical action that will shift people’s lifestyles and behaviour – through measures such as green taxation, regulation or even rationing.
So while a radical movement such as Extinction Rebellion can act as a much-needed catalyst to get people talking about climate change, the case for action will in the end need to be made in a much broader way that appeals to voters from across the political spectrum. There’s much to learn from the campaign for equal marriage in the US, which successfully won round conservative voters by framing the argument not primarily in the language of rights, but in values of love, commitment and family.
This remains the missing link in avoiding catastrophic climate change. How to make people see that this is the most existential threat humankind has ever faced, yet without making them feel fatalistic about their lack of ability to influence events. If we fail to crack this conundrum, the future of our planet hangs in the balance.
… we have a small favour to ask. More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute.

The long road to a zero-emissions UK,article,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/21/long-road-to-zero-emissions-uk,374,"It is the near future. You wake in a house warmed by a heat pump that extracts energy from deep below the ground and delivers it to your home. (Your gas boiler was outlawed years ago.) You rise and make yourself a cup of tea – from water boiled on a hydrogen-burning kitchen stove. Then you head to work – in a robot-driven electric car directed by central control network to avoid traffic jams.
At midday, you pause for lunch: a sandwich made of meat grown in a laboratory. At the end of the day, you are taken home by a robot car – through countryside festooned with solar panels and turbines.
Welcome to carbon-free Britain, a nation stripped of its petrol cars, diesel trucks and trains, gas heating, methane-belching cows, and jumbo jets. The UK of tomorrow is a zero-emissions haven.
Or at least that is the dream, one that is now being pursued with passion by growing numbers of UK citizens. Indignant at the lack of political effort being made to curtail global warming, they have responded with mounting outrage which last week reached a peak during Extinction Rebellion’s protests in London.
Creating a zero-emission society in the UK has become a major cause and it will receive further serious promotion next week when the government’s climate change committee publishes its report on how, and when, Britain can achieve this status and play a proper part in the battle against global warming.
It will be hard work, as the committee will make clear. Last year 6.8 tonnes of greenhouse gases were emitted into the atmosphere per head of population in the UK. To decarbonise the nation, that figure will have to be reduced to zero.
The crucial question is: when? Just how quickly can we eliminate our carbon emissions? Extinction Rebellion protesters are clear. They want the UK to be decarbonised by 2025. That will mean massive curtailment of travel by car or plane, major changes in food production – steaks would become culinary treats of the past – and the construction of swathes of wind and solar plants. But given that we face disastrous climatic change, only massive, widespread, rapid interventions can now save us from a fiery global fate, they say.
Many experts disagree, however. They argue that such an imminent target is completely impractical. “Yes, you could decarbonise Britain by 2025 but the cost of implementing such vast changes at that speed would be massive and hugely unpopular,” says Lord Turner, former chairman of the climate change committee.
Most expect the climate change committee will plump for 2050 as Britain’s ideal decarbonisation date. “2050 is do-able and desirable and would have an insignificant overall cost to the economy,” states Turner, who is now chairman of the Energy Transitions Commission. According to this scenario, developed nations, including Britain, would aim to achieve zero-emissions status by 2050 and then use the decarbonising technologies they have developed to achieve this goal – hydrogen plants, carbon dioxide storage vaults and advanced renewable generators – to help developing nations halt their greenhouse gas emissions by 2060.
We would then have a reasonable chance of restricting global warming to less than 2C and so avoid the worst effects of climate change: unprecedented storms, melting ice caps, disappearing coral reefs, rising sea levels and drowned cities.
But just how straightforward will it be to create a zero-emissions society? How easily will we be able to kick the carbon habit? At first glance, the evidence looks encouraging. Britain has already embarked on a path of carbon emissions reduction for its power generation industry. Fossil fuel plants have been closed and wind farms have been built in their place.
And the change has already been reflected in Britain’s power statistics. In 2013, 62.5% of UK electricity was generated by oil, coal and gas stations, while renewable provided only 14.5%. In 2018, the figure for oil, coal and gas had been reduced to 44% while renewables were generating 31.7%. It is a distinct improvement – though we have yet to be given a date when engineers expect the last UK fossil-fuelled power plant to produce its final watts of electricity and to emit its last puffs of carbon dioxide.
“Decarbonising UK power production is going well,” says George Day, head of policy for the technology and innovation centre Energy Systems Catapult. “There is a clear path forward.” But as he points out, there are many other sources of carbon dioxide in the UK. “The next big challenge will be heating. Gas boilers are major carbon emitters and dealing with them is going to be very difficult.”
According to Day, about 90% of British people have gas boilers in their homes, most having been fitted relatively recently – over the past 20 to 30 years or so. “And we have really come to love them,” he states. “You get hot water and heating at a flick of a switch, after all.
And that is a problem, he argues. “Dislodging that incumbent technology in a way that is socially acceptable is going to be really hard. Indeed it is probably the toughest challenge we face in decarbonising Britain because you are talking about homes where people are used to making their own decisions.”
A solution would be to price gas out of common use, by putting increasingly heavy carbon taxes on household supplies so people can no longer afford them and are forced to change heating systems. But that would only lead to widespread protests, says Day. “Just look at the gilets jaunes,” he points out.
Instead, ways will have to be found to entice householders – not compel them – to move away from gas heating to alternatives such as electric heating, heat pumps and hydrogen-burning radiators. “They will have to see it as a better alternative to gas heating,” says Day. “It will be a big task but I believe it can be done.”
Time will be a key consideration. At present around 20,000 homes a year are being converted into low-carbon housing units. “However if we are serious about reaching zero emissions by 2050 then we are going to move with a lot more urgency,” adds Day. “By 2025, we will have to be converting around a million houses a year.”
Nor is household heating the only headache facing the decarbonisation of the UK. Steel-making, cement manufacture, shipping, aviation and trucking also pose problems.
Consider cement. It is the basic ingredient of concrete, the second most consumed substance in the world – behind water. Around 10 million tonnes of cement are used every year in a host of construction projects across the UK, from homes to new underground lines. (Hundreds of thousand of tonnes are being used to build the access shafts, underground stations, and tunnels for Crossrail, for example.)
Cement manufacture requires heat which could be supplied using electricity generated by renewables. But a major problem remains: making cement involves breaking down limestone to obtain calcium oxide and that process releases carbon dioxide in significant amounts. It is estimated that cement manufacture is responsible for about 8% of current global emissions. Nor is it obvious how to find ways to eradicate them completely.
Then there are farms and planes. “In the case of aviation, you might use batteries and hydrogen to power relatively small aircraft for short distances: a 100-seater for a flight of an hour or so,” says Turner. “But for a jumbo across the Atlantic you will still need fuels with the energy density of heavy liquid hydrocarbons.”
As for agriculture, it is estimated that around 6 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide) are emitted from farms around the world. Major reductions could be achieved through improved management practices, say researchers. Nevertheless eating the meat of belching cows, no matter how tasty is the resulting steak, undoubtedly has a major impact on emission levels. Changes in the British diet will be needed.
In the end, it will simply not be possible to reduce Britain’s fossil-fuel emissions to zero, say scientists. To compensate, we will have to take carbon dioxide back out of the atmosphere. “That is the logical, inevitable consequence of trying to achieve zero net emissions in this country,” argues Corinne Le Quéré, of the University of East Anglia. “If you are looking for any net zero target then you have to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.”
This can be done in three ways: naturally, by planting trees and shrubs that absorb carbon dioxide. Or artificially – on a larger scale – the gas can be removed as it is produced at a factory or power station that burns trees for energy.
Or it can be removed by huge numbers of man-made air filters, known as direct air capture. The carbon dioxide can be liquefied and stored underground in underground caverns, or old, depleted gas fields under the North Sea. This is known as carbon capture utilisation and underground storage (CCUS).
“In the end, your choice of replanting or of building underground storage facilities depends on how much carbon you will need to remove,” says Le Quéré. “Most calculations suggest Britain will need to take quite a lot of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere to keep its net emissions at zero.”
That arithmetic clearly implies that Britain will need to build a number of CCUS plants, a point backed by Charlotte Morgan, who chaired a recent task force that urged the construction of several carbon storage facilities in the UK. Each of these would be able to hold millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide.
“These could create an enormous industry for Britain,” says Morgan, who envisages the creation of five industrial clusters – in Humberside, Merseyside, South Wales, central Scotland and Teeside – where CCUS facilities could be built and attract industries from around the world. “However, if we want to these up and running by the end of the next decade, we need to act quickly.”
This need for speed is shared by many other parts of the zero-emissions programme, as we have seen. It may seem odd given it is unlikely it will reach its conclusion for another three decades. Nevertheless, scientists are adamant that even if choose 2050 for our decarbonisation date, we need to act now.
This urgency of the task is emphasized by Joeri Rogelj at Imperial College London. “If the world limits emissions of carbon dioxide to no more than 420 billion tonnes this century, we will have a two in three chance of keeping global warming down to around 1.5C.
“However, if we go above to 580 billion tonnes then our chances will be reduced to 50-50. The problem is that in 2017 alone, a total of 42 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide was emitted in a single year. By that calculation, we clearly do not have a lot of time to waste.”
… we can’t turn away from climate change. For The Guardian, reporting on the environment is a  priority.  We give climate, nature and pollution stories the prominence they deserve, stories which often go unreported by others in the mainstream media. At this critical time for humanity and our planet, we are determined to inform readers about threats, consequences and solutions based on scientific facts, not political prejudice or business interests. But we need your support to grow our coverage, to travel to the remote frontlines of change and to cover vital conferences that affect us all.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute.

So we have a new date for our diaries, to split the nation once more between those howling bereft anguish and those who wish it would all just go away: 20 May is now going to be Threxit day, the day Game of Thrones finally departs our screens.
Whether you’re a diehard fan or not, you can’t really deny that it has been part of our on-off national conversation for the last eight years or so, even more so than Harry Potter the previous decade; and, if you happen to live in Ulster, Iceland or Croatia, it will even have brought a grin to your local finances. It has made fantasy, that spoddiest of jester genres, acceptable (because it wasn’t really about that, ever, just power-politics limned in a simpler medieval brutality); shown that women can be powerful without somehow having to be hobbled with niceness: perhaps, above all, reclaimed television’s vital and urgent power, aided immensely by the franchised dreck of cinematic “blockbusters”, so spawning an exodus of screenwriting, directing, acting talent back to the living room.
This final series opener thus had a lot to live up to. It disappointed some, with its perceived failure to move things significantly forward: personally, I was delighted, as, after a nearly two-year hiatus, it gave us all a chance to remind ourselves precisely where we were. At Winterfell was where we were, barnacled in rime or covered in furs, though there have to be new definitions of intensity of “cold” to fully convey Sansa’s pass-agg mien on having to welcome Daenerys. The Wall has been breached, a dragon has been recruited to the undead Walkers, and all is set for a quite stupendous battle, possibly episode four or so, to rival, in scope and quite possibly in actual budget, the Normandy invasion.
In all this, it was a grand opener, shot through with dark humour and the occasional tendresse. It all got a little briefly Hollywood with the dragon-ride over Iceland’s striated mad beauties, and my knee jiggled in sympathy with Thrones purists who must have gag-reflexed when came a dragon-snort, half-love, half-jealousy, at Dany and Jon’s waterfall-clinch, but still… and Jon!
Jon Snow had a happy episode! Not only did he get to ride a dragon, and find out he was not a “bastard” (in the proper sense of the word rather than simply someone who carves you up on the motorway); but, even better, he’s actually heir to the Iron Throne. Good episode for Jon. (If bad news for his putative love life, but then again, 20 May is coming, and if you can’t shag your aunt before you die… one thing that particularly separates this from Lord of the Rings is its insistence on twincest and the like). And for us. I particularly loved what was surely a back-reference to the one misstep the casting directors have made, shoehorning in Ed Sheeran at the height of his unaccountable fame just because he was (unaccountably) famous, to act very badly as a soldier. As Bronn gossips in his naked frolicking, after the war with Daenerys that “boy Eddie... the ginger... came back with his face burned off”. These casting supremos know how to retro-suckerpunch.
More of Iceland, little of it good though, in a simply superb exposition of Climate Change: The Facts. My, after his brief and ongoing Netflix sojourn, Attenborough’s really been allowed to take off the gloves, hasn’t he? No wonder, after 30 years of his trying to tell us all of this, politely thirled both by his love of the BBC and their absurd insistence on “balance”.
Yet balance was what the many sharp scientists, most of whom have led the way in this, attempted throughout to show in this one-off (in many senses). Their language was always couched with “coulds” and “all indicators suggests”, as they told a quite simple horror story of, essentially, how our last chance to combat global warming has had the legs cut from under it by the recent deforestation of a third of global woodland for palm-oil growth, and the near-certain climatic tipping points this is entirely likely to engender. It was left to David Attenborough to quietly expound on how that immensely careful use of language by the least alarmist of scientists has been the very thing that has allowed politicians, oil companies, climate-change deniers, a tissue-thin excuse to delay. This was immense, and I do rather wish he’d taken the gloves off 30 years back.
We had (blessedly briefly) old footage of Lord Lawson of Winterfell, apparently only him, again and again, telling us essentially that even if the world did get warmer it was a good thing because, said this gentleman who used to keep his hands tight on our Treasury’s windpipe, it would mean fewer people dying of cold.
There’s still time, was the message, in both this programme and in Earth from Space, something I’d thought might be a bit gimmicky but turned out to be cloyingly watchable. We watched, rapt, as cameras from space zoomed in on elephants, individual seals, hippo-paths; importantly, though, on the interconnectedness of tiny planetary currents, oceanic and other. As Chiwetel Ejiofor nicely noted in this first (of four) he voices, we thought we were going looking into space; we are ending up learning a now-crucial lot about our planet. He had nicely prosaic hints as to ways forward, to gainsay, for instance, the destruction of half the world’s wildlife in 80 years. Eat all the food we buy. Avoid air-freighted food. Avoid beef and sheep, because they fart. This is something we can do, now.
Back to Life, set in Hythe with a fat sprinkling of Dungeness, has something of the same flavour of Don’t Forget the Driver, in what may be termed the new genre of sadcom, but a very different premise. Lass released from jail after 18 years, returning (against all our instincts) to pick up her pieces, locally, where everyone hates her and her own mother hides the knives. This six-parter is, in places, bitter as nuclear wind, in places life-affirmingly warm and funny, and Daisy Haggard knows, very much, what she’s doing, holding a vial of smelling salts up to our own lazy censoriousness with wit and style and melancholy, and expect awards.
Hard to get, yet, where the second series of Trust Me is going, with its crippled soldier-veteran in a Glasgow hospital where threat lurks, especially at night, with every pair of scissors, every abandoned nurse-station, as we thrust power ever further into beeping machines and hence hugely enable one dodgy human’s intervention. So far, so very tense, for the first of four, and I for one Trust It, even if you might never trust late-night wards again.
In Chimerica, Lucy Kirkwood’s so far splendid adaptation of her own play, we get a killer line at the start of the first (of four) which sums up much of what will follow. “She [a protesting woman] wants to know what happens after you get a dream of democracy,” asks a translator, for a photographer in Tiananmen Square, 1989. “We know what China is dreaming of. What is America dreaming of?”
The gung-ho snapper moves on from Pentax to digital Canon, and moves on from global fame, having snapped the man who stood against the tanks in the square, to ignominy. He adulterates a picture in Syria, today, for greater impact in a global half-hour news cycle, in a post-Trump, post-truth world. Obviously, it’s the very worst thing he could have done, braving the war zones but playing right into the prez’s tiny hands. The fallout, in the play, in the series, in real China, in real America, in real journalism, is enough to drive one to Westeros.
… we can’t turn away from climate change. The Guardian’s environmental coverage reports the scientific facts, social consequences and political choices that are shaping the fate of our planet. As the world's leaders turn their backs on the environment, we are at a crisis point. Individual consumer choices are important, but we need collective action to achieve the systemic change that will really make a difference. Our pioneering and our fearless reporting on the environment can play a vital role in that. But we need our readers’ support.

In a speech on Sunday night where she took aim at politicians who have for too long been able to satisfy demands for action with “beautiful words and promises”, the Swedish 16-year-old said humanity was sitting at a crossroads, but that those gathered had chosen which path they wish to take.
Extinction Rebellion is an international protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues. Demonstration have included blocking bridges to traffic in London and a semi-naked protest inside the House of Commons. 
The group says climate breakdown threatens all life on Earth, and so it is rebelling against politicians who 'have failed us', to provoke radical change that will stave off a climate emergency.
“I come from Sweden and back there its almost the same problem as here, as everywhere, that nothing is being done to stop an ecological crisis despite all the beautiful words and promises,” she told the crowd.
“We are now facing an existential crisis, the climate crisis and ecological crisis which have never been treated as crises before, they have been ignored for decades.
“And for way too long the politicians and the people in power have gotten away with not doing anything. We will make sure that politician’s will not get away with it for any longer.”
Her speech came amid police efforts to forcibly clear Extinction Rebellion protesters from Waterloo Bridge as the group debated whether to continue its campaign of mass civil disobedience. Police said on Sunday night they had cleared all the protesters from Parliament Square.
The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said the disruption was “counter-productive” to the cause of climate change and was stretching resources so much it could damage police’s ability to fight violent crime.
Extinction Rebellion had earlier said it expected its supporters would be cleared out of the two sites occupied without permission as police prepared to evict them if they declined to leave voluntarily.
Last week, the group gained global coverage for the disruption its tactics of civil disobedience caused in central London. On Sunday, the organisers said they intended to change tack and would offer to vacate some sites in exchange for the mayor acting on some of their demands.
The Metropolitan police said they had made 963 arrests and charged 42 people. The force’s leader, Cressida Dick, said the group’s tactics, centred on peaceful direct action, had caused too much disruption.
On Saturday, Oxford Circus and Piccadilly Circus were returned to normal use, after complaints from businesses about the blocking of some of the capital’s key arteries.
On Sunday, activists rushed to Parliament Square, when police turned up in force to try to clear five roadblocks. Activists were using lock-on devices to hold the space, as well as gluing themselves to the ground and each other in order to slow down the police.
Activists said there were three people locked on trees in the square with more ready to go up. They promised attempts to evict them would be “spectacular” and could take police all night. However, by Sunday evening the police said the square had been cleared.
The stage-truck on Waterloo Bridge was finally removed by 5am on Sunday after police spent most of Saturday and well into the night removing protesters glued and locked on to it. Police spent hours using angle grinders to cut free the two protesters who had locked themselves down on the top of truck, before winching them down and carrying them into the back of waiting police vans.
By Sunday night they were moving the activists to one side of the carriageway, and arresting those who are refusing to move.
The Met has needed support from about 200 officers from other forces to deal with the protests, which have been peaceful.
Khan said 9,000 officers had been involved in policing the protest so far. He said: “I share the passion about tackling climate change of those protesting, and support the democratic right to peaceful and lawful protest, but this is now taking a real toll on our city – our communities, businesses and police. This is counter-productive to the cause and our city.”
The mayor added: “I remain in close contact with the Met commissioner, and agree that Londoners have suffered too much disruption and that the policing operation has been extremely challenging for our over-stretched and under-resourced police.
“I’m extremely concerned about the impact the protests are having on our ability to tackle issues like violent crime if they continue any longer. It simply isn’t right to put Londoners’ safety at risk like this.”
The protest group said a phalanx of police vans were gathered around Waterloo Bridge on Sunday amid mounting expectation protesters would be forced out.
Ronan McNern, a spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion, said: “We think they want everything cleared by the end of the week. People are willing to be arrested. There is a deep sense we do not want to be attached to any single site. What this disruption is doing, we are the news now. It is making people talk in pubs and buses about Extinction Rebellion. It makes them think about their existence which is under threat.”
Extinction Rebellion is discussing withdrawing from some sites in return for being allowed to remain in others and having its demands met.
One manifesto from Farhana Yamin, an international environmental lawyer, advocated a “pause” in disruption next week to better project their demands and press for negotiations with government.
She wrote: “Today marks a transition from week one, which focused on actions that were vision-holding but also caused mass ‘disruption’ across many dimensions (economic, cultural, emotional, social). Week two marks a new phase of rebellion focused on ‘negotiations’ where the focus will shift to our actual political demands.”
She continued: “We want to show that XR [Extinction Rebellion] is a cohesive long-term, global force, not some flash in the pan.”
Others in the group’s leadership were planning further disruption and a meeting this week will attempt to decide on the group’s strategy.
… in the fight to protect the environment. By keeping the Guardian’s environmental coverage open and accessible, we can report on the changes needed to avoid climate and natural catastrophe. The choices made by individuals are important, but we need to work together for the systemic transformation that will make a real difference. As well as reporting the facts about what is happening now, we investigate the causes and talk to the people trying to make the future better. But we need our readers’ support.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism.

The roads around Parliament Square were cleared of protesters earlier on Sunday, with the northbound carriageway of Waterloo Bridge reopened to traffic by the evening. On Sunday night, police continued their operations, moving to remove the last activists, who had glued themselves to the bridge and to each other.
Officers had earlier warned people that remaining on the bridge was an “arrestable offence”, and requested that the activists move to Marble Arch, the designated protest area, where hundreds of activists remain.
However, many demonstrators chose to stay at the Waterloo Bridge site, drumming, dancing and singing all along the bridge. At least six campaigners were chained to each other by their hands, with their arms covered with various substances to slow the process of removal by officers. Two men who had glued their hands to the lampposts on Waterloo Bridge were cut free by officers and arrested.
The last protester on the bridge, a 70-year-old woman who did not wish to be named, told the Press Association that said she felt embarrassed to be the last one and was “trying to look dignified”. Having already been arrested at Oxford Circus “chasing after a pink yacht”, she said she would rather be arrested again than walk away, as per the requests of officers.
Asked why it was important for her to join the movement, she said: “I have been a nurse and a childminder most of my life. The world we are leaving for the children and grandchildren is going to be horrendous and we let it happen. It happened on our watch. So we have to stand up and fight or lie down and fight.”
The Metropolitan police has requested about 200 extra officers to help deal with the protests, in which 963 people have been arrested and 42 people, aged from 19 to 77, charged.
Extinction Rebellion have said there will be a “people’s assembly” at Marble Arch on Monday afternoon to decide what will happen in the coming week, with the movement appearing split on what next steps to take in their campaign of non-violent civil disobedience.
Greta Thunberg, the teenage climate campaigner, made a speech in solidarity with the protesters in Marble Arch. The Swedish student took aim at the “politicians and people in power” who had long been able to satisfy demands for action with “beautiful words and promises”, and declared that governments would no longer be able ignore the impending climate and ecological crisis.
“I come from Sweden and back there it’s almost the same problem as here, as everywhere, that nothing is being done to stop an ecological crisis despite all the beautiful words and promises,” she said, after being greeted with loud cheers.
“We are now facing an existential crisis, the climate crisis and ecological crisis which have never been treated as crises before. They have been ignored for decades and for way too long the politicians and the people in power have gotten away with not doing anything. We will make sure that politicians will not get away with it for any longer.”
Thunberg, who has been credited with inspiring a worldwide movement to reduce carbon emissions, said humanity was sitting at a crossroads. She told those gathered at Marble Arch that they had chosen which ecological path they wanted to take. She emphasised that they were now waiting for the rest of the world to follow their example.
“We are the ones making a difference, we the people in this Extinction Rebellion and the children’s school strike for the climate,” she said. “It shouldn’t be like that, but since no one else is doing anything, we will have to do so.
 “We will never stop fighting for this planet, for ourselves, our futures and for the futures of our children and grandchildren.” Later, Massive Attack played a concert for the crowds.
Thunberg will meet MPs including the Green party MP Caroline Lucas, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and the environment secretary, Michael Gove, next week. She has been touring Europe throughout her Easter holidays, imploring leaders to take radical action before it is too late.
Last week, she poured scorn on EU leaders for holding three emergency summits on Brexit and none on the threat posed by climate change, suggesting that it evidenced politicians’ disinterest in tackling climate change. Her speech was given a standing ovation.
Thousands of Extinction Rebellion campaigners had blocked four areas in central London on Monday, but on Saturday police regained control of Oxford Circus.

By which I mean, that most people are emphasising the sources of atmospheric carbon and carbon-dioxide creation, particularly man’s contribution, but are not really looking at the global carbon cycle sinks, the importance of them, and what is happening to them.
Which is just as, if not more important than the increasing man made carbon-dioxide sources.
Global carbon sinks have been a part of the Earths system of achieving a stable condition for millions of years. And is now, in the age of man, what has been called homeostases. A condition which represents a stable balance of carbon sources and carbon sinks, that result in an environment that is suitable for life on Earth, including man.
Courtesy of James Lovelock, we now refer to homeostases as part of the Gaia hypothesis, whereby the whole biosphere of the Earth’s life forms are regarded as part of a natural system, that is self regulating the conditions that make life on the Earth possible.
Without life on Earth, the temperatures on Earth would be much higher. Since the start of the solar system, the sun has got hotter, by about 10% every billion years. Which means it is now over 40% hotter than it was at the start. Fortunately, for us, life on Earth managed to get a toe hold, and prevail and evolved for long enough to begin to affect its own environment and change the biosphere. Other neighbouring planets were not so well placed, with Venus being too close to the sun, where it got too hot, too fast to allow life to get to the point where it could sufficiently affect its own environment. And Mars lost its atmosphere, because it lost its magnetosphere.
The Earths natural, life based regulator has been going on for millions and billions of years. where the carbon sources, such as volcanoes, are matched with carbon sinks. On land the plants, forests, and grasslands lead to the creation of peat beds, which is the first step in burying carbon longer term, plus other organic matter which results in coal and oil layers. In the oceans a similar long term carbon burying occurs, mainly from phytoplankton and zooplankton, plus other organics to sediments, and eventually hydrocarbon layers.
The important point to note, is that the Earths extent of the forests+ and plankton+ grew and evolved to the point that where necessary and sustainable to created the equilibrium, before the advent of man.
What man has done in recent history, is undo and break Earths natural system that creates the homeostasis.
He has done this in a two fold process. Firstly he has dug up the buried carbon, in the form of the hydrocarbons, and burning them. Thereby releasing the carbon and undoing what was necessary to compensate the increasing temperature of the sun. 
And secondly, he has, and continues to destroy vast areas of forests and grassland carbon sinks on a global industrial scale , and is overloading the worlds carbon sink oceans, causing rising levels of dissolved carbon dioxide, and increasing levels of acidity, which in turn is putting plankton and other carbon sinks at risk.
So in summary, it is simply not enough to achieve zero carbon emissions from man. It is also necessary to stop destroying the Earths natural carbon sinks.Finally, it’s also worth noting that with deforestation, the peat beds beneath them are exposed and try out. Which then rather being the biggest of the land based carbon sinks actually turn into a major carbon source, further exacerbating the problem
So the activists needs to also turn their attention to the carbon sink destroyers, with even more urgency. Because controlling man’s contribution to the carbon cycle will be very very difficult, but if we destroy the Earths natural carbon sinks that task will be impossible.', u'recommendation_count': u'15', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1555935263000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'that', u'effect': u'an environment that is suitable for life on earth including man'}, {u'cause': u'it lost its magnetosphere', u'effect': u'and mars lost its atmosphere'}, {u'cause': u'which', u'effect': u'coal and oil layers'}, {u'cause': u'the plants forests', u'effect': u'the creation of peat beds plus other organic matter which results in coal and oil layers'}, {u'cause': None, u'effect': u'rising levels of dissolved carbon dioxide'}], u'author_id': u'13100732', u'id': u'128265185', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'5nufk1n4prez', u'text': u'Why don't you like Malala?', u'recommendation_count': u'29', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1555935252000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'18498746', u'in_reply_to': u'128265068', u'id': u'128265176', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'vtiman', u'text': u'You sound like you probably need to be.', u'recommendation_count': u'39', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1555935248000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'3991184', u'in_reply_to': u'128264930', u'id': u'128265174', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'JulesBywaterLees', u'text': u'No, we need to get on with dealing with climate change- if we can fix our democracy in the process then great- but we need to walk, talk and chew gum.', u'recommendation_count': u'6', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1555935231000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'4738374', u'in_reply_to': u'128264591', u'id': u'128265171', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Spike501', u'text': u'Guess what - dealing with climate change involves hard choices.', u'recommendation_count': u'37', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1555935215000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'4632941', u'in_reply_to': u'128265022', u'id': u'128265166', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'erenata', u'text': u'Without America on board, it is all a waste of effort', u'recommendation_count': u'4', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1555935199000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'14430328', u'id': u'128265158', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'riveness', u'text': u'Nope as consumption is a dead cert to grow.

One the most telling lines in d'Ancona's piece for me is when he writes: ""More striking has been the media’s general inability to understand the XR uprising."" It reminded me instantly of an Emily Maitlis interview with someone from UK Uncut, whose actions are precursors to some of XR's earlier events. UK Uncut had been carrying out a disruptive but entirely peaceful action in a shop very near where, outside, an unrelated group of black bloc demonstrators had kicked in a window. The window kicking-in had attracted all the media attention, the police turned up and had arrested whoever they could, including the UK Uncut activists. Maitlis's interview got a couple of minutes in when, suddenly she asked the UK Uncut member to condemn the black bloc kicking-in of the window. The UK Uncut person appeared completely baffled why she was being asked to comment on something she and her group hadn't been responsible for, which was the ostensible issue. Maitlis just plugged on repeatedly, apparently unable to understand that her question was irrelevant to her interviewee.

She’s young, admired around the world and her name is Greta Thunberg. She’s a 16-year-old climate hero and I couldn’t be more proud to be co-hosting her visit.
Greta’s rise to fame has been vertiginous. Last year she skipped school and sat in front of the Swedish parliament in protest against inaction on climate change – and now she is one of the figureheads of a school climate strike movement that has swept the globe, which more than a million young people taking to the streets last month to demand that world leaders step up to this monumental challenge.
The success of the strike is not incidental. Every red light is flashing on the Earth’s dashboard. The 20 warmest years on record all happened in the last 22 years. Nature and wildlife populations are at crisis levels across the world. Wildfires and droughts are becoming increasingly common – with people in the global south already dying from the effects of climate change which were mostly caused by countries in the north. Here in the UK, communities are under serious threat from flooding, sea level rises, extreme heat and more.
Of course Greta had to act. And of course thousands followed her.
In the UK, Extinction Rebellion is also making waves. By putting their bodies on the line in protest against climate change, its members aren’t just creating headlines, they are showing moral courage at a time when too many politicians are taking us backwards. Greta arrives today in a country that talks the talk on climate, but simply won’t walk the walk. Not only are the government cheerleaders for dirty fossil fuels like fracking, but they’ve cut support for renewables like wind and solar. When we look back at this moment in a generation’s time, the real criminals won’t be seen as those blockading bridges – it will be those who understood the science of climate change, yet consistently blocked action to prevent its worst effects.
Yet despite government intransigence, there are real grounds for hope. We have the means to start to tackle this crisis – from renewable energy to clean and sustainable public transport. It is cheap and it is here; we just need to the political will to scale it up and roll it out, the first steps towards utterly transforming the global economy. And we need to take every step together, in a new, genuinely inclusive politics.
There is hope in a generation of people who are demanding from their leaders not just what seems politically possible but what is scientifically necessary to prevent total climate breakdown. That generation builds on longstanding struggles, particularly from environmental defenders who have risked – and given – their lives defending their land, water and rights against the power of fossil fuel firms who have stopped at nothing in their pursuit of the bottom line.
So when Greta takes to the stage today, she will see in front of her hundreds of people of her age who aren’t afraid to take a stand, and she will stand on the shoulders of the many environmental defenders who have stood before her.
Make no mistake, the climate movement has broken into the mainstream – and it is here to stay. Our task now is to meet every promise by a politician with a demand to go further, to scale up our ambition as those at the top seek to appease us with warm words and rousing rhetoric. We must be deadly serious about getting the work done to avoid the worst of this climate catastrophe.
If we don’t rise to this task,and don’t rise to it now, then we condemn Greta’s generation, and generations to follow, to a future framed by wildfire and drought – it’s as simple as that.

… we can’t turn away from climate change. The Guardian’s environmental coverage reports the scientific facts, social consequences and political choices that are shaping the fate of our planet. As the world's leaders turn their backs on the environment, we are at a crisis point. Individual consumer choices are important, but we need collective action to achieve the systemic change that will really make a difference. Our pioneering and our fearless reporting on the environment can play a vital role in that. But we need our readers’ support.

The president chose instead to praise the benefits of a “strong market economy”.
In response, one leading climate scientist said Trump’s environmental policy was “in many cases the antithesis of protection”. The executive director of the Sierra Club said Trump was “the worst president for the environment our nation has ever had”.
Trump praised the “abundant beauty and life-sustaining bounty” of the American environment but did not echo growing warnings from scientists over rising temperatures or the precipitous decline of many species.
“Environmental protection and economic prosperity go hand in hand,” Trump said in his message for Earth Day, a global event held to support environmental protection annually since 1970.
“A strong market economy is essential to protecting our critical natural resources and fostering a legacy of conservation. My administration is committed to being effective stewards of our environment while encouraging opportunities for American workers and their families.”
Trump added: “At the same time that our nation is experiencing historic economic and job growth, our air and water quality ranks among the highest in the world.” He stated that his administration has “expanded support for conservation of land, water and wildlife”.
Last year, US government scientists issued a 1,000-page climate change assessment that warned the country faces hundreds of billions of dollars in economic losses due to rising temperatures, flooding and wildfires. Thousands of Americans are expected to die in worsening heatwaves, with diseases such as West Nile, dengue fever, chikungunya and Lyme set to expand in range as temperatures rise and rainfall patterns change.
“The fact that they’re not mentioning what many consider to be the gravest existential threat facing humanity is a good indication of the priorities of this administration,” said Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&amp;M University.
“The clear priority of the administration is extracting unsustainable short-term profits from the environment, which is in many cases the antithesis of environmental protection. This is not surprising.”
Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, called Trump “the worst president for the environment our nation has ever had”, adding: “He has regularly and consistently prioritized the profits of corporate polluters over clean air, clean water and the health of our communities.
“The fact that he continues to ignore the climate crisis endangers the nation and will be viewed by history with scorn.”
Trump has routinely disparaged climate science and has attempted to dismantle every major policy aimed at lowering planet-warming emissions, favoring a watered down alternative his administration admits would cause an extra 1,400 deaths a year from air pollution. In June 2017, he announced the withdrawal of the US from the Paris climate deal.
The administration has thrown open vast tracts of public land and almost all US waters to oil, gas and coalmining, removed protections from some prized landscapes and scrapped rules that stopped mining waste being dumped into rivers.
Trump, who recently erroneously claimed that wind turbines cause cancer, has repeatedly stated that the US has some of the cleanest air and water in the world.
In fact, while the US’s air is generally far healthier than growing economic powers such as China and India, the American Lung Association has pointed out that four in 10 Americans still live in counties with harmful levels of smog.
Millions of Americans are also exposed to drinking water containing industrial chemicals, while lead in water remains a widespread issue five years after the notorious contamination in Flint, Michigan.

The Guardian is partnering with CJR and the Nation on a 30 April conference aimed at reframing the way journalists cover climate change. More information about the conference, including a link to RSVP, is here.
Last summer, during the deadliest wildfire season in California’s history, MSNBC’s Chris Hayes got into a revealing Twitter discussion about why US television doesn’t much cover climate change. Elon Green, an editor at Longform, had tweeted, “Sure would be nice if our news networks – the only outlets that can force change in this country – would cover it with commensurate urgency.” Hayes (who is an editor at large for the Nation) replied that his program had tried. Which was true: in 2016, All In With Chris Hayes spent an entire week highlighting the impact of climate change in the US as part of a look at the issues that Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were ignoring. The problem, Hayes tweeted, was that “every single time we’ve covered [climate change] it’s been a palpable ratings killer. So the incentives are not great.”
The Twittersphere pounced. “TV used to be obligated to put on programming for the public good even if it didn’t get good ratings. What happened to that?” asked @JThomasAlbert. @GalJaya said, “Your ‘ratings killer’ argument against covering #climatechange is the reverse of that used during the 2016 primary when corporate media justified gifting Trump $5 billion in free air time because ‘it was good for ratings,’ with disastrous results for the nation.”
When @mikebaird17 urged Hayes to invite Katharine Hayhoe of Texas Tech University, one of the best climate science communicators around, on to his show, she tweeted that All In had canceled on her twice – once when “I was literally in the studio w[ith] the earpiece in my ear” – and so she wouldn’t waste any more time on it.
“Wait, we did that?” Hayes tweeted back. “I’m very very sorry that happened.”
This spring Hayes redeemed himself, airing perhaps the best coverage on American television yet of the Green New Deal. All In devoted its entire 29 March broadcast to analyzing the congressional resolution, co-sponsored by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey, which outlines a plan to mobilize the United States to stave off climate disaster and, in the process, create millions of green jobs. In a shrewd answer to the ratings challenge, Hayes booked Ocasio-Cortez, the most charismatic US politician of the moment, for the entire hour.
Yet at a time when civilization is accelerating toward disaster, climate silence continues to reign across the bulk of the US news media. Especially on television, where most Americans still get their news, the brutal demands of ratings and money work against adequate coverage of the biggest story of our time. Many newspapers, too, are failing the climate test. Last October, the scientists of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a landmark report, warning that humanity had a mere 12 years to radically slash greenhouse gas emissions or face a calamitous future in which hundreds of millions of people worldwide would go hungry or homeless or worse. Only 22 of the 50 biggest newspapers in the United States covered that report.
Instead of sleepwalking us toward disaster, the US news media need to remember their Paul Revere responsibilities – to awaken, inform and rouse the people to action. To that end, the Nation and CJR are launching Covering Climate Change: A New Playbook for a 1.5-Degree World, a project aimed at dramatically improving US media coverage of the climate crisis. When the IPCC scientists issued their 12-year warning, they said that limiting temperature rise to 1.5C would require radically transforming energy, agriculture, transportation, construction and other core sectors of the global economy. Our project is grounded in the conviction that the news sector must be transformed just as radically.
The project will launch on 30 April with a conference at the Columbia Journalism School – a working forum where journalists will gather to start charting a new course. We envision this event as the beginning of a conversation that America’s journalists and news organizations must have with one another, as well as with the public we are supposed to be serving, about how to cover this rapidly uncoiling emergency. Judging by the climate coverage to date, most of the US news media still don’t grasp the seriousness of this issue. There is a runaway train racing toward us, and its name is climate change. That is not alarmism; it is scientific fact. We as a civilization urgently need to slow that train down and help as many people off the tracks as possible. It’s an enormous challenge, and if we don’t get it right, nothing else will matter. The US mainstream news media, unlike major news outlets in Europe and independent media in the US, have played a big part in getting it wrong for many years. It’s past time to make amends.
If 1.5C is the new limit for a habitable planet, how can newsrooms tell that story in ways that will finally resonate with their audiences? And given journalism’s deeply troubled business model, how can such coverage be paid for? Some preliminary suggestions. (You can read this story in its entirety at Columbia Journalism Review or The Nation.)
Don’t blame the audience, and listen to the kids. The onus is on news organizations to craft the story in ways that will demand the attention of readers and viewers. The specifics of how to do this will vary depending on whether a given outlet works in text, radio, TV or some other medium and whether it is commercially or publicly funded, but the core challenge is the same. A majority of Americans are interested in climate change and want to hear what can be done about it. This is especially true of the younger people that news organizations covet as an audience. Even most young Republicans want climate action. And no one is speaking with more clarity now than Greta Thunberg, Alexandria Villaseñor and the other teenagers who have rallied hundreds of thousands of people into the streets worldwide for the School Strike 4 Climate demonstrations.
Establish a diverse climate desk, but don’t silo climate coverage. The climate story is too important and multidimensional for a news outlet not to have a designated team covering it. That team must have members who reflect the economic, racial and gender diversity of America; if not, the coverage will miss crucial aspects of the story and fail to connect with important audiences. At the same time, climate change is so far-reaching that connections should be made when reporting on nearly every topic. For example, an economics reporter could partner with a climate reporter to cover the case for a just transition: the need to help workers and communities that have long relied on fossil fuel, such as the coal regions of Appalachia, transition to a clean-energy economy, as the Green New Deal envisions.
Learn the science. Many journalists have long had a bias toward the conceptual. But you can’t do justice to the climate crisis if you don’t understand the scientific facts, in particular how insanely late the hour is. At this point, anyone suggesting a leisurely approach to slashing emissions is not taking the science seriously. Make the time to get educated. Four recent books – McKibben’s Falter, Naomi Klein’s On Fire, David Wallace-Wells’s The Uninhabitable Earth, and Jeff Goodell’s The Water Will Come – are good places to start.
Don’t internalize the spin. Not only do most Americans care about climate change, but an overwhelming majority support a Green New Deal – 81% of registered voters said so as of last December, according to Yale climate pollsters. Trump and Fox don’t like the Green New Deal? Fine. But journalists should report that the rest of America does. Likewise, they should not buy the argument that supporting a Green New Deal is a terrible political risk that will play into the hands of Trump and the GOP; nor should the media give credence to wild assertions about what a Green New Deal would do or cost. The data simply does not support such accusations. But breaking free from this ideological trap requires another step.
Lose the Beltway mindset. It’s not just the Green New Deal that is popular with the broader public. Many of the subsidiary policies – such as Medicare for All and free daycare – are now supported by upwards of 70% of the American public, according to Pew and Reuters polls. Inside the Beltway, this fact is unknown or discounted; the assumption by journalists and the politicians they cover is that such policies are ultra-leftist political suicide. They think this because the Beltway worldview prioritizes transactional politics: what will Congress pass and the president sign into law? But what Congress and the White House do is often very different from what the American people favor, and the press should not confuse the two.
Help the heartland. Some of the places being hit hardest by climate change, such as the midwestern states flooded this spring, have little access to real climate news; instead, the denial peddled by Fox News and Rush Limbaugh dominates. Iconic TV newsman Bill Moyers has an antidote: “Suppose you formed a consortium of media that could quickly act as a strike force to show how a disaster like this is related to climate change – not just for the general media, but for agricultural media, heartland radio stations, local television outlets. A huge teachable moment could be at hand if there were a small coordinating nerve center of journalists who could energize reporting, op-eds, interviews, and so on that connect the public to the causes and not just the consequences of events like this.” Moyers added that such a team should “always have on standby a pool of the most reputable scientists who, on camera and otherwise, can connect natural disasters to the latest and most credible scientific research”.
Cover the solutions. There isn’t a more exciting time to be on the climate beat. That may sound strange, considering how much suffering lies in store from the impacts that are already locked in. But with the Green New Deal, the US government is now, for the first time, at least talking about a response that is commensurate with the scale and urgency of the problem. Reporters have a tendency to gravitate to the crime scene, to the tragedy. They have a harder time with the solutions to a problem; some even mistake it as fluff. Now, with climate change, the solution is a critical part of the story.
Don’t be afraid to point fingers. As always, journalists should shun cheerleading, but neither should we be neutral. Defusing the climate crisis is in everyone’s interest, but some entities are resolutely opposed to doing what the science says is needed, starting with the president of the United States. The press has called out Trump on many fronts – for his lying, corruption and racism – but his deliberate worsening of the climate crisis has been little mentioned, though it is arguably the most consequential of his presidential actions. Meanwhile, ExxonMobil has announced plans to keep producing large amounts of oil and gas through at least 2040; other companies have made similar declarations. If enacted, those plans guarantee catastrophe. Journalism has a responsibility to make that consequence clear to the public and to cover the companies, executives, and investors behind those plans accordingly.
If American journalism doesn’t get the climate story right – and soon – no other story will matter. The news media’s past climate failures can be redeemed only by an immediate shift to more high-profile, inclusive and fearless coverage. Our #CoveringClimateNow project calls on all journalists and news outlets to join the conversation about how to make that happen. As the nation’s founders envisioned long ago, the role of a free press is to inform the people and hold the powerful accountable. These days, our collective survival demands nothing less.
… we can’t turn away from climate change. For The Guardian, reporting on the environment is a  priority.  We give climate, nature and pollution stories the prominence they deserve, stories which often go unreported by others in the mainstream media. At this critical time for humanity and our planet, we are determined to inform readers about threats, consequences and solutions based on scientific facts, not political prejudice or business interests. But we need your support to grow our coverage, to travel to the remote frontlines of change and to cover vital conferences that affect us all.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.

Speaking at a public event in London as Extinction Rebellion protests continued in the capital, the initiator of the school strike for climate movement was typically frank about the scale of the problem the world faces and the impact her campaign has made. “People are slowly becoming more aware, but emissions continue to rise. We can’t focus on small things. Basically, nothing has changed,” she said.
At several points, she stressed the need for the protests to spread. “This is not just young people being sick of politicians. It’s an existential crisis,” Thunberg said. “It is something that will affect the future of our civilisation. It’s not just a movement. It’s a crisis and we must take action accordingly.”
In a question and answer session, Franny Armstrong, the director of the climate documentary The Age of Stupid, asked whether it was time for a general strike. “Yes,” replied Thunberg in unison with the other members of the panel.
Traditional unions have so far been wary of joining the strikes. Although workers’ federations in Italy made Thunberg an honorary member, most others have given either tepid support or none due to concerns about the possible impact on jobs. But there is growing support in the UK, the US and other countries for a Green New Deal that would increase spending on renewable energy.
The talk took place on Earth Day, after a week of protests by Extinction Rebellion activists pushed the climate crisis on to news broadcasts and newspaper front pages.
Police have arrested more than 1,000 demonstrators at Parliament Square, Oxford Circus and Waterloo Bridge, but hundreds remain camped in Marble Arch, where Thunberg spoke on Sunday.
“I support Extinction Rebellion. What they are doing is good. Civil disobedience is important to show this is an emergency. We need to do everything we can to put pressure on the people in power,” she told the audience on Monday, prompting cheers and applause.
“Why study for a future that is being taken from us? Why study for facts when facts don’t matter in this society? It’s empowering to know I am doing something, I am taking a stand, I am disrupting.”
The interest in the event was so intense that a long line of supporters stretched along Euston Road waiting for the doors to open at Friends House. Most guests appeared to be fellow school strikers. A handful wore shirts or headbands printed with the Extinction Rebellion symbol.
But the audience included all age groups, and just about every major environment organisation associated itself with the talk, which was hosted by the Quakers and co-organised by Guardian Events. When Thunberg appeared on stage, she was greeted with thunderous applause.
Armstrong said: “I’ve been to dozens of talks here over the years, but I’ve never seen anything like this. It’s the first time I have seen a standing ovation even before the event starts. She’s a rock star.”
In the past week, Thunberg has met Pope Francis in the Vatican and addressed members of the European parliament. On Tuesday, she will visit the Houses of Parliament, meet the House of Commons Speaker, John Bercow, and take part in an event with the leaders of all the main parties except Theresa May.
She told the audience she had been taken by surprise at the swift spread of a movement that began less than a year ago, when she went on strike alone outside the Swedish parliament. “It is hard to understand what is happening during the last months. It has all happened so fast. I don’t have time to think it through,” she said.
Veteran observers of the British parliament said she has helped push the climate issue higher up the UK political agenda than at any time since the 2008 Climate Change Act.
Green party officials said they hoped the meeting on Tuesday could spur a new phase of cross-party collaboration on climate change, including monthly meetings, wider public consultations and an agreement that party manifestos should be vetted by an independent body such as the Committee on Climate Change to assess whether they are in line with the Paris agreement.
Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP, said the current wave of climate action on the streets and the school strikes gave her hope. “There is more political leadership there and here than I have seen in Westminster. It feels like a turning point in the history of how we defend our planet,” she said.
“Young people are calling out against a system that is sadly broken … We are going to change the definition of what is politically possible so that it is what is scientifically necessary.”
The discussion ranged from veganism and avoiding flying to political change throughout society. Thunberg said everything was necessary, though she put the focus on challenging the companies and governments that are responsible for the bulk of emissions.
How to deal with with people in power was a frequent subject of questions to the panel. Thunberg said her autism helped her filter out much of the greenwashing.
“We are more likely to see through lies. We don’t follow the stream. You can’t be a little bit sustainable – either you are sustainable or you are not,” she said.
There were occasional moments of levity. At one point, Thunberg was asked how she dealt with climate deniers. “I don’t,” she replied.
Thunberg’s earlier point was reiterated by Anna Taylor from the UK Student Climate Network. “We are not going to be satisfied by politicians saying ‘we support you’ and then walking away,” she said.
“We won’t be satisfied until they meet our demands and act. That’s why simply taking a selfie or posting support on Twitter isn’t enough. That’s why we have to keep striking.”
For all the talk of politics and protest, however, some of the most poignant and pertinent questions came from the youngest children. One asked: “If pollution continues, how much time have we got left?” Another wanted to know: “Can we achieve our goal in the time we have?”
Thunberg, in response, was reassuring but measured: “Of course we can, it’s physically possible, the scientists say. It’s up to us. If we do this now then of course we will. But if we don’t, we might not do it. But yes, definitely we can.”
… in the fight to protect the environment. By keeping the Guardian’s environmental coverage open and accessible, we can report on the changes needed to avoid climate and natural catastrophe.

Don't blame the trees or an early Spring.
Try a simple experiment (even for non-sufferers of hay-fever).
a) Don't go out (hows the symptoms afterwards?).b) Go for a walk in the woods/heath/forest (hows the symptoms afterwards?).c) Hang around a field of Oil-seed rape/canola for a few hours (hows the symptoms afterwards?).
Option 'c' will leave you struggling to breath, eyes streaming. throat closing-up, gasping wheezing and considering A&E.
*Those fields full of very bright yellow flowers.
Personally I'd be surprised if UK trees had an early Spring since we've just had a chilly (but not too bad) Blackthorn Winter (https://weather.com/en-GB/unitedkingdom/weather/news/blackthorn-winter-weather-uk).

The 2002 Government budget for hay fever issues was 7,372,000,000 yen, 27 times the amount of seven years earlier. Administrative measures include basic research, improved forecasting and the development of therapies, as well as research to develop low pollen producing cryptomeria and Japanese cypress varieties. However, devastation of the forestry industry and the diminishing number of forestry workers as result of cheap and high quality imports has made actual implementation of measures in forest plantations slow. In 2005, the Forestry Agency announced plans to plant 600,000 low pollen-producing cryptomeria trees over the following five years. Nonetheless, cryptomeria forests in Japan cover a total of 45,300 square kilometres so a meaningful migration to such varieties proves to be a considerable challenge.The 2002 budget for hay fever issues was 7,372,000,000 yen, 27 times the amount of seven years earlier.

But if you think it is bad in the UK, try living in Tennessee. With a long growing season and geography that causes air to sit over the region for long periods, the southern state is the hay fever capital of the US.
Now the season is starting earlier and lasting longer. At the start of this month, allergy doctors were kept busy when a yellow haze blanketed much of the south-eastern US, caused by dense clouds of pollen carried on the breeze.
Analysis of US weather data shows the growing season – from the last spring frost to the first autumn frost – has been increasing and is now an average of two weeks longer than it was in 1970.
Meanwhile, about 30% of Americans have hay fever compared with 10% about 40 years ago. If greenhouse gas emissions continue unchecked, scientists estimate the average growing season across most of the US will be a month longer, piling on the misery for hay fever sufferers in Tennessee.
… we have a small favour to ask. More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute.

While they are the ones who are very publicly sprooking its supposed benefits – including more than a few dubious claims – they will not be the final arbitrators. The decision to allow the mine to proceed will be based on economic considerations which in our brave new world has usurped science as the driver for policy decisions. This is evident by many earlier decisions to allow mining in contentious regions and the support for Adani shown by the labor Queensland premier. Even the leader of the federal opposition has been ambivalent over its future even saying that if the Adani proposal did go ahead it would not increase Australia's emissions. So how did we get to these dangerous situation ? 
Australia, like most of the developed world had trade protectionists policies even in the Menzies government, which remained in place until Paul Keating, who to the surprise of many in his party and the joy of conservatives, embraced the de-regulated market economy ideas of Milton Friedman. Protectionism was seen as a restriction on global trade and thus holding back GDP growth , which has increased markable with free trade – but it came at a price. Protectionism encouraged self sufficiency as imports were more expensive because of the tariffs imposed and these were a progressive form of tax levied more on luxury goods. The higher cost encouraged would be importers to shift manufacturing to Australia, most notably for car (as well as bus, truck & tractors) manufacturing which in1970 saw 475,000 cars made in Australia, the 10th highest rate in the world. It also produced an export industry which saw cars shipped to Asia, NZ and the US and Australia became one of 13 countries with the capabilities to design and develop mass market cars from scratch. 
Because of these market based economic decisions to lower and then abolish tariffs (free trade) we now a much larger GDP but our imports are rising faster than exports. Australia now imports over 1million cars at a cost of US $29.4 b as well as $4.4b in spare parts which could have been made locally. Much the same applies for white goods, furniture, timber, tiles, electrical and electronic components required for the 220,000 houses we build every year. We are also importing far more food and a report from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences(ABARES) included the fact that our food imports have increased from $4 billion to $14 billion while food exports only increased from $21 billion to $37 billion over the period from 1990 to 2016. Imports of all types are growing along with population growth and increased consumerism but food imports are growing much faster than exports because of free trade agreements and government failure to protect farmers from cheap imports. There is also a marked decrease in our capacity to grow food particularly the fruit and vegetables that used to be grown on cities fringes but which have now been swallowed by urban sprawl. This suggest that not only are we at heading towards a loss of food self sufficiency but we are at risk from lower quality or contaminated foods as has occurred with berries, honey, olive oil, and orange juice. 
But herein lies the rub. To match these imports we must have equal or higher exports. In December 2017 there was a trade deficit which became a surplus of $0.98b in April this year and then $1.7b in June. But; Minerals and fuels now account for 45.5% of our exports. Food (grains, meat & primary products) are only13.9% with manufacturing down to 11.8% (and shedding 122,400 jobs in a decade). The service sector contributed 21.9% most of which is education related and reliant on O/S students. Australia has thus been deliberately diverted into an economy with a high demand for imported goods with limited employment opportunities and sources of exports based mainly on resources, in other words, a quarry for the world. We have very few options, food production is unlikely to be expanded and may well shrink due to climate changes, manufacturing has been run down too far to rescue in the short term and the service industries face a problem as our eduction qualifications are declining. No politician could ever win an election with a promise of reinstalling tariffs, cutting back on consumerism or abandoning growth economics. Instead we will plough on because of the economists obsession with GDP growth - one will require not only continue with these practices but to increase them every year. The Adani mine will be allowed to proceed and this will be followed by more from mining magnate Genia Rinehart and Clive Palmer right until rising temperatures make survival more important than economics.', u'recommendation_count': u'2', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1556078317000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'the tariffs imposed', u'effect': u'as imports were more expensive'}, {u'cause': u'free trade agreements and government failure to protect farmers from cheap imports', u'effect': u'are growing much faster than exports'}, {u'cause': u'climate changes', u'effect': u'may well shrink'}, {u'cause': u'the economists obsession with gdp growth', u'effect': u'instead we will plough on require'}], u'author_id': u'16007883', u'id': u'128318500', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'JamesM19888', u'text': u'What utter drivel', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1556078261000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'101483445', u'in_reply_to': u'128313237', u'id': u'128318487', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'JamesM19888', u'text': u'What is the cost of in action exactly?

Next, renewables cover VAST areas in wind and solar where one golf-ball of uranium could supply ALL your energy needs for your entire life. Solar produces 300 TIMES the waste of nuclear power.Finally, nuclear 'waste' is actually the answer for climate change, not the problem! Breeder reactors burn it. Google breeder reactor if you don't believe me. Pyro-processing means it can't be weaponized, and finally, once the breeder reactor has burned the waste again and again, Argonne labs shows how to melt the final waste product down into ceramic tablets and store it under the reactor-park for just 300 to 500 years. Then it is safe! Here’s the 4 minute Argonne Labs video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlMDDhQ9-pE
New breeder reactors require power to GO, so power failures do not cause a melt-down. Indeed, Molten Salt Reactors CANNOT MELT DOWN AS THEY ARE ALREADY a liquid.

By Mark Nelson and Madison Czerwinski California and Germany could have mostly or completely decarbonized their electricity sectors had their investments in renewables been diverted instead to new nuclear, a new Environmental Progress analysis finds. 
In 2017, Germany generated 37 percent of its electricity from non-carbon sources.[1] In pursuing the Energiewende, Germany will have invested $580 billion in renewable energy and storage by 2025. 
If Germany had invested in nuclear instead, it could have built 46 1.6 GW EPR reactors at the $12.5 billion per reactor cost of the U.K.’s Hinkley Point C. German companies assisted with the design of the EPR and the reactor was explicitly planned to meet the strictest European regulations.
In this scenario, EP assumes that a Germany pursuing nuclear power would maintain the same level of nuclear generation as it produced annually before implementing its nuclear phase-out in 2011, about 133 TWh per year. 
With 46 EPRs operating at 90 percent capacity factor, Germany could first eliminate all coal, gas, and biomass electricity, then make up for today’s 150 terawatt-hours per year of wind and solar from its renewables investment, all while exporting 100 terawatt-hours of electricity to its neighbors (double 2017’s actual exports). Finally, with the remaining 133 terawatt-hours, Germany could decarbonize its entire light vehicle fleet including all 45 million of its passenger vehicles.[2]

The next step was to be the privatisation.It was a nasty, sneaky plan because:1. It didn't initially raise the price much. (After a few more rises it became more obvious!)2. You couldn't avoid it by being more frugal with the switch. You pay per day for being connected to the poles and wires. 3. It could be inflated by the newly minted privateers ( a useful term, a pirate-like person, but operating at sea for the govt in earlier centuries) by ""investing"" in lots (and lots) of poles and wires.4. The rate for poles and wires rose by well over 100% in a remarkably short time, ready for privatisation. I remember NSW LABOR Treasurers throwing major tantrums when the public understandably didn't want a bar of privatisation after it was all ready for them. 5. It helped that the Liberals had been absolutely DELIGHTED about those Labor Treasurers' meltdowns, and privatisation went ahead in a bi-partisan manner.6. After Toned Abs and Co in the Federal sphere had ""reduced"" pressure on the poor people, the price was even higher.7. The people were a tad suspicious about both sides after all this malarky . 8. The people also discovered that after the thorough mangling of a ""price signal"" for electricity (by inflating the part of the bill that couldn't be avoided by frugality) they couldn't cut the bill much by cutting usage. Frustrating.9. But that was the way it had all been designed. 10.

Unfortunately, grass does not grow very well under the dark shade of dense forest canopy. Please understand that unlike grass, Acanthus thrives under the shade of forest, helps trees to grow, reduces the risk of forest fires, and helps forests to sprout back after fires.
A forest with a supportive Acanthus field beneath it, is an effective three floored carbon-sink widespread area.
And livestock love Acanthus (!), including chickens! Actually, livestock prefer Acanthus to lush green grass: (as can be seen from this video)
https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10203109841760416&id=1037691031
It is obvious that Acanthus fields living beneath forests provide far better edible 'green carpet' canopies, and a better spectacle than an artificial grassland suntanning naked under the sun with herds of cows treading upon her.
What are we waiting for? Do we want to see our oceans rise further? And to several meters?!
Why do we continue to blindly substitute forests with grasslands? and at an accelerated rate! Why do we pretend that livestock require grasslands, and grasslands only, to grow? Is it possible that we use it as a pretext to profit from hardwoods? Probably! Mankind is after all a greedy animal.
Acanthus survives drought and fire through the use of rhizome root systems that are deeper than those of grass. Acanthus manages to harness in its rhizomes more rainwater beneath the soil than grass. Acanthus propagates rapidly by seed and rhisome, just like grass. If we start placing Acanthus seeds upon grasslands now, its taller canopies will eventually win over grass by cutting all sunlight to grass. 
My suggestion to livestock farmers, to improve your profits, and to help reverse Climate-Change deforestation, is to plant nutritional fruit trees and nut trees with Acanthus seeds around them, at every ten grid metres of your grasslands. Avocados are particularly nutricional fruits, and easy to grow. Your livestock will thrive better, more organically relaxed under the shade of trees, and better nutritional fed with Acanthus than with ordinary grass.
To orchard farmers, you who at least already farm trees, my advice to you is to place Acanthus around your trees, to improve ground fertility, humidity, and of course, the carbon-sink property of your land. 
To environmentalists, and young people whose futures are more at stake, my advice to you is to gather Acanthus seeds in your pockets and spread them every few metres beneath forests and grasslands. It will form a tight canopy to substitute artificial grasslands very fast. 
Once Acanthus forms a 50 cm high green carpet 'canopy' with its wide, almost horizontal-held leaves, it traps the humidity and heat that can be used as a direct widespread-low efficient compost-heap, (better still described as a compost-spread,) by simply throwing, spreading, organic matter to decompose inside that Acanthus canopy. You can afford to accidentally squeeze Acanthus with heavy organic material, it will simply thrive around that material with the help of rhizome and seed.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1556060690000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'101487771', u'in_reply_to': u'128313660', u'id': u'128314508', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Alan Baird', u'text': u'I repeatedly see versions S is spouting about China and India not pulling their weight but they're doing catch up industrialising, and only just beginning the disengagement from the full fossil fuel economy, all with a monumental population size yet China was heatedly criticised in the west for trying to hold the population tide back.We (the west) did OUR full-on fossil fuel industrialisation years ago, and that increase in carbon is still there but you don't factor THAT in of course.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1556060346000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'17617207', u'in_reply_to': u'128282336', u'id': u'128314391', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Alan Baird', u'text': u'Another tragedy.

As Katharine Murphy explained a few weeks back, “private polling conducted for the environment movement and for the major parties suggests community concern about climate change is currently sitting at levels not seen since the federal election cycle in 2007”.
A survey commissioned by the Australia Institute showed the majority of voters wanted to mobilise on climate “like they mobilised everyone during the world wars”. That result was consistent around Australia, with 57% of Queenslanders and 60% of Victorians agreeing that the country faced an emergency.
The ABC Vote Compass found the environment ranked as the most important issue by 29% of respondents, up from 9% in 2016.
Why, then, aren’t we seeing the parties in a bidding war to address such concerns?
We know that if focus groups returned equivalent anxieties about refugees, the campaign would devolve into a contest to formulate new techniques for border cruelty.
We’ve all seen that movie before.
In 2013, Tony Abbott made the three-word slogan “stop the boats” central to his bid for election.
Kevin Rudd desperately sought to counter by introducing the grotesque PNG solution, which incarcerated new boat arrivals on Manus Island and prohibited refugees from ever settling in Australia.
He described it, correctly, as “a very hardline decision” – and yet at the time only 14% of Australians had nominated asylum seekers as one of the three most important issues determining their vote.
If that tiny proportion could radically alter refugee policy at the election, why hasn’t the support of 53% of voters for a WWII-style climate mobilisation dramatically reshaped the 2019 contest?
As we head to the polls, neither major party is promising anything like the “emergency action” the majority of Australians wants.
The Coalition shows more enthusiasm for ridiculous fulminations against electric cars than any serious attempt to address global warming. As for Labor, Shorten’s policies represent a significant step back from the (inadequate) measures previously proposed by Gillard and Rudd. Writing in the Sydney Morning Herald, Shane Wright rightly calls the ALP platform “as much an effort to neutralise the political attack as to find ways to truly reduce Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions”.
The reluctance of politicians to propose real environmental action might seem bizarre, given a context where that action would be not only right but also popular.
But the comparison with refugees illustrates the peculiar dynamic of climate politics.
Perversely, asylum seekers became such a preoccupation for both parties because, in one sense, border security was never a significant issue in Australia.
Jordan houses nearly three million refugees; Pakistan, 1.4 million. Precisely because the refugee numbers arriving in this country were, in relative terms, utterly minuscule, governments could deliver “solutions” (albeit at great financial cost and with tremendous cruelty).
Addressing the environmental crisis isn’t as easy as beating up on defenceless asylum seekers. A meaningful response entails challenging powerful vested interests.
In particular, you can’t decarbonise an economy without defeating the corporations whose business practices depend on the despoliation of the planet.
A recent study noted that just a hundred companies were responsible for more than 70% of greenhouse gas emissions since 1988. But those companies include some of the most significant corporate entities in the world – and mainstream politicians regard going toe to toe with multinational capital as “courageous” in the Humphrey Appleby sense of the word.
To put it another way, in our system, the wishes of the voters don’t necessarily prevail. Think of the war in Afghanistan and how it dragged on and on, even though, for years, every survey showed most Australians wanted the troops brought home.
What mattered then was not popular opinion but the elite consensus in support of the war. The same might be said about climate. Ordinary people want radical policies but corporate Australia doesn‘t.
In Britain, hundreds of environmental protesters have been arrested for acts of civil disobedience organised by Extinction Rebellion.
“We are facing an unprecedented global emergency,” ER’s manifesto reads. “Life on Earth is in crisis: scientists agree we have entered a period of abrupt climate breakdown, and we are in the midst of a mass extinction of our own making.”
The group calls for governments to declare a “climate and ecological emergency”. But it also demands a “citizen’s assembly”, on the basis that professional politicians have proved themselves incapable of addressing the crisis.
Let’s say it again: Australians want environmental action.
We can’t afford more delays. .The majority of carbon emissions from fossil fuels have entered the atmosphere in the last 25 to 30 years – that is, during the period in which global warming was understood and governments were supposedly fighting it.
Extinction Rebellion’s now an international movement, with an Australian group signing up those prepared to embrace civil disobedience, up to and including being arrested.
It’s election season, the one period in which politicians supposedly listen, and there’s still no sign of the climate message getting through. We desperately need a people’s movement. As Tim Winton wrote in the Guardian on the weekend, “Enough cowardice. Enough bullshit. Time for action.”

If countries fail to improve on their Paris agreement commitments, this feedback mechanism, combined with a loss of heat-deflecting white ice, will cause a near 5% amplification of global warming and its associated costs, says the paper, which was published on Tuesday in Nature Communications.
The authors say their study is the first to calculate the economic impact of permafrost melt and reduced albedo – a measure of how much light that hits a surface is reflected without being absorbed – based on the most advanced computer models of what is likely to happen in the Arctic as temperatures rise. It shows how destabilised natural systems will worsen the problem caused by man-made emissions, making it more difficult and expensive to solve.
They assessed known stocks of frozen organic matter in the ground up to 3 metres deep at multiple points across the Arctic. These were run through the world’s most advanced simulation software in the US and at the UK Met Office to predict how much gas will be released at different levels of warming. Even with supercomputers, the number crunching took weeks because the vast geography and complex climate interactions of the Arctic throw up multiple variables. The researchers then applied previous economic impact models to assess the likely costs.
Permafrost melt is the main concern. Greenhouse gases – which are released when organic matter that had been frozen below the soil for centuries thaws and rots - have already begun to escape at the current level of 1 degrees Celsius of global heating. So far the impact is small. Ten gigatonnes of carbon have been released from the permafrost but this source of emissions will grow rapidly once temperatures rise beyond 1.5C.
On the current trajectory of at least 3C of warming by the end of the century, melting permafrost is expected to discharge up to 280 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide and 3 gigatonnes of methane, which has a climate effect that is 10 to 20 times stronger than CO2.
This would increase the global climate-driven impacts by by $70tn between now and 2300. This is 10 times higher than the projected benefits from a melting Arctic, such as easier navigation for ships and access to minerals, says the paper.
It would also add to global inequality because most of the economic burden – equivalent to almost the entire world’s current annual GDP – is likely to be borne by countries in warmer poorer regions such as India and Africa, which are most vulnerable to a rise in temperatures.
“It’s disheartening that we have this in front of us,” said Dmitry Yumashev of Lancaster University. “Even at 1.5C to 2C, there are impacts and costs due to thawing permafrost. But they are considerably lower for these scenarios compared to business as usual. We have the technology and policy instruments to limit the warming but we are not moving fast enough.”
The new projections contained a modicum of good news because the impact of land permafrost melt was at the lower range of what had been feared. Previous estimates suggested these Arctic tipping points could add more than 10% to climate costs. Some feared the methane alone could prove catastrophic but the new figures show CO2 remains the greatest concern.
“We still have a time bomb, but it may not be as large as previously believed,” said Yumashev. But he warned against complacency because even at the low end the damages are huge, the study has a considerable degree of uncertainty and the costs of several other potential tipping points have yet to be calculated.

The Metropolitan police said it was imposing pre-emptive conditions restricting any demonstration outside the Houses of Parliament on Tuesday to the lawn in the centre of the square, after hearing that activists with the group planned to gather there.
Protesters must clear the area by midnight, police said, and may not gather in Old Palace Yard, a site the group has requested as a permanent protest camp.
In Parliament Square on Tuesday morning, a small crowd of Extinction Rebellion protesters who had been there since Monday waited for the main protest march to arrive.
Amber, 23, who did not give her surname, said she was not hopeful the government would change its position on the climate emergency.
“We just want to be heard … we have put a lot into these occupations and actions, now we just need some sort of engagement from the government. They have been on holiday so who knows – they might come back and want to engage properly, but I’m not hopeful.”
Several hundred people arrived in Parliament Square just before midday on Tuesday, flags flying and drums beating. There was a big police presence as the protesters arrived in an attempt to prevent them blocking surrounding roads or Westminster Bridge.
Clarissa Carlyon, from London, said: “We are coming into Parliament Square because we have captured the media’s attention and a lot of attention around the globe, and now it’s time for the politicians to come and talk to us.”
Liam Geary Baulch, 26, also from London, said relations between the group and the police had become increasingly strained, with dismay over the Met’s decision to name those charged in connection with the protest and to seize a soundsystem it had been using at its base at Marble Arch.
“We have seen thousands of people take non-violent action and over 1,000 arrests, yet we have had no complaints from the police about violence,” Geary Baulch said.
“What there has been complaints about is that despite the civil relations between the officers on the ground and the activists, there has been a lack of respect by them releasing the names and locations of more than 50 of the people charged, so I think there has been a breakdown of trust between the people on the ground and some of the officers because that’s making these people vulnerable to being doorstepped by the press.”
Activists were also surprised and dismayed by the police operation to seize their soundsystem on Monday night. “There were no liaison officers on shift, which I think was a big mistake, to do something that was going to make the crowd anxious,” Geary Baulch said, adding that the operation had also contributed to the breakdown of trust.
Four activists had secured themselves up tall trees at the back of Parliament Square where they had dropped banners saying “eyes on government in action” and “May profiting from war: citizens assembly now.”
Their friend, who was at the base of the trees, said they had climbed up in the early hours of the morning.

More than 1,000 people have been arrested in the past week in a campaign of mass non-violent direct action orchestrated by the group to highlight how little time the world has left to halt manmade ecological breakdown.
Most have been arrested for breaching section 14 orders that restrict rights to protest in each location. But Tuesday’s order is the first to explicitly mention that organisers could be targeted for arrest.
A statement circulated to the media said: “Any organiser or person taking part in the protest failing to comply with these conditions or inciting others not to comply with them will be committing an offence and will be liable to arrest.”
Over the bank holiday weekend it took a mass police operation to clear Oxford Circus, Waterloo Bridge and Parliament Square of the small festivals of protest, which included stages, sound systems, workshops, wellbeing tents and free food.
Activists at each location had formed human barricades, securing themselves across roads and to key pieces of infrastructure using lock-on devices and superglue.

Don't get me wrong. I think fusion power will be part of the solution to the world's electrical needs going forward. But it is too far off in the future to be a solution to the crisis we face right now. Your denigration of the use of the word 'have' in regard to the linked study seems disingenuous when all it is saying is that all regions of the world have sufficient renewable resources to tap into to support the world's energy needs. Of course there will be massive efforts needed to take advantage of these resources.
The difference between the approaches is that we know solar, wind and hydro work. We know how to build these systems, we've been doing it for decades. We have current methods to smooth out the natural variability of these generating systems. They could be powering the world in very short order if we would only make the effort.

We are now witnessing this premature call to action on a planetary scale. As the adults in government accelerate their consumption of fossil fuels, children are leading the campaign against our species’ looming extinction. Our survival now depends on the prospects for a global movement to follow their lead and demand an International Green New Deal.
Several countries have proposed their own versions of a Green New Deal. Here in Europe, DiEM25 and our European Spring coalition are campaigning under the banner of a detailed Green New Deal agenda. In the UK, a new campaign is pushing similar legislation with MPs such as Caroline Lucas and Clive Lewis. And in the US, dogged activists in the Sunrise Movement are working with representatives such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to push their proposal to the front of the political agenda.
But these campaigns have largely remained siloed. Their advisers may exchange notes and ideas, but no strategy has emerged to coordinate these campaigns in a broader, global framework.
Unfortunately, climate change knows no borders. The US may be the second-largest polluter in the world, but it makes up less than 15% of global greenhouse emissions. Leading by example is simply not enough.
Instead, we need an International Green New Deal: a pragmatic plan to raise $8tn – 5% of global GDP – each year, coordinate its investment in the transition to renewable energy and commit to providing climate protections on the basis of countries’ needs, rather than their means.
Call it the Organization for Emergency Environmental Cooperation – the namesake of the original OEEC 75 years ago. While many US activists find inspiration in a “second world war-style mobilization”, the International Green New Deal is better modeled by the Marshall plan that followed it. With financial assistance from the US government, 16 countries formed the Organization for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC), dedicated to rebuilding the infrastructure of a devastated continent and coordinating its supply of energy.
But if the original OEEC entrenched an extractive capitalism at Europe’s core –protecting the steel and coal cartel – the new organization for an International Green New Deal can empower communities around the world in a single transformational project.
The transnational scope of this mobilization is crucial for three main reasons.
The first is production. Recent studies show that, as long as countries cooperate, all continents have the wind, solar and hydropower resources they need in a zero-emissions world. Northern countries and mountainous regions have better access to wind power, while southern lands are better suited to exploiting the sun. An International Green New Deal could exploit these differences and ensure that renewable energy is available to all of them year-round.
Confronting the climate crisis will require more than keeping fossil fuels in the ground
The second is innovation. Confronting the climate crisis will require more than keeping fossil fuels in the ground. We will also need major scientific breakthroughs to develop renewable sources of energy, adapt existing infrastructure, detoxify our oceans and decarbonize the atmosphere. No country alone can fund the research and development necessary to meet these challenges. The OEEC would pool the brainpower of the global scientific community: a Green Manhattan Project.
The third is reparation. For centuries, countries such as the US and the UK have plundered natural resources from around the world and polluted them back out. Less developed nations have been doubly dispossessed: first, of their resource wealth, and second, of their right to a sustainable life – and in the case of many small island developing states, of their very right to exist. An International Green New Deal would redistribute resources to rehabilitate overexploited regions, protect against rising sea levels, and guarantee a decent standard of living to all climate refugees.
The UN climate change conferences will not save us from extinction – the demise of the Paris agreement should be evidence enough. These frameworks lock us into prisoners’ dilemmas, in which every country has an incentive to defect on their climate commitments, even if cooperation between them would yield a greater collective good. As long as climate cooperation is framed around sacrifice, it is vulnerable to strongmen like Donald Trump who vow to buck international rules in the name of national interests.
The International Green New Deal changes the frame. Rather than pleading for restraint, it sets out a positive-sum vision of international investment, in which the gains from joining in outweigh those to going it alone.
This is the strategy that won Franklin D Roosevelt the original New Deal. His plan addressed people who had given up hope and inspired in them the idea that there is an alternative. That there are ways of pressing idle resources into public service. It made sense to the disheartened and offered opportunity to the entrepreneurial.
The same is true of the International Green New Deal, which mobilizes public finance to crowd in private investments that, together, fund the $8tn transition. Just like in the original New Deal, public financing will involve a mix of taxes and bond instruments. On the former, we can introduce a global minimum corporate tax rate that is then redistributed on the basis of their sales. On the latter, public investment banks – including the European Investment Bank, the World Bank and the KfW, Germany’s state-owned development bank – can coordinate the issue of green bonds that the major central banks agree collectively to support in the secondary markets.
Suddenly, countries with large trade surpluses will realize they are better able to invest their excess capital if green investments in deficit countries are coordinated under the auspices of an international plan. The positive-sum dynamic will prevail.
In this sense, the stakes of the International Green New Deal are not merely environmental. By uniting countries in the project of bottom-up economic transformation – and coercing multinationals to fund their fair share of it – it will also stem the tide of bigotry and xenophobia engulfing the world.
“Advanced” capitalist countries today are literally falling apart. In the US, net public investment has fallen below half of one per cent of GDP. Across the eurozone, net public investment has remained below zero for nearly a decade. It is little wonder that political monsters are rising again: just as in the 1930s, the grapes of wrath are ripening and “growing heavy for the vintage”.
To revive the liberal democratic project, some pundits have suggested making China into a bogeyman. But the real bogeyman is of our creation: a climate crisis wrought by decades of inaction and underinvestment. To address the true existential threat that we face today, we must reverse the economic policies that brought us to this brink. Austerity means extinction.
The promise of an International Green New Deal to is to avoid the pitfalls of cold war politics and unite humanity in the only project capable of preserving a habitable planet. To do this, however, we need a powerful progressive international movement to demand that our leaders begin to act beyond their own borders. Let’s start building it. The children are watching.

Researchers at the School of Environment and Sustainability found that, on average, while kits provided by companies like Blue Apron, Sun Basket and HelloFresh often do involve more packaging waste, the emissions for grocery store meals carried two kilograms more of carbon dioxide per meal than those of the meal-prep kits.
“There are lots of people who really liked meal kits but were saying ‘Ah, there’s so much plastic and I feel so bad because [it’s] so terrible environmentally,” said Dr Shelie Miller, one of the primary researchers. “I said ‘You know, I bet if we take a bigger picture look, they may not turn out to be that bad.’ Just largely because of the pre-portioned ingredients and potentially, the lack of food waste.”
Using five different Blue Apron meals, the researchers tracked and compared the lives of the meals through several different environmental lenses, concluding the disparity in emissions was mostly due to the supply chain and the portions of food. The extra steps stores take to source food add up to more carbon dioxide, as well as encourage food waste.
“It really is the food and the food waste that dictate the environmental impact,” Miller said.
While the meals did come from Blue Apron, the company did not sponsor the study – but were obviously pleased with the result. “Blue Apron has long been driven by our vision of building a better food system,” said Dr Alison Grantham, their agro-ecologist and director of procurement. “We are delighted to see the positive benefits of our direct-to-consumer model materialize in lower life cycle greenhouse gas emissions.”
Meal-prep kits like Blue Apron can be expensive, but there are other solutions for those who would like to be environmentally conscious. “One strategy that has been shown both to reduce food waste but will ultimately also save consumers money is meal planning,” said Brent Heard, the other researcher associated with the study. “It will decrease the amount of food you need to purchase at the store … In line with this, another thing consumers can do is try to purchase food in the smallest portion sizes. Try to select foods that are as close to pre-portioned as possible.”
The study did not take into account people who participate in alternative forms of grocery purchasing, like community-supported agriculture. Despite this, both Heard and Miller agree the central message behind the study does not change. “The study really motivates looking beyond what’s directly in front of us when we think about the environmental impacts of a product,” says Heard.

Since she began her school strike in Stockholm last August, Greta has addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos, the European parliament and the UN climate talks in Poland. Last week she met the pope in Rome. On Tuesday she met UK political leaders at the House of Commons. That Theresa May opted out of an encounter with one of the world’s foremost young activists is an embarrassing error of judgment. By any rational calculus, Greta is in the process of doing humanity a huge favour.
That is because we struggle to give the global warming and wildlife crisis the attention they deserve. We have the science, with predictions of a manmade greenhouse effect dating back to the 1890s. (One of Greta’s distant relatives, Svante Arrhenius, was a pioneer in the field.) We have the international structures to collate the experts’ findings: the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued its first report in 1990. We have some, although not all, of the knowledge and technology we need to wean us off our addiction to fossil fuels: wind and solar energy; healthy alternatives to meat; bicycles and trains. Many nations have laws to help us transition to a low-carbon future. The world has the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the agreement struck in Paris in 2015.
But for reasons that are psychological as well as political, we seem mostly unable to concentrate on the existential threat we face as global warming gathers pace (20 of the hottest-ever years were in the last 22) and climate chaos unfolds. Something else is always more important – or more manageable. Even those who recognise that we must use all the tools at our disposal, to stop emitting greenhouse gases as soon as possible, struggle to be heard.
Thanks in no small part to the eye-catching tactic of the school strike, over the past nine months the movement spearheaded by Greta Thunberg has cut through. Green activists and scholars have spoken for years of the generational injustice of climate change. The school strikers belong to a 21st-century generation who have either taken this idea on, or arrived at it through a process of deduction of their own. Greta, who believes her outlook has been influenced by her autism, says she learned about climate change at school aged eight, and became depressed at 11. By 15, her angst had translated itself into a distinctive form of civil disobedience – the Friday school strikes which spread around the world.
Hints that Greta has been manipulated by adults appear to be unfounded. As a teenager, she is in any case entitled to advice. And while it is natural to focus on her as a figurehead, the movement does not depend on her. As she told the audience at a Guardian Live event on Monday, she does not see herself as a leader, but as a participant.
How the wave of demonstrations she helped start develops will be fascinating, as will the progress of the Extinction Rebellion protesters. Peaceful protest and activism are vital to democracy. The climate crisis makes them urgent and necessary. But decision-making requires processes and structures. This is not easy, and partly explains why so many of the successful civil disobedience campaigns of the past have been shaped by charismatic individuals.
The school strikers’ message, similar to the extinction rebels, is that we should panic. Our house, in Greta’s memorable phrase, is on fire. We must embrace “cathedral thinking” – laying the foundations for the carbon-free future without knowing how we are going to paint the roof. This way of thinking does induce fear. But since doing nothing is not an option, except for nihilists and misanthropes, the rest of us have little choice but to battle through these darker emotions – and act with hope. The IPCC said last year that the next 12 years are critical, a warning echoed on the BBC by David Attenborough in a landmark documentary last week. The film should have been made a decade ago. We should have been alert to the dangers before children went on strike. But we still have some time.
… we have a small favour to ask. More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.

Speaking in response to an urgent question in the Commons on Tuesday, the shadow energy minister, Barry Gardiner – who also holds the international trade role – said that alongside the school strikes, the protests organised by Extinction Rebellion were reminiscent of previous memorable struggles.
“All of those victories were won by citizens uniting against injustice, making their voice heard. And Extinction Rebellion and the school climate strikers are doing just that,” Gardiner said.
Outside parliament, several hundred protesters from Extinction Rebellion gathered to call for politicians to engage with their three demands: for politicians to tell the truth, for the UK to cut carbon emissions to zero by 2025, and for the formation of a citizens’ assembly.
Jon Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, came out to speak to the crowd, pledging to make climate change a central focus of Labour’s health and wellbeing policy and expressed his support for a citizens’ assembly.
Inside the chamber, former Labour leader Ed Miliband said the government must declare a climate emergency and introduce a “green new deal”.
Miliband, who was the energy and climate change secretary under Gordon Brown, said the protesters were correct. “The truth is the planet is warming far faster than we are acting,” he said. “Climate change is not some theoretical future prospect, but is with us here and now.”
Responding for the government, Claire Perry, the energy minister, rejected the idea of a climate emergency – “I don’t know what that would entail” – and said she had reservations about the Extinction Rebellion protests.
While she was glad such arguments were being heard, Perry said: “They have caused disruption for many hundreds and thousands of hard-working Londoners and they have required a heavy policing presence.
“I worry that many of the messages we are hearing ignore the progress that is being made, and as such make people fearful for the future rather than hopeful.”
More than 1,000 Extinction Rebellion activists have been arrested in the past week in a campaign of mass non-violent direct action orchestrated by the group to highlight how little time there is to halt manmade ecological breakdown.
Protesters occupied four sites across the capital and staged various acts of civil disobedience including blocking roads, disrupting a train line and conducting a protest at Heathrow airport.
On Tuesday the group said it intended to carry out more actions in the next few days – including blocking roads in and around the City of London on Thursday.
The group’s “rapid response team” met on Tuesday to decide its strategy for the coming weeks. A spokesperson said they were discussing how, when and if this stage of the “rebellion” should end rather than whether there should be more actions this week. The group said there would be two more “people’s assemblies” in the next few days at its Marble Arch camp before a final decision would be made on Wednesday.
“We have had enormous success and intend to continue,” said a spokesperson. “But what shape that is going to take and when we end is under discussion. It is important that we do have a little pause to take stock and get feedback from everyone – it has been an incredibly intense few days.”
One of the group’s co-founders, Roger Hallam, said: “We do want to negotiate with the government and will pause the disruption if that happens but at the moment it is all systems go … the rebellion continues.”
On Tuesday the group announced it had raised almost £200,000 – mostly in small donations of between £10 and £50 – since the protests began, making a total of £365,000 since January.
Scotland Yard’s tactics in policing the demonstrations appeared to harden at the weekend with protesters cleared from three of their four roadblocks. On Tuesday officers told Extinction Rebellion organisers that they faced arrest if they incited protesters to block roads around Parliament Square. Police said they were imposing preemptive conditions restricting any demonstration outside the Houses of Parliament.
Liam Geary Baulch, from London, said relations between the group and the police had become increasingly strained, with dismay over the Met’s decision to name those charged in connection with the protest and to seize a sound system it had been using in Marble Arch.
“We have seen thousands of people take non-violent action and over 1,000 arrests, yet we have had no complaints from the police about violence,” Geary Baulch said.

After the noise of Brexit in parliament and the disruption of Extinction Rebellion outside, the 16-year-old Swedish activist cut an extraordinarily composed figure as she arrived with her trademark braids, hand-painted placard and a speech that forced politicians to reflect on a crisis that is growing steadily worse despite three decades of political promises.
“This ongoing irresponsible behaviour will no doubt be remembered in history as one of the greatest failures of humankind,” she told the packed audience of MPs, officials and fellow school strikers. “You lied to us. You gave us false hope. You told us that the future was something to look forward to.”
There was no let-up for the audience. The UK, she said, was very special due to its “mind-blowing historical carbon debt”, a reference to the country’s record as the birthplace of industrialisation. But this was also, she said, because its claims of world-leading progress on cutting emissions are partly the result of “creative accounting” and are belied by the government’s plans for more high-emissions projects.
“The UK’s active current support of new exploitation of fossil fuels, like for example the UK shale gas fracking industry, the expansion of its North Sea oil and gas fields, the expansion of airports, as well as the planning permission for a brand new coalmine, is beyond absurd,” she said.
She finished to a standing ovation and cheers, then sat quietly as the panel of senior politicians gave their responses. Several appeared chastened.
“Your voice – still, calm and clear – is like the voice of our conscience,” said the environment secretary, Michael Gove. “When I listened to you, I felt great admiration, but also responsibility and guilt. I am of your parents’ generation, and I recognise that we haven’t done nearly enough to address climate change and the broader environmental crisis that we helped to create.”
Ed Miliband, the Labour politician who led the UK’s delegation to the 2009 Copenhagen climate summit and oversaw the UK Climate Act, said he recognised that what was done in the past has been proven by science not to be enough. “You have woken us up. We thank you. All the young people who have gone on strike have held up a mirror to our society … you have taught us all a really important lesson. You have stood out from the crowd.”
Thunberg listened attentively, applauding only when a member of audience criticised the government for pushing ahead with fracking. Her mantra when dealing with governments has been consistent: Never mind the words. Nothing matters apart from actions to halt emissions.
The big test on this will come on 2 May, when the climate change committee announces the results of a review of the UK’s targets, including when the country should aim to reach net zero emissions. This was prompted by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report last year, which warned of the dangers of global warming exceeding 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The recent surge of demands for more ambition – on the streets, from the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, and from David Attenborough – have helped to amplify the message that Greta and others are stressing with their climate strikes.
Tuesday saw other signs of progress that would have been hard to imagine a year ago. Caroline Lucas, the former leader of the Green party, announced that during Greta’s meeting with party leaders earlier in the day, participants – including Jeremy Corbyn and Ian Blackford – had agreed to start regular cross-party meetings on climate policy, to open consultations with youth climate activists and to have an independent body assess whether party manifestos were in line with the Paris agreement.
Theresa May was the only party leader who did not attend but otherwise Greta’s visit proved an opportunity for a renewal of the cross-party consensus on climate. The mood was strikingly in contrast to the bitterly divisive debates of Brexit: Gove applauded Lucas’s moral leadership on environmental issues and said nobody had done more than Miliband to put the UK’s climate policy on a strong track.
Gove was, however, criticised for being the person in the room with the most power to change policy, but the most evasive answers. “He’s environment secretary, so it’s not enough for him to feel guilty,” said Lucas. “I hope he takes home the message that he should not be satisfied with warm words.”
The standing-room-only turnout was far better than the recent climate debate in parliament, which drew barely a dozen MPs even though it was the first on the crisis held in the main chamber in two years. Several dozen politicians attended on Tuesday, along with government officials and representatives of the UK student strikers movement. Attendees said it was the most crowded event they could remember in more than 10 years at the Attlee suite.
The young Swede spoke so quietly at first that many in the audience struggled to catch her speech above the clicks of the cameras. The low volume was deliberate, forcing people to hush and listen intently. “Can you hear me?” she asked repeatedly. “Is my English OK? Is the microphone on? Because I’m beginning to wonder. During the last six months I have travelled around Europe for hundreds of hours in trains, electric cars and buses, repeating these life-changing words over and over again. But no one seems to be talking about it, and nothing has changed.”
But now there is undoubtedly more focus on the subject. After Greta’s speech, she went to the main debating chamber of the House of Commons, where MPs greeted her with a roar of applause and Miliband asked the government whether it would declare a national climate emergency. MPs also held a debate about the recent Extinction Rebellion protests and student strikes.
Unimpressed, Thunberg said afterwards that the politicians were missing the point. “They turn this into a question of what methods the protesters use – truancy and civil disobedience – but it’s not about that. It’s about the fact that we face an existential crisis.”
After the event, she went to St Pancras station to catch the Eurostar, the first leg of a 36-hour journey back to Stockholm. Passers-by, who recognised her on the street with her climate-strike sign, gave her the thumbs up and words of support. During the Easter holidays, she has received rock star treatment, selling out venues, being followed by paparazzi, meeting the Pope and having politicians humble themselves in her presence.
As long as the attention serves a purpose it is tolerable, Greta said. But she is now ready to return home. “I like to be left alone,” she said as she headed back to Sweden, back to school and back to her regular weekly strike.
… we can’t turn away from climate change. The Guardian’s environmental coverage reports the scientific facts, social consequences and political choices that are shaping the fate of our planet. As the world's leaders turn their backs on the environment, we are at a crisis point. Individual consumer choices are important, but we need collective action to achieve the systemic change that will really make a difference. Our pioneering and our fearless reporting on the environment can play a vital role in that. But we need our readers’ support.

For mine, Shorten’s characterisation is on target, for as it stands, there is much of the soul of this nation in great need of redemption. 
Two points stand out - firstly, Morrison the Destroyer and secondly, Morrison the Invisible. 
Even a cursory assessment of Morrison’s CV shows us the proof of this. Fingerprints on everything, responsibility for nothing. The Smiling Assassin, as Julie Bishop now knows, to her cost. 
KM put it elegantly:
... the Liberal leader has a well-honed talent for getting out from under when the building collapses. 
I just say Morrison doesn’t care how he gets the top job - or what degradation and ruin he finds when he gets there - just so long as he gets there. Constant lies, shape-shifting, pointing “over there”, flat refusal to discuss ANYTHING in his past behaviour (which might well be instructive as to his FUTURE behaviour), perversity in dismissing any objective institutional opinion that doesn’t agree with his plan. And so it goes on. 
Shorten, on the other hand, has put his policies in the public arena a long time ago, has been constantly available to the public, and to media, to discuss them, has been willing to refine or update them as unintended consequences might require. 
The media has much to answer for too, as KM says. Opinion writers aside, its job is not to BE the headline, nor to use the opportunity to create a personal profile - its job is not to be a player in determining what is news. It’s job is, simply enough, to report it. 
The future of this country should not be determined by one man’s personal ambition for glory at any cost, coupled with another man’s personal resentment of a lack of kow-towing.

To you ""real industries"" have names which start with capital letters even when not at the start of a sentence.
However, many Australian agricultural operations exist quite well with the solar panels they've installed to replace those noisy expensive old diesel generators. Many agricultural operations exist quite well with their wind turbines which provide both revenue and shelter for their stock from wind and sun. Many logistic and manufacturing operations also exist quite well with their rooftop solar panels which reduce their power bills. 
In reality all the industries you listed, whether starting with capital letters or not, meet some need. Australian agriculture provides food. medicine and fibre that people need and will pay money for. Australian tourism provides holidays for people which they need allowing them to return to work refreshed and more productive. Manufacturing provides people with constructed objects which they use in their daily lives and in their employment. Education provides people with access to knowledge which they use in their daily life and in their employment. Mining provides people with minerals and rocks which can be used in manufacturing a wide range of objects from ships, cars, buildings to batteries. Healthcare provides people with access to a healthy life enabling them to engage in daily life and employment. Entertainment provides people with relaxation and inspiration enabling them to continue with their home and work life. Logistics provides other industries with the material things it needs. Finance provides industry and people with the money needed to expand.
All these industries meet an economic need. None is any more a racket than the other. They are all interdependent. All industries depend on the agricultural industry to feed and clothe their workforce.

A cross-party group of federal MPs has asked the auditor general to urgently investigate $180m spent on water buybacks last year, amid concerns about whether the government got value for money. 
The buybacks of water rights from three large properties as part of the Murray-Darling basin plan proceeded without tender, and took place while Barnaby Joyce was minister for agriculture.
In April 2016 he declared an end to large-scale water buybacks for the environment. Instead it appeared that the commonwealth negotiated with farmers who approached it wanting to sell.

It's that simple | Katharine Murphy,article,http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/apr/18/buying-international-permits-is-a-cheap-way-to-cut-emissions-its-that-simple,242,"It’s the climate policy debate, so veering into Numptyville is par for the course, but I confess we are there earlier than even I expected.
For the past few days of the election campaign, we have been having a conversation about the use of international permits – if you can call what’s been happening a conversation. It’s been more like a series of unconnected statements. A bout of incoherent shouting in a wardrobe.
In the interests of preserving sanity, let’s try and tether the debate to some basic facts and concepts. Labor has proposed using international permits as part of its climate policy measures to allow high-emitting businesses to reduce their pollution at least cost.
Sticking with basic facts, using international permits to lower the costs associated with reducing pollution was something the Coalition said it was prepared do.
Yes, that’s right. This government. The one that’s still in power. That happened in 2017, when it reviewed its climate policies.
In December 2017, the government’s policy was to “support, in principle, the use of international units”. If you are curious enough to click through to that source document, let me save you five minutes. Look on page eight.
So stay with me. The government that flagged using international permits, with a final decision about the timing and scope of use to be taken in 2020, is the same government that is now trying to sell the voters (and media outlets gullible enough to swallow and amplify the latest most lurid conspiracy about “carbon credits for Kazakhstan”) a big bucket of bollocks.
The official line now is the use of international permits will cost an absolute motser, and end heavy industry in this country.
Just while we are back in the vault, the same 2017 climate policy review also suggested the government would pursue a new light vehicle fuel efficiency standard to reduce transport emissions – another position the government now disavows because it wants to pretend that Bill Shorten has a secret plan to confiscate your ute.
I mean seriously, this is pathetic. How cynical can you get?
For people who have no idea about permits, why we are talking about them, what they are, why they are even remotely relevant, allow me to assist.
If you want to reduce pollution there are a couple of ways to do it. One is high-cost. The other is least-cost.
If you want to force down domestic emissions at any cost, you don’t use policy tools such as permits. You just set strict rules, and insist that heavy emitters reduce their pollution. Doing that might mean some firms go out of business, but that doesn’t matter to you if your objective is reducing pollution at any cost, because the science tells you there is an urgent problem to address.
If you don’t want to do that, if you want to reduce pollution at least cost, then policy tools such as permits enter the mix. Labor’s proposal is an emissions reduction target of 45% for heavy polluters, and it has flagged allowing businesses to buy permits to help them meet their liabilities.
Put at its simplest, having access to permits means businesses can buy emissions reduction occurring elsewhere. Having to buy permits imposes a cost on the business – but that’s the point.
If the objective is to reduce pollution, there is a price associated with doing it. The only question is whether the price is high or lower. There is no free lunch.
A point worth noting while we are on costs. The government has in recent years passed the costs of emissions reduction onto taxpayers rather than polluters. That’s what the emissions reduction fund is. It’s a pot of taxpayer money that pays for emissions reduction.
So you are paying for emissions reduction now. You just don’t know it, because nobody sends you a detailed set of accounts.
Back to our free lunch. Scott Morrison in the shadow of an election sent a number of public signals to try to reassure voters that the Coalition was taking climate change seriously.
But the fact is the Coalition has retreated to the Tony Abbott position. That’s what the confected moral panic about international permits and ute confiscation tells us. We are back to the Abbott position. Back to hyperbole and wrecking in the hope that governing by graphic novel can win you an election.
There are legitimate questions about the use of permits. The first is: should any government be allowing them in the mix when the science suggests the need to reduce pollution is urgent?
The second is: are the permits junk? The third (which links to the first) is: how much usage should you permit? The fourth concerns the relative costs associated with using them versus not using them.
It’s completely reasonable to ask Labor questions about the costs associated with its climate policies, just as it’s reasonable to ask the Morrison government about the cost of six years of inaction, which is this government’s legacy.
But while it’s fine to ask questions, this conversation also has to touch reality, and ensuing reporting and analysis has to cut through the spin.
By shouting about the dangers to the economy of businesses being forced to buy permits to reduce their carbon liabilities, the Coalition is drawing a bright red line that should not be missed.
The government is saying it doesn’t support emissions reduction if that imposes a cost on businesses.
The government is saying that emissions reduction that imposes a cost on anyone apart from you, the voter (because you are already paying), should not happen.
Just give yourself a minute to absorb that position, and line it up against what the climate science tells us needs to happen.
It’s an extraordinary thing to say in an election season where Australian voters are deeply worried about climate change.
… we have a small favour to ask. More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders.

Easter. It is interesting to remember that this time last year Polly et al were supporting Mandelson's elderly minions outside the Houses of Parliament demanding Corbyn be suitably crucified.

as Toynbee herself did in February 2019 ). But I won't. What can you say about people who are prepared to countenance the deaths of their progenitors for short-term perceived economic gain?

I'm not so young either and studied Environmental Science at university in the late 70s. At that time, the opinions around were that fossil fuel would be totally gone before the year 2000 and that population growth would mean that everyone would be standing on top of each other by then as well.
I honestly don't think that our species is in danger of extinction in the next 50 years or so due to climate change.
I have total sympathy with the need to look after the planet and do what we can for future generations, however I also believe that we have to be realistic about what can be changed, the timescale for that change and the means used to bring it about.

But what comes next? | Polly Toynbee,article,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/18/extinction-rebellion-protest-climate-change-david-attenborough,482,"Day four of Extinction Rebellion, which has been a phenomenal success, as climate protesters occupy four pressure points in Britain’s congested capital. Everything has conspired to maximise attention for their climate cause, with the news unnaturally quiet in this pause in Brexit hostilities.
Compared to Brexit rage and fury, climate protesters are the soul of peace and goodwill, their pink boat welcoming Oxford Street shoppers, who mainly stop to talk. The surprisingly few police are friendly, with the 400 arrests curiously voluntary, people well-warned in advance so those who can’t be arrested step back. Is it true the police cuts have left too little capacity to arrest everyone? Two officers laugh: “You might say that, we couldn’t possibly comment”.
The sun shines on them as Waterloo Bridge is magically transformed into the Boris Johnson £53m garden bridge that never was, with a long line of trees in big pots down the middle and rows of flowers. The calm of the carless river crossing is a good advertisement for how cities might be. “Come and join us, take time off work,” Gail Bradbrook, one of the organisers, exhorted Today programme listeners this morning. She’s right. All who can should be there. Those in tree-hugging outfits and carnival costumes may attract the cameras – but gathered here are all ages and occupations. The school strikes, started by the remarkable Greta Thunberg, caught the imagination around the world, just as this protest is echoed in 80 cities, from India to the US. Challenged by Nick Robinson for the nuisance caused, Bradbrook said “It gets you on the Today programme” – and that’s the blunt truth.
By another stroke of protesters’ luck, tonight David Attenborough delivers his most devastating warning yet in BBC One’s Climate Change: The Facts. In the past the BBC has been criticised for avoiding climate controversy in its phenomenally successful, world bestselling Attenborough nature franchise. No longer. Possibly spurred on by Netflix poaching Attenborough for its more polemical series, the gloves are off. “If we have not taken dramatic action within the next decade we could face irreversible damage to the natural world and the collapse of our societies,” he says. The 92-year-old naturalist speaks with resounding authority, as scientists lay out the undeniable evidence of what 1C extra heat has done already, and what risks becoming unstoppable. Among horrifying footage of wildfires, ice cliffs crumbling into the sea and permafrost melting to release methane many times more damaging than CO2, come eye-watering particulars: one foot of Louisiana is being lost every 45 minutes to rising sea levels. “It’s hard to exaggerate the peril we are in,” he says.
But as ever, how do we turn the Attenborough evidence and public protest into politics? We have been here before in 2006 when Gordon Brown brought over Al Gore to show his equally devastating film, An Inconvenient Truth. I thought then this might be a political tipping point. At least now the UK climate deniers are trounced: the BBC rightly refuses them airtime. But guiltily, I am well aware that every day we obsess in the media about other things is another day lost to the monumental, all-consuming threat to the planet and humanity. Greta Thunberg tells us to stop “talking about taxes or Brexit” and focus on the survival of life on earth.
It’s almost too big to think about. Or there is nothing new to say. The left/right divide has been a disaster: even if the respectable right no longer seriously denies climate change, it balks at solutions that look collectivist and socialist. Indeed, the need to take climate action, the need for state investment in a green new deal, gives new impetus to socialist thinking – an all-too-convenient excuse, the right suspects. Inequality blocks every remedy: how do you make everyone cut down on fossil fuels without helping the poor in cold homes and old cars, and giving aid to poorer countries in order to redistribute the pain? If the US, China, India or anywhere else isn’t doing enough, why should we? Reasons why politicians do too little are legion.
As Larry Elliot writes today, it helps that Mark Carney of the Bank of England is warning of catastrophic financial consequences. Will he follow that through in everything the bank does?
Extinction Rebellion wants net zero carbon emissions by 2025: existing targets are being badly missed. Protesters point to fracking, new coal mines, new incinerators and a Heathrow extension as perverse government polices. The government’s effective ban on land-based wind power just as it became profitable, to appease shire voters, was shocking. So was the sudden withdrawal of solar subsidies and the feed-in tariff, just as that industry was taking off, causing an immediate loss of 12,000 solar jobs. The government has asked the independent Committee on Climate Change to review its targets, results to be published shortly. What’s needed is a translation of fear into acceptable politics: the protesters are wise to demand a citizens’ assembly to examine all the evidence and gain public consent for what needs to be done outside the left-right battle-lines of conventional politics. The government should seize on that. Let’s hope the protest ends as elegantly as it has been conducted.

The thumbs-down from the Greens, who will likely be the critical Senate bloc post-election in the event of a Labor victory, comes as the politically influential motoring lobby has also signalled it will push back on Labor’s proposal to introduce vehicle efficiency standards for light vehicles that would bring Australia broadly into line with carbon pollutions standards for cars in the US.
The Australian Industry Group, which represents some of Australia’s heavy emitters, also argued the 45% emissions target proposed by Labor would represent a “heavy lift” for many parts of the economy and “would be workable only if they were delivered in tandem with commitments to avoid trade distortions, allow many sources of flexibility and facilitate major low-carbon investments”.
Labor on Monday, on budget eve and only days before the calling of the election, unveiled the final tranche of its climate policy. The policy includes more stringent pollution-reduction requirements for heavy industry, a new vehicle emissions standard imposed on car retailers, and new targets to increase the share of electric vehicles in the transport fleet.
The Morrison government went on the political offensive immediately, likening the measures to a carbon “tax”. The prime minister claimed Labor’s beefed-up pollution requirements for big emitters would force companies to purchase international carbon credits, “sending money offshore to foreign carbon traders – carbon credits from Kazakhstan”.
The Greens’ climate spokesman, Adam Bandt, used similar language to Morrison: “We cannot outsource our emissions reduction obligations to a pig farm in Ukraine.”
Bandt said international offsets were “fake action because Australian polluters will buy overseas permits from other countries but keep polluting at home. International offsets delay climate action in Australia. More coal will be burnt at home and the transition to 100% renewables will be delayed”.
Labor defended the decision to deploy permits as part of the abatement options. The shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, said the government needed to explain why it supported Australian businesses trading in international markets, but not international carbon markets.
“What we need are cuts in pollution, whether they are from the Australian carbon farming sector or overseas robust credible markets or the electricity sector – the important thing is for cuts in pollution to be achieved … in the most cost-effective and efficient manner possible,” Butler said.
A pitched backroom lobbying campaign has prevented governments imposing vehicle emissions standards in Australia for years. The Australian Automobile Association warned on Tuesday “a poorly designed standard will drive up the cost of cars”, despite government modelling indicating vehicle efficiency standards would actually deliver billions of dollars in fuel savings for consumers.
Labor has proposed a pollution regulation that will bring Australian cars in line with 105g of carbon dioxide per kilometre, but will consult on the timeline for phasing in the change.
The AAA remains opposed to a model that would mirror standards in the European Union or the US and has successfully argued for years that the needs of Australian drivers are unique.
On Monday the AAA said it supports the introduction of an emissions standard that recognises the “unique needs and preferences of Australian motorists”, but that a “poorly-designed standard” would drive up the cost of cars and petrol. 
The issue of vehicle efficiency standards has been politically toxic, with attempts by the current government to introduce them derailed by the National party and the motoring and petroleum lobbies.
The consequence of that is Australia now lags behind the rest of the world in introducing standards that would help deal with the country’s second-highest source of emissions – the transport sector.
One motor lobby, the NRMA, has taken a different position to the AAA and says Australia is so far behind it will have to look at banning internal combustion engine vehicle sales within the next decade.
Labor has also proposed a national electric vehicle target of 50% of all new car sales by 2030.
Other industry groups on Monday said they wanted to see more detail on how the opposition plans to implement its climate policies if it wins government in May.
The Ai Group’s chief executive, Innes Willox, said proposed pollution requirements for different sectors under a beefed-up safeguard mechanism would need to be achieved through low-cost abatement anywhere in the domestic economy, as well as through credible international options.
He warned assisting industries exposed as a result of the transition to a low-carbon economy could be difficult when many currently weren’t defined as emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries under government arrangements. Willox also said that options for low- and zero-carbon transition in industry needed to be more tangible.
“The proposed Strategic Industries Fund could be useful, though important detail is lacking on coverage, level of matching and more,” Willox said.
“In short, we should not underestimate how difficult the trade-offs would be between the expectations of different industries and other stakeholders. Close consultation with the breadth of affected industries would be essential to deliver on such ambitious goals.”
Environment groups, meanwhile, said the package was a substantial step forward on climate but still fell short on issues including the need to replace coal-fired power and reduce deforestation.
Kelly O’Shanassy, the chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation, said: “There is still a cognitive dissidence in our national debate about the climate damage the coal we dig up and send overseas is causing. No party can claim to be truly serious on climate change until it stops Adani and develops a strategy to accelerate the transition away from coal.” 
The Australia Institute’s Richie Merzian said the policy had the potential “to actually reduce emissions in line with a credible and achievable emission reduction target of 45% by 2030”.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/01/greens-blast-key-part-of-labors-climate-policy-as-fake-action

The prime minister, Justin Trudeau, citing international commitments to fight global warming, had made clear for two years he would slap the tax on any of the 10 provinces that did not come up with their own plans by 1 April.
The measure is opposed by Ontario, the most populous province, where Trudeau’s Liberals need to do well to stand a chance of retaining power in a federal election this October.
Carbon pollution will initially cost C$20 ($15) a tonne, rising by C$10 a year until it reaches C$50 in 2022. It also applies in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick.
“As of today, it’s no longer free to pollute anywhere in Canada,” the environment minister, Catherine McKenna, said on Twitter.
“Climate change is real ... some politicians may not care much, but our kids and our grandkids do.“
Official data regularly show Canada has little chance of meeting its climate change goals of reducing emissions by 30% from 2005 levels by 2030.
Although Ottawa says the money collected will be returned to taxpayers in the form of rebates, right-leaning parties portray it as a cash grab.
The Conservatives, who polls show could win the October election as a scandal over alleged political interference dogs Trudeau, promise to scrap the measure.
Ontario premier Doug Ford vowed to oppose what he called “the worst tax ever” in court.
“We’re going to keep fighting this carbon tax with every single tool at our disposal,” he said in a filmed statement.
Scott Moe, the premier of Saskatchewan, which has already launched a challenge, said he hoped the tax was an April Fool’s joke.
“We now have four provinces representing half the population in this nation that say this is a flawed policy,” Moe told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.

The current climate change ...
BQEND
You have failed to define when, in your opinion, the ""current"" period started. For the IPCC this is usually taken to be ""since 1950 / the mid-20th century"".
BQSTART
Humans have caused these changes in the climate or climate change in the last 140 years. What humans have done over the last 140 years ...
BQEND
Here you run into the problem of the ""early 20th century warming period"", from 1910 to 1940/1945.
See, for example, in the IPCC's AR5 (WG1 report, Chapter 10, page 887) :
BQSTART
Ring et al. (2012) estimate, based on time series analysis, that part of the early 20th century warming was due to GHG increases (see also Figure 10.6), but find a dominant contribution by internal variability. 
...
Some studies have suggested that the warming is a response to the AMO (Schlesinger and Ramankutty, 1994; Polyakov et al., 2005; Knight et al., 2006; Tung and Zhou, 2013), or a large but random expression of internal variability (Bengtsson et al., 2006; Wood and Overland, 2010).
BQEND
Note that in using the word ""mainly"" I am not questioning whether anthropogenic forcings were ""part of"" or ""contributed to"" the resulting temperature curve, I am (or rather, ""the IPCC is"" ...) saying that it was ""dominated"" by the natural variability alternative during that time period.
There is considerable room for ""debate"" on this issue because, as the IPCC themselves put it in the conclusion to their ""The early 20th century warming"" sub-sub-section cited above :
BQSTART
It remains difficult to quantify the contribution to this warming from internal variability, natural forcing and anthropogenic forcing, due to forcing and response uncertainties and incomplete observational coverage.
BQEND
Your mention of ""the last 140 years"" is undermined by the IPCC itself, given that one of the most quoted lines in AR5 is ""It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.""
See the ""FAQ 10.1, Figure 1"" graphs on page 895 of AR5 for further evidence that the ""consensus"" view is that before 1950 the ""climate change"" indicated using the (global mean surface) temperature proxy was indeed ""mainly"" due to natural variability.

BQSTART

8.) I gather from this last discussion that it would be absurd to attribute the Katrina disaster to global warming?   A: Yes, it would be absurd. 
9.) Q: OK, maybe we won’t see global warming effects in landfalling hurricanes for another 50 years or so, but shouldn’t we still be worried about it? The answer to this question is largely a matter of one’s geographical and time horizons. For U.S.-centric concerns over the next 30-50 years, by far the most important hurricane problem we face is demographic and political....On the other hand, if one’s view is not confined to the U.S. but is global, and/or one’s time horizon is more than 50 years, global warming may indeed begin to have a discernible influence on hurricane damage, especially when coupled with projected increases in sea level.

It could well be that Dr. Emanuel shares your scepticism about projecting too much from current hurricanes.

Here I define an index of the potential destructiveness of hurricanes based on the total dissipation of power, integrated over the lifetime of the cyclone, and show that this index has increased markedly since the mid-1970s. 
This trend is due to both longer storm lifetimes and greater storm intensities. I find that the record of net hurricane power dissipation is highly correlated with tropical sea surface temperature, reflecting well-documented climate signals, including multi-decadal oscillations in the North Atlantic and North Pacific, and global warming.

https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03906
Tropical cyclones derive their strength from warm water and much of the resulting damage is due to storm surge. Add heat to the system and a higher base sea level and you get more destructive storms.
I don’t think one can say that global warming caused Hurricane Sandy, but ocean temperatures were several degrees above normal for both Sandy and typhoon Haiyan and sea levels were higher than before the Industrial Revolution, so global warming exacerbated the storms. 
The extra foot or so of sea level rise on the US East Coast caused Hurricane Sandy to flood an additional 25 square miles. (one foot of sea level rise, averaged globally moves the shoreline inland 300 feet, it’s worse in places like S Florida and Bangladesh).
Another interesting thing about Sandy. Changes in the jet stream, perhaps due to Arctic ice decline, allowed Sandy to follow an unusual, and unusually damaging course; directly into land with the dangerous semi-circle of the storm piling water ashore.

As opposed to your belief, what does the evidence say?
For anyone living in a region subject to cyclones or hurricanes, these large tropical storms now last for longer periods of around 30 hours or so as opposed to 24 as they pass overhead. No one is suggesting that any hurricane or cyclone on Earth will last for 30 years.
No one is suggesting that droughts last for hours, and while seasonal droughts can last for months, for example the yearly winter early spring drought of South East Queensland, droughts such as the South East Australian millennial drought, this decades drought in South Eastern Australia and Western Queensland as well as the new but chronic rainfall deficit of South Western Western Australia, have lasted for years.
While one heatwave this summer lasted 36 days in Cloncurry and Camooweal, heatwaves generally last a few days to a few weeks, but they have increased in frequency and duration.
The extreme rainfall events that cause floods can last a matter of hours to days but extreme La Nina events can last a year with repeated extreme rainfall events and associated floods. 
During such years repeated rainfall events over months and weeks can result in complete soil saturation such that a two hour extreme rainfall events can resust in flash flooding causing sudden loss of life and crop, stock and property damage. This happened in Toowoomba and the Lockyer Valley in 2011. Flash floods, as their name suggests, don't last for long but global warming has increased the frequency of the extreme rainfall events that cause them and consequently increased the frequency of flash floods. 
Hundreds of kilometres downstream from Toowoomba and 10 days later, the waters from that flash flood moved through Brisbane and Ipswich as a prolonged flood peak over a week or so with peaks occurring with each high tide as the river roared through. Thirty years before and in the absence of a huge flood mitigating dam, a similar but more local flood, described as a one in 200 year event, had reached a similar height. Flood frequency and the size of the responsible extreme rainfall event had increased. 
 In 2005 Kerry Emanuel demonstrated that since the 1970 the destructiveness of tropical cyclones has increased worldwide due to increases in the frequency of more intense storms and more time spent such storms over one place, a function of size and speed of movement irrespective of declining overall activity.https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03906
The overall pattern is one of increases in the frequency extreme weather events such as heatwaves and the extreme rainfall events that cause floods, increase in the rate of onset of droughts as increased temperatures increase evaporation of soil moisture, and increased destructiveness of cyclones and hurricanes - all over a consecutive overlapping 30 year periods - that indicates a change in the climate.

When we picture climate change it is often extreme weather that springs to mind: hurricanes, cyclones, droughts, heatwaves and floods.
BQEND
That is because ""we"" have been indulging in what is known as ""rewriting the dictionary"".
I use the IPCC definition of ""climate change"" (AR5, Annex III) :
BQSTART
Climate change refers to a change in the state of the climate that can be identified (e.g., by using statistical tests) by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties, and that persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer. Climate change may be due to natural internal processes or external forcings such as modulations of the solar cycles, volcanic eruptions and persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere or in land use.
BQEND
For historical reasons the minimum (and default) ""integration time"" for meteorological data, AKA ""weather"", to become climate data is 30 years.
For me, and I believe many others, ""hurricanes, cyclones, droughts, heatwaves and floods"" = ""extreme weather events"", which occur over periods measured in terms of ""hours to months"" instead of ""30+ years"".
Regarding ""hurricanes / tropical cyclones"" specifically, while the SPM for AR5 stated that in general ""Changes in many extreme weather and climate events have been observed since about 1950"", you had to look in Chapter 2 to discover that :
BQSTART
Confidence remains low for long-term (centennial) changes in tropical cyclone activity, after accounting for past changes in observing capabilities. However, it is virtually certain that the frequency and intensity of the strongest tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic has increased since the 1970s. {2.6.3}

But secondary impacts, such as landslides, also present a major threat.
Just over two weeks ago, Cyclone Idai made landfall in Mozambique and high winds, rainfall and flooding were the primary concern. But for the people living in the Chimanimani district of Zimbabwe, it turned out to be earth itself that presented the biggest danger.
More than 180 people in the region are known to have been killed by the landslides triggered by Idai. “Rocks came from the mountain and crushed our hut …,” said a woman. One of her three children was killed in the crush.
Nasa satellite images clearly depict the extensive landslide activity associated with Cyclone Idai. Exacerbated by deforestation, the movement started in the upper reaches of river catchments, but quickly gathered material and pace.
“Sediment-rich floods in the main channel illustrate the way in which landslides high in the catchment can cause extensive damage long distances downstream,” explains Dave Petley in his landslide blog.

Under the banner Parents for the Future, 34 groups from 16 countries on four continents have issued an open letter. It demands urgent action to fight climate change and prevent temperatures rising by more than 1.5C, beyond which scientists say droughts, floods and heatwaves will get significantly worse.
“What our kids are telling us is what science has been telling us for many years – there is no time left,” the letter says. “We now owe it to them to act.”
“Parents – we are everywhere in society: in classrooms as teachers, in fields as farmers, in factories as workers, in hospitals as healers, in boardrooms as CEOs, in legislatures as policymakers,” it says. “We have the power to build this safe, just and clean future for our kids.”
On 15 March 2019, 1.6 million students from 125 countries and more than 2,000 cities marched to demand urgent and decisive actions against the climate crisis.
What our kids are telling us is what science has been telling us for many years. There is no time left. Climate change is not a looming threat anymore. It is an existential crisis whose impact we are already feeling from deadly wildfires in California and bleaching corals in Australia, to historic heatwaves in Japan and drought in South Africa.
We, parents, grandparents, carers and all those who care about the next generation stand with and for our kids. We stand with the scientific community. We stand for urgent and far more ambitious actions, policies and measures in line with a future below 1.5C of warming.
Our kids have bravely raised awareness and mobilised global public opinion to unprecedented levels. They have given us hope. We now owe it to them to act. Willingly or not, together we are the last generations which can take on the challenge of stabilising our climate and avoiding catastrophic climate change.
Climate change will not go away if we refuse to look at it or deny it. The climate will only stabilise if we support, advocate and ultimately vote in line with the 1.5C goal. The climate catastrophe can be prevented if we educate, inspire and enable more of us to act.
Parents – we are everywhere in society: in the classrooms as teachers, in the fields as farmers, in the factories as workers, in the hospitals as healers, in the boardrooms as CEOs, in the legislature as policymakers. We have the power to build this safe, just and clean future for our kids.
The containment of man-made climate change must become the greatest achievement of this century. Together, we are ready.Parents for the Future
The groups involved come from countries including the UK, Germany, US, Australia, India and South Africa. In the UK, the Mothers Rise Up group will march in London on 12 May, international Mother’s Day, and protests are expected in other nations.
“Although this is an event created by mums, it isn’t just for mums,” said Becky Wynn, from London. Wynn has two children – Seb, aged five, and Celeste, aged three. “We are calling anyone who is moved by the love of a child to join – fathers, grandparents, aunties, uncles, childminders and friends. We are all custodians of our threatened home.”
The youth strikes for climate began with a solo protest by Greta Thunberg in Sweden in August 2018. “We live in a strange world, where children must sacrifice their education in order to protest against the destruction of their future,” she told an audience in Berlin on Saturday.
Thunberg has now met world leaders and the strikes swelled to an estimated 1.5 million students in 125 countries on 15 March. Weekly strikes, registered at the Fridays for Future website, are continuing, with almost 450 strikes in 68 countries. The next global day of strikes will be 12 April.
One of the instigators of the global action by parents is Helene Costa, from Parents For Future Seattle in the US and a mother of two. “If we don’t act for our own children, who will?” she said. “What we are seeing through the global youth mobilisation and this international letter from parents is the emergence of a transnational conscience around climate actions. That makes me very hopeful.”
Eve White, a mother of two from Tasmania, Australia, and part of Australian Parents for Climate Action, said: “Climate change will make my kids’ lives much harder than my life has been in many ways. This is incredibly unfair, especially as scientists have been warning us about this for decades and the solutions are available. So why aren’t we acting – urgently?”
In New Delhi, India, Bhavreen Kandhari, mother of twin girls, said: “My government needs to urgently focus on climate breakdown and the role of trees, coal, construction and their impact on our air and water as well. Our children are going to pay the price for our mistakes and that is not acceptable to me.”
Tim Habraken, a father of two from Rotterdam in the Netherlands, said: “For ages, parents grew up with the idea that their children would have a better life than theirs. Currently, we are seeing a world that not only will very likely be worse for our children, but potentially uninhabitable. We should ask: when our children hold us accountable in the future, and ask us what we did, can we live with ourselves?”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/03/parents-around-the-world-mobilise-behind-youth-climate-strikes

That is the world scientists are uncovering as they look back in time to when the planet last had as much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as it does today.
Using sedimentary records and plant fossils, researchers have found that temperatures near the South Pole were about 20C higher than now in the Pliocene epoch, from 5.3m to 2.6m years ago. 
Many scientists use sophisticated computer models to predict the impacts of human-caused climate change, but looking back in time for real-world examples can give new insights.
The Pliocene was a “proper analogy” and offered important lessons about the road ahead, said Martin Siegert, a geophysicist and climate-change scientist at Imperial College London. “The headline news is the temperatures are 3-4C higher and sea levels are 15-20 metres higher than they are today. The indication is that there is no Greenland ice sheet any more, no West Antarctic ice sheet and big chunks of East Antarctic [ice sheet] taken,” he said.
Fossil fuel burning was pumping CO2 into the atmosphere extremely rapidly, he said, though it took time for the atmosphere and oceans to respond fully. “If you put your oven on at home and set it to 200C the temperature does not get to that immediately, it takes a bit of time, and it is the same with climate,” Siegert said, at a Royal Meteorological Society meeting on the climate of the Pliocene.
He added that global temperature had already risen by 1C since the industrial revolution, when CO2 levels were 280 parts per million (ppm). CO2 was now at 412ppm and rising, suggesting the planet would be locked into rises of 3C-4C in the next few centuries. Ice melting, he said, took even longer and the huge sea level rises indicated by the Pliocene evidence would probably take a few millennia to come about.
In the Pliocene a variety of beech and possibly conifer trees grew at Oliver Bluffs, 300 miles from the South Pole. The tree remains had been unearthed as fossils, along with cushion plants and mosses. 
Jane Francis, director of the British Antarctic Survey, said: “This is an amazing discovery. They found fossil leaves of southern beech. I call them the last forests of Antarctica. They were growing at 400ppm CO2, so this may be where we are going back to, with ice sheets melting at times, which may allow plants to colonise again.” 
The evidence showed summertime temperatures in the Pliocene were a tundra-like 5C near the Pole, compared with -15C to -20C today.
The presence of plants showed the Antarctic ice cap was much smaller in the Pliocene and the sea level much higher. “Twenty metres of sea level rise would have a major impact on our all our coastal cities and all our coastal areas where people live,” Francis said.
Polar regions were especially important in understanding global climate, she said: “We know that is where the change happens first and where it is most dramatic.”
About 100m years ago an even more extreme climate occurred. In the Cretaceous period CO2 levels were 1,000ppm. Antarctica still sat over the South Pole, but the region was warm and covered in great forests, the stumps and soil of which have been preserved as fossils in places like Alexander Island.
“If we keep carbon emissions going at the current rate, by the end of the century we will have 1,000ppm,” said Siegert. The low 280ppm level of CO2  in the run-up to the industrial revolution was rooted in carbon being removed from the air by plants and animals and then buried. “It formed coal seams, gas and oil fields. And what we have been doing for the last 150 years is digging it all up and putting it back into the atmosphere, it’s crazy.”

Nature can provide effective options to help tackle climate change. Often there is no need for complicated, expensive and unproven technology. As we know from our work in such countries as Bhutan and Costa Rica, some governments are embracing nature-based solutions where natural forests are managed for their key role in storing carbon and regulating water for clean, green hydropower. Policies and investment need to work with local people and focus on linking nature to infrastructure to help avoid catastrophic climate change, protect biodiversity and cut emissions. The real challenge is to align the politics of change to the actions that are needed. While some countries are doing the right thing, in other places (such as Brazil) the politics is going backwards in deeply troubling ways.

• Readers seeking a wide-ranging introduction to the practicalities and benefits of rewilding formerly intensive agricultural land in the UK will find lots of interest in the book Wilding, by Isabella Tree – about a live, 20-year-old project on the Knepp Estate in West Sussex, which can be visited. Especially interesting is the information on the role of glomalin in carbon capture and in soil improvement. A natural glycoprotein, it is produced by mycorrhizal fungi from plant roots and is a key soil component. A Defra assessment of the increased carbon storage capacity on this site, in neutral grassland and broadleaved woodland under rewilding, showed a 51% rise compared with the intensive agricultural management of last century. I was pleased to find that there does seem a way to get a grip on climate change alongside reducing emissions, if we can grasp it. We can all do it in our gardens as well – we don’t have to plant trees.Roy RhodesBelmont, Lancashire
• This mobilisation to draw carbon naturally from the atmosphere is long overdue. Sign me up! But is it still too narrow?
Logically, the more people and places that are mobilised, the more carbon we can extract. But how many of us can access the forest, swamp, coastal margin etc of which George Monbiot writes? Very few. This is still for others to do, not me.
Yet here I am in my back garden deliberately burying carbon. I ferment all food waste (no carbon emitted), feed it directly to my soil’s ecosystem (more soil carbon biomass), add wood biochar (permanent carbon sink) to house more soil micro-organisms and retain water and nutrients (for more biomass), then mulch with dead vegetation (protection and food for biomass). This is low-tech, and makes lovely worm-dug growing soil.
My point is that we can trap carbon naturally in many ways, some of which fit local resources and local needs like food and sanitation. These lend themselves to community efforts, in every neighbourhood everywhere. Summed together across a country, they’d be as significant as George’s big-ticket items. We can, and should, become the Carbon Preservation Society.
This is for everyone – for all those feeling helpless to affect climate change. We are not powerless. Within this new campaign, let’s create a web of local, regional and worldwide carbon preservers. Let the great and the good give the annual prizes!Malcolm FowlesReading, Berkshire
• I have supported tree protection and worked to encourage and undertake both small- and large-scale tree planting for all of my professional career.
I have undertaken much planting myself in my own semi-rural parish. I propagate trees from our local native, established giants!
There are so many issues relating to this work at all levels, including encouraging local authorities and landowners to support, protect and maintain trees on their own land.
But, putting that matter to one side, one of my biggest concerns for the last two decades has been the ever-increasing reliance on plastic tree protectors, along with their sturdy tree ties. The result is that we see plastic tubes – either whole or in pieces – contaminating and strangling our planting schemes, littering our landscapes, watercourses, open spaces, highway embankments and verges, existing and new woodlands.
This practice must be resolved so that we can have healthy, protected trees but without the plastic contaminating litter residue.
I suggest new products, new materials, more input into good planting design and practice, in order to reduce reliance on tree tubes, and much more positive management.Anne WestoverWestover Landscape Ltd
• Your correspondents are correct in asserting that planting permanent stands of hardwoods can contribute a great deal to sequestering carbon from the atmosphere. Every hectare of hardwood in a temperate climate with adequate water can accumulate at least 20 tonnes of aerial biomass annually for 30 years – 600 tonnes per hectare. But then sequestration stops on that plot. The trick is what to do next, but the answer is at hand.
Simple technologies with very low carbon emissions are available to harvest accumulated biomass, recover most of the sequestered plant nutrients, and densify the remainder to above 1 tonne per cubic metre – the density of water. Provided the right species are chosen, the roots left in the ground will sprout and within two years the carbon-capture process will have resumed as rapidly as before. Pop down to your local coppice to see what I mean.
If the densified wood is deposited in the deep ocean, below 1,000m, where it is cold, dark and with little oxygen, it is there for good. Even if some organism worked out how to use the densified wood for metabolism, any CO2 or methane produced would remain a solid, out of the atmosphere for ever.
To indicate the enormous volume available in which to sequester carbon in the deep, 1bn tonnes of CO2 deposited there would raise sea level by 2 nanometres. If all the annual CO2 emissions were dealt with in this way, sea level would rise by the thickness of a human hair.Dr Graeme Coles Chairman and technical director, Knewe, New Zealand
• The natural climate solutions approach proposed by scientists and activists including Michael Mann, Greta Thunberg and George Monbiot is a vitally important component of our global approaches to tackling climate and ecological breakdown. But carbon sequestration by trees (the removal of carbon dioxide from the air via net photosynthesis), and carbon storage in forest ecosystems (especially soils) are only two of the methods by which sustainable forest management can combat climate change.
The third method is the carbon substitution effect achieved by replacing fossil fuels, either directly as bioenergy, or indirectly through use of wood (for example as structural timber) instead of higher carbon footprint materials, such as concrete and steel. In the UK, with only 13% forest cover, we are less than 20% self-sufficient in wood products and thus need to increase all three methods of using forestry to mitigate climate change. Otherwise we are dependent on importing harvested wood from other parts of the world rather than helping restore their forests.
Climate-smart forestry is an approach that considers how natural woodlands and commercial forest plantations need to adapt to climate change while maintaining, and increasing, their climate mitigation through individual trees, in the forest and by products from the forest. This needs to be achieved without reducing the other benefits to society that the forest habitat provides, such as flood mitigation, access for recreation and associated health and wellbeing.Dr Andrew WeatherallNational School of Forestry, University of Cumbria 
• Conserving natural ecosystems to help mitigate and adapt to climate change is indeed an urgent necessity. A key question is how such places should be managed and secured.
The world’s protected area network already covers 15% of the planet’s land surface and its role in defending against climate change is recognised, for instance in a groundbreaking declaration by 18 Latin American countries at the Paris climate meeting in 2015. Additional opportunities include the territories of indigenous peoples, plus many community lands and other natural landscapes. But the survival of all such areas is fragile: national parks and nature reserves are being de-designated or degraded, indigenous peoples forced off their lands and conversion of natural forests has in many areas increased recently.
Bold targets for avoiding further conversion of natural habitats are needed. Collaboration between conservation and human rights groups can help to ensure that protection does not further disadvantage the people who live in near-natural ecosystems, who are often among the world’s poorest. Pressure must be kept on governments and industry to honour existing conservation pledges and to increase these to the levels needed to provide a measure of environmental security.Nigel DudleyEquilibrium Research, Bristol

What is happening to the climate, and the CO2 emissions causing this, are not related to the weather.
The economic section is where CO2 emissions should appear, alongside economic indicators like GDP and stock market prices. This is where the relationship between how we think wealth is generated and the costs of doing so should be made transparent. The thoughtful introduction of a few more headline indicators such as inequality, population numbers for humans/pollinators/dolphins/tigers, forest cover and deaths from air pollution on the same page would make the Guardian a genuinely progressive and even a transformative newspaper.Sara ParkinPrincipal associate, The Sustainability Literacy Project 
• It’s great that the Guardian will publish a daily record of carbon dioxide levels, but the place for this is not the weather page. Weather is outside our control. Carbon dioxide levels are our responsibility – the inexorable rise should be (daily) front-page news.Donald SmithHaddington, East Lothian
• It is good that you are recognising the climate emergency by posting the daily levels of atmospheric CO2 which are still rising. However, as reported in February, there have been even sharper rises in methane in recent years. Methane and nitrous oxide are much more potent greenhouse gases in the short term, and scientists do not understand the source of these alarming increases. Please would you also report daily methane and nitrous oxide levels as a reminder that urgent action is needed to cut the emissions and levels of these gases too.Dr Andrew BoswellNorwich
• I’m delighted to read that the Guardian will now include a carbon dioxide measure as part of its daily forecast. However, as George Monbiot has been saying for years, we urgently need to change the language we are using to discuss the climate situation.
The term “climate change”, still being used in your newspaper in this article, gives an inaccurate and far too benign impression of the situation. The terms “climate breakdown” or “climate crisis” are much more accurate. Please consider reviewing the language used in your newspapers when discussing this issue. Susanna RiviereLondon

Half of the ice in the mountain chain’s 4,000 glaciers will be gone by 2050 due to global warming already baked in by past emissions, the research shows. After that, even if carbon emissions have plummeted to zero, two-thirds of the ice will still have melted by 2100.
If emissions continue to rise at the current rate, the ice tongues will have all but disappeared from Alpine valleys by the end of the century. The researchers said the loss of the glaciers would have a big impact on water availability for farming and hydroelectricity, especially during droughts, and affect nature and tourism.
“Glaciers in the European Alps and their recent evolution are some of the clearest indicators of the ongoing changes in climate,” said Daniel Farinotti, a glaciologist at ETH Zurich in Switzerland and one of the research team.
“In the pessimistic case, the Alps will be mostly ice-free by 2100, with only isolated ice patches remaining at high elevation, representing 5% or less of the present-day ice volume,” said Matthias Huss, a senior researcher at ETH Zurich.
In February, a study found that a third of the huge ice fields in Asia’s towering mountain chains were also doomed to melt because of climate change, with serious consequences for almost 2 billion people downstream.
Glaciers along the Hindu Kush and Himalayan range are at higher, colder altitudes, but if global carbon emissions are not cut, two-thirds of their ice will melt by 2100.
Melting glaciers contribute to rising sea levels, but almost three-quarters of this water comes from Greenland and Antarctica. The Hindu Kush Himalayas, Patagonia and Iceland are also significant. The European Alps, which run through France, Switzerland, Italy, Austria and Germany, contribute less than 1%.
The latest research, published in the journal The Cryosphere and presented at the European Geosciences Union conference in Vienna, Austria, on Tuesday, combined computer models with real world data to forecast the fate of the glaciers. It used 2017 as its starting point.
Unlike previous work, the models explicitly included how the glaciers move down the mountains. This led to lower projected ice losses compared with earlier research. Applying this approach to other glaciated mountain chains could improve ice loss forecasts there, the researchers said.
Cutting the emissions from fossil-fuel burning, deforestation and other polluting activities is the biggest factor in minimising the melting of the ice. Farinotti said: “The future of these glaciers in indeed at risk, but there is still a possibility to limit their future losses.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/09/two-thirds-glaciers-alps-alpine-doomed-climate-change-ice

Fast, deep cuts in global emissions from energy, transport and food are needed to keep temperature rises in check and an analysis has shown this means the new generation will have lifetime carbon budgets almost 90% lower than someone born in 1950.
The data dramatically highlighted the burden inherited by today’s children, an issue at the heart of the global school strikes for climate. Another major strike will take place in more than 70 nations on Friday.
“Those in positions of power – from politicians to business leaders – that have benefited from a much higher lifetime carbon budget have a duty to act to ensure a liveable planet for current and future generations,” said Jake Woodier at the UK Student Climate Network, which is supporting the strikes. “Without appropriate action, those in power are sacrificing our tomorrow for their today.”
The new analysis by the climate analysts Carbon Brief combines data on emissions and population changes with climate models. It then calculates how much the average citizen on Earth can emit over their lifetime to keep temperature rises below 1.5C or 2C above pre-industrial levels, the goal of the world’s nations to avoid climate catastrophe.
Previous and existing generations have emitted nearly all the carbon dioxide needed to take the world to 1.5C or 2C, meaning future generations will have to severely cut the emissions from flying, meat consumption and other activities in their lifetimes. The children and young people taking part in the youth strikes (born 1997-2012) will have carbon budgets just one sixth those of their baby boomer grandparents (1946-1964).
“As protests by school children increase each week around the world, our analysis starkly highlights the intergenerational injustice of climate change,” said Leo Hickman, editor of Carbon Brief. “If warming is to be limited to safe levels, today’s children are going to have to greatly curtail their own lifetime emissions compared to older generations.”
The idea for the analysis came from Ben Caldecott, at the University of Oxford’s Sustainable Finance Programme. He said it is the first systematic use of emissions data to inform the debate about intergenerational responsibility for climate change and had produced some “uncomfortable numbers”.
“The purpose is not to fan the flames of rising intergenerational angst, but rather to provide some objective analysis to support dialogue between generations within countries and across them so we can tackle climate change,” he said. “The results will feed into intergenerational equity debates, for example in terms of access to housing, the availability of pensions, rising university tuition fees, changing retirement ages.”
There is a currently a wide gap between the average annual emissions of a US citizen (16.9 tonnes) and an Indian citizen (1.9 tonnes). The analysis showing that children born now would have a lifetime carbon budget 90% lower than their grandparents assumes the relative gap would remain.
But in a second analysis, Carbon Brief posited a future carbon budget that would be the same for every citizen on the planet. This would mean that the budget for a child born today in the US is even lower, 97% lower than that of that of their grandparents. For someone born today in Europe, their budget would be 94% lower.
“That those born today only have a carbon budget a fraction of the size of those from previous generations exemplifies the need for a transformative approach that puts social and economic justice at the heart of plans to tackle the climate crisis,” said Woodier. “We need massive investment in people and planet to transform our economies, and we need it urgently.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/10/climate-crisis-todays-children-face-lives-with-tiny-carbon-footprints

However, it neglects an important consideration. If, as Emilie Bellet explains, women are “looking more at where we want to be in 10, 20 or 30 years’ time”, then we also need to think hard about the kind of future our money is going to support. Many women – and men – would be horrified to think that the price for their own security is increased uncertainty and instability across the world, as many funds continue to rely heavily on the fossil fuel and extractive industries. Even so-called ethical funds are often only undertaking basic negative screening, for example ruling out pornography, weapons, tobacco and gambling, but with very little to say on climate risk. The real bottom line is that there is no money to be made on a dead planet.
Happily, this can be a win-win situation. Increasingly, fund managers are recognising the risk of the “carbon bubble” and are starting to shift their own funds. And evidence is growing that over the long term, sustainable investments can outperform the broken business-as-usual market. But this shift won’t happen without ongoing consumer pressure on the financial sector. An influx of motivated women into this space presents an excellent opportunity.
At Friends of the Earth we have been campaigning for fossil fuel divestment and corporate accountability for many years. Through our innovation work we are currently piloting a new peer-led programme for women who want to take control of their finances, but in a way that supports their vision for a safe and liveable planet. Your readers may find the recently published Good Guide to Impact Investing a good place to start.Mary StevensExperiments programme manager, Friends of the Earth
 • Your article says “if you had invested £1 in the FTSE 250 10 years ago, it would now have grown to £2.53, once inflation is taken into account”. However, if you had invested it in 2007 rather than 2009 it would only just have recovered its value. Admittedly, you would have received dividends, but these were not guaranteed to do better than if you had put the money in Ernie.Margaret SquiresSt Andrews, Fife

More than 60 demonstrations involving tens of thousands of young people are expected from Parliament Square in London to sites in Leeds, Manchester and Brighton. They follow the global strike on 15 March, when more than 1 million young people across the world took action to demand rapid action to tackle the climate crisis.
The movement began when Swedish student Greta Thunberg started a solo school strike in August. The protests have been widely praised, although some have criticised the students for skipping school. On Friday, many UK students will already be on holiday.
“Young people in the UK are sending those in power a clear message: we won’t accept anything less than urgent climate action,” said Anna Taylor, 18, from London and co-founder of the UK Student Climate Network. “Our futures, the health of our environment and the lives of those around the world already suffering the devastation of the climate crisis are not up for debate. We need [leaders] to act to protect people and planet.”
On Wednesday, Green party MP Caroline Lucas challenged Theresa May to join the leaders of all the other major parties who have already agreed to meet Thunberg when she visits the UK on 23 April. Thunberg has already met UN secretary general António Guterres, the pope and addressed the Davos summit.
The prime minister declined to say she would meet Thunberg, saying: “I often hear young people tell of the importance of climate change.” May added: “This government has a fine record on climate change.”
However, a government report published on Thursday showed the UK is now set to miss its 2025 and 2030 emissions targets by an even larger margin than before. “Many policies which will affect the 2020s and beyond have not yet been developed to the point at which they can be included in these projections,” it said.
“With our young people coming out on to the streets in record numbers calling for a structural change to tackle the climate crisis, the public will not forgive failure on this scale,” said Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour’s shadow business secretary.
Concern about climate change is higher than ever amongst UK students – 91% – according to a rolling opinion poll for the National Union of Students, which began in 2014.
In Cambridge, several hundred school children plan to lie on the ground in a “die-in” protest to demand urgent action against climate change. They will wear blue to highlight the impacts of flooding and sea level rise on future generations and on the people of Mozambique and Zimbabwe who were hit by Cyclone Idai in March.
Rowan Williams, former head of the Anglican church and master of Magdalene College at the University of Cambridge, will join the protest. “It’s a great sign of hope that so many of our young people are willing to stand up and be counted. This is their world, and our generation has come close to wrecking it,” he said.
Ella Hone, at Chesterton Community College, said: “This Friday is my 12th birthday, so as a present I would like people to understand how important it is not only to me, but to everyone. Climate change is affecting all life on earth [and] we desperately need to stop it.”
While the once-a-month strikes are expected to be large in the UK, Brazil, India and the Baltic nations on Friday, elsewhere weekly strikes have continued, particularly in Germany and Belgium. Luisa Neubauer, a youth striker from Hamburg, said 20,000 were expected to protest again on Friday.
Neubauer has put the demands for climate action to Germany’s economy environment ministers. “We still don’t see that our government has understood what historical and global responsibility it carries,” she said. “So we really don’t have a choice but to keep going. For us young generations it’s an existential question.”
Around the world, strikes are expected in 500 towns and cities in 70 countries on Friday, according to the Fridays for Future website.
“These striking school children might not be able to vote yet, but they’re certainly changing the face and pace of the debate – this is exactly what we’ve all been waiting for,” said Helen Clarkson, CEO of The Climate Group, which has agreements from 200 multinational companies and 220 state and regional governments to take significant climate action.
“For the last 20 to 30 years, the environmental movement has been waiting for the public to care about climate change,” she said. “[The young people] taking to the streets to protest, are bringing exactly the energy and urgency that is needed to transform the conversation.”
Extinction Rebellion activists have said they will “shut down London” on Monday by blocking roads in the capital, as part of global protests by that movement.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/12/fresh-wave-of-youth-climate-action-protests-expected-across-britain

Thanks for reading and commenting – here’s a summary of the afternoon’s events:
On 22 April, the Guardian is hosting an event with Greta Thunberg and Anna Taylor, from the UK Student Climate Network, with an introduction from Caroline Lucas MP, and chaired by the Guardian’s Zoe Williams.
You can find out more about this event here. 
Most of those who were involved in today’s marches are heading home now. Jake Woodier , from the UK Youth Climate Coalition, said: “It’s been a really fantastic day, with thousands and thousands of students protesting across the country, and continuing to build the movement.”
We will be closing the live blog shortly, so thanks to all those who contributed. 
Organiser Cyrus Jarvis, 16, a year 11 student from London Academy school in Barnet, North London, reflected on the march, saying: 
The police tried to frighten us with arrests but we just moved on. We are really sorry for anyone who did have issues because of us, but unfortunately this is what we have to do to get our point across to the government. If we don’t cause disruption they don’t listen to us and they haven’t listened to us in the past.”
The young are going to save the world. Here's my video on the #ClimateStrike https://t.co/yuXqrt5rPX

Cambridge Schools Eco-Council, the local children’s organisation behind the strikes, said:
We have inherited a system which fuels the climate crisis that is threatening our future. We have done little to contribute to climate change, and yet we are going to suffer the consequences of it. Equally, the poorest children on Earth are nowadays suffering the worst impacts of a climate crisis that has been fuelled by the economy of the richest countries.
This is a climate emergency. Our youth strikes will continue until government takes notice and urgently acts to stop funding, subsidising and promoting fossil fuels, invests in community-owned renewable energy and includes the environmental crisis in our schools curricula. We demand system change, we demand climate justice.”
To keep everyone up to date on what’s been happening on the youth strikes so far today, here’s a summary.

Protesters in London are not just finished with Oxford Street today, but action is set to go on into the evening with a show to raise awareness about the role of fast fashion in climate change.
On Friday, at 6.30pm, the Extinction Rebellion Fashion Action group will put on a catwalk to highlight our fashion consumption habits. The fashion industry is set to consume a quarter of the world’s carbon budget by 2050 in clothing production. 
Models and performers will parade across the crossing outside Oxford Circus station – which will be covered in shocking pink carpet – while wearing pollution masks and carrying bags of single-use plastic to highlight the wasteful and disposable nature of the industry. Ramon Salgado-Touzon, one of the organisers, said:
There are enough clothes already on this planet to dress us all, we need to stop consuming that which we don’t need. We are being manipulated every day into buying more and more, so we want to shift the public consciousness to urge people to realise that we have enough and that this continual consumption is unsustainable and unhealthy. We must heal our minds in order to heal the planet.
People are now dispersing from Trafalgar Square in London, after a morning of marching through the city. Here’s a map of the day’s activities, showing which parts of the UK got involved.
Brilliant day! Huge thanks to all the organisers and volunteers @artecologyltd , Blue Seas Protection, @xriow who made it all happen 🌍 #YouthStrike4Climate pic.twitter.com/r44T7bJznj

Now protesters have made it to Trafalgar Square, and the young people who have gathered are shouting: “Whose planet? Our planet.” People visiting the National gallery are looking on at the action. 
Sakina Sheikh, Lewisham councillor from Labour for a Green New Deal, has just said via a tannoy: “This is what democracy looks like.”
“We demand climate justice now ... It’s everybody’s issues. This is a movement and it has to be led by the people we seek to serve, working class communities, communities of colour.” 
Her words have been met with a massive cheer and applause. 
One student climate change protester was taken into a police van because he refused to move out of the road. 
Oxford Street came to a halt when protesters sat down in the road as part of the Youth Strike 4 Climate campaign. 
But as police officers ushered most away, a defiant group stayed on, to the annoyance of some road users. The Metropolitan police said there had been no arrests.
The group were also questioned by pedestrians, who asked why police should be dedicating resources to a protest when knife crime is continuing across the city.
A mother, who joined her children on the march, said: “It’s a protest, they’re making their point, that’s what this is all about.”

The Greens leader committed to hold Labor to account in the Senate on its pledge to legislate the coalition’s national energy guarantee.
Di Natale said he had reached out to the Labor leader, after the opposition committed to the Neg as a way to end the climate wars.
Asked if he was genuine about cooperation or would stick to pure positions, Di Natale said the ball was in Shorten’s court.
“I have reached out to Bill Shorten. It is up to him to decide whether he wants to continue to ignore the Greens. He does that at his peril,” Di Natale told ABC TV on Sunday.
“At the moment, what he’s doing is adopting a weaker policy on climate than the policy he took in 2016, which is weaker again than the 2013 policy.”
Earlier this week, the Greens MP Adam Bandt wouldn’t say whether the minor party will torpedo Labor’s policy if it is viewed as insufficiently ambitious, as the party did in 2009 when it rejected Kevin Rudd’s carbon pollution reduction scheme.
“The Greens in the Senate will work hard, cooperatively, pushing Labor, holding them to account and making sure we do what needs to be done,” Di Natale said.
The Victorian senator seized on a report in the Age newspaper revealing the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority believes limiting the average global temperature increase to 1.5C or below “is critical to maintain the ecological function of the Great Barrier Reef”.
“We’re on track to exceed that,” Di Natale said. “The scientists are saying that the Great Barrier Reef is gone if we continue to burn coal and ship it off overseas.”
While the major parties have flagged they may pause electioneering over Easter, Di Natale said he’ll be part of an anti-Adani coal mine convoy across the country.
“We won’t be doing anything on Anzac Day. We will be campaigning hard through the Easter period,” Di Natale said.
Di Natale believes the Melbourne blue ribbon Liberal seats of Higgins and Kooyong are “winnable for the Greens”.
“What stronger message can the people of Higgins and Kooyong send to the Liberal party than to elect Greens in those seats and say: ‘We are sick of the climate denialism of the Liberal party’,” he said.
He said bullying problems within the Victorian Greens ranks have been sorted. “We’ve reformed some of our conflict resolution processes, our candidate management processes, and we’re in good shape,” Di Natale said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/apr/14/richard-di-natale-warns-bill-shorten-he-ignores-the-greens-at-his-peril

Did anyone care?,article,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/15/david-buckel-lawyer-climate-change-protest,0,"On a recent Saturday in Brooklyn, against the unlikely backdrop of a huge blue-and-white Ikea outlet, several dozen volunteers hand-churned compost. Decomposing food scraps emit considerable heat, and the 6ft-tall compost heaps were warm to the touch. As shovels and pitchforks pierced the compost, gusts of steam rolled off like fog.
A three-acre lot-turned-urban farm, the Red Hook Community Farms contains the largest compost site in America powered entirely by sustainable sources. During an orientation for new volunteers, one of the site managers explained that the operation was the brainchild of a lawyer-turned-environmentalist named David Buckel, who supervised it until his death last year. He designed the site’s processes so it would run like clockwork, even in his absence.
A woman asked, hesitantly: “Is he the one who … self-immolated?”
“Yes,” the manager said.
He didn’t elaborate but said he considered the site Buckel’s legacy, and that he and the other two managers felt honored to carry on its work.
As the manager talked, a small wind turbine whizzed overhead. Energy from the turbine, plus several solar panels, fed into a generator that pumped air into the compost heaps not being churned by hand. On the other side of the lot grew rows of spinach, kale, tomatoes and other crops, which the farm sells or donates to food pantries.
Terry Kaelber, Buckel’s husband and companion of 34 years, often volunteers at the compost site. When I asked him about the site, he thought carefully, then said: “There is something very simple and pure in coming together, in giving up your time, to take people’s food scraps and do the work that will enable those scraps to be turned back, over time, into food.”
The site was a microcosm, he said, of the kind of self-sustaining, harmonious society Buckel wanted to build – the kind “I think in some ways we all subconsciously long for”.
“I only wish,” he said, “that David had stuck it out.”
Early on the morning of 14 April 2018, Buckel – a 60-year-old retired gay rights attorney – left his cozy, garden-surrounded Brooklyn house and walked to nearby Prospect Park. He made his way to a stretch of grass, where he emailed media outlets a statement decrying humanity’s passivity in the face of pollution and global warming.
A few minutes later, he doused himself in gasoline and set himself on fire.
“Most humans on the planet now breathe air made unhealthy by fossil fuels, and many die early deaths as a result,” his statement said. “[M]y early death by fossil fuel reflects what we are doing to ourselves.”
With characteristic care, he also left a short note at the scene for emergency personnel. “I am David Buckel and I just killed myself by fire as a protest suicide,” he wrote. “I apologize to you for the mess.”
None of Buckel’s family or friends were aware of his intent, and we will never know for certain whether pre-existing mental distress may have contributed to his decision to take his life. But his writing made it clear he viewed his death in political terms and hoped it would galvanize mass action.
His statement referred to the Buddhist monks who have burned themselves to death to protest against the occupation of Tibet. As someone who came of age during the Vietnam war, he was also surely familiar with the iconic photograph of Thich Quang Duc, a Saigon monk who self-immolated to protest against South Vietnamese persecution of Buddhists. He may have also known of Norman Morrison, a Quaker who killed himself in front of the Pentagon to protest against the Vietnam war.
Around the same period, Jan Palach, a university student in Prague, self-immolated in an attempt to rally Czechoslovaks against Soviet occupation. Before he died of his burns, Palach said his target was less the Soviet regime itself than the fatalism and despair he feared had overcome his fellow citizens.
Despite the risk of copycats, most people who have committed political self-immolation have indicated that they hoped to inspire mass mobilization, not further death.
Sometimes mobilization does come: when Mohamed Bouazizi, an impoverished fruit vendor in Tunisia, set himself on fire in 2011 to protest government corruption, it catalyzed a mass protest that toppled the country’s dictatorship and inspired similar movements across the Arab world.
It is difficult to say why some incidents of self-immolation are perceived as mental health tragedies and others as considered political acts; why some became enduring political iconography and others are relegated to obscurity; and why some catalyze change and others don’t.
Buckel had led a distinguished legal career, and worked on famous cases including the Nebraska hate crime that inspired the film Boys Don’t Cry; for that reason, as well as the shocking circumstances of his death, his death received national news coverage. But in a reactive 24-hour news cycle, the story was rapidly buried by the ongoing drama of the Mueller investigation and airstrikes on Syria.
The mass action Buckel had hoped for did not come. There was no Prague spring or Tunisian revolution for the planet. Writing in the New York Times less than a week later, the novelist Nathan Englander asked why Buckel’s death received so little attention compared with the “AR-15-level attention that we give the very worst among us”, mass killers.
The muted response was probably, in part, an understandable reluctance to glorify suicide. A profile of Buckel in the Times, investigating what might have driven a seemingly healthy man to set himself on fire, acknowledged that the question was mostly impossible to answer.
But perhaps there were even more fundamental, unresolvable questions making otherwise sympathetic people uneasy: was Buckel’s death an act of optimism, or surrender? And what is individual responsibility, when confronted by the seemingly insurmountable crisis of a rapidly changing planet?
Buckel grew up in upstate New York, one of five children; his father was an agricultural consultant and his mother a florist. As a child he spent some time working on his relatives’ farm, but he was troubled by the slaughter of animals and later became a pescatarian.
He met Kaelber while living in Rochester, and they later moved to New York, where they eventually settled near Prospect Park. They shared their home with a lesbian couple with whom they were co-raising a college-aged daughter.
Buckel loved the natural world and had a lifelong commitment to environmental issues. His work as a lawyer, however, focused on poverty law and LGBT rights. He spent the bulk of his career at Lambda Legal, an LGBT rights organization based in New York.
In the 1990s, when Buckel joined Lambda, LGBT rights were on shaky and sometimes non-existent legal footing. Homosexuality was banned in the military; some states still enforced sodomy laws; and most LGBT rights organizations were focused on securing basic employment and housing protections for gay people and fighting HIV/Aids discrimination. Marriage was far, far away. The legal arm of the gay rights movement was a long-shot insurgency, and attorneys working on LGBT issues sometimes felt as if they were in a jurisprudential wild west.
“At the time it felt like, ‘There is no law here, there is no opening for this – so we’re just going to make one,’” Beatrice Dohrn, a former Lambda colleague of Buckel’s, told me. “Once gay rights had more legal footing the landscape changed. But at the time we really were kind of outlaws.”
It would be easy, and not totally incorrect, to describe Buckel – fastidious in his habits and devoted to his work – as a strait-laced but formidable lawyer who excelled at working within the system to change it. In one sense, Dohrn said, he was. But that image would obscure his anti-establishment streak. “That suit he always wore?” she said. “That wasn’t David. That was something he forced himself into.”
“David was a funny person with a wry, and sharp, wit,” Suzanne Goldberg, another former Lambda colleague, told me. In a parody of the conventions of legal correspondence, he sometimes signed his documents “DB/afq” – “David Buckel/another fucking queer”.
He never lost sight of the fact that we were representing real people, often with serious difficulties in their lives
But he was also “a careful and deeply committed lawyer”, Goldberg said – a “meticulous” person who brought intense sense of purpose to his work. “He never lost sight of the fact that we were representing real people, often with serious difficulties in their lives as a result of discrimination or harassment.”
Although a private person, he radiated sincere interest in others. When you were in conversation with him, Dohrn said, you felt as if you were “the only person in the room”, so intense was his attention. He would ask question after question about your life and interests, listening carefully to the answers, then asking more. You could talk for ages, and only later realize that you never learned anything about him.
At the time, advocating for LGBT rights meant navigating a legal framework in which anti-gay logics were “baked in”, Dohrn said. Lawyers and activists were sometimes forced to accept homophobic premises in order to achieve tactical wins. “A lot of lawyers would look for loopholes in the law, but we were like, ‘No, I don’t want to win that way.’”
Buckel exemplified the second attitude. He believed in the righteousness of the cause, and seemed buoyed by faith in human nature. His refusal to compromise and his tendency to embrace uphill battles sometimes vexed his more pragmatic colleagues. Evan Wolfson, a former colleague, praised Buckel’s work but said he sometimes tended to “categorical” or “rigid” thinking. He could be “very black-and-white, very un-nuanced in his initial appraisals of things, and because he was also very methodical and very serious, we would have to kind of reel him back in, or open up a gradation, or try to persuade him to see a more flexible alternative”.
His support for pursuing cases in conservative states – Utah, Iowa, Nebraska – considered poor soil for gay rights activism did, however, lead to several landmark victories. And he was also ahead of the curve in embracing issues – such as rights and protections for LGBT youth – regarded at the time as tangential or tactically risky.
At the time, “the right wing was still very fixated on this idea that we – gay people – were trying to indoctrinate young people”, Dohrn said. To avoid encouraging that trope, gay groups tended to steer clear of issues involving youth. Buckel, however, urged Lambda to take more cases defending young people.
They included Nabozny v Podlesny (1996), which determined that schools have a duty to protect students from bullying because of their sexuality; and East High Gay Straight Alliance v Board of Education of Salt Lake City (1999), which overturned the school district’s “unwritten policy” against gay-friendly student groups. He also worked on Dale v Boy Scouts of America (2000), an unsuccessful attempt to force the organization to end its then ban on gay members.
He was also an early advocate for transgender rights, which Wolfson said he views as Buckel’s signature achievement at Lambda.
In 1993, in Nebraska, two men raped Brandon Teena, a 21-year-old trans man. Teena reported the crime to the local sheriff’s department. The sheriff not only failed to take the allegation seriously, but tipped off the rapists, who murdered Teena and two witnesses.
The events inspired a 1998 documentary, The Brandon Teena Story, and the 1999 film Boys Don’t Cry, for which Hilary Swank, portraying Teena, won an Academy award for best actress.
With the support of Lambda and other organizations, Teena’s mother, JoAnn Brandon, sued the sheriff’s office and county government. In 2001, the Nebraska supreme court ruled that the sheriff had violated a duty to protect Teena.
On the Teena case and others, Buckel’s talent for listening was crucial to earning clients’ trust, Dohrn said; his most powerful weapon was often his empathy.
Buckel had always been a conservationist and he had “a revulsion for excess consumption”, Dohrn said. He brought his lunch to work every day in the blue plastic bag in which his morning paper was delivered. When he was looking for a home in Brooklyn, he was determined to find one near a park. He loved gardening and gave plants as gifts.
When he retired from Lambda in 2008, it seemed like a good time to devote himself to the environment. While working on grant applications, he became interested in the Red Hook Community Farms. The lot had a small compost site that he believed was underused. With the aid of a grant from the sanitation department, he began expanding the operation into one that could process several tons of compost a week.
He was determined to run the compost site, now supported by the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and the city government, using only human power and sustainable electricity. At the time it was generally considered difficult, if not impossible, to run a large-scale composting operation without significant help from machines. He threw himself at the challenge of proving that thinking wrong, and succeeded.
“David often said that if he hadn’t become a lawyer he would have become an engineer,” Kaelber said. “He loved puzzles. In this case the puzzle was how to create a community composting site that didn’t have rats and vermin, that didn’t smell, that didn’t have the negative things people associate with composting. He believed it could be done.”
Domingo Morales, now one of the site’s managers, considers Buckel his mentor. “He was the most intelligent person I’ve ever known,” he said. His meticulousness was key to the site’s sustainability and scalability. “Whenever David sent an email to someone it was always a page long. He would answer all these questions that you might have.”
Buckel was always upbeat when talking to volunteers, but privately he expressed more doubt. “He was realistic, in the sense that he knew we were barely scratching the surface,” Morales said.
“There were times we would get into these discussions on the environment,” Morales said, “and they would get very dark. I got the sense from David that he didn’t really blame other people, but that he kind of considered himself to blame. Any environmental injustice, anything going wrong with the world – he didn’t just get mad at other people, he was mad at himself.”
He walked a mile to work every day, to avoid using fossil fuels. He was painstakingly frugal in his habits. He tinkered with the compost processes for ever-greater efficiency. He seemed almost embarrassed of his own life on earth – the space he occupied; the resources he expended – and constantly sought new ways to offset what he viewed as his cost. But it never felt like enough.
“I think some of David’s distress was just all that was going on,” Kaelber said. “The gutting of the [Environmental Protection Agency] since the election of Trump; the complete denial of climate change and the science behind it; the fact that they want to open more and more land to oil and gas drilling, instead of focusing on sustainable solutions.”
During a conversation about two years before he died, Buckel asked Morales what he thought of the self-immolating Tibetan monks. They argued about the ethics of killing oneself as protest. Morales felt it was a foolish method of protest, especially if someone is a parent or spouse with obligations to living people, but Buckel felt it was an honorable act, maybe the most honorable act one can do.
None of his friends or family noticed anything unusual in the days leading up to his death, but Kaelber said he was upset by news that Scott Pruitt, then head of the EPA, was rolling back numerous environmental regulations.
Saturday 14 April was a mild day, good weather for composting, and nothing seemed out of the ordinary. Early in the morning, Morales remembers, “he texted me: ‘Hey, Domingo, I’m going to be out sick today.’ The past couple months he had been training me to run the site without him, but I thought nothing of it. So I said: ‘OK, cool, hope you’re all right, feel better.’ Then a few minutes later he emailed me the letter he sent the news outlets, with an additional note at the top to me. He apologized for leaving the way he did, and leaving me with this responsibility. He told me he was proud of me, personally and successfully, and he ended with a little joke, saying I should hire some temps. He was basically saying ‘the site must go on.’”
Those who knew and loved Buckel wrestle with how to talk about his death. At his memorial service, one of the women with whom he and Kaelber were co-raising their daughter articulated the dilemma: they didn’t want to ignore the deep personal desperation they believe influenced his decision, but they also didn’t want to detract from his dedication to causes that meant a lot to him.
His statement explaining his death is not a tightly argued, lawyerly brief, peppered with dire statistics about global warming; although it mentions pollution, the actual words “climate change” or “global warming” do not appear. The letter often feels more like a statement of frustration with human nature than about climate change, and reading it buttresses the sense, expressed by some who knew him, that he might have been using his political anxieties to rationalize a decision he had already made.
“[My] privilege,” he wrote, is “feeling heavier than responsibility met.”
But his concerns about the planet are clear; and, whether or not one agrees with the decision, so was his explanation for his self-immolation.
“You know, it was a very conscious, deliberate choice he made,” Kaelber told me. “Not that I was aware of it beforehand. But he never did anything that wasn’t deliberate.”
Dohrn, his former colleague, said: “I don’t think we can treat his death like it was a valiant, valid decision unaffected by things that hopefully people will get care for.” But “if his death is going to garner attention outside the immediate circle of people who are grieving – if it is going to have a public component – then I think that public component should reflect the issue he connected his death to”.
During her eulogy, Buckel’s niece, Carrie Bryant, said: “David, I promise you – we promise you – that we will give voice to those who have been silenced; we will give love to those who need it; we will tend to this, our beloved great Earth; and we will honor you,” through “simple, individual acts, as you so courageously did to make this world a more loving and just place”.
She added: “This much we owe to you.”
Buckel hoped his death would catalyze immediate action. It didn’t. By apparent coincidence, however, the anniversary of his death, however, will overlap with what could be the largest-ever direct action over climate change. Extinction Rebellion, an international activist group, is planning a global wave of civil disobedience the week of 14 April.
Extinction Rebellion, and similar groups such as the Sunrise Movement, believe mass civil disobedience is the most effective way to break through passivity and pressure governments to take concrete action on the climate.
As a dry run of sorts, members of Extinction Rebellion were recently arrested in New York for blocking Fifth Avenue. In London, members stripped partly naked in parliament. Eve Mosher, a spokewoman, told me that the group hopes for hundreds of headline-grabbing arrests this month. The climate movement may be gaining momentum after all, even if Buckel didn’t live to see it. Yesterday, at the site where he died, Extinction Rebellion held a “funeral” for the species that have gone extinct because of climate change.
He understood that humans are deeply flawed. I think what drove him was how to inspire people to be their best selves
From everything we understand, climate change is a tragedy of the commons on a vast scale. Addressing it will require human beings do a lot of things they aren’t naturally inclined to do, like make short-term sacrifices for the sake of long-term common good: the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that as early as 2030 the earth may warm 1.5C (2.7F) over pre-industrial levels – and that 1.5C is the highest level the planet can sustain without entering the realm of the catastrophic. Just limiting warming to that level will require, the IPCC said, mobilization of a scale with “no documented historic precedent”.
It’s a sobering thought, and it invites the kind of fatalism that Buckel hoped to fight against.
“I don’t think you can say he was either ‘pessimistic’ or ‘optimistic’” about human nature, Kaelber said. “He was more complicated than that. He understood that humans are deeply flawed. I think what drove him was how to inspire people to be their best selves.”
He added: “If people want to honor David’s life they should look at how they can get involved, politically and in their own personal lives, in combating climate change.” His voice cracked with emotion. “In the thing that David wrote, the most meaningful part, to me, was: in the aggregated acts of millions of individuals, that is how change is going to occur.”
Guests of the memorial service received tree saplings. Perhaps in 10 years, Kaelber told me, he will go visit them all and see what they have become.
Buckel’s friends and family are also building a grove of trees on the space where he died. They have planted some dogwoods, staggered to bloom at different times. Kaelber hopes it will become a gathering place for contemplation, but also a place where people might hold community meetings to organize against global warming.
“He always loved trees,” Kaelber said. He hopes the site will become known as David’s Grove.
Beatrice Dohrn also told me a story about Buckel’s love of plants. “You know, in 1997 I had a breakup that I grieved very hard, and David, as if to cheer me up, gave me a jade plant. I’ve kept it for many, many years, and at some point it almost died,” she said.
“It was down to a stump. But for some reason I didn’t give up on it.”

Parents and their children joined scientists, teachers, long-term environmentalists and other protesters both young and old to occupy major junctions and demand urgent action over the escalating ecological crisis.
The protests are part of a global campaign organised by the British climate group Extinction Rebellion, with demonstrations planned in 80 cities across 33 countries in the coming days.
The group is calling on the UK government to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025 and establish a citizens’ assembly to devise an emergency plan of action to tackle climate breakdown and biodiversity loss.
By mid-afternoon five London landmarks – Waterloo Bridge, Marble Arch, Parliament Square, Oxford Circus and Piccadilly Circus – had been blocked by thousands of protesters.
Organisers said they hoped to hold the first four of those venues round the clock over the coming days with a temporary camp established at Marble Arch, causing widespread disruption in the capital.
However, as darkness fell on Waterloo Bridge on Monday night, police moved in and began to arrest protesters still blocking the crossing. A spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion said there were several hundred people still occupying the bridge, adding that “morale was high” and a cheer went up every time someone was taken away by the police.
The arrests came after the Metropolitan police issued an order under section 14 of the Public Order Act, which allows conditions to be imposed on “public processions” and “public assemblies”. The order restricted the protesters to the area around Marble Arch. A police officer on the bridge said that the Met could impose limits on assembly if they felt there was a serious risk of disruption or to public order. “Obviously, sitting down on Waterloo Bridge is a serious disruption to the community,” he said.
Police mingled more or less freely with the crowd and around several gazebos, potted plants and trees, and a mobile stage that was hosting a choir. “They are taking people incredibly slowly,” said one protest organiser. “It could take all night.”
At about 10pm police became anxious when several dozen more people arrived to reinforce the numbers on the bridge. By midnight there had been around 50 arrests linked to the climate protests. 
Earlier Roger Hallam, one of the movement’s leaders, said nothing like this had been seen on the streets of London for decades. “What’s amazing about this is for 30 years you have just had that closing up of public space – ‘you can’t do this, you can’t do that, you’ve got to finish then’.
Extinction Rebellion is an international protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues. Demonstration have included blocking bridges to traffic in London and a semi-naked protest inside the House of Commons. 
The group says climate breakdown threatens all life on Earth, and so it is rebelling against politicians who 'have failed us', to provoke radical change that will stave off a climate emergency.
“Suddenly what Extinction Rebellion has done is actually say: ‘we are doing this.’ And the state is so weak through austerity that they can’t stop us.”
The campaign cites the civil rights and suffragette movements as inspiration and is backed by hundreds of scientists and academics, including the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams.
Williams, who part in Monday’s protest, said at a meditation the night before that humans had declared war on nature: “We are here tonight to declare that we do not wish to be at war. We wish to make peace with ourselves by making peace with our neighbour Earth and with our God,” he said.
The group wrote to the prime minister, Theresa May, on Monday outlining their demands and asking for talks. In the letter they warned they would escalate their disruptive actions over the coming days and weeks unless the government acts.
“Make no mistake, people are already dying,” the letter said. “In the majority world, indigenous communities are now on the brink of extinction. This crisis is only going to get worse … prime minister, you cannot ignore this crisis any longer. We must act now.”
At Waterloo Bridge before the arrests, protesters blocked the roads and turned the crossing into an impromptu garden bridge, with people bringing trees, flowers and setting up a miniature skate park and stage.
At Oxford Circus thousands of protesters danced to live music at the normally busy junction. A lifesized model of a boat was parked in the middle of the crossing with the slogan Tell the Truth emblazoned on the side. At nearby Piccadilly Circus the youth section of Extinction Rebellion held a sit-down protest, writing messages in chalk on the pavement.
Organisers hope the rebellion will last for several days and say its success depends on the number of people willing to occupy the sites in the days and nights ahead.
Laura Sorensen, a retired teacher who travelled from Somerset to join the protests, was one of thousands who gathered on Waterloo Bridge in the sunshine.
She said: “I am so worried about what’s happening to the planet. We are on a knife-edge now and I felt strongly that I needed to get out and show myself, rather than just talk about it in the pub.”
Sorensen said she had not previously been active in the environment movement but that as a child she had been given a love of nature by her parents. “I see this disaster unfolding all around me … it is terrifying and the government have done nothing despite all the warnings, so we have to act now.”
Trey Taylor, 19, was with two friends in Piccadilly Circus. He said he felt compelled to act when he realised the scale of the emergency.
“We are facing environmental breakdown and nothing remotely proportionate is being done about it … when you look at the facts this is happening now and the government response is utterly woeful.”
In Parliament Square about 2,000 people gathered under a sea of flags, placards and banners. From an octagonal stage erected on the green for speakers, Jamie Kelsey Fry, the contributing editor for New Internationalist magazine, said: “This is not a political movement, this is a movement of humanity. We are all backgrounds, all ages, all races, bound together in one wish, one dream, which is that we will have a good, decent, loving future, for generations to come.”
Five protesters were arrested for suspected criminal damage when they staged a demonstration at Shell’s headquarters. A glass revolving door was shattered and hundreds of passersby watched as two activists climbed above the entrance, writing “Shell knew” and “Shell knows” on the building.
At Marble Arch hundreds of people sat in the sun, listening to bands playing from an open-sided truck.
Simon Bramwell, who was glued to a revolving door at @Shell, said: ""Shell has known about the impact the fossil fuel industry is having on our planet for decades. They've done nothing but deceive, lie and undermine any efforts at transition to renewables."" #extinctionrebellion pic.twitter.com/efAb6QO7C0
Police walked among protesters, many of whom had come with their children, while groups of activists at the periphery blocked the various roads feeding into what is usually one of London’s busiest junctions.
Alex Armitage, an NHS doctor, had been drafted in as a spokesperson for the Marble Arch group. He said he hoped the police could be brought on side. “Eventually if this is going to work, if we are going to have the massive change in the economy that we need to protect ourselves from climate change, we are going to need the police to be unwilling or unable to restore order, and then the government has no option but to negotiate,” he said. “It all seems really grandiose – but so is the scale of the problem facing us.”
A number of major roads in the capital were brought to a standstill with roads gridlocked in surrounding streets. The AA said the disruption had been significant.
Police on Waterloo Bridge said there were no plans to move protesters on for the time being. One officer said: “It’s been very peaceful so far. Everyone has been really pleasant. The only grief we’ve had is from passing motorists shouting at them to ‘get a job’ – that’s about as exciting as it’s got.”
The events in London were the biggest demonstrations but there were smaller protests in other cities around the world.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/15/thousands-expected-in-london-for-extinction-rebellion-protest

In an article published in the Guardian on Wednesday aimed at the international financial community, Mark Carney, the Bank’s governor, and François Villeroy de Galhau, the governor of the Banque de France, said financial regulators, banks and insurers around the world had to “raise the bar” to avoid catastrophe.
They said: “As financial policymakers and prudential supervisors we cannot ignore the obvious physical risks before our eyes. Climate change is a global problem, which requires global solutions, in which the whole financial sector has a central role to play.”
The warning comes as concern over the impact of climate change and the lack of urgent action is increasing, reflected in the Extinction Rebellion protests and schoolchildren’s strikes across the world.
The heads of two of the world’s most influential central banks urged other financial regulators around the world to carry out climate change stress tests to spot any risks in the system, while also calling for more collaboration between nations on the issue. They warned that a “massive reallocation of capital” was necessary to prevent global warming above the 2°C maximum target set by the Paris climate agreement, with the banking system required to play a pivotal role.
“If some companies and industries fail to adjust to this new world, they will fail to exist,” Carney and De Galhau said.
Climate change poses significant risks to banks and insurers from rising instances of catastrophic weather-related events, such as heatwaves, droughts and floods, which could land them with significant losses.
There are also risks for financial firms as governments accept the need to tackle climate change because banks that have lent to companies reliant on burning fossil fuels run the risk of steep financial losses.
Carney has previously warned that plunging sales of diesel cars, due to new vehicle emissions tests and changes in the tax system, which have had knock-on effects for manufacturers and the wider economy, are an example of this in action.
Banks could find they have stranded assets that turn out to be worthless if they are reliant on burning fossil fuels. Threadneedle Street has said as much as $20tn (£15.3tn) of assets could be wiped out by climate change if it is not effectively addressed.
The open letter from Carney and De Galhau accompanies the launch of a report from the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), an international group of central banks and financial regulators, outlining the steps necessary for financiers to tackle climate change.
Global warming has typically been of secondary concern to central bankers since the 2008 financial crisis, as they grappled with the immediate threat of banking failures. However, there is growing recognition that action is needed to fight the risks it poses.
Although they have received praise for advancing the debate about climate change, Carney, central bankers and financiers have been criticised for expecting the banking industry to reform itself without tougher regulation being introduced.
Frank van Lerven, a senior economist at the New Economics Foundation thinktank, said: “Central banks across the world, and in the UK, have done a very good job of identifying the problem. The question is whether they have the right balance between being thought leaders on this issue and identifying problems and taking action.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/17/mark-carney-tells-global-banks-they-cannot-ignore-climate-change-dangers

“The science is clear – Canada’s climate is warming more rapidly than the global average, and this level of warming effectively cannot be changed,” Nancy Hamzawi, assistant deputy minister for science and technology at Environment and Climate Change Canada, told reporters on Monday.
The report, released late on Monday by Environment and Climate Change Canada, paints a grim picture of Canada’s future, in which deadly heatwaves and heavy rainstorms become a common occurrence. Forty-three government scientists and academics authored the peer-reviewed report.
While global temperatures have increased 0.8C since 1948, Canada has seen an increase of 1.7C – more than double the global average.
And in the Arctic, the warming is happening at a much faster rate of 2.3C, the report says.
While the increased warming in the Arctic is not yet fully understood, snow and ice play a critical role in reflecting the sun’s radiation and heat. But scientists say the retreat of glaciers and disappearing sea ice both contribute to a feedback loop of warming, which is one of the factors contributing to Canada’s disproportionate temperature increase.
The report suggests the majority of warming felt in Canada and around the globe is the result of burning fossil fuels.
Canada has already pledged to cut emissions by 200m tonnes by 2030 – a cornerstone of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s national climate strategy – largely through a federally mandated carbon tax and shuttering coal-fired plants.
Despite the urgency of the report, Canada remains mired in a political battle over climate policy.
Trudeau has pushed for a national carbon pricing strategy, and on Monday the federal government imposed the tax on four provinces that refuse to implement one. Conservative politicians have pledged to remove the tax if they win this fall’s general election, arguing that it is too much of a burden for Canadians.
But under the current plan, households will receive rebate cheques from the federal government to offset any added expenses from the tax – meaning costs to the average consumer are negligible.
The report makes clear that Canada faces markedly different outcomes, depending on the policies it chooses to reduce emissions.
Under a scenario in which global emissions are dramatically reduced, average temperatures will rise only 3C across the country by 2100, including the Arctic region.
But if countries – including Canada – fail to act aggressively, increases of 7-9 degrees are likely, and the Arctic faces the prospect of 11 degrees of warming.
Under the report’s worst-case scenario, the risk of deadly heatwaves increases tenfold bring with it droughts and forest fires. Western Canada has already grappled with two years of record forest fire seasons. The risk of major rain events also doubles, meaning cities will be inundated with catastrophic urban flooding.
Access to critical sources of fresh water will also be constrained, due in large part to reduced winter snowfall, which in turn becomes a source of clean water when the snowpack melts.
Many of the previously documented effects – melting permafrost, disappearing sea ice and glacial retreat – are only set to intensify in the coming years.
“We are already seeing the effects of widespread warming in Canada,” said Elizabeth Bush, a climate science adviser at Environment Canada, told reporters. “It’s clear, the science supports the fact that adapting to climate change is an imperative. Urgent action is needed to reduce emissions.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/02/canada-climate-change-warming-twice-as-fast-report

MPs attempted to continue the debate during the peaceful protest by 11 activists from Extinction Rebellion, though several made coded mentions to the protest in their speeches.
Protesters had slogans daubed on their chests, including “for all life” and “SOS” and two more wore grey body paint and elephant masks, which the group said referred to climate change as “the elephant in the room”.
Police cleared the public gallery in the House of Commons and then removed the protesters individually, some of whom were carried out by officers.
The police later said 12 people had been arrested “for outraging public decency”.
The protest began during a speech by the Labour MP Peter Kyle, who was arguing in favour of his motion to add a confirmatory Brexit referendum.
The Tory MP Justine Greening congratulated Kyle for “fleshing out his arguments very well indeed” and Kyle in turn thanked the Conservative MP Steve Brine for a “cheeky intervention”.
The Conservative Nick Boles congratulated Kyle for delivering his speech “with a certain amount of distraction” and quipped that many of his Tory colleagues appeared to be missing from the benches around him including “a noted naturist”.
Boles was referring to the Brexiter MP Bernard Jenkin – who enjoys nudism as a private hobby.
In a point of order, the Conservative MP Nigel Evans said the House of Commons had dealt well with “a distraction, not a disruption to our proceedings” and thanked thanked police and Commons officials.
The Speaker, John Bercow, also thanked officials after the protesters were removed. “We just press on with the debate, that is what we are here to do,” he said, to cheers in the chamber.
In a statement after the protest, one of the activists, Mark Ovland, said climate change was being “flagrantly and recklessly ignored by our government and media” and the group wanted to draw attention to the crisis during the debate on Brexit.
“By undressing in parliament, we are putting ourselves in an incredibly vulnerable position, highlighting the vulnerability that all of us share in the face of environmental and societal breakdown,” he said.
Another of the activists, Iggy Fox, said: “I’m tired of the time and resources our government wastes rearranging the deckchairs on the Brexitanic. It’s high time politicians stop beating around the bush and tackle the environmental crisis head on, like they should have done years ago.

Rumours abounded that they had done so by the buttocks, but in fact it was just their hands. Still, it sounds a bit like that description of resentment: it’s like taking poison and waiting for the other person to die. Whoever it was that ended up getting sprayed with WD40 and taken away by the police, it wasn’t Michael Gove. This manner of nude protest has a fine pedigree, on the following issues.
The naked bike ride is a worldwide movement, in which clothing is optional. If you have seen it, you will remember it from the double-take: “Wait, was that person naked?” that happens when naked people are fast-moving. Its mission statement had the original aim to “protest oil dependency and celebrate the power and individuality of our bodies” – a slightly woolly purpose that makes me think that some people just really like being naked on a bike.
The Ukrainian protest group Femen made history – and international front pages – protesting against sex tourism, marriage agencies, sexism generally and – by 2012 at Davos – capitalism. I always smelled a rat because they looked so great; true protest would be stripping naked when you look like a mattress stuffed with socks. But maybe that’s a really sexist thing to say. Am I part of the problem?
The economist Victoria Bateman started on a different wicket, trying to “punch feminism into economics” by stripping down to her gloves in the middle of a conference. She then shifted on to Brexit and Rachel Johnson followed suit. “I thought it would make a cheeky nib in the Sun,” Johnson tells me. “‘Boris’s sister flashes baps’. I wasn’t even naked! I was wearing a flesh-coloured basque. It was horrific. Overnight, I turned into La CicciolinaThe whole world thinks I got my tits out against Brexit. And I would, if I thought it would help, but I didn’t.”

Not the classic nude protest, but an early example of the anarchic spirit: the Freedomites were Russian emigres who arrived in Canada at the turn of the 19th century hoping to escape religious persecution and soon had a beef with the Canadian government. They also used arson to protest against materialism, which is arguably the most succinct protest of all.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2019/apr/02/activism-laid-bare-a-quick-history-of-naked-protests

The decision, revealed in Tuesday’s budget, effectively cuts the amount spent per year from $200m to $133m over the life of the fund, which pays polluters to implement greenhouse gas abatement projects.
Labor’s climate spokesman, Mark Butler, has accused Scott Morrison of already cutting the “main policy to deliver his weak 2030 pollution reduction targets”, while the Greens attacked the Coalition for spending just $189m over the first four years.
The $2bn relaunch of the Abbott-era emissions reduction fund was part of the Morrison government’s effort to bolster its environmental credentials in the face of rising community concern about the impact of climate change and challenges from independent candidates targeting the Liberal party on its climate record.
In February the prime minister’s office briefed journalists, including Guardian Australia, that $2bn would be invested over 10 years in the climate fund to build on the ERF’s record of reducing emissions by 193m tonnes.
On 25 February Scott Morrison told Sky News the Emissions Reduction Fund was a $2bn investment “over the next 10 years”, a comment he repeated in a speech the f0llowing day.
But in the budget papers released on Tuesday, the climate solutions fund is allocated $2bn over 15 years from 2019-20, including $189m over four years.
Butler said: “This was the policy that was meant to do the heavy lifting to deliver the government’s 2030 emission reduction targets, even though government data projects Australia will fail to meet even this government’s weak emission reduction targets.
“This is a budget from a government that has given up governing, and never tried to deliver real climate action.”
A spokesman for environment minister, Melissa Price, accounted for the discrepancy by explaining that auctions to deliver abatement will be conducted over a 10-year period but confirming the money will be spent over 15.
“The fund will deliver an additional 103m tonnes of abatement to 2030,” he said.
“There is scope to contract additional abatement between 2031 and 2035, or bring this funding forward to provide additional abatement in the period 2021 and 2030, depending on market conditions.”
The Greens climate spokesman, Adam Bandt, said the government planned to spend just $189m over four years on “its signature climate ‘policy’”, noting “there’s more new money for the Cairns ring road than for climate change” in the 2019 budget.
$189m.That’s all the gov is spending on its signature climate ‘policy’ over the Budget period.There’s more new money for the Cairns Ring Road than for climate change.Turf this mob out.#Budget2019 #Greens
Labor’s climate policy is to reduce emissions in the electricity sector by 45% by 2030.
On Monday Labor added a target for the rollout of electric vehicles, the promise to introduce vehicle emissions standards and to beef up the safeguard mechanism to impose new pollution reduction requirements for the aviation sector, cement, steel and aluminium, mining and gas, direct combustion and the non-electricity energy sectors.
The budget showed that the balance of the Coalition’s $3.5bn climate solutions package includes:
Up to $1.38bn in equity over six years for the Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro project and $5.5m for oversight of that project
$61.2m for the energy efficient communities program
$56m for a feasibility study for the second inter-connector between Tasmania and the mainland
$18m on energy efficiency; and
$400,000 to develop a national electric vehicle strategy
An investigation by Guardian Australia last year found it was often difficult to determine if the emissions reduction fund was offering value for money.
Malcolm Turnbull, who once branded the approach “a recipe for fiscal recklessness on a grand scale”, let the ERF dwindle to almost nothing as he pursued policy alternatives, including the national energy guarantee resisted by conservatives and dumped by Morrison shortly after he took the Liberal leadership last year.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/02/coalition-climate-solutions-fund-must-last-further-five-years

Neither is being addressed with the urgency needed to prevent our life-support systems from spiralling into collapse. We are writing to champion a thrilling but neglected approach to averting climate chaos while defending the living world: natural climate solutions. This means drawing carbon dioxide out of the air by protecting and restoring ecosystems.
By defending, restoring and re-establishing forests, peatlands, mangroves, salt marshes, natural seabeds and other crucial ecosystems, large amounts of carbon can be removed from the air and stored. At the same time, the protection and restoration of these ecosystems can help minimise a sixth great extinction, while enhancing local people’s resilience against climate disaster. Defending the living world and defending the climate are, in many cases, one and the same. This potential has so far been largely overlooked.
We call on governments to support natural climate solutions with an urgent programme of research, funding and political commitment. It is essential that they work with the guidance and free, prior and informed consent of indigenous people and other local communities.
This approach should not be used as a substitute for the rapid and comprehensive decarbonisation of industrial economies. A committed and well-funded programme to address all the causes of climate chaos, including natural climate solutions, could help us hold the heating of the planet below 1.5C. We ask that they are deployed with the urgency these crises demand.

Edinburgh Science said on Wednesday it realised its commitment to educating people on climate change was substantially compromised by accepting money from fossil fuel companies.
The charity said the oil industry “is not moving fast enough” to cut greenhouse gas emissions, adding that “climate change is without doubt an urgent threat of unprecedented magnitude”.
Edinburgh Science has taken money from Total and Exxon to pay for its “Generation Science” tours of Scottish schools, promoting science as a career in classrooms, as well as from Shell and the Scottish Oil Club.
Climate activists had warned Edinburgh Science it faced protests during this year’s festival, which starts this weekend. Protesters believe the festival does not do enough to educate visitors about the threats posed by climate change.
The Scottish Oil Club was targeted by Extinction Rebellion activists last month when it held its annual dinner at the National Museum of Scotland, leading to 14 activists being charged. The Edinburgh international festival dropped BP as a sponsor in 2017.
One science festival event for families this year involves teaching children how to find and drill for oil, inviting participants to construct a scale-model drilling rig. In contrast, this year’s Edinburgh medal for scientific achievement is being awarded as part of the festival to Christiana Figueres, the executive secretary of the UN framework convention on climate change.
Edinburgh Science said: “With the issues of climate change ever present and urgent, we feel increasingly compromised by the conflict between accepting sponsorship from fossil fuel companies and programming events that scrutinise the main causes of climate change.
“The UN intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) calls for a dramatic and immediate reduction in the amount of fossil fuels consumed if we are to keep global warming to no more than 1.5C.
“Whilst we see change happening in the oil and gas sector and appreciate that the demands on them are complex, we are of the view that the sector is not moving fast enough to meet the IPCC targets and that there is a conflict between their behaviour and the underlying science.”
Tara Wight, a spokeswoman for the campaign group Science Unstained, said the charity’s decision was welcome. “By being associated with science outreach events, fossil fuel companies aim to clean up their image and present themselves as responsible organisations that are in alignment with scientific consensus on climate change.
“Sponsoring educational and cultural organisations is a cheap and effective means of improving their public image while continuing to destroy the earth.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/03/edinburgh-science-festival-charity-bans-fossil-fuel-sponsorship

On Monday, the night that parliament was supposed to “take back control”, protest group Extinction Rebellion got into the gallery, took their kit off and tried to stick a variety of body parts to the glass, turning the House of Commons into some kind of X-rated human zoo.
It seemed weird but by the time Tuesday came around we were all looking back on it as a rare moment of sanity. For one thing, it was just nice to see people who had made a decision. It wasn’t the best decision – they were going to glue their hands to some glass and wriggle their bums around for a bit – but at least something got decided in parliament.
Because what happened next was that MPs, who had just taken control from a government who kept bringing back the same deal over and over again, decided to reject every available option they had created for themselves for the second time in a row.
You can only imagine how the evening went down in EU capitals.
“All right, 1,011 days since the referendum, 11 left to go. Let’s take a look at what the UK is doing … oh you’re taking the piss!”
“What’s wrong, Angela?”
“They’re having a wee initial think about what kind of Brexit they actually want to happen.”
“Are you sure they aren’t making final preparations?”
“NO, THEY’RE BRAINSTORMING!”
“OK, but how are they getting on? Are they at least nearly there, Angela?”
“No. And I don’t know how to tell you this, but they’ve hired strippers.”
With all other options having been rejected, Theresa May sat down to reject the final option of having a general election. In a seven-hour cabinet meeting, she and her colleagues argued furiously about what the hell to do next, probably setting aside at least two hours to talk about what a baller move it was of David Cameron to call the referendum to solve divisions within the Tory party.
At the end of it, May gave her inevitable press statement (they may as well strap a lectern to her tummy at this point) and announced her genius solution: do the same thing that had just failed 24 hours before on Bum Day.
May’s game-changing suggestion was to try to agree an approach with Jeremy Corbyn, and if that didn’t work then a range of options for the future relationship would be put to the Commons in a series of votes. To be fair to May, it was extremely on brand for her to go down a route that had already failed repeatedly.
The government, which spent almost three years fighting itself before it even considered compromising with a party it actively despises, now wants to get this sorted by the end of the week. In 2016 this offer would have been sensible. Now, with a week to go, it looks like the prime minister, having started a fire and fanned the flames, is asking Labour to stand there holding a can of petrol with her and act a bit shifty till the police arrive.
There’s another problem. Anything Labour agrees, it will have to trust May’s successor to carry out. A few weeks ago it looked like May would cling to the doorframe of No 10 until humans died off and she was governing over a mutated breed of cockroaches who also didn’t like her that much. But she’s now promised to resign, meaning whoever replaces her will have to carry out what she agrees.
And that’s, to put it mildly, bad, as Boris Johnson is trying to make himself look electable again. Late on Tuesday, irony died as the cauliflower told the BBC that people want politicians in Westminster “not to focus on themselves, but to focus on the needs of the country”. This from a man who hired a photographer to photograph his own resignation in protest against a deal he would go on to endorse in return for the prime minister quitting to make way for him.
Now with Brexiteers already quitting or threatening to strike, the DUP livid, the EU sceptical that the plan will work, maybe even to the point that it won’t grant an extension, the chaos really begins. And it’s going to make bum glue-apalooza look like a regular Monday.

In an interview with Guardian Australia’s political podcast, Butler says Labor’s commitment to reduce emissions by 45% on 2005 levels by 2030 is a “rock solid commitment”, not an “aspiration” or “something that would be nice to achieve” – and he says voters are more agitated now about climate action than he has ever seen during his time as an MP .
Butler says the Morrison government is lining up to deploy “tired old scare campaigns” about carbon taxes in the coming campaign – with Scott Morrison this week characterising the measures this week as a “Borat tax” – “but what I see as I get around the country after a very angry summer … the hottest summer we have ever had … is Australians are sick of it”.
He argues voters are in a mood to punish the Coalition if the government defaults to wrecking and hyperbole over the coming weeks. “The consciousness, the level of expectation for this building, for the Australian parliament to do better on climate change is greater than I’ve ever seen – I think it’s greater than it was in 2007.
“People are increasingly seeing the impacts of climate change, they are seeing the urgent clear advice from scientists that this is a climate emergency.
“We have to stop having these petty political fights. We need to stop responding to Tony Abbott’s playbook and actually start putting some serious policy in place.”
Butler indicated Labor would pursue as much of the policy, outlined this week, as it could without triggering “a drawn out legislative battle” – meaning by regulation, and by working within existing mechanisms – and he predicts the Greens will be punished by their supporters if they refuse to support Labor’s climate policy on the basis of insufficient ambition.
The Greens outlined its own climate policy before Labor to define some of the boundaries of policy ambition post-election, and have already signalled they could torpedo one element of Labor’s climate plan – allowing heavy polluters to use international permits to meet their emissions reduction targets.
Butler says that is a backflip on the position the Greens took during the implementation of the carbon price in the 43rd parliament. “They supported [the use of permits] when we were last in government, it was a central feature of the clean energy package they signed up to … but now, apparently, that’s an abomination.
“I think there is a lot of politics going on.”
He said if the Liberals lost the coming federal election, and Abbott lost his seat, that could create the conditions for the Liberal party to come back to the table on climate change, and he predicted if the Greens shot down the policy on the basis it wasn’t perfect, “that would be an extraordinary decision, frankly, for the Greens to take”.
Butler said the Greens voting with Abbott against Labor’s first climate policy mechanism during the last period in government was one of the factors in shattering the political consensus at the federal level which has prevented policy action for the best part of a decade.
The shadow climate change minister says Australia has now lost five years, with emissions rising when they should have been falling. “If Labor is elected at the next election, I think the gravity of responsibility of the next parliament to do something here should not be under-estimated.
“If the next Labor government is not allowed to make serious changes in this area, I hate to think where Australia is going to be in 2030.
“I hate to think of the scale of betrayal to our children and grandchildren if, for politics, our government, if we are elected at the next election, is prevented from implementing this policy.”
Labor’s policy involves boosting the existing safeguards mechanism to impose more stringent pollution reduction standards on heavy emitters, and imposing a new pollution regulation on car retailers “in line with” 105g CO2/km for light vehicles, which will drive the uptake of electric vehicles.
The specific timeframes for implementation are not clear in the policy document released this week, and Labor has refused to release a carbon budget making transparent the specific levels of emissions reduction it is factoring in in each sector of the economy.
Butler acknowledges that Labor will face lobbying from politically influential stakeholders on its climate commitments if it wins the coming election, but he insists the changes will be implemented, pushback or no pushback.
He says a key difference between now and when Labor was last in government is a substantial shift from investors, regulators and lenders to a world where carbon emissions are now considered “a key investment risk”.
“Emissions reduction is now no longer an option. Emissions reduction is now a must do for emissions intensive businesses.”
Butler says he would like to remain in the climate portfolio in the event of an election win, but adds whether he does is a matter for Shorten – and he repeated his personal opposition to the controversial Queensland Adani coal mine. “I don’t think there’s a case for opening up a new thermal coal mine.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/apr/06/parliament-must-back-labors-climate-policy-if-party-wins-power-mark-butler-says

It is also true that women dominate 'sustainable farming' (however defined) in many locations because of the concerns they carry - in their identities as women -about human-nature interactions and the implications of hard science approaches to farming. I was in Myanmar recently and spoke to a male 'big buyer' of agricultural produce and he said that over-application of pesticides was creating bio-diversity collapse which was leading to farmers applying yet more pesticides as insect outbreaks are getting uncontrollable. Many farmers cannot manage the expense of non-sustainable farming and are getting out - some to live on the very margins of society where they are forced to consume wild foods (plants, animals, insects) and so the negative feedback goes on endlessy.
I believe the 'feminine principle' is a 'mental construct' much as many other things we humans do - hard science included - but the feminine principle in farming promotes ecological interactions and is therefore the only way forward, really.

But it don’t matter that “it ain’t science”. What matters is how we view things, practically. Many men have adopted the utilitarian, reductionist approach because that’s how society forms them.

Even so it's always worth allowing oneself to actually read and carefully consider in a deep way arguments and experiences which differ greatly from our own.
I was talking to women farmers in a remote community in Bangladesh very recently and they very much believed that women had a strong affinity with nature and could work with 'her' (men can't, they said - all men care about is maximising yield at the expense of a more intuitive way of farming). They also said - and every woman farmer I've met in East and southern Africa says the same - that woman are far closer to livestock and understand what they want. For me, that's gender.

It pointed to how closeness to nature has been devalued within patriarchal social systems, both generally and in relation to specific biological processes such as child bearing and menstruation, which are definitely specific to women. 
It is evident from the defensive comments of some commenters here that a connection with nature is not exclusive to women (thankfully!). However the article shows that the association of nature and qualities such as connectedness, feeling, co-operation and non-linear consciousness with the feminine need not be an oppressive one (especially if we recognise that the feminine exists in both women and men), but can be embraced and celebrated by women, as it can for men who value these qualities.
Scientific thinking from the Enlightenment onwards tended to a) value controlling nature and keeping it at a distance via use of the intellect, b) propose the existence of one true view of reality that made all other views 'wrong', and could be found through experimentation, reason and logic, and c) regard nature as having no inherent worth beyond its utilitarian value to humans, trees as lumber, animals as meat and minerals as means to economic power. This ideological position co-evolved with a privileging of men and masculinity, which was seen to be associated with the superior traits of reason, logic, detachment and control over emotions. All of the qualities mentioned helped to achieve significant technological and scientific breakthroughs, however their one-sidedness has also put our ongoing survival at grave risk. 
What values can help to counteract this and heal our sick planet? More techno-fixes, conqueror-mentality solutions for controlling nature better? No: fundamentally, we need to value our connectedness to nature, the joy we feel in the garden or the forest, the grief we feel in a clearfelled logging coupe or a river full of dead fish. We need to respect all life based on this connection, at the same time recognising that we are part of an ecosystem and cannot survive alone. Then we need to reshape societies and economies around co-operation and sustainability, turning the focus of our drive for betterment towards systems and processes that sustain life and health, rather than building empires for the few.', u'recommendation_count': u'9', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1554807027000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'13834978', u'id': u'127888673', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Bearmuchly', u'text': u'Thank you for illustrating my point.

Adaptation of food crops will be through crop development - conventional breeding, hybridisation, biotechnology and so on.

A population of a few million human hunter-gatherers was apparently beyond the carrying capacity of the planet as most places where we showed up the megafauna disappeared.
Around 10-12,000 years ago, when large climate oscillations settled down, we developed agriculture which allowed us to double our population many times into the billions.
But agriculture faces big challenges if we don’t change our ways soon (1), as do our fisheries, and if they both decline significantly, forcing us back to being largely hunter-gatherers, history tells us that out of every 1,000 people you see maybe one survives.
Except this time it won’t be meat on the hoof with mastodons, large flightless birds and picking lobsters off the beach. No, going back to trying to hunt and gather during the 6th mass extinction isn’t the best timing so one in a thousand is likely wildly optimistic.

It’s a cliche but it’s literally what I’m doing. I spend my weekends transforming the tired old lawn into garden beds, layering woodchips, straw and horse shit I’ve shovelled from the paddocks next door into rich soil to grow my lettuces and kale. I have always loved gardening but now, more than ever, working with the earth has taken on an element of the spiritual.
As a teenager, like many suburban white girls, I got way into Wicca, that gentle, nature-centred neo-pagan religion beloved by would-be witches everywhere. Much later, in my early 20s, I revisited witchcraft, finding an unstructured feminine spirituality that helped me make sense of the world.
Like many other young women I loved the playfulness of astrology and the tarot, but what always appealed to me most was the sense of communion with the natural world. Now, at a point of genuine global climate crisis, I am beginning to see how valuable fostering that connection can be.
Women have long been associated with nature, usually to our detriment. An enduring, exasperating thorn in the side of feminism has been the persistent belief that women are inherently closer to the physical world, and to our animal bodies, than men, disqualifying us from our right to intellectual or cultural pursuits beyond the home.
Simone de Beauvoir wrote about it when she described woman as being “more enslaved to the species than the male” thanks to the embodied reality of human reproduction; the anthropologist Sherry B Ortner wrote in 1974 that associating women with nature handily allows us to subjugate half of the world’s population, while asserting confidently that it is simply the natural way of things.
It’s all rubbish, of course; as Ortner put it, all humans have a physical body and a sense of nonphysical mind. And, certainly, we can’t be bound to either by something as ephemeral as gender.
But I think this correlation of women to nature, which has been oppressive and restrictive for so long, can now be a source of power and unity for women who are concerned – as we all should be – about the future of our natural environment.
My favourite way to think of the witch is as a woman drawing strength from what ought to subdue her. When you think of it this way, a whole coven of earth witches emerges among the women of Australian agriculture. Much of what we associate with the figure of the witch concerns women’s knowledge of the natural world: plants for eating and healing, solstices for planting and harvesting, cycles of the world by which to set the cycles of the home.
When I part the mulch to plant seedlings, or when I forage blackberries and wild brassica while I’m walking the dog, I feel a sense of connection to all the planting, farming and foraging women who’ve come before me.
And though many of the farmers I’ve spoken to would probably balk at the idea of identifying as a witch, the term taps into a long lineage of women’s knowledge about the earth. Women in agriculture seem the most logical inheritors.
Regenerative agriculture is a radical new approach that privileges soil health and holistic farming. In Australia many more women are involved in regenerative agricultural practices than are in traditional agriculture, which remains male-dominated.
It can be tempting to attribute this unquestioningly to the notion that women are somehow inherently more in tune with nature but that’s neither accurate nor useful. The reality is that many farming women inordinately take on the role of childcare and food preparation – and this is what makes them experts in their field. They see the connections between earth and food and human health. Living those connections feels like the most conscious, everyday kind of witchcraft.
It’s easy to dismiss this kind of thinking as kumbaya nonsense but that’s partly because the impulse is so ingrained in us to devalue anything associated with the feminine – in this case, something as objectively neutral and undeniably necessary as the Earth on which we stand.
For a long time, just as we have associated women with nature, we have coded nature as feminine and, as we do with all other things coded feminine, we have degraded, exploited and subjugated it.
But taking up the position of the witch – someone who values the feminine, and defiantly claims the knowledge and power of the bodily and natural – shows how to completely reimagine our relationship with the Earth and, hopefully, to change the future of all who live on it for the better.

“Toyota Australia were not consulted on the use of the HiLux in government materials.”
The ads – which appeared on Monday – use Facebook ad functionality to target users with an interest in particular vehicle types to make the false claim about Labor’s policy, which includes vehicle emissions standards and a target of 50% of new car sales being electric vehicles by 2030.
The Japanese carmaker also said it was on track with global plans to electrify the entire vehicle line up by 2025. 
The Coalition is stepping up its attack despite the fact the treasurer and former environment minister Josh Frydenberg has spruiked electric vehicles on the basis they will save drivers money and that vehicle emissions standards are still part of the government’s plan to reduce emissions.
The ads, posted by the Liberal party’s official account, state that “Labor’s car tax would mean higher prices on some of Australia’s most popular cars” and encourage users to “sign up to stop Labor’s car tax”.
Labor’s electric vehicle policy, released earlier in April, includes only one tax-related measure – a deduction of 20% depreciation for businesses which buy electric vehicles worth more than $20,000.
The imposition of an emissions standard of 105g CO2/km for light vehicles is not a tax because it does not raise any revenue for the government.
In fact, the uptake of electric vehicles is estimated to cost the budget more than $1bn a year by 2030 in lost fuel excise, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.
The Facebook ads target users who have indicate their interest in popular car brands including Holdens, Ford Rangers, Toyota Hiluxes and Mitsubishi Tritons.
Libs are now running targeted FB ads against specific car types - which are all available ""interest"" categories for FB ads (I just checked and you can target australians in specific age ranges interested in mitsubishi tritons if you want) pic.twitter.com/p395Ftf8Ti
The ads do not contain detailed authorisations, although the Australian Electoral Commission has told Guardian Australia that ads meet their standards if details are posted in the “about” section of the posting page.
Other ads on the Liberal party Facebook page suggest that emissions standards “will add up to $4,863 to the cost of a new car”, citing a 2016 report by the Centre for International Economics.
An infrastructure department report published in December 2016 estimated that a 105g CO2/km emissions standard phased in from 2020 to 2025 will save $27.5bn in fuel costs and achieve $2.7bn worth of greenhouse gas abatement, for a total $30.1bn saving. It estimated a total cost of $16.2bn to achieve the standard, for a total net benefit of $13.9bn.
As recently as August 2017 Frydenberg said vehicle efficiency standards were about “reducing fuel costs and carbon emissions at the same time”.
“In Australia in 2016 the average amount of CO2 emitted per kilometre was 182 grams, while the EU is moving to 100g/km by 2021, and in the US the target is 105g/km by 2025,” he said.
Frydenberg said if Australia had fuel efficiency standards in line with comparable nations, “estimates of the fuel saving per passenger vehicle could be above $500 per year, or nearly $28bn in total by 2040”.
“Given the long distances travelled in regional Australia, the savings could be even greater for people living outside the main cities.”
The environment department website states the the emissions reduction fund – the centrepiece of the Coalition’s climate change policy – will provide “support for the uptake of renewable energy and energy efficiency [and] vehicle emission standards”.
On Sunday Scott Morrison accused Shorten of wanting to “end the weekend” because the electric vehicles would hurt “Australians who love being out there in their four-wheel drives”.
The Coalition was elected under Tony Abbott in 2013 with a fierce campaign against the Labor government’s price on carbon, which it labelled a carbon tax.
In 2017 Abbott’s former chief of staff, Peta Credlin, admitted “it wasn’t a carbon tax … it was many other things in nomenclature terms but we made it a carbon tax”.
“We made it a fight about the hip pocket and not about the environment,” she told Sky News. “That was brutal retail politics and it took Abbott about six months to cut through and when he cut through, Gillard was gone.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/apr/10/liberal-party-facebook-ads-falsely-claim-labor-wants-to-tax-cars

Speaking at the spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund in Washington DC, the broadcaster and environmentalist said that on current trends parts of the world would soon become uninhabitable and populations would be be forced to move.
Attenborough, 92, said it was vital that countries met their commitments made in the 2015 Paris climate agreement to reduce carbon emissions because time was fast running out for the planet.
Asked by the IMF managing director, Christine Lagarde, whether there was a link between migration and climate change, Attenborough said: “It is happening in Europe. People are coming from Africa because they can’t live where they are.”
He said migration pressures would become more acute as temperatures continued to rise because more parts of the world would become uninhabitable. 
Attenborough, who was publicising the Netflix series Our Planet, said: “I find it hard to exaggerate the peril. This is the new extinction and we are half way through it. We are in terrible, terrible trouble and the longer we wait to do something about it the worse it is going to get.”
Noting that “70% of bird species have gone”, he said: “We have time now, 10 years, perhaps 20 years, to do something about it. The longer we leave it the more difficult it is going to be and if we leave it too long we won’t be able to do something about it and the natural system will collapse.”
Attenborough likened the damage being caused to the natural world to an investor eating into capital: “It’s fine to take a profit but you wouldn’t be so silly as to eat into capital. But that’s what we are doing with the natural world all the time.”
Safeguarding the future of the planet meant that governments may need to risk the wrath of voters by ending subsidies for fossil fuels and imposing carbon taxes.
“We are supporting and subsidising the very things that are damaging our planet. The natural world is so delicate. It needs all the protection it can get. Sometimes that means governments have to take decisions that are painful and cost money.
“Carbon-based fuel is the source of many of our problems and we are subsidising that.”
Attenborough said it gave him hope that support for environmentalism was strong among young people and politicians needed to listen: “They are saying: ‘Do something and we will support you.’”
He said there had been examples, including the agreement to end whaling, of international cooperation to help the natural world, but added: “The opportunity won’t last for ever. Unless we act on the Paris climate change agreement we are going to be in real trouble.”
Attenborough’s theme will be echoed by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, during his visit to Washington for the IMF’s spring meeting.
Hammond plans to urge fellow finance ministers to make sustainable growth and tackling climate change central to their economies.
“We must work together with our partners across the world to create a safer, more prosperous and more sustainable economy for future generations,” he will say, at the inaugural gathering of a global group of finance ministers dedicated to using economic levers to tackle climate change.
The Treasury said Hammond would make the first intervention at the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action, building on his previous warnings that calls by the young to reverse the existing damage to the environment must be heeded if global economies are to continue to grow and capitalism is to continue to succeed.
Hammond will argue that environmentalism is good for the economy, pointing to the UK’s 430,000 jobs in low carbon businesses. The chancellor will insist that global guidelines for tacking climate change need to be backed by urgent actions.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/11/expect-even-greater-migration-from-africa-says-attenborough-imf-global-warming

Speaking after Mark Carney, the Bank’s governor, used an article in the Guardian to warn financial firms that they faced an existential risk from global warming, the shadow chancellor said Labour was exploring ways to retool Threadneedle Street.
Welcoming Carney’s intervention in a tweet on Wednesday, McDonnell appeared to suggest that more action was required to meet the challenges of climate change.
Mark Carney's intervention is breakthrough moment. In addition to rewriting government spending criteria we’ll now consult on changing the Bank of England's mandate to reflect the climate change emergency highlighted by #ExtinctionRebellion Rebellion demo. https://t.co/n7M7qBnp8j
McDonnell has been examining various ways to reshape the Bank’s mandate, which is set by the government, should Labour come to power.
He has previously focused on giving Threadneedle Street greater powers to direct the lending of commercial banks into more productive sectors of the economy, and away from property speculation. Labour is also considering ways to funnel more investment into green industries and technologies, which will encompass how the role of government and other agencies, such as the Bank, can be used to tackle climate change.
The party has already said it would rewrite the Treasury’s green book, the manual for government spending decisions, and that the Office for Budget Responsibility, the tax and spending watchdog, would be mandated to consider climate risks in its economic forecasts.
The Bank said on Wednesday it would disclose an assessment of how it managed climate-related financial risks as part of its 2019-20 annual report, a regular update on its work, which will come out next year.
Carney said the central bank would adopt the framework of the taskforce for climate-related financial disclosures (TCFD) – a G20 initiative calling on commercial banks to disclose their lending to companies with carbon-related risks – to publish details of its own risks from climate change.
“We need to lead by example and by providing such disclosures, we will be playing our part to secure the transition to sustainable financial system,” he said.
Campaigners have argued that the Bank could do more to tackle risks from climate change, including forcing the mandatory disclosure of carbon-related assets, rather than asking banks to consider doing so.
Threadneedle Street could also force banks to set aside more money to protect from losses on carbon assets, or encourage them to lend to green projects by reducing the amount of money they are required to set aside.
Rob Macquarie, an economist at the lobby group Positive Money, said: “Central banks have a crucial role to play in decarbonising the financial system, but continually present their mandates as a restriction against adopting certain climate-friendly policies. We therefore welcome moves from the Labour party.”

Our politicians fail to grasp the scale and urgency of the risk humanity faces. The UK signed up to the UN’s sustainable development goals (SDGs) in 2015, but has yet to develop a coherent and rigorous national plan for their domestic and international implementation.
Encouragingly, the SDGs form a new roadmap for our future that in principle aligns the economy with the Earth’s life support systems. Yet, a recent report by the Stockholm Resilience Centre shows that attempting to achieve the socioeconomic goals using conventional growth policies would make it virtually impossible to reduce the speed of global warming and environmental degradation.
The research team tested three other scenarios, and the only one that met all goals implemented systemic transformational change. A key element was reducing inequality by a redistribution of wealth, work and income, including ensuring that the 10% richest people take no more that 40% of the income.
We clearly have an unprecedented and immense challenge before us, with little choice but to engage as a mass movement to create a system-wide transformation in our politics and our economy.Stephen Martin Visiting professor, University of the West of EnglandStephen Sterling Emeritus professor of sustainability education, Plymouth University
• Both Extinction Rebellion and the climate strikes are reminders that we need to rebuild our societies now if we are to avoid them facing climate collapse in the near future. But both initiatives need to avoid the fate of the Occupy movement, which had huge support 10 years ago but disintegrated because of a lack of precise demands and concrete policy goals.
Fortunately, many such policies already exist. The organisation I founded, the World Future Council, has identified the best policy solutions available in countries, regions and cities worldwide. British Columbia has a carbon tax. Maryland, US, has obligatory environmental literacy education. Rwanda has a successful reforestation policy. Japan has an effective energy conservation law. Costa Rica has an exemplary biodiversity law.
These provide starting points. But the UK has gone in the opposite way: 10 years ago the WFC helped MPs introduce feed-in tariff legislation (originating in Germany) to speed up the production of renewable energy. But the coalition government hastened to emasculate it. As many proposals are rejected over cost, a key recommendation is the adaptation of quantitative easing to fund the energy transition.
One WFC proposal is for central banks to buy fossil fuel “stranded assets” on condition the money paid is invested in renewables. How this can be done sustainably is explained in our study “Unlocking the trillions”. As central banks cannot go bankrupt in their own currency, they can also buy – and add to their reserves – long-term and low- or zero-interest bonds to kickstart the required emergency reforms in poor countries.Jakob von UexkullFounder, World Future Council
• Larry Elliott is informative on a subject that matters, as usual (Threadneedle Street’s timely warning for banks and insurers: take climate change seriously, 16 April). But insurers have taken it seriously since at least 2009, when a representative of Munich Re wrote: “Climate change probably already accounts for a significant share of economic losses from weather-related natural catastrophes in the period since 1980, which totalled $1.6tn (in original values).
“In the light of these facts, it is disappointing no breakthrough was achieved at the Copenhagen climate summit in December 2009. At Munich Re, we look closely at a multitude of risks and how best to handle them. Risks that change in the course of time are especially hazardous. Climate change is just such a risk of change.”
But even the premium increases 10 years later don’t appear to have cut emissions sufficiently. So the Bank of England must convince the government to take more effective action. For example, as in the second world war, introduce rationing of any production of greenhouse gases.David MurrayWallington, Surrey
• Are US college courses teaching how not to be duped by bullshit really necessary (‘Calling bullshit’: the college class on how not to be duped by the news, theguardian.com, 17 April)? If students haven’t developed their critical thinking faculty by the time they get to college, they are probably lost to the agencies of disinformation and manipulation.
In Britain, it is obvious that our education system, designed as it is to provide compliant labour to increase the wealth of a few, has failed when its cities are filled with humanity-saving, peaceful demonstrators. It is inspirational to observe their ability to recognise what is truly important and disregard the odium of passersby – normal people going about their business, in many cases to finance or produce goods harmful to humanity and the natural world. These protesters are the freethinkers who have escaped the bullshit net.Geoff NaylorWinchester, Hampshire
• In This Changes Everything, Naomi Klein defines one legacy of the free market: “In virtually every country the political class accepts the premise that it is not the place of government to tell large corporations what they can and cannot do, even when public health and welfare – indeed the habitability of our shared home – are clearly at stake.” In the streets, yes, but in the ballot box we bring about the inevitable and dismiss our free-market political class. We build a new system.John AirsLiverpool
• I admire Ben Smoke’s action at Stansted (Journal, 16 April), but disagree with him about arrest, though agree about not glorifying it and being clear about the consequences.
I am a Quaker, a psychotherapist member of the Climate Psychology Alliance, which aims to support activists therapeutically, and a member of Extinction Rebellion. What we need is a mass movement with arrest as a possible and necessary part of it. When thousands join us in solidarity and put this issue before everything else, the state will have to listen and take action.Nick DavisWeybridge, Surrey

… we can’t turn away from climate change. For The Guardian, reporting on the environment is a  priority.  We give climate, nature and pollution stories the prominence they deserve, stories which often go unreported by others in the mainstream media. At this critical time for humanity and our planet, we are determined to inform readers about threats, consequences and solutions based on scientific facts, not political prejudice or business interests. But we need your support to grow our coverage, to travel to the remote frontlines of change and to cover vital conferences that affect us all.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account.

In the event Di Natale’s working supposition is correct, and Shorten goes on to win the campaign, the Greens are Labor’s mostly likely dance partners in the Senate for a range of progressive reforms the ALP is taking to the contest, particularly climate change, which was the focus of the recent overture.
Shorten did not come back to him, but Di Natale says he remains hopeful that two progressive political leaders can find their level. “My hope is Bill Shorten and Labor recognise it’s important to have a constructive relationship with the Greens,” Di Natale says in an interview with Guardian Australia.
If Australian voters on 18 May return a parliament where Labor is forced to govern in minority, then the Greens leader has some clear expectations. He wants a seat at the table as Labor implements its climate policy, as happened during the 43rd parliament. “I would hope Shorten would show the maturity that Julia Gillard demonstrated and bring people to the table to negotiate constructively.”
In the event it’s not a minority government scenario, if Labor wins outright and the Greens are in balance of power in the Senate, Di Natale also wants it known that his party is prepared to vote against a climate policy it regards as insufficiently ambitious, as the Greens did once before, controversially, in 2009.
Ahead of the election, the shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, warned the Greens against a repeat of 2009. Butler told Guardian Australia the Greens voting with Tony Abbott against Labor’s first climate policy mechanism during the last period in government was one of the factors in shattering the political consensus at the federal level, which has prevented policy action for the best part of a decade.
The Greens leader says it is impossible to be definitive about a post-election decision right now, given Labor’s policy still contains several unknowns, but he says the policy Shorten and Butler are taking to the 2019 election is weaker than the policy of 2016 and “now is the time to base a policy on science”.
Di Natale says if Labor’s climate policy, post-election, meets the Greens’ test of ambition, and one of the relevant tests of ambition is “a plan to phase out coal”, then Shorten can expect support.
“But if it’s going to lock in failure, then we won’t support it. We will make a decision based on the policy.”
The Greens leader is equally clear about his expectations about Labor’s stance on the Adani coal project should it win the election. Di Natale will on Thursday join Bob Brown’s convoy protesting against the proposed mine as it makes its way from Hobart to central Queensland.
The Greens leader says he expects a Labor government to block the controversial project. Di Natale says he has zero sympathy with arguments that opposing a project that has already secured major approvals creates a significant sovereign risk problem for a party of government. “If the message we want to send is it’s risky to invest in coal in Australia, then I think that’s the right message,” he says.
The Greens go into the contest needing to defend five Senate spots, and the party is ever hopeful of picking up an extra in the ACT. In the lower house, the objective is to return Adam Bandt to Melbourne, and to contest Kooyong, Higgins, McNamara, Wills and Canberra.
The party has been plagued by open displays of internal dissent in recent times, and has underperformed in recent electoral contests, although Di Natale says he’s “very encouraged” by the party’s performance in the recent New South Wales election.
He insists he’s worked hard to address complaints about the party’s internal culture, and he said the NSW Greens, often at odds with their federal counterparts, now “understood the need to work together”.
Asked whether he thought the factional brawling and complaints about party culture had damaged the Greens, Di Natale says “it’s had a very small impact”.
Di Natale, who arrived in Canberra presenting as a pragmatic and mild-mannered GP, now has a harder edge to his politicking. He says this reflects frustration that has built up “after spending three years in the parliament with one of the worst governments in Australian history, and I don’t say that lightly”.
“It has an impact,” he says. “It has made me determined to throw them out”.
Asked whether he has the appetite to remain party leader, given the recent adversity, and given the toxic nature of contemporary politics, Di Natale says party leadership remains the gift of his colleagues. Self-evidently the Greens’ performance in the coming poll will be a critical factor in whether he retains the backing of his party room.
But he insists he’s not ground down by the obvious challenges. “I feel very positive about the job at the moment. The party has addressed some challenges and we’ve come through that.”

This was based on forecasts made a week or so in advance, which showed plumes of freezing Arctic air heading down towards Britain, just in time for the Easter break.
In the event, Easter 2018 was indeed a bit of a write-off, weather-wise. Daytime temperatures were especially low, while cool winds swept across the country, making it feel even colder. This raised the issue once again of the timing of Easter. Last year, Easter Sunday was on 1 April, just 11 days into the 35-day period in which it can occur. No matter how many times schools, tourist boards and seaside towns plead for the Easter weekend to be fixed on a date later in April, we persist in following this bizarre and disruptive timetable.
The rest of April 2018 was not much to write home about, either, although in the middle of the month there was a brief warm spell, during which London’s St James’s Park recorded a high of 29.1C, the warmest April day since 1949. But this was a short-lived respite from the prevailing cool, wet and unsettled weather during the rest of the month.

I agree with you inasmuch as that the constant litany of distressing news that a nature writer must daily confront would be exceedingly difficult to navigate without surrendering to gloom. The writer of this piece, though, was not just balanced in her appraisal, but perhaps even light-handed. Rather than mentioning ‘how terrible humans are,’ and that the ‘end is in sight,’ she gently points to the inescapable fact of the dire damages we have wrought on the world. No small feat if you ask me; it takes infinite patience and good humour to maintain a ‘politically correct’ and well-mannered stance amidst such chaos and sustained resistance to remedial action from those most able to make meaningful change. 
It’s no secret just how far down the road our environmental over-reach has taken us, but here’s just one small example, fresh today, from, of all places, New Zealand. Considered by many the safest environmental haven for those who can afford to move there. 
“New Zealand, famous for the pristine landscape promoted in the ‘Pure New Zealand’ branding, is now considered one of the most ‘invaded’ countries in the world, with 75 animal and plant species having gone extinct since human settlement. The once vibrant bird life has fared particularly badly, with 90% of sea birds, and 80% of shorebirds threatened with or at risk of extinction. Almost two-thirds of New Zealand’s rare eco-systems are also under threat of collapse...groundwater failed standards at 59% of wells due to the presence of E coli, and at 13% of the wells due to nitrates. Some 57% of monitored lakes registered poor water quality, and 76% of native freshwater fish are at risk or threatened with extinction. A third of freshwater insects are also in danger of extinction...”
Whilst I resonate with the urge to dismiss all this as groundless End of Time lunacy, the science is inescapable and rapidly increasing, and it makes the writer of this piece look - rather than doomsday and humanity-bashing as you suggest - to be biased towards the side of non-disclosure. 
The other point I would like to make, without wanting to sound like a personal attack, is that the life of journalists of all types are under increasing attack all over the world. It seems to me a great mistake to partake in it without sharp critical engagement. Our only real weapon is the sword of truth, and the task of good journalism is to wield it well.

It is a difficult time for the genre: all the pleasure to be found in viewing our natural splendour is being tainted, somewhat, by an imminent sense of doom and destruction. It’s hard to show beautiful animals without acknowledging that their habitats are at risk of disappearing entirely. Earth from Space does not evade the perils of climate change, and some of its quiet power comes from simply showing the damage being done.
It opens with a family of elephants in Kenya, with a calf in danger of starvation and a herd that has barely eaten because of an extreme dry season. These animals are heartbreakingly emaciated. But the rain comes and they make it through. The approach is more gentle than bombastic. Perhaps there is a hope that, in seeing animals in their glory, we might take more care of what we have.
Earth from Space promises a new perspective on nature documentaries by using, as its starting point, images taken from some of the thousands of satellites orbiting the Earth, which are now so capable of capturing minute detail that they can pick out individual animals from space. The tinfoil hat side of my brain began to look up at the sky with suspicion, before I realised that it is safe to assume that a herd of elephants frolicking in the rain holds more interest than the tea-drinking habits of a writer in perpetual pyjamas, but even so. From these unimaginably far away shots, we get closer, and zoom in, until we’re right there on the delta with warring hippos, or in the Himalayas with snub-nosed monkeys whose tiny faces are extraordinary, their smeared, plumped lips looking as if they belong more on the cover of a celebrity weekly than slurping the nectar of rhododendron flowers.
In central China, the programme-makers saved the best until last
Ejiofor narrates us around the world with poetic flair, taking us from vignette to vignette with speed, and there is little time to linger. While some stories earn more time, we zip past seals on the coast of Namibia and an isolated, unexplored rainforest high on a clifftop in Mozambique; an underwater volcano is a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it interlude.
There is ample aesthetic appeal in seeing Earth from above, which will not be news to anyone who has recently found themselves having to select a new screensaver. Sweeping shots of Lake Baikal in Siberia, frozen over for five months of the year, reveal shards of ice stacked like tiles, and there is a grim beauty to even its most perilous spots, as the huge dark rings of meltwater threaten the survival of baby seals.
There is far more here, however, than just a visual treat. Surveillance of this kind allows scientists to see places they might not have been able to access previously, and the resulting insights can be significant. The satellites pick up brown smears tainting the white ice of the Antarctic. The old adage that one should never eat yellow snow takes on a whole new meaning when its origins are revealed, and the diet of the emperor penguins that live there has a lot to answer for.
It is a rare moment of optimism: spotting these new colonies, essentially identified by the trails of faeces they leave in their wake, has more than doubled the known global population. Enjoy that moment while it lasts; it is followed by a shot of a vast iceberg four times the size of Greater London breaking off from the Arctic shelf.
Ejiofor explains that as well as spying on nature, satellites mean “we can also see our cities” (the tinfoil hat is vibrating again), and flashes of humans gathered en masse appear: in Mecca for hajj, Burning Man, even Glastonbury, though in my experience, it would be kinder all round not to zoom in on revellers too closely. In central China, though, the beauty is truly remarkable, and the programme-makers have saved the best until last. Thousands of students of Shaolin kung-fu, who train for six hours a day, six days a week, perform a routine in near-perfect unison.
Even from a regular point of view, this is an astonishing spectacle. But from above, from far away, it looks like a grand, magnificent flower unfurling. It seems inappropriate, in the light of the underlying message that people are ruining everything, to come to this point, but here we are, with human beings, stealing the show again.
… we can’t turn away from climate change. For The Guardian, reporting on the environment is a  priority.  We give climate, nature and pollution stories the prominence they deserve, stories which often go unreported by others in the mainstream media. At this critical time for our species and our planet, we are determined to inform readers about threats, consequences and solutions based on scientific facts, not political prejudice or business interests. But we need your support to grow our coverage, to travel to the remote frontlines of change and to cover vital conferences that affect us all.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute.

His photo-series Five Degrees was commended by judges for sensitively documenting a little-known but tragic side-effect of climate change: male suicide among Indian farmers.
Borella is a photojournalist with over 10 years’ experience, who has worked across the world. In 2015, he embarked on a trip to India to photograph victims of acid attacks. While there, he became increasingly aware of extreme weather in India but wanted to tell the story in a different way.
“I wanted to be able to show how our choices in the west affect people in places like India,” Borella said. “I felt obliged – but I didn’t want to produce cliched photos of desperate conditions in India. I wanted this to tell a personal story.”
He set about researching and months later he stumbled across a paper from the University of California, Berkeley, documenting a correlation between climate change and almost 60,000 Indian farmers taking their own lives.
“For me, this story spoke to the connection between environmental destruction and self-destruction. I felt obliged to tell it. I wanted to show how our choices in the west are having these huge consequences for people in the rest of the world, in terms of climate change.”
His photographs, telling the story of a farming community in Tamil Nadu facing its worst drought in 140 years, were praised by the judges who said it instantly stood out as winner.
The chair of judges Mike Trow, who was previously a picture editor for British Vogue, said Borella’s work was urgently needed, adding: “Borella documented this with incredible sensitivity, imagination and a direct aesthetic that we all agreed worked on a number of levels.”
Borella wanted the photographs to speak to the absence created by suicide, and decided to photograph some of the widows, choosing a square format to create intimacy. Although it was his first time entering the competition, he was quietly confident because of the personal power of the stories he was capturing.
“Of course it was a beautiful surprise when I got the call,” he said, adding “but as a journalist, you can recognise when you are really on to something that is outstanding. I really felt something about this project. I knew it had the possibility of raising huge awareness.”
“Every story of every widowed woman was so intimate and so moving,” he said, talking about a woman whose husband killed himself in front of the bank whose loan he could not replay, by drinking the pesticide that he used for his crops.
Borella found it difficult not being able to immediately help the women that he was photographing, but hopes the award will bring international attention to their stories.
Alongside winning Photographer of the Year, he also won in the Professional Documentary category.
… we can’t turn away from climate change. The Guardian’s environmental coverage reports the scientific facts, social consequences and political choices that are shaping the fate of our planet. As the world's leaders turn their backs on the environment, we are at a crisis point. Individual consumer choices are important, but we need collective action to achieve the systemic change that will really make a difference. Our pioneering and our fearless reporting on the environment can play a vital role in that. But we need our readers’ support.

The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.

Activists stepped up the demonstrations on their third day, targeting the capital’s rail network and the home of the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn.
Traders in the West End warned that the protests, which have seen protesters block four London landmarks for the past three days, had already cost them tens of millions of pounds.
The first estimate of the financial impact of the so-called climate rebellion came as activists targeted London’s rail network. Just after 11am, three people glued themselves to a train at Canary Wharf station, causing delays on the Docklands Light Railway.
A few hours later, four protesters glued their hands together and chained themselves to a fence outside Corbyn’s house, saying he was “the best hope this country has got” to meet the challenges of the climate crisis, adding that they were there to “support him” to go further.
Thousands of people, including parents and young children, pensioners, scientists and environmentalists, have taken part in Extinction Rebellion protests.
On Wednesday afternoon, the four sites that protesters had occupied in London since Monday – Marble Arch, Waterloo Bridge, Parliament Square and Oxford Circus – remained under their control, causing ongoing delays and diversions in the surrounding areas. 
Extinction Rebellion is an international protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues. Demonstration have included blocking bridges to traffic in London and a semi-naked protest inside the House of Commons. 
The group says climate breakdown threatens all life on Earth, and so it is rebelling against politicians who 'have failed us', to provoke radical change that will stave off a climate emergency.
The Metropolitan police has designated Marble Arch as a legitimate protest site. By early evening, large numbers of police officers had turned out in force at the other three sites announcing they were imposing a section 14 order requiring protesters to leave. 
Several hundred officers appeared in Parliament Square, removed sparsely manned roadblocks and took down gazebos, apparently retaking the space without difficulty. However, there were reports that activists had managed to hold the space after the arrival of a samba band, while others tried to set up new barriers around the square.
In Oxford Circus, police circulated among the crowd, who had been dancing all day to music from a stage mounted on a pink boat, serving notice on each.
Police made a concerted attempt to clear Waterloo Bridge by walking among the crowd and serving section 14 notices on all the people assembled there, telling them they had the right to either to go home or continue their protest in Marble Arch. Anyone who refused to comply was arrested.
By 9pm the Guardian had witnessed police carry away at least a dozen protesters, while many others left of their own accord. People who had already been served notice were arrested straight away if they did not leave after a few minutes.
There was pandemonium at times as police officers walked through the crowd, picking individuals apparently at random. A large number of police officers arrived as reinforcements at about 8.30pm.
However, numbers of protesters remained strong and cheers erupted each time an arrest was made. By 9.15pm they were led in a call and response song and chants of “whose police? our police. Whose hearts? Our hearts. Whose souls? Our souls.”
On Tuesday, organisers had warned that they were planning to disrupt London’s rail and tube network, and just after 11am three activists glued themselves to a DLR train at Canary Wharf, unfurling a banner reading, “Climate emergency – act now.” Two people then glued themselves to the top of the train. Another man, who gave his name as Mark, glued himself to the side of the train. The protesters were finally removed from the roof by police at 12.40pm.
Cathy Eastburn, 51, was one of those taking part in the transport disruption. She said she decided to make a stand for her teenage daughters. “I don’t want to be here today and I’m really sorry for the disruption, but I feel I have been forced to do this,” she said. “I have two daughters and I can’t sit by while their future is threatened … The government is doing nothing – we have to force them to act.”
Gail Bradbrook, one of the founders of Extinction Rebellion, who was at the scene, said: “This [Canary Wharf] is the heart of the system that is bringing us to our knees causing huge disruption and chaos around the world … so we want people to pause and reflect.” 
A few hours later another group of activists glued themselves together, then chained themselves to the fence of Corbyn’s house. The Labour leader left his home a few hours later saying he never gave interviews, or arranged meetings, outside his house. The activists left shortly after, saying Labour had offered to meet Extinction Rebellion next week.
David Lambert, 60, was one of those taking part. “We are here because we are supporters of Jeremy Corbyn and he is the best hope this country has got to get us out of this,” he said. “But we need system change and a transformation of our consumer economy and we know he is a person who has the authority and power to deliver that.”
The events in London are part of an international “climate rebellion” organised by the UK-based Extinction Rebellion. Protests had taken place or were planned in 80 cities across 33 countries, from India to Australia, and around Europe and the US. In The Hague , activists occupied the international criminal court building on Tuesday.
Twenty-nine arrests were made in Edinburgh on Tuesday night after police cleared remaining activists who who staged a sit-in on North Bridge. By 6am on Wednesday, they had all had been released and charged with breach of the peace, to appear in court at a later date.
In London, Extinction Rebellion protesters, activists and legal observers said some of those arrested were being taken to police stations outside of London, lending credence to persistent rumours that the Metropolitan police’s holding cells were reaching capacity. Several people reported cases of people being taken to Luton, Brighton and Essex. The Met would not confirm or deny the claim.
On Wednesday, Jace Tyrrell, the chief executive of New West End Company which represents Oxford Street and central London retailers, told Sky News the protests were hitting business hard.
“We have seen a 25% drop in spend – it was £12m yesterday and obviously we have had disruption today. The impact is customers thinking they are not going to come up over the bank holiday so this could go into the hundreds of millions of pounds if we do not grip this.” 
… in the fight to protect the environment. By keeping the Guardian’s environmental coverage open and accessible, we can report on the changes needed to avoid climate and natural catastrophe. The choices made by individuals are important, but we need to work together for the systemic transformation that will make a real difference. As well as reporting the facts about what is happening now, we investigate the causes and talk to the people trying to make the future better. But we need our readers’ support.

Environment Aotearoa is the first major environmental report in four years, and was compiled using data from Statistics New Zealand and the environment ministry.
It presents a sobering summary of a country that is starkly different from the pristine landscape promoted in the “Pure New Zealand” marketing campaign that lures millions of tourists every year.
It found New Zealand is now considered one of the most invaded countries in the world, with 75 animal and plant species having gone extinct since human settlement. The once-vibrant bird life has fared particularly badly, with 90% of seabirds and 80% of shorebirds threatened with or at risk of extinction.
Almost two-thirds of New Zealand’s rare ecosystems are under threat of collapse, and over the last 15 years the extinction risk worsened for 86 species, compared with the conservation status of just 26 species improving in the past 10 years.
The scale of what is being lost is impossible to accurately gauge, as only about 20% of New Zealand’s species have been identified and recorded.
Kevin Hague from the conservation group Forest and Bird said the report was chilling reading and captured the devastating affects of “decades of procrastination and denial”.
“New Zealand is losing species and ecosystems faster than nearly any other country,” he said. “Four thousand of our native species are in trouble … from rampant dairy conversions to destructive seabed trawling – [we] are irreversibly harming our natural world.”
The minister for the environment, David Parker, said the report offered “no big surprises” but reinforced the importance of cleaning up the waterways and becoming carbon neutral by 2050.
“If, with all our advantages, New Zealand can’t overcome its environmental problems, then the world won’t,” Parker said.
A massive rise in the country’s dairy herd over the last 20 years has had a devastating impact on the country’s freshwater quality, a key area being targeted by the government for improvement. During her election campaign, the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, pledged to make the country’s rivers and lakes swimmable again for the next generation.
That could prove challenging, with the report finding that groundwater failed standards at 59% of wells owing to the presence of E coli, and at 13% of the wells owing to nitrates. Some 57% of monitored lakes registered poor water quality, and 76% of native freshwater fish are at risk of or threatened with extinction. A third of freshwater insects are also in danger of extinction.
Forest and Bird said the main culprits for worsening freshwater quality were the intensive use of fertilisers, irrigation and cows.
The Green party co-leader James Shaw, who is also the minister for climate change, said the environment was taking a further hammering with the effects of global warming starting to be felt, including sea-level rise, increasing land temperatures and warming ocean temperatures.
“All the issues in this report are made worse by climate change and that is why this government is so determined to take strong action,” Shaw said.
“The introduction of climate change legislation, establishing an independent climate change commission to guide emissions reductions, and the just transition to a low emissions economy are vital.”
Hague said while the findings were sobering, the reality was far worse as the report missed “dangerous marine heatwaves” and the inadequacy of marine protections, with less than half a per cent of New Zealand’s sea area protected by marine reserves.
“We must not waste any more time in fundamentally changing the way we interact with nature,” he said. “We need an economy that nurtures and restores our environment, not one that trashes it.”

Yep, I've seen the reference you cite. There is, of course, plenty of discussion about how various models have performed versus reality. (I'm guessing that those suggesting that models haven't done that well are dismissed as ""deniers""; that's fine.)

What I had hoped to see, rather than this, was the ""out of sample"" test of the model allowing us to see its ""unfitted"" performance against a much longer series of actual data. I'll continue looking for that.

This is not true as we need both. Actually the IPCC sees multiple strands. And lets be clear we are talking about significant reduction, not elimination. 
What my analysis showed is how difficult to reduce emissions from my baseline, which (at that time), was already less than half that of the UK average. A largely vegetarian diet with an allowance for some white meats and dairy is a big step that most people could take now. Vegan is hard, and for little benefit from a CO2 pov.

The UKERC report Transforming the UK Energy System Public Values Attitudes and Acceptability Synthesis Report, is very indicative.
The main problem with the report is public perception is highlighted in the best possible way in that the public supports green initiatives, so it is all hunky dory.
What is mentioned but not highlighted enough is that people place the burden of change on governments and not on personal actions. Because the feel that they themselves cannot do much (P14), they do not have to (P19). This is also highlighted in the waste section (P19) where these initiatives are focused more on supply rather than demand.
When asked about driving less (transport is 41% of our energy use) and using less air flights, deep resistance was met (P15). Person responsibility in giving up leisure flights was resisted but business flights were the ones to be reduced. This attitude is repeated throughout the report. So even though the report says that 81% of respondents ""want"" to reduce their energy use, it is clear that very few actually will. This is a key point but is glossed over by the positive 81% figure.
Further with regard to electrification of cars and heating, only half the respondents would use these services if these services will be cheaper than gas (heating P14), and increase performance against petrol (P15). In other words as is commented many times in excerpts from the people, compromise seems to be very short on the ground. Etc.
The problem with many of these reports is they highlight perception rather than action. So even though I have a concern, I will do nothing about it. What this report here highlights again is that people are ‘concerned’ but show a clear indication to inaction over this concern.

Enormous nonsense. Nuclear power is one of the safest ways of generating electricity resulting in among the lowest number of fatalities per TWh generated. It is also among the most environmentally benign energy technologies with full lifecycle emissions about the same as wind power and lower than PV, it uses far less land than renewables (except rooftop PV) and far less materials (steel, concrete, glass etc). It needs less transmission lines than renewables (except rooftop PV). It needs far less storage than renewables. Storage also has it's environmental impact including lifecycle emissions.
If you are looking for the energy technology that has the possibly of disaster on a huge scale, that would be large hydro.

But it seems to me that what I care most about is preserving a world that bears some resemblance to the past: a world with some ice at the top and bottom and the odd coral reef in between; a world where people are connected to the past and future (and to one another) instead of turned into obsolete software.
And those seem to me profoundly conservative positions. Meanwhile, oil companies and tech barons strike me as deeply radical, willing to alter the chemical composition of the atmosphere, eager to confer immortality.
There is a native conservatism in human beings that resists such efforts, a visceral sense of what’s right or dangerous, rash or proper. You needn’t understand every nuance of germline engineering or the carbon cycle to understand why monkeying around on this scale might be a bad idea. And indeed, polling suggests that most people instinctively oppose, say, living forever or designing babies, just as they want government action to stabilise the climate.
Luckily, we have two relatively new inventions that could prove decisive to solving global warming before it destroys the planet. One is the solar panel, and the other is the nonviolent movement. Obviously, they are not the same sort of inventions: the solar panel (and its cousins, the wind turbine and the lithium-ion battery) is hardware, while the ability to organise en masse for change is more akin to software. Indeed, even to call nonviolent campaigning a “technology” will strike some as odd. Each is still in its infancy; we deploy them, but fairly blindly, finding out by trial and error their best uses. Both come with inherent limits: neither is as decisive or as immediately powerful as, say, a nuclear weapon or a coal-fired power plant. But both are transformative nonetheless – and, crucially, the power they wield is human in scale.
Before we can best employ these technologies, we need to address the two most insidious ideas deployed in defence of the status quo. The first is that there is no need for mass resistance because each of us should choose for ourselves the future we want. The second is that there is no possibility of resistance because the die is already cast.
Choice is the mantra that unites people of many political persuasions. Conservatives say, “you’re not the boss of me”, when it comes to paying taxes; liberals say it when the topic is marijuana. The easiest, laziest way to dispense with a controversy is to say: “Do what you want; don’t tell me what to do.” 
If “let anyone do what they want” is a flawed argument, then “no one can stop them anyway” is an infuriating one. Insisting that some horror is inevitable no matter what you do is the response of those who don’t want to be bothered trying to stop it, and I’ve heard it too often to take it entirely seriously.
I remember, for instance, when investigative reporters proved that Exxon had known all about global warming and had covered up that knowledge. Plenty of people on the professionally jaded left told me, in one form or another, “of course they did”, or “all corporations lie”, or “nothing will ever happen to them anyway”. This kind of knowing cynicism is a gift to the Exxons of the world. Happily, far more people reacted with usefully naive outrage: before too long, people were comparing the oil giants with the tobacco companies, and some of the biggest cities in the US were suing them for damages. We don’t know yet precisely how it will end, only that giving them a pass because of their power makes no sense.
Innovation doesn’t scare me. I think that if we back off the most crazed frontiers of technology, we can still figure out how to keep humans healthy, safe, productive – and human. Not everyone agrees. Some harbour a deep pessimism about human nature which I confess, as an American in the age of Donald Trump, occasionally seems sound.
Of all the arguments for unhindered technological growth, the single saddest (in the sense that it just gives up on human beings) comes from the Oxford don Julian Savulescu. In essence he contends that, left to themselves, democracies can’t solve climate change, “for in order to do so a majority of their voters must support the adoption of substantial restrictions on their excessively consumerist lifestyle, and there is no indication they would be willing to make such sacrifices”. Also, our ingrained suspicion of outsiders keeps us from working together globally. And so, faced with the need to move quickly, we should “morally bio-enhance” our children or, more likely, use genetic engineering, so they will cooperate. 
This is roughly akin to “geoengineering the atmosphere” to prevent climate change – some people, having given up on taming the fossil-fuel companies, want to instead pump the atmosphere full of sulphur to block incoming solar radiation. Both cases are based on the premise that we humans won’t rise to the occasion.
I hope Savulescu seriously underestimates the power of both technology and democracy – of the solar panel and of nonviolence. I believe we have the means at hand to solve our problems short of turning our children into saintly robots – which, in any event, wouldn’t do a thing to solve climate change, given that by the time these morally improved youths had grown into positions of power, the damage would long since have been done. And I’m convinced Savulescu is wrong about people’s selfishness presenting the main obstacle to solving climate change: around the world, polling shows that people are not just highly concerned about global warming, but also willing to pay a price to solve it. Americans, for instance, said in 2017 that they were willing to see their energy bills rise 15% and have the money spent on clean energy programmes – that’s about in line with the size of the carbon taxes that national groups have been campaigning for.
The reason we don’t have a solution to climate change has less to do with the greed of the great, unengineered unwashed than with the greed of the almost unbelievably small percentage of people at the top of the energy heap. That is to say, the Koch brothers and the Exxon execs have never been willing to take a 15% slice off their profits, not when they could spend a much smaller share of their winnings corrupting the political debate with rolls of cash. If you wanted to “morally enhance” anyone, that’s where you’d start – if there are Grinches in need of hearts, it’s pretty obvious who should be at the front of the line.
But let’s not win that way. Let’s operate on the assumption that human beings are not grossly defective. That we’re capable of acting together to do remarkable things.

As the world's leaders turn their backs on the environment, we are at a crisis point. Individual consumer choices are important, but we need collective action to achieve the systemic change that will really make a difference. Our pioneering and our fearless reporting on the environment can play a vital role in that. But we need our readers’ support.

The home secretary, who is positioning himself for a run at the Conservative party leadership, made a series of tweets condemning “any protesters who are stepping outside the boundaries of the law”.
He called on the police to “take a firm stance” against protesters who were “significantly disrupting the lives of others”.
“Over recent days, commuters trying to earn a living have been unable to travel to work and businesses have been disrupted,” he said, following a meeting with Met police chiefs.
“Emergency vehicles have faced difficulties navigating the road networks and the demonstrations have put added pressure on police officers whose job it is to solve crimes and protect the public.
“Let me be clear: I totally condemn any protesters who are stepping outside the boundaries of the law. They have no right to cause misery for the millions of people who are trying to lead their daily lives. Unlawful behaviour will not be tolerated.”
Hundreds have been arrested and more than 1,000 officers deployed to police the protests, which entered their fourth day on Thursday.
Scotland Yard took the rare step of releasing a detailed statement setting out the difficulties they have faced keeping control of the protests, while avoiding infringing on the activists’ rights to demonstrate.
They said demonstrators’ tactic of lying down meant four officers were needed to make an arrest but said there was no legal justification for more draconian tactics, such as kettling and mass-arresting groups, because the demonstrations were peaceful.
Politicians have struggled to respond to the protests, as they are keen to head off complaints that not enough is being done to tackle climate change at the same time as taking a tough stance against disruption to commuters.
Javid and Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, have come under pressure from the rightwing press in recent days to take a more outspoken stance against any protesters disrupting public transport or acting illegally.
In a letter to the home secretary, Khan suggested that cuts to funding were restricting the ability of the Metropolitan police to cope with the activists.
“The Met’s ability to police protests without impacting on core policing priorities – such as tackling knife crime – has been made significantly harder by the huge cuts to government police funding,” he said.
Citing £850m of cuts to the force since 2010, he added: “Whether to tackle violent crime, or police protests, our brave police officers deserve the resources they need to keep us safe.”
He highlighted the increasing cost of policing a growing number of protests in London, and said he was working with the Met to consider claiming for a special grant to help with costs for the current demonstrations.
He has said on Twitter that the world is “facing a climate emergency” and that he “fully supports the right of protesters to protest on this vital issue”, while urging organisers to “work with police to ensure their demonstrations are peaceful and lawful and that disruption is kept to a minimum”.
The environment secretary, Michael Gove, said: “We’ve got the message,” after some activists glued themselves to a train and others chained themselves to a garden fence at the home of the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn.
Claire Perry, the energy and climate change minister, also said that she “got the science, motivation and passion driving climate emergency protests” but could not see that “disrupting one of world’s busiest transport systems … blocking emergency routes and making life difficult for so many is going to build consensus and support for the changes we need”.

The Metropolitan police has come under increasing pressure to crack down on the Extinction Rebellion demonstrators who have blocked transport networks in the capital in recent days; not least from the home secretary, Sajid Javid, who has urged officers to “take a firm stance”.
On Thursday, the force said the demonstrations were proving such a drain on resources that police were having to release under investigation many of those arrested, even if that meant they simply returned to the protest sites, while Easter leave was being cancelled for officers who were being asked to work 12-hour shifts.
Scotland Yard took the rare step of releasing a detailed statement setting out the difficulties they have faced keeping control of the protests, while avoiding infringing on the activists’ rights to demonstrate. It came on the same day as the protesters said their next target would be the UK’s largest airport – Heathrow.
Police said the demonstrators’ tactic of lying down meant four officers were needed to make an arrest and said there was no legal justification for more draconian measures, such as kettling and mass-arresting groups, because the demonstrations were peaceful.
“Those arrested are then taken into custody which again means our officers are off the streets temporarily while that process takes place,” the statement said.
Police added: “We have been asked why we are not using tactics such as containment, physically and forcibly stopping the protesters from moving around. The simple answer is we have no legal basis to do so. These are peaceful protesters; while disruptive, their actions are not violent towards police, themselves or other members of the public.
“We are looking at other tactics, such as tighter police cordons, but again that is resource-intensive in terms of officer numbers and, more often than not, it just shifts the protesters to another location nearby and does not assist in reopening roads.”
Police said that, by Thursday night, more than 500 people had been arrested in connection with the protests; primarily on suspicion of minor offences. Ten of those have been charged with breaching section 14 of the Public Order Act, under which police can impose conditions on public assemblies to prevent serious disruption, and obstruction of the highway.
Police added: “It is better for us to keep our resources and custody capacity moving and flexible than leave protesters sitting in cells for up to 12 hours before going to court for what, although highly disruptive, are lower level offences.
“So, everyone else arrested has been released under investigation and will be brought back to be formally interviewed and charged as appropriate in due course. We are aware that means some protesters immediately return to the area to resume their activities; those people will be arrested again.”
Scotland Yard warned the protesters they face a “robust response” if they target Heathrow on Friday. The force said it has “strong plans” in place, while the airport said it is “working with the authorities” to address the issue.
Earlier on Thursday, Javid held talks with the Met commissioner, Cressida Dick. He said: “Everyone has the right to protest peacefully … But people do not have the right to break the law.”
Javid added: “Let me be clear: I totally condemn any protesters who are stepping outside the boundaries of the law ... I expect the police to take a firm stance and use the full force of the law.”
The Met said it considered London’s Marble Arch a legal protest site but that three others – affected areas Parliament Square, Oxford Circus and Waterloo Bridge – were not and that conditions prohibiting demonstrations there had been extended until Sunday, Saturday and Friday, respectively.

The legislation passed on Thursday by the city council puts caps on carbon emissions for buildings over 25,000 sq ft – requiring a 40% overall cut in their emissions by 2030.
The mandates, touted as a local version of the Green New Deal embraced by many progressive Democrats, will apply to 50,000 buildings – from buildings with a few dozen apartments to Trump Tower, the president’s Fifth Avenue skyscraper which advocates have targeted as a major polluter.
“It will be the largest emissions reduction policy ever, in any city,” said the city councilman Costa Constantinides, who spearheaded the bills.
The law puts caps on how many tons of carbon a building may produce per square foot, with different limits for residential, commercial and industrial buildings.
To reach them, many buildings will have to replace heating or air conditioning systems with more efficient models or put in better insulation and windows. Or, they can use electricity from clean sources like solar and hydropower, which will not produce emissions.
It is an attempt to tackle the biggest source of greenhouse gas in New York, where buildings account for about 67% of emissions.
Real estate owners have opposed the plan, calling it too costly and too riddled with exceptions to be effective.
“The approach taken today will have a negative impact on our ability to attract and retain a broad range of industries, including technology, media, finance and life sciences, that provide opportunity and continued economic growth that is so important for our city,” said John Banks, the president of the Real Estate Board of New York.
Rent-stabilized apartments will be exempt from the caps, though they will be required to do some upgrades to improve energy efficiency. Churches, synagogues and mosques are also exempt, as is the city’s public housing system.
Banks wrote that the exceptions unfairly leave “mostly market-rate housing and commercial buildings to shoulder the entire burden of what is undeniably a shared societal problem”.
Buildings that violate the caps will face fines of $268 a year for every excess ton of carbon they put out – which could add up to millions of dollars for the worst offenders.
The city is also aiming to set up a carbon trading program, though details have not been determined. By 2050, the aim is to cut the buildings’ emissions by 80%.
The package, called the Climate Mobilization Act, also requires new buildings to put in green roofs or rooftop solar panels. 
A New York panel has predicted sea level rises of up to 6ft if climate change goes unchecked, leaving wide swaths of the city in the path of floods. Mayor Bill de Blasio last month proposed building a new chunk of Manhattan to protect the existing island from rising seas.
New York is one of a host of US cities and states that have vowed to drive down their carbon emissions despite a retreat at the federal level under Donald Trump, who withdrew from the landmark Paris climate change agreement.
De Blasio plans to sign the legislation.
“It’s going to revolutionize our ability to reduce emissions through our buildings, which are really our number one problem here in New York City,” he said this week. “We were going to need to do something very aggressive, particularly because the federal government is not doing their role.”
… we can’t turn away from climate change. For The Guardian, reporting on the environment is a  priority.  We give climate, nature and pollution stories the prominence they deserve, stories which often go unreported by others in the mainstream media. At this critical time for our species and our planet, we are determined to inform readers about threats, consequences and solutions based on scientific facts, not political prejudice or business interests. But we need your support to grow our coverage, to travel to the remote frontlines of change and to cover vital conferences that affect us all.

It is unfortunate that the White House is currently controlled by the worst example of a human being but he won't be around forever. It is also worth noting that many US cities and states are are already responding to meet the challenge and ignoring the ignorance and stupidity of their president.Currently the changes at global and national level are simply too slow. The science is showing that limiting average global temperature increases to below 1.5 degrees C is now a virtually impossible task.

Did you even pay attention - 40% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030 to limit us to 1.5 centrigrade warming. Itself a level that will still cause £trillions in economic losses to extreme climate events. ZERO CO2 emissions by 2050.
Not a matter of whether Gelion btl in the GU agrees but conclusions from expert analysis of actual scientific research in the field.
You carry on, pin your faith on the Donkey of Carbon Capture. It allows you to believe you can plod on, as you were and it'll all turn out nice again, eh?
Before you do, little starter for another tenner to your fave offsetting scheme to salve your western guilt, while doing nothing:
2018 global Carbon Emissions ~37.1 BILLION Tonnes. So, how much was sequestered by Carbon Capture and Storage, given we have the technology, according to you?
Given the idea has been around since the '70s and the technology behind it since the 1920s. Why isn't it in place to meet 40% reduction by 2030, oh Gelion?
Simple, it has never been proven as practical at anything like the scale required. In reality, it's little more than a business opportunity for the coal industry. To keep it alive, rather than switch now to renewable sources.
It requires massive amounts of energy, supplied at the Power Station by burning more coal. All of which has to mined and transported in an extremely Carbon intensive process. On site, there has to be ready access to a gas reservoir, from which there is no leakage. Extraordinarily expensive, when wind and solar is already cheaper than coal, even without CCS and high risk.
So sorry Gelion, reducing emissions by halting our reckless lifestyles and consumption, is the only way we can possibly make the cuts required, with current technology.

It was a chance to watch spectacular creatures revelling in the beauty of their natural habitats, as the man with a voice as soothing as ice-cream described what we could see, from the violent to the serene. Those days are gone. Attenborough’s recent move to Netflix, for Our Planet, was deceptive: a seemingly gorgeous nature documentary that doubled up as animal kingdom snuff movies in which the beauty of those natural habitats was revealed as a crumbling paradise, ruined by people and particularly by greed. One of the main points of praise for Our Planet, which was well received, suggested that Attenborough was no longer tiptoeing around the issue of climate change, the implication being that he had done so before.
You sense that Our Planet was unfortunately timed for the BBC. In Climate Change: The Facts, the gloves are now not so much off as thrown to the floor in a certain rage. It’s right there in the title, bold and stark. This hour-long documentary, part of the Our Planet Matters season, is wide-ranging yet concise, easy to understand, not blighted by the ego of, say, An Inconvenient Truth, and it is designed to do for climate change denial what 2017’s Blue Planet did for single-use plastic.
That’s not to say it should be Attenborough’s responsibility to get the wider public to pay attention, nor that it is down to the BBC. It isn’t. But Climate Change: The Facts is a rousing call to arms. It is an alarm clock set at a horrifying volume. The first 40 minutes are given over to what Attenborough calls, without hyperbole, “our greatest threat in thousands of years”. Expert after expert explains the consequences of rising CO2 levels, on the ice caps, on coastal regions, on weather and wildlife and society itself. The most powerful moments are in footage shot not by expert crews who have spent years on location, but on shaky cameras, capturing the very moment at which the reality of our warming planet struck the person holding the phone. In Cairns, Australia, flying foxes are unable to survive the extreme temperatures; rescuers survey the terrible massacre, and we learn that while 350 were saved, 11,000 died. A man and his son talk through their escape from raging wildfires, over the film they took while attempting to drive through a cavern of blazing red trees. These are horror movies playing out in miniature. It is difficult to watch even five minutes of this and remain somehow neutral, or unconvinced.
Yet as I kept on, scribbling down an increasingly grim list of statistics, most of which I knew, vaguely, though compiled like this they finally sound as dreadful as they truly are – 20 of the warmest years on record happened in the last 22 years; Greenland’s ice sheet is melting five times faster than it was 25 years ago – I started to wonder about responsibility, and if and where it would be placed. This would be a toothless film, in the end, if it were hamstrung by political neutrality, and if its inevitable “it’s not too late” message rested solely on individuals and what relatively little tweaks we might make as consumers. What about corporations? What about governments?
Then, at that exact moment, having played the despair through to its crescendo, the experts served up unvarnished honesty. They lined up to lay out the facts, plain and simple. Fossil fuel companies are the most profitable businesses man has ever known, and they engage in PR offensives, using the same consultants as tobacco companies, and the resulting uncertainty and denial, designed to safeguard profits, has narrowed our window for action. It is unforgivable. I find it hard to believe that anyone, regardless of political affiliation, can watch footage of Trump calling climate change “a hoax ... a money-making industry” and not be left winded by such staggering ignorance or astonishing deceit, though it is, more likely, more bleakly, a catastrophic combination of the two. At least Nigel Lawson only appears here in archive footage, and his argument sounds limp, to put it kindly.
Climate Change: The Facts should not have to change minds, but perhaps it will change them anyway, or at least make this seem as pressing as it needs to be. With the Extinction Rebellion protests across London this week, disrupting day-to-day business, and this, on primetime BBC One, maybe the message will filter through. At the very least, it should incite indignation that more was not done, sooner, and then urgency and a decision to both change and push for change at a much higher level. Because there is, for a brief moment, just possibly, still time.
… we can’t turn away from climate change. The Guardian’s environmental coverage reports the scientific facts, social consequences and political choices that are shaping the fate of our planet. As the world's leaders turn their backs on the environment, we are at a crisis point. Individual consumer choices are important, but we need collective action to achieve the systemic change that will really make a difference. Our pioneering and our fearless reporting on the environment can play a vital role in that. But we need our readers’ support.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.

The Swedish activist will also take the campaign to the UK parliament, where she will speak to dozens of MPs including the Green party MP Caroline Lucas, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and the environment secretary, Michael Gove.
Her arrival on Sunday coincides with a surge of concern about the climate. On Thursday the BBC screened a documentary about the crisis, narrated by David Attenborough. In recent days, the governor of the Bank of England, groups of scientists and members of the clergy have added their voices to the call for more ambitious cuts to emissions.
Thousands of Extinction Rebellion campaigners have blocked four areas in central London since the start of the week, and youth activists are staging a demonstration at Heathrow on Friday. Police have made more than 500 arrests but organisers have vowed to continue for another week. There have also been demonstrations by the group in New York, Paris, The Hague and dozens of other cities.
Thunberg, whose strike sparked a global movement of more than a million students in less than a year, was also one of the signatories of the declaration that launched Extinction Rebellion in October. She had previously arranged to be in London after Easter to speak in parliament at the invitation of Lucas, meet student activists in the UK and to talk at a public event co-hosted by the Guardian.
Before her visit, she said she was keen to join the campaigners on the streets. “I would love to participate in their protests while in London if there is time and if they are still protesting. I think it’s one of the most important and hopeful movements of our time. Civil disobedience is necessary to create attention to the ongoing climate and ecological crisis.”
Extinction Rebellion plans to ramp up its protest over the weekend, when it hopes more people will join because of the bank holiday and the warmer weather. More actions, including a picnic on a motorway, are planned for Monday, Earth Day. Organisers say the protests will continue for another week, bolstered by Thunberg’s support.
“She is abso-bloody-lutely important. I thank her from my heart,” said Ronan McNern, a spokesman for the group. “It’s not Extinction Rebellion that people should watch out for. It’s the School Strike 4 Climate, it’s the youth. This is their moment.”
Thunberg has become a global figurehead for the climate movement in the past year. During her Easter holidays, she has been on a European speaking tour and has, so far, met Pope Francis and addressed the European parliament. MEPs gave her speech, which harangued them for spending too long on Brexit and not enough time on climate, a standing ovation.
In the UK parliament next week, she will meet the Speaker of the House of Commons and talk to several dozen MPs. 
“Greta is coming to the UK at a time of unprecedented public awareness and action around climate change – and will deliver a powerful message to politicians that they cannot ignore either the rising seas or the rising citizens’ movements demanding action,” said Lucas.
“It’s especially significant given the divisiveness around Brexit and how vital it is that we put aside any political or other differences we might have to respond to the climate emergency.
“All the main opposition parties have agreed to sit down and listen to her and the UK climate strikers she has inspired, and I think this could be a defining moment for how the UK responds to the climate and wider environmental crises.”

trees get taste of air of the future,article,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/19/amazons-trees-get-taste-of-air-of-the-future,214,"An ambitious experiment deep in the Amazon rainforest aims to find out how the ecosystem is likely to respond to rising levels of carbon dioxide.
In 2000 a research team at the UK’s Hadley Centre forecast that a combination of reduced rainfall and higher temperatures caused by global warming could decimate the Amazon by the end of the century. But the following decade another Hadley Centre team concluded that this scenario was unlikely.
The contrary verdict was based largely on the researchers’ belief that extra carbon dioxide in the air would protect trees against the increasingly harsh conditions.
The revised prediction did not reassure David Lapola, a Brazilian biologist who is running the new experiment. “Who knows,” he said. “Hypotheses are all we have now.”
Lapola said nobody had tested the impact of increased carbon dioxide on trees in the Amazon. That is what he and an international team of scientists at a site 35 miles north of Manaus now intend to do.
As Lapola spoke, a pair of construction workers in heavy boots paraded by carrying a large, flat, octagonal aluminium frame. Nearby, several more workers were putting the finishing touches to an open-topped greenhouse made of flexible window panels and more aluminium. 
The structure was being put up around several spindly saplings, taking care to avoid trampling the soil. When all of Lapola’s chambers have been installed – eight altogether, scattered around an area of jungle twice the size of a football field – computer-controlled nozzles will spray carbon dioxide into four of them, boosting the concentration inside their walls to 50% higher than outside. The other four chambers will be controls and receive no extra CO2.
Unless the growth in CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels around the world slows down, these raised levels of CO2 in the air will be normal by about 2050.
Scientists have previously exposed saplings and full-grown trees from temperate forests, such as sweet gum and pine trees, to extra CO2. One experiment in the 1990s tested the effect of extra CO2 on the understory trees of a Panama jungle.
The conclusion so far from scores of such experiments on how dozens of species in various places fare in CO2-enhanced air is: it depends.
Since carbon extracted from carbon dioxide is the essential building block of plants, it makes sense that more CO2 in the air should help plants grow better. But sometimes other factors such as lack of critical nutrients prevent plants from taking advantage of extra CO2. Scientists do not yet know enough about how such limiting factors work to predict how a diverse natural forest such as the Amazon will behave in the air of the future.
The question matters not just because the fate of this jungle’s assorted flora and fauna could be at stake. The Amazon stores a vast amount of CO2 in its tree trunks which, if the forest declines, will be released into the air, accelerating global warming. That would cause damage all around the world.
Lapola’s chamber research will be the first time Amazon trees are tested with extra CO2 in otherwise almost-natural conditions. After it’s done, the scientists want to build a larger experiment that bathes a plot as big as a baseball diamond in CO2-enhanced air all the way from the ground to the lofty treetops. This could reveal whether mature trees behave differently to young ones.
The chambers are expected to be ready in late April, at which point the experiment will begin. “I’ll probably be here,” said Lapola, a professor at the University of Campinas in São Paulo, who estimated he has visited the site 50 times already. “It’s hard to stay away.”

As well as diverting effort into battles with the criminal justice system, it distracts from thousands of ways to decarbonise the economy: pension funds, insurance companies and banks control $400tn in assets, making decisions daily about where to invest, as well as influencing company boards, as Larry Elliott points out (Threadneedle Street’s timely warning for banks and insurers to take climate change seriously, 16 April).
Local authorities shape our environment (and own £400bn in assets), and soon voters will decide who should run them. Every employer, school and household can make decisions that turn away from chaos.
The suffragettes’ battle for the vote is celebrated as a great victory for direct action, but 100 years later the struggle for women’s equality is still being waged within countless institutions. Creating lasting change takes political skill, as well as passion and persistence. For democracies to solve difficult problems like climate change and inequality, schools need to teach practical politics as a basic skill.Titus AlexanderAuthor of Practical Politics: Lessons in Power and Democracy; convener, Democracy Matters
• I agree with Ben Smoke that it’s important not to fetishise the number of arrests in relation to current protests. Extinction Rebellion places too much emphasis on number of arrests. Think the government will negotiate on matters of substance? Think again. I speak as one taking part in the actions this week. The urgency is real, and people need to know the truth. But it will take profound public pressure on other parts of our system that hold us in stasis – vested interests, fossil fuel companies particularly, MPs and ministers, the media, finance, and local government. We need to listen to our allies and work with them, community groups and NGOs particularly. Extinction Rebellion’s sophistication around direct action will need to be matched by effective political strategy to achieve the kind of changes needed.Gill WestcottCheriton Bishop, Exeter
Everything the Green party said 30 years ago is coming to pass. The planet can’t wait much longer
• Thirty years ago I was chair of the Green party’s media committee. Caroline Lucas was the party’s press officer. We were working on the 1989 European election campaign – the one where the Greens won 15% of the vote but no seats (no PR then).
Two days ago, I visited three of the four Extinction Rebellion sites and talked to activists. They were deeply impressive, committed people – non-violent, refusing to blame and shame, empathic, compassionate and universalist (Climate protesters target transport and Corbyn, as disruption hits traders, 18 April).
Everything the Green party said 30 years ago is coming to pass. The planet can’t wait much longer. I commend the bravery, passion and wit of Extinction rebels. Recognised routes of influencing events have failed. Non-violent direct action led to the birth of civil rights for all in the US. Maybe it can lead to a Green New Deal here. This may be our last chance.Lyn DadeTwickenham, Middlesex
• I read the article by Mark Carney, François Villeroy de Galhau and Frank Elderson of the Network for Greening the Financial System (Global finance must go green if we are to fight climate change, 17 April) on the way to an investor meeting, which I had to cancel due to the Extinction Rebellion protests at Oxford Circus.
I’m raising investment for a reusable plastic-free biodegradable and compostable paint tin, to stop plastic single-use items ending up in landfill or the ocean in their hundreds of millions. I don’t disagree with the aims of the protest, but targeting all the business community is not right. Some of us get it and are doing something about it; please, activists, focus your protests on those who aren’t.Kim ThongerFinedon, Northamptonshire
• The letter about HS2 from Andy Burnham and Steve Rotheram (19 April), mayors of Manchester and Liverpool, might be persuasive if it were not written while Extinction Rebellion takes action against climate catastrophe and David Attenborough delivers his powerful piece on BBC One.
The mayors’ letter is peppered with words and phrases that mean growth: economic potential, released capacity and, of course, the yearned-for “powerhouse”. But what the young people of Extinction Rebellion are saying is: how can you offer us a future based on growth? What is the point of releasing capacity if we run out of the planet’s fundamental resources: water, clean air, space to live that will not be flooded with seawater, soil in which food can grow?
What we need is a plan – a transport plan, an everything plan – that considers every single aspect in relation to the threat to these resources.Alison LeonardHebden Bridge, West Yorkshire
Tall glass buildings have a devastating effect on our collective wellbeing (Global finance must go green if we are to fight climate change, Journal, 17 April). They produce more CO2 per metre squared in construction and operation for every higher floor they support. Their huge energy demand spikes at the hottest/coldest times of day/year, driving grids to the brink of collapse.
In future extreme heatwaves, like that of 2003, they can cause power outages across whole regions and resulting citizen deaths. They increase pedestrian discomfort, even killing people with the superwinds created around their structures. When they burn catastrophically, people above the fire may not survive. They reflect heat on to adjacent buildings, driving up their energy consumption and discomfort in those opposite. They shade whole urban areas from winter sun and the ability to generate solar energy in their shadow. They can destroy the mental peace of neighbourhoods by their overbearing dominance of the skyline, like the Walkie Talkie in London.
Who will pay to demolish them when they catastrophically fail, like Grenfell Tower did? Yet planners ignore such risks and fall over themselves to give permission for the next one. Norman Foster’s Tulip is the latest unnecessary London ego trip. The Tulip is indeed a huge (light) bulb heating up the sky and driving climate change. Bankers must take the responsible step of de-risking cities by never again financing these structures that should now be seen as gigantic climate risks.Susan RoafOxford
In a week when Brexit for once did not lead the headlines, it is the world’s most critical problem that has come back to the fore – the dire concerns over climate change. Mark Carney’s warning to financial regulators, banks and insurers around the world to “raise the bar” can’t come soon enough. The Extinction Rebellion movement has very much focused attention this week on climate change, and whatever their methods, it is really important we focus public policy on this massive threat to our long-term wellbeing. Councils are fully aware of their important responsibility in this as local leaders, and the raft of climate emergency resolutions, coupled with developing programmes of radical action, is our contribution to dealing with this existential threat.
It is about time the financiers picked up the baton, as the major societal change required to come anywhere close to dealing with this challenge needs both lots of money and the transformation of economies to work. So I encourage this sector to work more effectively with government at all levels and stop investing in high-carbon fossil fuels, but also in nuclear power, which is just too slow to realise and too expensive to deal with the urgency of the climate crisis.
Billions, if not trillions, needs to be invested now in low-carbon energy, storage, efficiency, transport and heating solutions. Politicians can only do so much. Extinction Rebellion is right in that we should have been taking much more urgent action over the past 40 years, and as policymakers we should accept that common failure. Now is the time for rapid change so that all our grandchildren and future generations can have a real chance of a decent life. To the financial sector, I urge them to get on with supporting us in that endeavour.Councillor David BlackburnChair of UK and Ireland Nuclear Free Local Authorities steering committee
The article by Clive Lewis MP was excellent (Labour’s message to UK’s young climate strikers, theguardian.com, 12 April). But Labour’s ambition for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century is not fast enough. We will be committed to at least 2C warming by then due to CO2’s long lifecycle. The scientists who publish the IPCC report have been clear – we have 12 years to transform our power infrastructure. That transformation will cost $45tn according to the International Energy Agency. Your article on Mark Carney’s warning to the financial sector cites a figure of $20tn for assets at risk due to climate change.
There are only three choices regarding who will pay these gigantic bills: governments, consumers or shareholders. Only the government has the balance sheet, the borrowing capacity and the timeframe to mothball fossil fuel-driven power plants and build new renewable energy assets. As Gordon Brown taught the world in the 2008 financial meltdown, if you want to move fast, nationalise. The only practical way to turbocharge the energy transition is to nationalise the power sector, allowing existing shareholders an exit or opportunity to swap their shares into a renewable sector de-risked by government involvement.
In simple terms, a government exists to do what citizens cannot do for themselves. The ability to mobilise resources in the face of an external threat led the UK to its “finest hour”, as Churchill observed. The first paper connecting CO2 and the greenhouse effect came out in the 1970s. Nearly 50 years later the nations of the world have failed to rein in the pollutants responsible for global warming. The next generation are demanding a response to the climate crisis and those with the experience to legislate, to finance and to procure must advance bold measures such as nationalisation to deliver a better future.John CurtisDirector, Ventnor Botanic Garden
Regarding Andre Spicer’s article about Extinction Rebellion (The Extinction Rebels have got their tactics badly wrong. Here’s why, theguardian.com, 19 April), semantics are important on the left/right political axis, but what’s more important is the plurality of messaging.
Extinction Rebellion cannot be all things to all people. In the wake of the current protests and David Attenborough’s Climate Change – The Facts programme, it’s now the job of other voices across the political and cultural spectrum to sound the clarion of change in language their respective demographics will understand. Extinction Rebellion and Attenborough’s team have opened the door to making that possible. Those of us in the media, the arts and beyond have a duty to get on with it.Blake WellstedLondon
Sajid Javid referred to protesters “disrupting the lives of others” (Report, 19 April). Presumably far better to leave it until their lives are disrupted by rising sea levels, ferocious storms, flood, drought, crop failure, starvation, mass migration and extinction of much of the life of the biosphere. Any politician with the intelligence, or care for humanity, to see beyond the next election would be in Westminster right now urgently working out how to save the world from approaching catastrophe – but maybe that’s somewhere on the list, after the next-but-one Brexit extension.Hilary LangFrome, Somerset

… in the fight to protect the environment. By keeping the Guardian’s environmental coverage open and accessible, we can report on the changes needed to avoid climate and natural catastrophe. The choices made by individuals are important, but we need to work together for the systemic transformation that will make a real difference. As well as reporting the facts about what is happening now, we investigate the causes and talk to the people trying to make the future better. But we need our readers’ support.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute.

Officers with angle grinders cut through the bars below the hull of the vessel, named after the murdered Honduran environmental activist, which protesters had chained and glued themselves to.
Five hours later, however, the tables had turned as hundreds of activist reinforcements swarmed into side roads and blocked the end of Regent Street. The police were surrounded. As officers attached the Berta Cáceres to a lorry, the crowd chanted: “We have more boats.”
By 7pm police had managed to move the boat just two streets away, only to find themselves pinned in by more rows of demonstrators singing the Beatles’ All You Need Is Love. After much obstruction the vessel was eventually driven away up Regent Street followed by jogging uniformed officers.
Welcome to the fifth day of the Extinction Rebellion, the escalating but still methodically polite campaign of disruption that has turned several of central London’s best-known locations into a giant game of territorial to-and-fro.
Despite more than 100 arrests on Friday, taking the total to 682 by early evening, the demonstration which has blocked four major London landmarks looked set to continue beyond the weekend, with organisers preparing to extend their disruption on Monday to “picnics on the motorway.”
The activists reported an influx of supporters as the Easter holiday, balmy weather and gestures of support from school strike leader Greta Thunberg and the actor Emma Thompson injected new momentum into the weeklong climate protest.
As on previous days, the mood was largely respectful on both sides, but video later emerged of activists being dragged roughly across the concrete near Regent Street.
Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish activist and founder of the school strikes for climate movement, will visit parliament on Monday and Tuesday and said she was also keen to join the campaigners on the streets. 
The Metropolitan police has admitted that it is overstretched and officers said additional forces were called in from Wales and other regions to prevent Heathrow from becoming a target, but fears proved exaggerated. A group of 15 youth activists staged a two-hour peaceful protest at a road junction close to the airport.
At the biggest of the camps at Marble Arch, organisers said they had had about 300 signups in the afternoon alone, with dozens of people volunteering to work as brochure distributors. Wolfgang Wopperer-Beholz, who manned the sign-up desk, said there had been a marked increase compared with the previous day. “Earlier, the people who put their names on the list were already knowledgeable. Now we are seeing more people who don’t know so much, but are pretty enthusiastic.” He said many had mentioned the David Attenborough documentary on climate change that had aired on the BBC on Thursday night.
Induction sessions at a tent in Parliament Square were so packed that the attendees spilled outside. “It’s growing at an amazing rate. I think the Attenborough documentary lit a fire in people’s bellies,” said one of the activists, who gave only the name Archer. “They are not just the usual dirty hippies either. There are doctors, architects, and the ethnic diversity is getting wider.”
“I’ve campaigned on this for 30 years with very little effect. It’s only with Extinction Rebellion that I have a sense that we are getting somewhere,” said Bing Jones, a retired doctor from Sheffield, who was arrested and placed in a police cell in Belgravia on Thursday night. “When I was released, there was a volunteer waiting for me outside with a Mars bar and big smile. He had signed up that day, been trained, and then sat outside the police station for four hours until I came out. This is a wonderful, strange movement and new people continue to come along.”
Among the newcomers on Friday was actor Sonera Angel, who was waving a yellow banner marked with the Extinction Rebellion symbol near the police perimeter at Oxford Circus. She said she had come by train with a big group from Southend. She planned to return over the weekend and persuade more of her friends to join. “There is no excuse now it is a holiday,” she said. “Climate change is such a huge issue and governments all over the world are doing almost nothing about it.”
Thompson also joined the Oxford Circus camp on Friday morning as activists read “poems to the Earth”. Later the actor gave a speech from the Berta Cáceres.
Thompson said her generation had failed young people: “We have seriously failed them and our planet is in serious trouble. We have much, much less time than we thought. I have seen the evidence for myself and I really care about my children and grandchildren enough to want to be here today to stand with the next generation.”
Organisers say the protests will continue for another week, bolstered by Thunberg, who will arrive in the UK on Sunday as part of a European tour that has included a meeting with Pope Francis and an excoriating address at the European parliament.
Thunberg, whose strike sparked a global movement of more than a million students in less than a year, was also one of the signatories to the declaration that launched Extinction Rebellion in October. She had previously arranged to be in London after Easter to speak in parliament to party leaders and other MPs, meet fellow student activists and talk at a public event co-hosted by the Guardian.
“I would love to participate in their protests while in London if there is time and if they are still protesting,” Thunberg said. “I think it’s one of the most important and hopeful movements of our time. Civil disobedience is necessary to create attention to the ongoing climate and ecological crisis.”
Activists and politicians say she and other young campaigners had a key role to play. “She is abso-bloody-lutely important. I thank her from my heart,” said Ronan McNern, a spokesman for the group. “It’s not Extinction Rebellion that people should watch out for. It’s the school strike for climate, it’s the youth. This is their moment.”
The climate campaigners have also been boosted by a host of prominent supporters from the science and academic communities and the entertainment world. In an open letter on Friday, the former Nasa scientist James Hansen spelled out the growing dangers of climate change and noted that he too has conducted “highly respectful acts of nonviolent civil disobedience – on occasion leading even to my arrest”.
Linguist and activist Noam Chomsky is among those who have sent a statement of support. “It is impossible to exaggerate the awesome nature of the challenge we face: to determine, within the next few years, whether organised human society can survive in anything like its present form,” he said. “The activists of Extinction Rebellion are leading the way in confronting this immense challenge, with courage and integrity, an achievement of historic significance that must be amplified with urgency.”

However, with a sea level rise of up to 1.15 metres, or possibly more, this century, and increasingly violent storms forecast, then simply rebuilding them or making them higher is too expensive to be a viable option. Since tourism and access to the sea are vital, and the benefits to birdlife and fish nurseries that the region’s marshes represent are valuable assets, then a different way has to be found.
Research has shown that a salt marsh just 40m wide can reduce the height of waves by 20%, and 80m wide to near zero. Academics from Cambridge (which, judging from a topographical map, might otherwise be needing a sea wall in the future), other experts from the region’s universities and conservation groups such as the National Trust that own a lot of the coast, are intent on expanding existing marshes. 
Since it is the storm waves that demolish cliffs and even solid concrete walls, the plan is to retreat slightly inland and develop “soft defences” in front of valuable farmland and coastal settlements to prevent much larger swathes of East Anglia being swallowed by the sea. 
… we can’t turn away from climate change. For The Guardian, reporting on the environment is a  priority.  We give climate, nature and pollution stories the prominence they deserve, stories which often go unreported by others in the mainstream media. At this critical time for our species and our planet, we are determined to inform readers about threats, consequences and solutions based on scientific facts, not political prejudice or business interests. But we need your support to grow our coverage, to travel to the remote frontlines of change and to cover vital conferences that affect us all.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as €1 – and it only takes a minute.

Surely, the logical conclusion must be that all man-made emissions would cease if all economic activity came to a complete halt. But this is not a helpful basis for a discussion about what needs to happen. It seems more helpful to reverse the logic. All human activity produces emissions. The question is therefore, how much emissions are sustainable such that the world we pass on to the next generations is at least as liveable as the one we have had the privilege of enjoying. One way to think about this is an emissions budget for each and everyone of us. When we do that calculation ... Such a budget has been estimated to be between 2 and 3 tons of CO2 per person annually ... one quickly realises that each one of us produces more emissions than that budget would allow us. It is therefore possible and up to us individually to change our behaviour to get as close to the budget as we can.

The low flows and fish kills that I saw in small Brisbane creeks occurred during the millennial drought. The Darling River catchment has experienced drought over the last five years. Global warming has increased the rate of onset of drought in this region as increased temperature overall increases evaporation reducing runoff and groundwater recharge into streams. Global warming has caused the Southern Ocean lows that bring rain to the Darling catchment to stay further south reducing rainfall. The severe El Nino of 2015-16 also reduced rainfall and increased temperature. This years weak El Nino didn't help.

And isn’t the truth just the opposite of “following our leaders”? Leaders do what the people want? Once it becomes clear that a large part of the population is inclined to change and accepts that these changes require some form of sacrifice, leaders embrace this change and propose meaningful policies.
[In democracies leaders cannot be elected unless they appeal to the existing sentiment of the electorate. In authoritarian regimes, leaders obsessively try to appease the people to stay in power. Even in totalitarian states, the frightening element is the ability to turn a broad sentiment into an oppressive mass movement. Of course the relationship between the leader and the people is reciprocal and self-reenforcing. Brexit is a reminder that chasing policies that don’t command a solid majority is futile.]
Young people during Future for Friday marches expose the inability of their own parents’ generation to find any answers. Extinction Rebellion are people of old ages who are willing to stand up for their convictions. When the population broadly see activists as heroes and take pride in the initiative of their children and - most importantly - embrace the notion that doing the right thing will entail a change in behaviour ... then the leaders will follow and make material change happen. Until that point, leaders do best to maintain the status quo suggesting change is possible in homeopathic doses.
The shift in sentiment about smoking is an example how this process works. First scientists exposed the problem. Then activists relentlessly reminded people of health risks not just for smokers but also their non-smoking friends and relatives and bystanders until ... until the mood shifted and people saw smoking not as a right but as a privilege.

It's unforgivable | Tim Winton,article,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/20/our-leaders-are-ignoring-global-warming-to-the-point-of-criminal-negligence-its-unforgivable,8459,"I’ve been asking myself a question – and even posing it makes me queasy.
Is it too late – are we beyond saving?
As a culture and a polity, when it comes to climate change, have we arrived at a point where we are now expected – even trained – to abandon hope and submit to the inevitable?
OK, I guess that’s two questions. In good faith I can still say that the answer to the first is no. But I’d be a liar and a fool to give the same response to the second.
No, it isn’t too late. But we’ve squandered decades of opportunities to mitigate and forestall impacts and we’re making a pig’s breakfast of responding to what is now a crisis. Even so, humans are not yet beyond saving themselves from the worst ravages of global warming. There’s fight in us yet, even if it’s a bit shapeless.
The problem – and it’s an existential threat both profound and perverse – is that those who lead us and have power over our shared destiny are ignoring global warming to the point of criminal negligence. Worse than that, their policies, language, patronal obligations and acts of bad faith are poisoning us, training citizens to accept the prospect of inexorable loss, unstoppable chaos, certain doom. Business as usual is robbing people of hope, white-anting the promise of change. That’s not just delinquent, it’s unforgivable.
Over the last 15 years in Australia our national governments have failed to respond effectively to the challenge of climate change, and for most of that time we actually gave ourselves the luxury of calling it a challenge. Now it’s more of a crisis. And it’s not as if our leaders are incapable of producing a timely response to a crisis. After all, in 2009 the government took bold steps to avoid an economic depression. And in the matter of refugees arriving by boat, governments still spend billions on emergency-level funding and infrastructure to meet what they view as a crisis of national security. But in the case of climate change there’s no equivalent sense of immediacy, no sense of priority commensurate with the dangers it poses to our future ability to feed ourselves, defend our largely coastal settlements, insure our homes, maintain national security and keep our children safe from harm.
I worry that this widely-shared grief and unfocussed rage may become the signal human disposition of our time
The message implicit in our governments’ refusal to act is that we should all just suck it up – as in “climate change is bullshit, and even if it’s not there’s nothing you can do about it”. Once internalised, this narrative is profoundly dangerous, not only for individuals, but for the entire community. It’s a licence for nihilism, a ticket to hell in a handbasket. And the cohort responsible for this mixture of denial and fatalism is far removed from the daily experience of the ordinary citizen, especially the youngest and poorest of us. They have become a threat to our shared future and we must hold them to account, immediately and without reservation.
In the last 25 years I’ve observed a peculiar social phenomenon in individuals and communities that I mistakenly thought I understood because I was a child of the cold war.
While working to help save ecosystems across Australia I’ve noticed a bruised attitude of beleaguerment in individuals and within groups that’s increasingly hard to ignore, a mounting grimness in the faces and language of people barely holding on in the face of steady, cumulative and unrelenting losses. They’re losing places, ecosystems, potential. It’s not restricted to activists; I see it in neighbourhoods and towns, I read it online, I get it in the mail. Ordinary folks – young and old – watching their waterways curdle, their soils blow away, their green spaces bulldozed, their fish gasping for air. Feeling wounded and betrayed, some are clinging to the last tendrils of hope, others are falling into despair. And that worries me.
Ecological depletion is being experienced communally as a mounting loss of access and an erosion of possibility. In essence, a pruning back of future prospects. It’s expressed as grief, and the most palpable, widespread and immediate expression of it is now brewing over climate change. Beneath that grief there’s rage.
I worry that this widely-shared grief and unfocussed rage may become the signal human disposition of our time, that the Anthropocene will be marked by fury and hopelessness. This frightens me just as much as the prospect of beachside properties falling into the sea, or even the death of our coral reefs. Acidifying cultures are as chaotic and dangerous as acidifying oceans.
Younger people in particular have begun to feel abandoned by their leaders and elders. They suspect they’ll be left without food or ammunition to stage a fighting retreat in which every battle is a defeat foreseen and every bit of territory was surrendered in advance by politicians and CEOs who deserted them long ago to hide in their privileged bunkers and silos.
So what hope for our kids? Why should we be surprised they’d walk out of school and march? Their futures are being traded away before their eyes. They see what many of their elders and betters refuse to acknowledge. That they’re being robbed.
During the cold war many of us were gripped by dread – it was personal and communal – and in the books and films of the era our anxiety was palpable. We lived every day with the prospect of nuclear annihilation, and sometimes that possibility was clear, present and extremely proximate, a matter of hours and minutes when a possibility became an actual probability. And for some time now I’ve been trying to see our current crisis through that lived experience. Because we survived, didn’t we? The worst never happened. No one pressed the button. So, chances are, all will be well this time, too – right?
The Great Barrier Reef experienced bleaching events so catastrophic they caused our most senior coral scientists to weep
But the reason humanity survived the cold war is because world leaders paid attention. They took emergent crises seriously. And in each instance of utmost danger, arguments of ideology and nationalism eventually fell away before the sacred importance of life itself. Beneath all the posturing there was, finally, a bedrock of humanity informing the technocrats and generals. Stepping back from the brink was expensive. Think what it cost in terms of pride, political prestige, assets, even territory. Consider the expenditure of ingenuity and infrastructure.
And there’s our problem. Because in this country, when it comes to climate change, there’s no equivalent attention to the crisis. For some there’s no crisis at all. Our governments and corporations are ensnared in a feedback loop of “common sense” and mutual self-preservation that’s little more than a bespoke form of nihilism. Ideology, prestige, assets and territory are now tacitly understood to be worth more than all life, human or otherwise. And the four great capacities of humanity to solve a crisis – ingenuity, discipline, courage and sacrifice – these seem to be reserved for more important enterprises. The future, by all accounts, can wait.
But the future is already with us. The button has been pushed – again and again.
In 2011, along hundreds of kilometres of the West Australian coast, abalone crawled off the reefs to die in their untold thousands on the baking white beaches because of a 2-degree spike in sea temperature. A little further north at Shark Bay, the world’s largest seagrass meadows suffered a sudden mortality of 20%. In the Northern Territory two years later, mangrove forests died along a 1,000km stretch of coast. And the Great Barrier Reef experienced successive bleaching events so catastrophic they caused the nation’s most senior coral scientists to weep.
Here’s the thing. To our current national government climate change is but a dry-lightning storm in a district unknown. For the denialists who control policy, the storm itself is an endlessly debatable phenomenon. And if the parish it’s lighting up really does exist, then it can safely be dismissed as remote and insignificant. But that district is real. Most of us know it as the immediate future. Some know it as the present. And it’s already burning. It’s peopled with folks who weep and seethe and dread what else may lie ahead.
We can no longer wait patiently for our leaders to catch up. We cannot allow ourselves to be trained to accept hopelessness. Not by business, nor by governments. Both have subjected us to a steady diet of loss and depletion. It’s sapped us and left us mourning a future we can see fading before it even arrives. There’s no good reason to submit to this. No sane purpose in putting up with it. Because grief will paralyse us, and despair renders doom inevitable. We can afford neither.
Australians can make a bad outcome inexorable by submitting to it meekly. Or we can fight for a viable future and meet this crisis shoulder to shoulder. I am of the passionate belief that we can and will. But to do this we’ll need to get our house in order – and fast. That means calling bullshit on what’s been happening in our name for the past 15 years.
It’s time to make sharp demands of our representatives, time to remove those who refuse to act in our common interest, time to elect people with courage, ingenuity and discipline, people who’ll sacrifice pride, privilege and even perks for the sake of something sacred. Because there’s something bigger at stake here than culture wars and the mediocrity of so-called common-sense. It’s the soil under our feet, the water we drink, the air we breathe.
Life. It’s worth the fight. But, by God, after decades of appeasement, defeatism and denialism, it’s going to take a fight. Time’s short. So, let’s give our grief and fury some shape and purpose and reclaim our future together. Enough cowardice. Enough bullshit. Time for action.

But the benefits will also be huge,article,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/21/zero-emissions-uk-huge-task-huge-benefits,164,"Britain needs to reach, by no later than 2050, net zero emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. This means any greenhouse gases we release must be balanced by the removal of an equivalent amount from the atmosphere.
The 2050 deadline represents our fair share of international responsibility for implementing the Paris agreement on climate change and meeting its goal of holding the rise in average global temperature to well below 2C – and pursuing best efforts to limit warming to no more than 1.5C.
Until global emissions reach net zero, average temperature will continue to rise. It is already about 1C above its pre-industrial level, and is fundamentally altering the Earth’s climate. Extreme weather events – heavy rainfalls and heatwaves – have occurred, and sea levels have risen.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has warned of very serious consequences if average temperature rises by more than 1.5C, with many millions more people threatened by food and water shortages, for instance. Worse, the higher that temperatures climb, the greater is the prospect of major catastrophic events occurring such as polar ice sheets in west Antarctica and Greenland being destabilised, leading to an inevitable sea-level rise of several metres.
The 2008 Climate Change Act commits the UK to reducing its annual emissions by at least 80% by 2050. But that was based on the assumption that global average temperature would rise by up to 2C. Since then scientific evidence has emerged to suggest that this level of global warming would be too dangerous. The UK is leading by example and has already reduced its annual emissions by more than 43% since 1990, a period during which our economy has grown more than 75%, proving that tackling climate change does not mean financial ruin. But this has mainly been achieved by phasing out coal as a source of electricity.
To reach net zero emissions by 2050, the UK needs strong action across the whole economy. We have many of the technologies we need already, and we will need to make more use of nuclear and renewable power. But it is not yet clear how we will, for instance, stop emissions from agriculture, including from livestock.
We will need to make significant investments, but the returns will be huge, not just in terms of avoided climate change impacts, but also new opportunities for innovative UK businesses serving the growing global demand for zero-emissions technologies. A zero-emissions economy will be cleaner, smarter and more efficient, ensuring prosperity and wellbeing for current and future generations.

The party leader, Peter Bevan-Baker is a Scotland-born dentist who has transformed a routine election into a closely watched race as he seeks to upend expectation and precedent on 23 April.
The bucolic island – Canada’s smallest province – is best known internationally as the home of LM Montgomery’s classic children’s novel Anne of Green Gables. But it also remains a region heavily reliant on fishing and farming – industries that are increasingly precarious as the area grapples with the effects of climate change.
Bevan-Baker’s potential win also underscores the unpredictability and diversity of Canadian politics. Last week, voters soundly rejected a progressive government that promised to tackle climate change in the heartlands of Canada’s oil industry.
For generations, the 153,000 residents of Prince Edward Island have experienced a see-saw of political consistency, with the Liberals and Progressive Conservatives alternating power with remarkable predictability.
But this belies an exciting history of Canadians firsts: Prince Edward Island elected the first non-European premier (Joseph Ghiz), the first elected female premier (Catherine Callbeck) and the first openly gay leader (incumbent premier Wade MacLauchlan).
“Could we become the first province to elect the Green party? It’s possible,” said Paul MacNeill, publisher and political commentator on the island.
No Green party in Canada has ever formed a provincial or national government. A win by Bevan-Baker would upend precedent, but even a minority government would be a first in the province since the 1800s.
While the province’s economy is roaring, the public appears to have grown weary of what would amount to four consecutive terms of Liberal government if premier MacLauchlan is re-elected on Tuesday (though it would only be his second term).
Bevan-Baker’s candidacy, however, promises to upset the status quo in a region known for its political moderation.
“He is fiscally conservative. He’s socially responsible and he’s environmentally aware,” said MacNeill. “Between the lilt of his voice and his policies – which are middle of the road for the most part – he’s won a lot of converts.”
And Bevan-Baker has been astute at reading the electorate. “They’ve been presenting themselves less as a party with an activist agenda on environmental issues and more as a party that will pay attention and is capable and interested in listening to the people,” said Don Desserud, a professor of political science at the University of Prince Edward Island.
In a province heavily reliant on agriculture, courting the rural areas, especially given the declining prosperity of family farms, is key to any electoral breakthrough.
“What Bevan Baker has done, is reformulated [the Greens’] message to say that they want to work with farmers, not against [them]. They want to help people. They want to support them,” said Desserud.
The result is policy proposals from the Greens that dive deep into pesticide and chemical fertiliser rules, but one that also emphasises individual responsibility as opposed to government regulation.
But a Green government also holds a certain poignancy for islanders on the front line of climate change: each day, the Atlantic Ocean eats away at its famed red cliffs and sections are expected to soon disappear beneath rising sea levels.
“Living on an island, you start to see the effects of climate change in a tangible way, especially as a farming and fishing community,” said Colin Buchanan, a musician in the province’s capital Charlottetown, who plans to once again vote Green.
While Canada has experimented with Green politicians in the past – most recently with Mike Schreiner, a small business owner in Guelph, Ontario, who won 45% of the vote in the province’s recent election – the country has been wary to fully embrace the party as a viable option in forming government.
But the electoral strategy of the party in PEI might also portend a shift in thinking about how to court a wary electorate.
“What the Green party has had to do is to basically rebrand themselves … as a far more comprehensive party,” said Desserud, likening its strategy to that of European Green parties.
The Greens have enjoyed a surprisingly robust lead over the other two parties throughout the campaign, even in conservative rural areas, but recent polling suggests the election has tightened into a three-way race.
The Progressive Conservative party leader and former journalist, Dennis King, is well-liked and seen as a moderate voice – and has slowly chipped away at Bevan-Baker’s outsized lead.
But the campaign, which has been cordial and friendly, has also been beset by tragedy: on Friday, the Green candidate and local teacher Josh Underhay and his young son died in a canoeing accident, a shocking blow to the tight-knit community.
“Josh brought humour, enthusiasm and boundless energy to every situation,” said Bevan-Baker in a statement the next day, announcing all campaign activities would be suspended over the weekend, with other parties also following suit.
In the last election, Bevan-Baker’s 2015 seat was the lone Green representation in the province’s legislative assembly, capping 10 previously unsuccessful attempts at winning a seat in Canadian politics. Hanna Bell brought the party’s seat count to two, following a 2017 byelection win.
But politics is a private matter for many and most residents are tight-lipped about their choice at the ballot box, making any predictions difficult.
“Islanders are a lot more more traditional than the numbers likely show,” he said. “Maybe I’ll be wrong. I hope I am.”

Higgins, a British barrister, led a decade-long campaign for “ecocide” to be recognised as a crime against humanity. She sold her house and gave up a high-paying job so she could dedicate herself to attempting to create a law that would make corporate executives and government ministers criminally liable for the damage they do to ecosystems.
Such a legal instrument could be a powerful tool for conservationists, climate campaigners and activists trying to stop air and water pollution, but earlier proposals for this to be included in the Rome statute on international crimes against humanity were dropped in 1996.
Ten years ago Higgins set out to revive the idea. She wrote a book, Eradicating Ecocide, lobbied the United Nations law commission, organised mock trials and established a trust fund for “Earth protectors”. Although the law has yet to be recognised, momentum is growing as a result of the ongoing climate crisis and growing evidence that major companies lobbied against policies that could protect people from pollution and other environmental harm.
On her organisation’s website, Higgins lamented the continued absence of a law that she believed would change the world. “There is a missing responsibility to protect … What is required is an expansion of our collective duty of care to protect the natural living world and all life. International ecocide crime is a law to protect the Earth.”
Higgins grew up on the shores of Loch Lomond and childhood discussions with her meteorologist father and artist mother were often about green issues. According to an interview with the Scotsman, her parents were initially shocked that their daughter had entered the legal profession, but Higgins later said: “The Earth is in need of a good lawyer.”
Several other legal organisations are now fighting for the environment in the courts, with occasional successes such as the Urgenda case in the Netherlands, in which a judge ruled that the government’s efforts to fight climate change were inadequate and emissions cuts must be stepped up.
Campaigners say an ecocide law would take this and other campaigns to protect nature to new levels. The Guardian columnist George Monbiot wrote that it could make the difference between a habitable and uninhabitable world by shifting the balance of power and forcing executives to think twice about actions that might damage the planet.
After discovering she had an aggressive form of cancer and had only weeks to live, Higgins told Monbiot that the work she pioneered would go on after her death. “My legal team will continue undeterred,” she said.
“But there are millions who care so much and feel so powerless about the future, and I would love to see them begin to understand the power of this one, simple law to protect the Earth – to realise it’s possible, even straightforward. I wish I could live to see a million Earth protectors standing for it – because I believe they will.”
On social media, tributes and condolence messages were sent by a wide range of groups and individuals, including philosophers, human rights campaigners, lawyers and Extinction Rebellion activists.
The author and activist Naomi Klein tweeted: “She devoted her life to changing broken laws that have failed so miserably to protect the natural systems on which we all depend. Her work will live on.”
Kate Raworth, a teacher at the Environmental Change Institute of Oxford University, said she was devastated by the loss of the brilliant, pioneering legal campaigner. “May bright young lawyers worldwide be inspired to continue her essential work,” she tweeted.

The 16-year-old Swedish student, who sparked a global youth-based movement when she began a “climate strike” outside Sweden’s parliament last year, gave a typically blunt speech. She told MPs: “This ongoing irresponsible behaviour will no doubt be remembered in history as one of the greatest failures of humankind.”
Thunberg, who had earlier met the heads of several of the UK’s political parties, also said today’s generation of leaders around the world had not acted fast enough to halt climate change. “You lied to us. You gave us false hope. You told us that the future was something to look forward to,” she said. “You don’t listen to the science because you are only interested in solutions that will enable you to carry on like before.”
Some consider the UK to be a leader in the fight against global warming, but Thunberg was fierce in her criticism: “The UK’s active current support of new exploitation of fossil fuels, like for example the UK shale gas fracking industry, the expansion of its North Sea oil and gas fields, the expansion of airports, as well as the planning permission for a brand new coalmine, is beyond absurd.”
She said the UK had a “mind-blowing historical carbon debt”, referring to the nation’s cumulative emissions since the industrial revolution. The UK government also uses “very creative carbon accounting”, she said, by not including the emissions from imported goods in headline figures. The former UN chief Ban Ki-Moon also recently criticised the UK government’s funding of fossil fuel projects in other countries.
Thunberg said there was still just about time to stop climate change: “I’m sure that the moment we start behaving as if we were in an emergency, we can avoid climate and ecological catastrophe. Humans are very adaptable. But the opportunity to do so will not last for long.”
She said the deciding factor for every new economic development must be the level of carbon emissions it will produce. “Every time we make a decision we should ask ourselves; how will this decision affect that [emissions] curve?”
About 1.6 million students are estimated to have skipped school to protest against climate inaction, prompting some criticism over lost education. Thunberg said: “I assure you we will go back to school the moment you start listening to science and give us a future. Is that really too much to ask?”
Earlier on Tuesday, Jeremy Corbyn and several other Westminster party leaders met Thunberg at parliament, with a symbolic place left at the table for the absent Theresa May.
Thunberg, who came to London to speak at the Extinction Rebellion environmental protests, and was due to address activists at Parliament Square later on Tuesday, met Corbyn, the Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, the Green MP Caroline Lucas and the Westminster leaders of the SNP and Plaid Cymru, Ian Blackford and Liz Saville Roberts.
May was chairing cabinet on Tuesday morning. Her spokesman said he did not have information about whether the prime minister had been invited to see Thunberg.
Organisers of the event said May had been invited, but there had been no response. A place at the table was left empty, with the prime minister’s name.
Thunberg told the MPs: “We just want people to listen to the science.” Corbyn told her: “Well done for what you have done.”
Lucas, the former Green leader who is the party’s sole MP, told the activist: “I think all of us are really committed to trying to ensure that there’s an ongoing way to really make sure that all of our policies and all of our work in parliament is properly scrutinised by young people with a perspective on climate in particular.
“We want young people’s voices to be heard in parliament. This is such an important moment, when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change say we have just 11 years left to get off the collision course we are on for climate catastrophe.
“That sense of urgency is here as never before, at a time when there have been protests on the streets not just of London but around the country and all the different nations of the UK. More than ever, politicians have our ears open to your message.”
While in parliament Thunberg also met the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, as well as the former Labour leader Ed Miliband and the Lib Dem MP Layla Moran.
Outside on Parliament Square, more demonstrators supporting the Extinction Rebellion group were massing, with police warning they risked arrest if they did not remain in a certain area and the protest continued after midnight.
More than 1,000 people have been arrested amid sit-in protests in London over the past week, which blocked Parliament Square, Oxford Circus and Waterloo Bridge. Activists are still at Marble Arch. More than 10,000 police were deployed to contain and then break up the protests.

I am 16 years old. I come from Sweden. And I speak on behalf of future generations.
I know many of you don’t want to listen to us – you say we are just children. But we’re only repeating the message of the united climate science.
Many of you appear concerned that we are wasting valuable lesson time, but I assure you we will go back to school the moment you start listening to science and give us a future. Is that really too much to ask?
In the year 2030 I will be 26 years old. My little sister Beata will be 23. Just like many of your own children or grandchildren. That is a great age, we have been told. When you have all of your life ahead of you. But I am not so sure it will be that great for us.
I was fortunate to be born in a time and place where everyone told us to dream big; I could become whatever I wanted to. I could live wherever I wanted to. People like me had everything we needed and more. Things our grandparents could not even dream of. We had everything we could ever wish for and yet now we may have nothing.
Now we probably don’t even have a future any more.
Because that future was sold so that a small number of people could make unimaginable amounts of money. It was stolen from us every time you said that the sky was the limit, and that you only live once.
You lied to us. You gave us false hope. You told us that the future was something to look forward to. And the saddest thing is that most children are not even aware of the fate that awaits us. We will not understand it until it’s too late. And yet we are the lucky ones. Those who will be affected the hardest are already suffering the consequences. But their voices are not heard.
Is my microphone on? Can you hear me?
Around the year 2030, 10 years 252 days and 10 hours away from now, we will be in a position where we set off an irreversible chain reaction beyond human control, that will most likely lead to the end of our civilisation as we know it. That is unless in that time, permanent and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society have taken place, including a reduction of CO2 emissions by at least 50%.
And please note that these calculations are depending on inventions that have not yet been invented at scale, inventions that are supposed to clear the atmosphere of astronomical amounts of carbon dioxide.
Furthermore, these calculations do not include unforeseen tipping points and feedback loops like the extremely powerful methane gas escaping from rapidly thawing arctic permafrost.
Nor do these scientific calculations include already locked-in warming hidden by toxic air pollution. Nor the aspect of equity – or climate justice – clearly stated throughout the Paris agreement, which is absolutely necessary to make it work on a global scale.
We must also bear in mind that these are just calculations. Estimations. That means that these “points of no return” may occur a bit sooner or later than 2030. No one can know for sure. We can, however, be certain that they will occur approximately in these timeframes, because these calculations are not opinions or wild guesses.
These projections are backed up by scientific facts, concluded by all nations through the IPCC. Nearly every single major national scientific body around the world unreservedly supports the work and findings of the IPCC.
Did you hear what I just said? Is my English OK? Is the microphone on? Because I’m beginning to wonder.
During the last six months I have travelled around Europe for hundreds of hours in trains, electric cars and buses, repeating these life-changing words over and over again. But no one seems to be talking about it, and nothing has changed. In fact, the emissions are still rising.
When I have been travelling around to speak in different countries, I am always offered help to write about the specific climate policies in specific countries. But that is not really necessary. Because the basic problem is the same everywhere. And the basic problem is that basically nothing is being done to halt – or even slow – climate and ecological breakdown, despite all the beautiful words and promises.
The UK is, however, very special. Not only for its mind-blowing historical carbon debt, but also for its current, very creative, carbon accounting.
Since 1990 the UK has achieved a 37% reduction of its territorial CO2 emissions, according to the Global Carbon Project. And that does sound very impressive. But these numbers do not include emissions from aviation, shipping and those associated with imports and exports. If these numbers are included the reduction is around 10% since 1990 – or an an average of 0.4% a year, according to Tyndall Manchester.And the main reason for this reduction is not a consequence of climate policies, but rather a 2001 EU directive on air quality that essentially forced the UK to close down its very old and extremely dirty coal power plants and replace them with less dirty gas power stations. And switching from one disastrous energy source to a slightly less disastrous one will of course result in a lowering of emissions.
But perhaps the most dangerous misconception about the climate crisis is that we have to “lower” our emissions. Because that is far from enough. Our emissions have to stop if we are to stay below 1.5-2C of warming. The “lowering of emissions” is of course necessary but it is only the beginning of a fast process that must lead to a stop within a couple of decades, or less. And by “stop” I mean net zero – and then quickly on to negative figures. That rules out most of today’s politics.
The fact that we are speaking of “lowering” instead of “stopping” emissions is perhaps the greatest force behind the continuing business as usual. The UK’s active current support of new exploitation of fossil fuels – for example, the UK shale gas fracking industry, the expansion of its North Sea oil and gas fields, the expansion of airports as well as the planning permission for a brand new coal mine – is beyond absurd.
This ongoing irresponsible behaviour will no doubt be remembered in history as one of the greatest failures of humankind.
People always tell me and the other millions of school strikers that we should be proud of ourselves for what we have accomplished. But the only thing that we need to look at is the emission curve. And I’m sorry, but it’s still rising. That curve is the only thing we should look at.
Every time we make a decision we should ask ourselves; how will this decision affect that curve? We should no longer measure our wealth and success in the graph that shows economic growth, but in the curve that shows the emissions of greenhouse gases. We should no longer only ask: “Have we got enough money to go through with this?” but also: “Have we got enough of the carbon budget to spare to go through with this?” That should and must become the centre of our new currency.
Many people say that we don’t have any solutions to the climate crisis. And they are right. Because how could we? How do you “solve” the greatest crisis that humanity has ever faced? How do you “solve” a war? How do you “solve” going to the moon for the first time? How do you “solve” inventing new inventions?
The climate crisis is both the easiest and the hardest issue we have ever faced. The easiest because we know what we must do. We must stop the emissions of greenhouse gases. The hardest because our current economics are still totally dependent on burning fossil fuels, and thereby destroying ecosystems in order to create everlasting economic growth.
“So, exactly how do we solve that?” you ask us – the schoolchildren striking for the climate.
And we say: “No one knows for sure. But we have to stop burning fossil fuels and restore nature and many other things that we may not have quite figured out yet.”
Then you say: “That’s not an answer!”
So we say: “We have to start treating the crisis like a crisis – and act even if we don’t have all the solutions.”
“That’s still not an answer,” you say.
Then we start talking about circular economy and rewilding nature and the need for a just transition. Then you don’t understand what we are talking about.
We say that all those solutions needed are not known to anyone and therefore we must unite behind the science and find them together along the way. But you do not listen to that. Because those answers are for solving a crisis that most of you don’t even fully understand. Or don’t want to understand.
You don’t listen to the science because you are only interested in solutions that will enable you to carry on like before. Like now. And those answers don’t exist any more. Because you did not act in time.
Avoiding climate breakdown will require cathedral thinking. We must lay the foundation while we may not know exactly how to build the ceiling.
Sometimes we just simply have to find a way. The moment we decide to fulfil something, we can do anything. And I’m sure that the moment we start behaving as if we were in an emergency, we can avoid climate and ecological catastrophe. Humans are very adaptable: we can still fix this. But the opportunity to do so will not last for long. We must start today. We have no more excuses.
We children are not sacrificing our education and our childhood for you to tell us what you consider is politically possible in the society that you have created. We have not taken to the streets for you to take selfies with us, and tell us that you really admire what we do.
We children are doing this to wake the adults up. We children are doing this for you to put your differences aside and start acting as you would in a crisis. We children are doing this because we want our hopes and dreams back.
I hope my microphone was on. I hope you could all hear me.

The protests have been met with both resounding support and disapproval. Still, millions of people have now heard their call for transformative and urgent change to avoid climate catastrophe.
It’s a message echoed by Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist, who is speaking in parliament on Tuesday, and the young people across the world who continue to strike from school each Friday. The climate conversation has now gone mainstream; earlier in the week the BBC aired a primetime documentary from David Attenborough, Climate Change: The Facts, while Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, warned the global financial system faces an existential threat from climate change.
It feels as though the message about the climate emergency is being pushed further than ever before.
We want to know how you have been affected by this movement in the UK. Has it opened your eyes to the climate issue? Have the school strikes and Extinction Rebellion protests changed your perspective and understanding of the climate emergency? What are the reactions of people around you? Have you and others reacted positively or negatively? Do you feel hopeful or frightened for the future?

They may be enjoying life free of the ties and responsibility of children, working at jobs they love and have studied for and struggled to obtain – jobs they know will be touched by having children in ways that a man’s career won’t.
Women are more than their biological ability to give birth, and I salute those who choose to explore and reach their own potential before deciding if they want to undertake the huge task of producing and raising another human being.Roz TreadwaySheringham, Norfolk
• I’m sorry that Zoe Williams, or anyone, felt or feels diminished over breastfeeding (The ‘breast is best’ lobby has failed women, Journal, 23 April). I’m pleased the National Childbirth Trust, or anyone, is able to devote resources to postnatal mental health. I’d like to say more, but the purpose of this letter is to object to the Guardian’s identification, in a front-page trail for this article, of advocates of breastfeeding as a “mafia”.Jan DubéPeebles, Scottish Borders
• Glorifying the sexualisation of women’s breasts to slag off breastfeeding campaigns is hardly a feminist strategy. Neither is pretending it’s all about individual choice. The breastfeeding debate, like that of climate change, would benefit from more systemic analysis. They have the same root problem – an economic system that aims to turn everything (water, air, life, child-rearing) into a commodity for profit and relies on the free labour of women to succeed.
Formula corporations operate like fossil-fuel ones, ruthlessly pursuing billions in profits and lobbying hard against international guidelines on breast milk. If we realise the climate crisis needs structural solutions, why not this? Is it because picking apart women’s choices is always fair game?Kirtana ChandrasekaranEdinburgh

After all, in the blink of an evolutionary eye we have gone from being able to stand upright to being able to fly off our planet, from believing that the horizon was the end of the earth to being able to peer into deep space-time, from understanding how our bodies work to being on the verge of being able to create life itself. We love to compete and we love to collaborate, often combining both activities in the name of sport. We are inherently social and have formed our immensely complex civilisation on the basis of agreeing what is “socially acceptable” and enshrining that with laws and rules.
With climate change, where we have gone astray is failing to update those laws and rules to cope with our burgeoning population, especially in our relationship with nature and the functioning of our economy.
There are two actions we could take that would transform our chances of surviving into the future. The first would be to enact a law of ecocide – the death of whose principal proponent was sadly reported in the same issue (Polly Higgins, tireless advocate for ecocide law, dies aged 50, 23 April). And the second would be to change the rules of accounting so that all companies using natural resources had to reinvest, say, 2% of their revenues in the restoration and repair of the natural environment.
In Extinction Rebellion and the UK Student Climate Network, we are seeing the emergence of social acceptance that it is wrong to not just allow but to actively reward the destruction of our future. We now need to press for these rule changes that would bring our destructive economy under control.Harold ForbesWareham, Dorset
• Greta Thunberg hits the nail on the head in calling for more support from the older generation and for the unions to get more active in tackling climate change (Activist lends support to general strike for the climate, 23 April). A crucial part of generating this support is to recognise that any effective response to the climate threat will mean a massive green infrastructure programme which will generate jobs in every constituency. This would include a labour-intensive upgrading of the energy efficiency of every building countrywide, plus the upgrading of local transport systems and recycling provision.
To get support for this approach not only from older people, but also more conservative ones, it will be imperative to emphasise the advantages for small and medium-sized businesses, as well as the investment and savings opportunities involved in addressing climate change. Add to this the concerns of these sectors of society about the future of their children and grandchildren, and this approach should result in a broader range of support for a net zero-carbon future. As such it should appeal to all political parties and so help ensure the urgent demands of Thunberg and Extinction Rebellion can be more swiftly met. Colin HinesConvener, UK Green New Deal Group 
• While I applaud the awareness being raised by Extinction Rebellion campaigners, I object to Gaby Hinsliff saying “past generations were oblivious” (Opinion, 20 April).
I am 73 and was brought up just after the war. We had no plastic bags and walked to the shops with our own bags. We got 2d on returned glass bottles. We walked to school. We beat cakes with a wooden spoon. We dried our clothes on the line. There was no bubble wrap – we used scrunched-up newspapers for fragile things and also for takeaway fish and chips. We pushed lawnmowers and we didn’t drive to the gym to get our exercise.
I could go on! As soon as new products came in, such as plastic and labour-saving electrical goods, some of us realised they were polluting and led to tremendous waste, so I don’t feel our postwar generation should be held entirely responsible for our present appalling climate problems and ocean pollution.Elizabeth EarlChard, Somerset
• We are experiencing two protest movements – Extinction Rebellion and Brexit – which might seem to be diametrically opposed. But to what extent do they reflect a shared understanding – that, at least for rich and ageing societies, the costs of a growing GDP are simply too high? For some those costs are represented by the need for an immigrant workforce; for others they are the destruction of the environment. But both movements can be seen as a call for deceleration – a call that traditional politicians simply do not have the language to meet. The empty branding that characterises our main political parties no longer reflects any significant values; the chasms within those parties make that abundantly clear. The response to both these protests – however different they appear – will require a new narrative of interdependence between citizens, particularly between young and old; we need a revised vocabulary to enable new kinds of conversation. Charlotte RouechéLondon
• I write in response to letters published on 20 April. I can assure Jean Corston that many Extinction Rebellion members go far beyond using a green energy supplier. We can also tell her that individuals’ energy suppliers don’t count for much if your government’s energy policy is fracking and nuclear power stations.
Yes, Andy Brown, most protesters are white but, as I said to a fellow protester, if I were a young black man I would not want to risk being arrested for fear of how a historically institutionally racist judiciary and job market might treat me. Incidentally, the only people to verbally abuse me were white; the many black and non-British people who stopped to talk were all very supportive.
Finally, I can tell Colin Baker that, apart from the initial jams last Monday, the police did an admirable job in keeping traffic flowing and minimising disruption. What will be interesting to see is the pollution records for London over the week. Many car journeys in central London are unnecessary, and if we showed some people an alternative way to travel, that can only be for the good of all of our lungs.
I did not take part in acts of civil disobedience lightly, but to help protect the beautiful country, and world, that I live in – not just for my son but for future generations.Rebecca FrickerLoughton, Essex
• I welcome the contributions from Mark Carney and Larry Elliott (Mark Carney’s warning on climate change is only a start, 18 April) on the role of finance and global heating, but as I returned home after five days on the bridge, what struck me most was the silence from our politicians.
Perhaps I was too busy handing out sunscreen or enjoying the atmosphere and music. Or is it because our government has nothing to say on anything? Paradigm shifts in public attitudes and even revolutions occur when the right time comes.
Extinction Rebellion have, unlike our politicians, through long preparation and some luck, appeared on the scene just when our politicians’ minds have been emptied of coherent thought, and the supporting establishment (here business and the cut-to-the-bone police) has lost confidence in them.John PaynePenallt, Monmouthshire

The front-page story said that conditions in the UK for Anopheles atroparvus, the indigenous mosquito most likely to carry malaria, were improving so much that the disease could return in about 2020. Critics considered it alarmist.
Since malaria, referred to as the ague, was common enough in the UK to be mentioned nine times in Shakespeare’s plays, it did not seem too far-fetched a claim but it caused a lot of debate.
The argument seemed to be that while conditions for mosquitoes were improving, and they are thriving in the UK’s current climate, it would need the misfortune of a human already infected with malaria to be bitten in order to transmit the disease to the insects. 
The infected insect would then have to bite another human to spread the disease locally. Since more than a million UK citizens currently go to malaria-infested countries each year and round 1,500 return with the disease it seems we have been lucky so far.

Air quality in the US has been improving since the 1970s, but that progress may be backsliding and 43% of Americans are now living in places where they are breathing unsafe air, according to the American Lung Association report.
As temperatures rise, wildfires are getting worse and spewing smoke across the west. And more smog, or ozone, is forming on warmer days. 
For the three hottest years on record, 2015 through 2017, about 141 million people lived in US counties that saw unhealthy levels of particle pollution, either in a single 24-hour period or over a year, or unhealthy levels of smog. That is 7 million more people than in the group’s last report.
“We’re seeing in this year’s report the impacts of climate change on air quality in really stunning terms,” said Paul Billings, a vice-president for the association.
Source: American Lung Association's 2019 State of the Air Report 
Eight communities set records for days with spikes in particle pollution, surpassing the group’s data back to 2001, Billings said.
Western wildfires might be to blame for much of the uptick, and next year’s report counting 2018 is expected to be even worse, he said.
In California, Bakersfield and the Fresno area had among the worst air quality in the country, according to all three measurements. Los Angeles continued to rank worst for smog. Fairbanks, Alaska, ranked third for particle pollution, probably because so many people burn wood to heat their homes.
The report is the health advocacy group’s annual assessment of government data.
Both smog and particle pollution are linked with breathing problems, lung and heart complications and early deaths. Smog occurs when sunlight reacts with gases from cars and power plants. Particle pollution also comes from burning fossil fuels, as well as from burning wood in fireplaces or stoves, and from wildfires.
The federal government’s National Climate Assessment explains that smog levels can increase with warmer days and both smog and particle pollution can increase when weather is stagnant. Worse droughts could also lead to more wind-blown dust.
Air pollution has fallen for decades in the US, due to pollution laws like the 1970 Clean Air Act and the use of less coal and more natural gas.
One 2018 study found that deaths from air pollution in the US were cut in half between 1990 and 2010. But they still accounted for one out of every 35 deaths – more than from traffic accidents and shootings combined.
In comparison, more than 5.5 billion people worldwide, 75% of the population, live in places that do not meet the World Health Organization standard for limiting particle pollution, according to the University of Chicago.
The Trump administration has sought to roll back Obama-era environmental progress, including on air and climate pollution regulations, such as rules for power plants and cars.
Miles Keogh, the executive director for the National Association of State Air Agencies, said weakening air standards would mean “walking away from a winning strategy”.
“We’ve got the tools here,” Keogh said. “We’ve got to use them to shore it up, adapt them to a changing climate and not walk away from things that work.”

Since the wave of protests began more than a week ago, 30,000 new backers or volunteers have offered their support to the environmental activist group. In the same period it has raised almost £200,000 – mostly in donations of between £10 and £50 – reaching a total of £365,000 since January.
The group said the figures showed the public was waking up to the scale of the crisis, adding that pressure was growing on politicians to act.
Extinction Rebellion is an international protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues. Demonstration have included blocking bridges to traffic in London and a semi-naked protest inside the House of Commons. 
The group says climate breakdown threatens all life on Earth, and so it is rebelling against politicians who 'have failed us', to provoke radical change that will stave off a climate emergency.
“What this shows is that Extinction Rebellion has spoken to people who have been wanting to act on this for such a long time but haven’t known how,” said a spokesperson for the group. “The debate on this is over – ordinary people are now saying it is time for politicians to act with real urgency.”
The group said the number of people on the streets for the protests had dwindled from a high over the Easter bank holiday weekend but that the number of people who had signed up to support future demonstrations had risen from 10,000 before the protest to 40,000 by Wednesday morning.
The Extinction Rebellion spokesperson said the group was also becoming more diverse – attracting more working-class and black and minority ethnic supporters. “But that is definitely a work in progress – there is still more work to do in that area,” she added.
The figures came a day after Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish student, who sparked a global youth-based movement when she began a “climate strike” outside Sweden’s parliament last year, visited Westminster.
In a speech to MPs, she said: “You lied to us. You gave us false hope. You told us that the future was something to look forward to. You don’t listen to the science because you are only interested in solutions that will enable you to carry on like before.”
Extinction Rebellion’s youth group wrote to MPs on Wednesday, as parliament restarted after the Easter break, pleading with them to act swiftly to address the crisis.
The letter states: “We are writing to ask you to hear the science, to feel the public’s change of heart and to act now to save our futures … Now the time has arrived to stand up and be counted – you are our elected representatives and we need your help.”
More than 1,000 Extinction Rebellion activists have been arrested in the past week in a campaign of mass non-violent direct action to highlight how little time there is to halt manmade ecological breakdown.
Protesters occupied four sites across the capital and staged acts of civil disobedience including blocking roads, disrupting a train line and conducting a protest at Heathrow.
On Tuesday, the group said it intended to carry out further action in the next few days – including blocking roads in and around the City of London on Thursday. It is debating how and when to stop this stage of the protests.
On Tuesday, senior Labour figures backed the protesters, likening them to the Chartists, suffragettes and anti-apartheid activists.
Speaking in response to an urgent question in the Commons, the shadow energy minister, Barry Gardiner said alongside the school strikes, the Extinction Rebellion protests were reminiscent of previous struggles.
“All of those victories were won by citizens uniting against injustice, making their voice heard. And Extinction Rebellion and the school climate strikers are doing just that,” he said.
Jon Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, came out to speak to the crowd, pledging to make climate change a central focus of Labour’s health and wellbeing policy and expressing his support for a citizens’ assembly.
Inside the chamber, the former Labour leader Ed Miliband said the government must declare a climate emergency and introduce a “green new deal”.
Miliband, who was the energy and climate change secretary under Gordon Brown, said the protesters were correct. “The truth is the planet is warming far faster than we are acting,” he said. “Climate change is not some theoretical future prospect, but is with us here and now.”
Responding for the government, Claire Perry, the energy minister, rejected the idea of a climate emergency – “I don’t know what that would entail” – and said she had reservations about the Extinction Rebellion protests.
She said though she was glad such arguments were being heard, they had caused “disruption for many hundreds and thousands of hard-working Londoners and they have required a heavy policing presence. I worry that many of the messages we are hearing ignore the progress that is being made, and as such make people fearful for the future rather than hopeful.”

Capitalism is self correcting and the article highlights that with Government push businesses will see they will lose existing profits if they do not act in ways that the public see as reducing global warming, or they will miss out on future profits to be had from not investing in global warming reducing activities and products.
The UK has reduced its carbon footprint dramatically by, for instance, the Government shutting down most coal burning energy production, by businesses investing in the development of electric cars and particularly by the collective development of wind powered and solar panel energy sources.
China and India are the countries on which pressure needs be applied.
China is to be much lauded for its technological development of solar panels but castigated for its frightening investment in coal burning power stations.

Extinction rebellion don't understand the role of government, it makes laws yes, but laws cannot be unreasonable, as knute demonstrated the power of law cannot hold back the tide. For example zero emission housing could be made mandatory but the practicality of doing so would be problematic. Many attempts have been made with various results, usually disappointing and at great expense meaning the consequences of the law would be less housing built and the use of loopholes and fraud. It wouldn't help with existing buildings either and the its actual impact would be slow unless we started mass demolitions, which would be politically very difficult.
Thats not to say thire is nothing that they can do, in fact quite a bit of legislation has already been introduced and simple stuff like banning crypto currency mining would be a fairly easy win. 
Government's can obviously also build infrastructure but the problem here is like brexiters, eco protestors say they all want the same thing, lower carbon emissions but when effort are implemented one faction or other doesn't like the solution.

BQENDDoing something right, even if for the ""wrong"" reasons, is still doing something right.
Thinking otherwise seems to be an attitude of looking for (or seeking to create) splits in the population. How exactly is that meant to produce a positive outcome? How will it bring more people to the cause? It's far more likely to do the opposite.
And if you don't believe me, just look at the rats in a sack that many of the leading proponents of Brexit resemble: they seem far more interested in upholding the purity of their sort of Brexit than they are in Brexit (of any sort) being actually delivered.

Climate change should not actually be a political issue - it's a scientific and engineering issue.
All parties should (jointly) set out cut-off dates for dealing with fossil fuels, and economic sanctions should apply to countries that don't adopt similar cut-off dates.
The cut-off dates can vary, according to the specific uses of fossil fuels.
All the main UK political parties signed an agreement that coal cannot be used to produce electricity in the UK after a cut off date - 2030.
This means no change of policy if there is a change of government, and the generators have clarity.
In reality, it looks like coal will be eliminated from electricity generation by 2025 - in fact I've seen a very recent suggestion it'll actually be done by 2023.
A number of countries are setting cut-off dates for registering new petrol or diesel vehicles.
As a result, I suspect that by around 2030 no car maker will be putting old engine technologies in new models.
Cut-off dates worked for removing lead from petrol, and for dealing with CFCs that strip the ozone layer.
For fossil fuels we need different cut-off dates, dealing with the easier fuels and uses first.
The UK Climate Change Committee that advises the government says that by 2025 we need to stop connecting new buildings to the gas grid - an earlier date would be better.
Space heating is one of the more difficult issues, but this is a start.
The global economy needs to be carbon-neutral within 3 decades, and even then we are stressing the earth's systems.
The current rate of rise in CO2 is faster than during the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum.
The fossil record in rocks formed around the equator during the PETM is really poor, and that's an indication that life in the tropics was extremely stressed.

""Temporal Scaling of Carbon Emission and Accumulation Rates: Modern Anthropogenic Emissions Compared to Estimates of PETM‐Onset Accumulation"" - Gingerich, 2019
confirms and builds on what was already known about the PETM:

""The Paleocene‐Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) is a global greenhouse warming event that happened 56 million years ago, causing extinction in the world's oceans and accelerated evolution on the continents....... 
If the present trend of increasing carbon emissions continues, we may see PETM‐magnitude extinction and accelerated evolution in as few as 140 years or about five human generations.

Climate change | Martha Gill,article,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/17/climate-change-extinction-rebellion-mark-carney-bank-of-england-protests,64,"This morning two very different kinds of harbingers brought us a message of climate doom. One was a colourful crowd of climate activists called Extinction Rebellion, who have been blocking traffic in London for the last two days, and who are today planning further “economic disruption” aimed directly at the city’s jugular: the tube and rail networks.
The other was less expected. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, along with the governor of France’s central bank, Villeroy de Galhau, has written an article for the Guardian warning banks and insurers that climate change threatens them too. In the wallet. Insurance claims from droughts and floods are bad for business. Then there’s the fact that governments are now taking carbon emissions seriously, which means companies that don’t adjust will likely be adjusted out of existence. And at a certain point, when climate catastrophe deepens, there will be a “Minsky moment” – a sudden collapse in asset prices, true economic disruption.
It feels like an important moment, this joining together of the solemn and besuited with the members of a group last seen supergluing their arses to the gallery glass in the House of Commons. It amplifies the message. Tackling climate change is, after all, about psychology. How should one talk about catastrophe? Make a problem too big and people will simply ignore it (just look at Brexit). Tell them it is too late, and the human instinct is to give up, rather than make vast efforts to save the scraps. And guilt doesn’t work on most people either – they are too wrapped up in their daily concerns. This is true of institutions too: David Cameron’s government was keen on green measures for a while, but only until something more important came along.
But there are certain milestones movements can hit, when it feels as if they are on their way. One is that they become cool. This happened to the modern feminist movement around the time Caitlin Moran’s book How to Be a Woman hit the shelves in 2011. It has gradually happened to climate activism too. Veganism is no longer something to sneer at. Celebrities who might have once tried to avoid looking too “hempy” now fall over themselves to burnish their climate credentials.
But an even more important milestone – when you know the movement has really picked up speed – comes when it directly threatens those in power. For feminism, again, this was #MeToo: the fear it has inspired among powerful men has done more for equality than decades of gentle awareness raising and women-friendly schemes. And now Carney is framing climate change in a language banks understand: as a threat to profits. It will add to other messages reaching the city. Five Volkswagen executives face up to a decade in prison for their role in faked diesel emission tests – a scandal that has also taken a chunk out of car sales. The investor Legal and General is cutting out companies they judge bad for the climate. For the planet, a turning point might just be at hand.

With climate change persisting as a significant campaign flashpoint, the chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, James Pearson, told Guardian Australia international permits were part of the toolkit for mitigating climate change in a cost-effective way.
“Australia’s carbon emissions reduction policies should be stable, predictable and provide long-term certainty for business,” Pearson said. “They should include access to credible international offsets; be market-based; implemented nationally; and minimise the potential for carbon leakage”.
Emma Herd, the chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change, which represents institutional investors, such as super funds, with total funds under management of over $2tn, said international carbon credits were a key component of meeting Australia’s Paris targets.
“They must have integrity and there should be limits on the amount you can use, but there is wide agreement that they have to be part of the policy toolkit,” Herd said.
She noted that the Morrison government – despite its recent criticisms – had been “negotiating hard” for Article 6 of the Paris agreement “to support credible carbon markets which deliver access to international offsets for Australian business”.
Herd pointed out that during the last climate change talks in Poland in December last year, that issue “was actually a core priority for Australian negotiators”.
The Business Council of Australia and the AiGroup also pointed to their previous statements of support for the use of permits on Thursday.
After days of the Coalition bombarding Labor’s climate policy, and in response to claims that business could be forced to spend between $25bn and $35bn on international credits to meet a 45% pollution reduction target, Bill Shorten muscled up on the hustings in Darwin on Thursday.
Shorten abandoned the low-key demeanour he has made a study of projecting in the opening week of the campaign, and branded the government’s campaign against Labor’s climate change policies “malicious and stupid”.
“It’s a malicious campaign by this government,” the Labor leader said. “What they want to do is scare Australians and say that it’s too hard to take action on climate change.
“In climate change, there will never be enough figures to satisfy the climate sceptics. If you don’t believe in the science of climate change, no amount of evidence will ever convince you because, fundamentally, it’s a stupid position not to take action.”
Labor is proposing an emissions reduction target of 45% and has signalled business will be permitted to use international permits to help meet its liabilities.
Herd told Guardian Australia some of the cost estimates being deployed during the election campaign about permits appeared to be based on the European Unit Allowance, the compliance unit in the European Emissions Trading Scheme.
“This is the most expensive reference price you could currently find,” she said. “Project-based international offset credits are usually much cheaper, especially if the company has in place a direct off-take agreement with the project”.
She pointed out the local carbon price, the Australian Carbon Credit Unit, was also significantly cheaper than the European allowance price being quoted. “It looks like much of the commentary is potentially conflating the EU compliance price with international offsets, and then using it as a generic carbon price to calculate an inflated total cost of climate action for Australia. This is not helpful for anyone.”
While Morrison is now pillorying the use of permits, the Coalition in 2017, when the current treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, was environment minister, took a decision “in principle” to allow the use of foreign carbon credits.
When it reviewed its existing suite of climate change policies in late 2017, the government accepted the use of permits and said a final decision “on the timing of use and appropriate quantity and quality limits” would be taken by 2020.
On Thursday, on the hustings in Tasmania, Scott Morrison declared Shorten “can’t even tell you how much money that companies are going to have to send offshore”.
“The Australian reports today $25bn, we actually think it’s higher than that. I understand it’s around $35bn that they will force companies to send offshore for those foreign carbon credits.
“That could be invested here in Australia, in employing more people, increasing wages.”
Morrison also appeared to leave open the option the government could consider nuclear energy during a radio interview in Tasmania. He said the government didn’t intend to subsidise nuclear energy but it was “not, not on the agenda”, even though there are legislative bans on nuclear energy.
The prime minister suggested the test of whether a project could proceed was whether it could pay its own way, and he said the evidence to date suggested nuclear power was too expensive.

India is responsible for only 3% of the climate-altering rise in CO2 to date (compared to 50% for USA and EU combined). Even today they contribute just 6% of global emissions, despite harbouring 18% of the world's population.
And yet, unbelievably, every day here BTL people suggest that Indians are the problem, not themselves. It's shameful, really.

No country gives up sovereignty to the UN. They make treaties and agreements that are organised by the UN. You're sounding like a bog standard Brexiteer who has no idea how international law works.

Of those four countries, only one is delinquent in international obligations.

Carbon dioxide is amassing in the atmosphere at levels not seen for millions of years when there were trees at the South Pole and Florida was under water. We have barely a decade to make amends. Protesters are on the streets.
But huge numbers of people have not given up. Not yet. Call them the carbon cutters. They are companies and cities, niche groups and nations. They are commuters and communes, off-gridders and off-setters, investors and institutions – and countless individuals, cutting their meat intake, installing solar panels, eschewing gas guzzlers and long-haul flights.
The Guardian’s Upside team heard from more than 200 carbon cutters in a callout to readers. We followed up their tips and showcase eight examples here, with many more in the comment thread. Their example in cutting carbon is a challenge to us all.
They are calling it “the world’s first sustainable season”, created by a Swedish orchestra so determined to cut its emissions that it has promised not to employ any musicians or conductors who travel by air.
“We are convinced that we can get all we need in terms of talent and artistic energy from within Europe, and from people living in Europe who come from other parts of the world,” said Fredrik Österling, director of Helsingborg Symphony Orchestra. “You can’t hear if a conductor comes from Venezuela or from China or from England. The differences are very, very small.”
Österling and his team are reaching out to artists, conductors and composers willing to make their way to the Swedish city by train, road or boat. Participants will be invited to suggest pieces or even whole programmes for the season, which will start in September 2020.Österling said that the idea for a no-flight season had come to him when the Swedish cellist Jakob Koranyi, who had travelled down from Stockholm by the night train, asked him what he was doing to compensate for the flights taken by other players. “Among the new generation of musicians, you often find this, that they choose to become vegans or vegetarians, and that they think about the CO2 footprint they have,” Österling said.
Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?
This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.

On the day he announced the idea, he said he was contacted by an Armenian pianist living in Vienna who had offered to take the train up to Sweden to play.In a typical season he estimated that his concert hall generated roughly 100 flights.  “It’s always been as if ‘art is above these issues’,” he said. “We are saying that we don’t believe that art is above the environment. The timeline is so short now, that we all have to contribute.” Richard Orange in Malmo
Costa Rica has long been ahead of the crowd. Blessed with abundant hydropower, its emissions peaked in 1999 and in 2017 its power system ran for a record 300 days on clean sources.
Now its president has vowed to eliminate net greenhouse gas emissions totally by 2050, meaning it would produce no more emissions than it can offset through activities such as expanding forests.
The country’s electricity, 98% of which is already derived from renewable sources, would be entirely clean by this point, while transport, which accounts for 40% of current emissions, would be transformed by requiring sales of new cars and trucks to be zero-emission only. The plan also targets the elimination of emissions from buildings, industry and waste disposal.
Carlos Alvarado, the president of Costa Rica, said that the plan should be used as a blueprint for other governments to help meet the increasingly urgent task of cutting emissions to avoid disastrous climate change.
“We have committed ourselves to be an international laboratory for decarbonisation and we are standing true to that commitment,” Alvarado told the Guardian. “We want to lead by example. Our strongest contribution is to demonstrate the possibilities. It’s not only possible but it’s necessary.”
Alvarado, a 39-year-old who was elected in April 2018, said countries need not be deterred by US inaction on climate change. 
“Imagine humanity is in the middle of an electric car race to survive and let’s say one of the big vehicles instead of moving forward just parked in the road,” Alvarado said. “The rest of us could stop and stare or we can continue our journey. We will need everybody but we also need to keep moving forward because time is part of this equation.
“In 2050, my son will be 37 and he will ask if I did enough for the planet and humanity to continue its existence. I better have a good answer. We need to do this because it’s the right thing to do.” Oliver Milman in New York
AB InBev brews a lot of beer – about 3,000 pints a second. If that sounds like one gigantic hangover, consider this: to do that it requires about 6.6 terawatt hours of electricity each year – about the same as Latvia.
Now it says it aims to generate that power solely through renewable means by 2025. For the most part, it will do so through so-called power purchasing arrangements – direct contracts with renewable suppliers. But it also plans to install its own solar and other generators on its sites.
Already, it says, about half its power in the US comes from renewables – enough to brew about 10bn pints.
“We believe climate change is real,” says Tony Milikin, the company’s chief sustainability officer. “We want other companies to jump on the flywheel that we’re on.” Mark Rice-Oxley
Wellington is getting greener. Literally. It’s been planting a tree every five minutes, on average, for the past 15 years – more than 1.5m in total.
Native species such as Rata, Kowhai and Kanuka are being prioritised, with the aim of creating a ‘green corridor’ for native bird species that have already begun to spillover into locals gardens from their protected habitat at the Zelandia eco-sanctuary.
Wellington mayor Justin Lester says the capital is New Zealand’s greenest city, and one of the few cities in the world where bio-diversity is increasing. Last month, it was named as the world’s least polluted capital, though that is also down to prevailing winds.
“Wellingtonians are proud of this transformation and are acting on it,” he says. “The most common conservation activity is tree planting - about 40% of Wellington residents have planted a native tree at home.”
The upshot is that although the city still has a battle on its hands to reduce emissions from traffic, the impact of all those leaves is starting to be felt. Trees act as a natural sink for carbon and about 40 percent of the city’s emissions are now mitigated by so-called land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) activities.
 According to the council almost half of the city’s urban area is now forested. By comparison’s 39% of Auckland is forested and 22% of Christchurch.
The Wellington tree planting project will contribute to a central government plan to plant one billion trees by 2028, which forms part of New Zealand’s ambition to be carbon zero by 2050. Eleanor Ainge Roy in Auckland
Aviation accounts for just over 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and it is one of the fastest growing areas. Its real effect on warming is several times greater because the emissions have more impact at altitude.
Growth is fuelled by globalisation and the rise of ultra-cheap flights. The airline industry has made gestures towards sustainability, but with little impact, and governments have shown great reluctance to rein in an industry seen as popular and strategic.
Into this vacuum, individuals have started to bring their own actions. “We are in a climate emergency and need to radically reduce our emissions to avert climate breakdown,” says Anna Hughes, of the UK’s FlightFree campaign. “Aviation is the biggest contributor to an individual’s carbon footprint [if they fly], and people are often unwilling to change the way they live because individual action doesn’t seem to make a difference. But they are more likely to act if they can see others are acting too.”
Inspired by a similar campaign in Sweden, FlightFree invites people to pledge not to take any flights in 2020, if enough other people are willing to do the same. Should 100,000 people sign up, the pledges will be triggered, giving an incentive to early adopters to encourage as many others to take part as they can, and potentially saving more than 50,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2020.
More than the carbon savings – which are hard to estimate in advance because some of the signatories may be frequent flyers while others may fly rarely – is the sense of moral action, that individuals can spur change even in huge and politically protected industries.
An increasing number of short-haul flights are taken by better-off people in better-off countries taking advantage of cheap flights and low property prices to buy holiday homes in areas that not long ago would have been practically and economically inaccessible, according to research from the New Economics Foundation.
That is unsustainable. But there are alternatives, from taking trains and the increasing distances that electric cars are capable of, to changing the tax regime so that instead of being charged taxes per flight – which blindly penalises those who rarely fly as much as those who jet off every other weekend – taxation could be based on an individual’s flight patterns over the course of a year, in order to truly reflect the social cost of our newfound habits.
So far, in the few weeks of its operation, several hundred people have signed up to FlightFree. It will have succeeded if it makes people think more about how modern flying patterns have changed, and how the impacts of this can be managed equitably, without destroying the planet.
It all started with full-page ads in the parish magazine, but the effort to get the villagers of Loddiswell, Devon to switch to a renewable energy provider now involves the printing of several hundred postcards.
The man behind the plan is 65-year-old Plymouth city council worker Paul Vann: “I started a campaign to get villagers to switch to a green supplier like Bulb after finding out it offers 100% renewable energy. I was hoping to get a village-sized solar farm in the parish but unfortunately the power lines around here are at capacity.”
The local parish has been supportive of the idea and Vann believes that if his village can make the change then the benefits to the environment would be great: “Even if only 100 households switch that would be equivalent to planting thousands of trees. Imagine if all villages could do it.
“It’s all been done at a relatively low cost to me. The ads only cost a few tenners and the postcards around £75. I’ll be saving money too by delivering them myself.
“I’ve gone out on a limb but my hope is that we will achieve at least 100 switches.” Rachel Obordo
Showcasing some of the best folk productions in Ireland, the Siamsa Tíre National Folk Theatre is used to playing a pivotal role in the country’s cultural life. With the greening initiative it’s also having an impact on its carbon footprint by reducing the theatre’s energy usage by 41% since 2016.
“Remarkably the election of Donald Trump spurred me into action,” said Catríona Fallon, CEO of the theatre. “We have 40 solar photovoltaic panels on the roof and replaced our oil-fired heating system with an air-to-heat pump which is run on electricity sourced from renewables. We’ve also halved our waste to landfill in the last year, which has saved us €1,000.”
In terms of the future, Fallon is proposing to allow flexible working to reduce the theatre’s carbon footprint further: “We could look at closing the building on a Monday when there’s very little activity (October to April only) and allow most of the staff team to either work remotely or to rearrange their hours into four days rather than five.“I’m a bit of an environmental nerd in my private life. When Trump was elected I sensed that this was the moment when my colleagues began to understand some of the dangers facing us in terms of climate change and environmental degradation, so I grasped the nettle. They may have since regretted this!” Rachel Obordo
If emissions of carbon dioxide are inevitable, can we avoid the effects on global warming by capturing, reusing or in some other way preventing the gas reaching the atmosphere and contributing to climate change?
Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has been mooted for more than two decades as a potential solution to climate change, but little progress has been made in that time. There are a handful of plants currently operating and no widespread plans for its adoption on a scale that would make the difference needed to stave off dangerous levels of warming.
The Carbon Capture Machine (CCM), built by scientists from the University of Aberdeen, is a prototype capable of converting 200kg of carbon dioxide a day to liquid. The machine is now one of five technologies in the final for the NRG Cosia Carbon X Prize, and its grand prize of $7.5m (£5.7m).
Inside the machine, the gases arising from coal combustion are “scrubbed”, which is done with a water solution of sodium carbonate or sodium hydroxide. This process – which relates to techniques used a century ago to purify the air in submarines – separates carbon dioxide from other gases, such as water vapour and nitrogen, and produces stable dry solids, white in colour and harmless.
Fred Glasser, emeritus professor of chemistry at the University of Aberdeen, says: “The expensive bit [of CCS] is that to pump carbon dioxide to the disposal site [usually offshore] it has to be liquid. To make a liquid requires separation of carbon dioxide from nitrogen and oxygen. The separation process is expensive and potentially polluting.”
By solving this critical part of the CCS problem, Glasser believes the CCM – which will be tested at a site in Dry Fork, Wyoming, as part of the X Prize – provides a vital solution, and will be cheap as the components are off-the-shelf parts common in other industrial processes, and the dry byproducts can be sold.
Glasser, with partners Zoe Morrison and MS Imbabi, has spun off CCM from Aberdeen University, and though the company is still small (“I also help to wash up the teacups,” notes Glasser) the partners are “aware of the transformational nature of the work we are doing and realise its potential impact on combatting climate change”.
Yet the partners are unhappy that despite the international recognition of the X Prize, they have been “unable to get UK government support despite repeated applications and amicable discussions”. If the demonstration in Dry Fork is successful, the company expects to be about 12 to 18 months from commercial production of a scaled-up machine.
When the large-scale capture and storage of carbon dioxide was mooted widely in the early 2000s as a solution for coal-fired power plants, coal was cheap and alternatives expensive. Since then, the price of renewable energy from wind and the sun has plunged. Expensive CCS on such a massive scale may no longer be needed if these trends continue.
But there are chemical processes in vital industries that will continue to emit carbon dioxide even if the fuel used is renewable – cement is the classic example, as the breakdown of calcium carbonate it requires releases carbon dioxide as a byproduct. Removing and storing the carbon dioxide from concrete production is a potentially massive market where CCM is also applicable. Fiona Harvey

Far from big sources, this is an indicator for the whole northern hemisphere. Each day you will see the numbers change a little. Over the last year they varied between 404 and 415 parts per million (ppm). They were lowest in late summer due to plant photosynthesis and greatest in spring from emissions that accumulated during the winter.
But compare year on year and you will see CO2 rising as emissions from our fossil fuel burning exceed what natural systems absorb. Globally, about 70% of CO2 emissions comes from cities. In leafy Egham, west of London, summer CO2 decreases by day due to plant photosynthesis and then plant respiration releases some of this at night. Along with emissions from fossil fuels, typical summer days show a variation of about 25ppm. 
For nearly 10 years, scientists at King’s College London have been measuring CO2 right inside the city. Here, the daily changes from the plants are completely overwhelmed by emissions from traffic and building heating. Close to roads CO2 can reach 1,000ppm.

The organisers of the Youth Strike 4 Climate movement said “sizeable events” took place in London, Sheffield, Manchester and Brighton, among other towns and cities. They mirrored events around the world, as protesters from cities as far apart as Helsinki and Delhi took to the streets.
In London, protesters walked across Westminster Bridge waving banners demanding a “Green New Deal”, before bringing Oxford Street to a halt by sitting down in the middle of the famous shopping thoroughfare.
Drivers looked out of their car windows, irked as young people banged on their doors, telling them to turn their engines off. Bus drivers sat in traffic on gridlocked streets, their vehicles devoid of passengers.
George Bond, 16, one of the organisers of the youth climate strike said that they decided to disrupt London’s busy shopping district because of the link between consumerist culture and climate change.
“It’s a stark reminder that in the western world we enjoy a culture of convenience, while people in the global south are working in bad conditions and suffering the most from climate change,” he said.
The Metropolitan police said there had been no arrests, though one student was taken into a police van for refusing to move.
Earlier, between 400 and 800 students joined a range of youth and leftwing activist groups in Parliament Square. Theo Sharieff, 23, a Socialist Students organiser from Birmingham, said: “To fight climate change we need socialist change.”
Creative banners abounded. One youngster held a poster with teenage actor Timothee Chalamet which read “the Earth is getting hotter than Timothee Chalamet”. An eight-year-old, Agnes Freij from St Aidan’s primary school held a banner with a painting of Dr Zeus’ Lorax reading: “I am the Lorax and I speak for the trees.”
She told the Guardian: “The Lorax speaks for the trees because they don’t have mouths. Right now I think the trees would be saying, stop this climate crisis.”
In the Highlands, Holly Gillibrand, who has gained national prominence for her activism, was on strike for the 14th week in a row, in her usual spot outside her school in Fort William with friends. Gillibrand, 13, was not missing school because the Easter break is under way in Scotland.
She said: “I think it’s important to strike during the holidays because people were saying that we were on strike because we got to miss school. This shows were are dedicated and willing to give up our free time for this crisis.”
Gillibrand has met Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, and wants to see politicians take more action. “We’re a rich, developed country so we need to be reducing our emissions more quickly,” she said.
In Sheffield, the former Green party leader Natalie Bennett was among the speakers at a city centre rally.
At the end of the London march, a selection of letters were read out by activists at Oxford Circus, including submissions from Yoko Ono, Kate Tempest and Rebecca Solnit.
More than 15,000 students took part in the first Youth Strike 4 Climate event in February, which organisers said was prompted by the alarming inaction of the government. Precise figures for Friday’s turnout were not immediately available – but some found it easier to attend as some schools are already on their Easter break.
Jake Woodier, of the UK Student Climate Network, said: “Thousands upon thousands of young people across the UK have shown their resolve by continuing to demonstrate for climate justice for the third month in a row, while also demanding a Green New Deal for the UK.
“This idea is by the people, for the people and puts people and the planet on an equal footing. The time for action is now.”
The youth climate movement was inspired by the Swedish schoolgirl Greta Thunberg, 16, who has gone on strike every Friday since August 2018. Thunberg is currently in her 34th week of striking outside the Riksdag parliament building in Stockholm.
The latest strikes come after a UN report warned that limiting temperature increases to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels – the point beyond which climate impacts become irreversibly severe – needs new levels of action.
On Thursday, the environmentalist and broadcaster David Attenborough told the IMF spring meeting that humans have at most 20 years to prevent the complete destruction of the environment.
The Norwich South MP Clive Lewis signalled the Labour party’s support for the movement, writing: “The time for incrementalism has passed. The young people striking today recognise this.”
The environment secretary, Michael Gove, has expressed support for the strikes, saying collective action can make a “profound difference”.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/12/students-climate-strikes-protests-london-environment

We had to eat up the mushy produce as quickly as possible and some of it ended up going to waste. But my tribulations were nothing compared to the problems that Canada jays are having with their freezers right now.
As winter approaches Canada jays collect up all sorts of treats to see them through the winter – juicy beetles and centipedes, mushrooms, berries, little voles and mice. These tasty morsels are hidden throughout the forest and help to see them through the lean winter months. But new research, published this week in Royal Society Open Science, shows that Canada jays living at the southern edge of their range in Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario, are struggling. The data shows that over the last 40 years the number of winter freeze-thaw events has increased. It appears that this frequent defrosting of the jays’ winter larders is leaving the birds hungry and unable to bring up large broods the following spring.
Many other species also rely on sub-zero winters to keep their food supplies fresh. For all of them climate change is reducing their range and forcing them to keep moving polewards.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/apr/12/weatherwatch-canada-jays-suffer-as-milder-winters-defrost-their-supplies

About 2,300 volunteers have signed up with Extinction Rebellion to obstruct some of the capital’s busiest roads for at least three days.
The disruption is to be the UK element of what organisers hope will be an international movement to protest against environmental and ecological destruction. 
XR, which cites the civil rights movement and suffragettes as inspirations and is backed by senior scientists and academics, including the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, claims to have 331 groups in 49 countries, with 222 activists arrested worldwide for acts of non-violent civil disobedience since last autumn.
Eighty-five people were arrested in London in November when thousands of protesters, including families and pensioners, occupied five bridges.
The group is demanding immediate action over environmental destruction, after dire predictions that humans face an existential threat if climate change and the loss of biodiversity continues.
It is calling on the government to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025 and establish a citizens’ assembly to devise an emergency plan of action similar to that seen during the second world war.
“We don’t want to disrupt people, but our government’s failure over the last 30 years leaves us no choice,” an XR spokesperson said.
“Governments prioritise the short-term interests of the economic elites so, to get their attention, we have to disrupt the economy.”
On Monday at 11am, protesters in London plan to block traffic at Marble Arch, Oxford Circus, Waterloo Bridge, Parliament Square and Piccadilly Circus. Roadblocks will continue night and day at each site, reminiscent of the Occupy London protest camp outside St Paul’s Cathedral in 2011-12.
Participants are being warned they will be invited to take part in non-violent civil disobedience, and might be arrested. Organisers have circulated legal advice to anyone planning to attend, requested they refrain from using drugs and alcohol during the protest, and asked that they treat passersby and the environment with respect.
A Metropolitan police spokesperson declined to comment other than to say an appropriate policing plan will be in place.
Tiana Jacout, an XR coordinator, said the protest’s success relied on recruiting enough people. “It’s literally a numbers game at the moment,” she said. “The more people we have, the easier it is to hold the space.”
Organisers have promised a “full-scale festival of collective action and creative resistance”, including talks, workshops, musical and theatrical performances, and a roaming people’s assembly, hosted at each of the locations.
“What I have been saying to people is that [the climate crisis] is not an unknown thing any more,” Jacout said. “Polls have shown 70-80% of people want it dealt with. If in the past 10 years you have been sitting at home, thinking this is not right, something needs to happen: come, this is it.”
Almost 100 academics declared their support for XR in a letter published in the Guardian in October, which said: “When a government wilfully abrogates its responsibility to protect its citizens from harm and to secure the future for generations to come, it has failed in its most essential duty of stewardship.
“The ‘social contract’ has been broken, and it is therefore not only our right, but our moral duty to bypass the government’s inaction and flagrant dereliction of duty, and to rebel to defend life itself.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/13/extinction-rebellion-calls-protesters-block-london-streets

Until now, there’s been something of a leadership void. Anyone who so much as uttered the words “climate change” might find me looking up at them, awaiting instruction.
Now I feel like I can pick and choose. Perhaps it’s because people are competing with Greta Thunberg, the teenage agitator behind the climate strikes, but good adults are stepping into the limelight.
My latest climate crush is Dr Mae Jemison. Despite being famous for spending time in space – she became the first African American female in space in 1992, serving as a mission specialist on the space shuttle Endeavour – she is all about tackling climate change, on Earth and doing it now.
The funny thing about astronauts is that they are rare in everyday life but abundant on the climate circuit. Even I’ve met five. They are particularly prized for their “blue marble” moment, the point at which they glimpse the Earth from space. Their macro-perspective gives us some indication of where our micro-actions can help. But what I particularly rate about Jemison (and she is not one of those I’ve met) is the fact that her main message is essentially “get over yourself, human”. The Earth will carry on without you, so get focused on making sure you’re not ejected.
Last week, as part of a panel at Women in the World in New York, alongside Oprah Winfrey, she also kicked into touch the idea that we might up sticks and move our chaos to space when our tenancy here ends due to bad behaviour. “We must not use Mars as our Plan B,” she said.
Similar climate perspective was shown by Peruvian farmer and mountain guide Saul Luciano Lliuya (another of my personal climate leaders) when he filed a lawsuit against RWE, the German energy giant, alleging that its immense emissions threatened his family, his property and his home city of Huaraz, 6,500 miles away.
The case recently entered the evidentiary phase before the higher regional court in Hamburg. That might sound like a boring bit of process, but it’s of fundamental significance. The Lliuya case shows that everyday people can take on big emitters. It’s the David and Goliath showdown of our time. At the last count, 1,302 climate lawsuits were progressing through legal systems across the world. Some of them will win and change the stakes.
I’m wary of raising false hopes, but I think we may have found the purpose of Instagram. @ PreachersNSneakers takes a forensic look at the apparel choices of a clique of celebrity preachers that has coalesced around Justin Bieber.
Since Bieber embraced evangelical Christianity a few years ago, celebrity-connected pastors have entered the mainstream. These include Chad Veach, sometimes referred to as “Bieber’s pastor”; Carl Lentz, who apparently baptised Bieber in an NBA player’s bath; and one Rich Wilkerson Jr, who officiated at the wedding of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West. They amass huge audiences and Instagram followings and rock Bieber-inspired wardrobes.
Scrutinising the pictures of pastors at work has reaped rich rewards. Rather literally, the most expensive spot being a pair of Air Yeezy 2 “Red Octobers” worn by pastor John Gray, with a resale value of $5,611. This has raised questions over what the good lord might make of such materialism and whether a megachurch pastor should be a hype-beast.
Under fire over his $1,980 Gucci backpack and $794 Traxedos track pants, Chad Veach is the only man of (expensive) cloth to attempt a comeback so far, posting that he didn’t pay for his outfit. He quickly thought better of it and deleted it.
As with all trends propagated by social media, we should be wary of contagion. I recommend UK clergy restrict themselves to modestly priced Hush Puppies, with typical orthopaedic support. The last thing we need now is Rev Alan from The Archers attempting to hide his Yeezys under his cassock.
Hey, Jude Law, how does it feel to get a 100% approval rating? That’s what I’d ask at the end of the week when images of the actor filming (The New Pope) in white budgie smugglers generated meltdown.
It goes deeper than the prurient. Timing was important: Brexit day 9,000 or trunks? But the images also delivered meme heaven and played into a weird trend for objectifying priests (thanks, Fleabag).
But the unexpected element was how we felt about Jude. He’s been in our lives for many years. He’s had bad times and indeed bad films. But we’ve always rooted for him. “Has anyone in the history of humankind reacted to losing his hair better than Jude Law?” asked writer Joe Reid as we gloried in Jude’s buff pontiff snaps.
It’s not all sunlit uplands. Jude’s briefs have launched a hundred beach-body-ready guides increasing body image pressure on men. They will generate beachwear angst. “Holiday get-up for men is tricky territory,” advised the Telegraph, which is understatement of the year if you’re proposing tight white trunks. My advice – do not go there.
But Jude did, and he gave us a day off and broke the internet, so well done.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/13/mae-jemison-astronaut-down-to-earth-wisdom-climate-change

Basis of the calculation: An electric battery/solar/wind powered icebreaker is not feasible with today's technology.
Starting point. Design is 19,000 hp, = 15,000 kW. Duty cycle is variable, but when it's working as an ice breaker the max horsepower is required for 67% of the time, hence, for example, breaking the ice for a mail/grocery spring/winter run to northern Labrador.
Daily power consumption for propulsion alone, not including heating lighting the boat etc. is therefore .67 * 15,000 Kw * 24 hours = 241,000 kWh per day. Say 6 day round trip = 1,447,000 kWh energy required for trip. A Tesla 100 kWh battery pack including cooling, weighs about 1,300 lbs. The real capacity isn't 100 kWh, but let's ignore that for a moment.
The boat would require = 16,100 Tesla battery packs to make a 6 day trip (corrected for the 90% efficiency of electric motors) so battery weight would be about 9,500 metric tonnes. However, the displacement tonnage of the boat in question is only 17,300 tonnes. So take out the weight of the required diesel fuel for the same energy (at 40% for a diesel engine, but that ignores the fact that the waste heat is used to the heat the ship, whereas there's not enough waste heat to do the same from electric motors), which is about 53 metric tonnes of diesel fuel and you have a big problem: a battery powered boat of the same power consumption and hull design would sink with the weight of the required batteries.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1555211897000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'3638543', u'in_reply_to': u'128052738', u'id': u'128053916', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'DukeofWoyWoy', u'text': u'With the millions of Pounds that Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate is spending by anchoring a ship, the giant German polar research vessel Polarstern, with 50 scientists to a large ice flow in the Arctic to enable a real feature that climate change is doing to our planet.The information that they gather may help to combat, or at least, allow for some positive action to be taken instead of just burying our heads in the sand hoping that it'll just fizzle out and go away.Maybe we could arrange for some of our pollies to visit, just so they could get the realisation that climate change is real and is now happening, we can only hope that some type of answer is found and found quickly.', u'recommendation_count': u'3', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1555211110000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'100586208', u'id': u'128053845', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'MikeSw', u'text': u'You do understand that models are not 'certain', and that nobody would ever claim that they are, right?

The incident the article posted is a weather event not climate change, and that's why nothing of that magnitude it has happened since 2010. The Wikipedia article is notes no connection to glaciers as contributing to the event. I can see heavy rains melting the snow pack rapidly as it did in the in the Alberta Rockies in 2013.

Scenario 2: doors & windows opened, car started. Exhaust fumes build up in the room. 
What I mean to say is, the carbon you mention being locked up in limestone, was put down over time. It represents a process of pulling carbon out of the air and putting it away ‘safely’. (A bit like having doors and windows will help reduce the exhaust fumes building up in the room). By contrast burning fossil fuels is actually taking carbon that was locked up and putting it back into the atmosphere - and at a much faster rate than the earth is capable of locking it away. (A bit like starting the car inside a room. The problem isn’t the petrol sitting in the gas tank, the problem is starting the engine and not having a way to clear out the exhaust fumes). 
The two are different - one is a locking up CO2, the other is releasing CO2.

BQSTART
Global warming is contributing to a rapid melting of the Himalayan glaciers. Between 1970 and 2000, 9% of their ice volume was lost (1). In the period from 2003 to 2009, they lost about 170 gigatons of water often leading to catastrophic flooding throughout the Indus, the Ganges and the Brahmaputra regions. In the spring of 2010 for example, heavy rains combined with a premature thaw which led to ​​one fifth of the surface area of Pakistan being under water for nearly five weeks; the cost of the damage ran to several tens of billions of dollars (1). 
The new trend is for more rain than snow, especially in spring. As a result the snows melt earlier leading to raging torrents in spring; while in the summer, that’s to say at the time when crops are in their phase of strongest growth, volumes of water in the streams and rivers are reduced. As a consequence, agricultural yields are lower, arid zones expand and fishing suffers. Ultimately, the consequence will probably be the displacement of populations.

The author of the piece I linked to explicitly says that global warming is a major contributor to the melting. As is also the case in other reports:

The impacts that the scientists are worried about will hit not just those living in the mountains, but also the 1.65 billion people living in the river valleys below - all are vulnerable to flooding and the destruction of crops. 
""Water is the theme that runs through many of the issues facing not just the mountain communities but the millions living downstream too. This report highlights how the retreat of snow and ice will change the way rivers behave, at first boosting their flow in spring and summer over the coming years, but only until the ice has melted away,"" said Dr Hamish Pritchard from the British Antarctic Survey.
""For me, the interesting question then is what happens in these major river basins in the years when the rains fail? Without the ice reserve there in the mountains to top the rivers up through the melt season, droughts will be harsher on those living downstream.
""This is a region where water is a hot topic politically, economically and in day to day life, and harsher droughts could be a severe shock to an already fragile system. I read this report as a warning to prepare for these shocks.""

two-thirds of Himalayan glaciers could melt by 2100 if global warming continues, according to the new report. 
Such a catastrophic melt would disrupt the flow of Asian rivers, which are a crucial resource for crops for billions of people in China, India and six other countries.
""This is the climate crisis you haven't heard of,"" said Philippus Wester, a scientist with the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, which released the report. “Global warming is on track to transform the frigid, glacier-covered mountain peaks ... to bare rocks in a little less than a century,"" he said in a statement. 
The glaciers are now a critical source of water for about 250 million people in the mountains and an additional 1.65 billion others who live in the river valleys below, the report said. 
Water from the melting glacial ice could lead to floods along such major rivers as the Ganges and the Indus, potentially destroying crops.

then in the long term allegedly anthropogenic climate change is a good thing is it not?
BQEND
In terms of the lives of the majority of people who are alive now and will be alive this century, it is certainly not a good thing, because far more of the world's human population inhabit regions which will experience negative effects than those regions which will benefit. Neither is climate change a good thing from the perspective of the other life-forms which will be negatively affected by it. That you are reduced to claiming this indicates that you do not comprehend the seriousness of the situation, or alternatively are trying to trivialise it because you feel that you personally will profit from it. As one writer puts it:
BQSTART
So what is at stake? The melting glaciers? No. Given thousands or millions of years, it seems likely that they will one day return. But on a more meaningful human timescale, what is really at stake is us – our own survival. Global warming is reducing our resources, and making life more perilous along the way. The rivers of the Himalayas are just one more example.

It will sail across the Arctic Ocean and after a few weeks reach a point off the Siberian coast, around 85 deg N 120 deg E, where it will attach itself to the biggest, strongest-looking ice floe its crew can find. And then, for the next year, the Polarstern will remain moored to this giant slab of frozen water as it slides, with other polar pack ice, round the Arctic Ocean.
For a year, teams of researchers from the ship will study conditions on the ice floe – which will be at least 2 sq km in area to satisfy researchers’ requirements. There they will set up instruments to study the atmosphere above them, the seabed below, the chemistry of the water around them, the Arctic Ocean’s sealife, and the behaviour of wildlife on the surface, including the occasional visiting polar bear.
This is Mosaic – the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate, the biggest international expedition ever launched in the Arctic. Its aim is to transform our knowledge of the north polar region, a place more affected by climate change than any other sector of our planet and which is expected to play a crucial role in determining how global warming impacts on the rest of the Earth.
“The Arctic is closely linked to weather in our latitudes,” says expedition leader Markus Rex, of the Alfred Wegener Institut in Germany. “We can already see climate changes in the Arctic that are shaping our weather and climate. However, we won’t succeed in accurately forecasting climate developments if we don’t have reliable prognoses for the Arctic.”
Backed by an international consortium led by the institute, Mosaic will cost more than £100m to complete. At any one time, around 50 scientists will be working on its prime vessel or on the ice to which it is moored. Regular visits by icebreakers from China, Russia and Sweden will keep the Polarstern supplied and recrewed so that by late 2020, when the project ends, more than 300 researchers from at least 17 nations will have taken turns to work there.
The idea of simply letting a research vessel drift across the polar cap trapped in ice is not new. The Fram expedition, led by the great Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen, lasted from 1893 to 1896, as his boat, gripped in sea ice, drifted across the Arctic Ocean and demonstrated the feasibility of such arduous undertakings. By modern standards, the scientific measurements taken by its crew were limited, however.
Mosaic, by contrast, will return reams of data, most of it aimed at helping researchers forecast the likely fate of our planet as it heats up as more and more greenhouse gases are pumped into the atmosphere. “The Arctic is crucial to understanding how climate change will affect the rest of the planet,” says Jeremy Wilkinson, a British physicist working on Mosaic. “We already monitor it constantly from space using satellites and also do a lot of work under the ice using robot submersibles. However, there is still a tremendous amount of research that needs to be done by humans, especially in the biological and the atmospheric sciences.”
This point is backed by Markus Frey, a polar explorer based at the British Antarctic Survey. (Britain’s research in the north pole is managed by the Arctic Office at the British Antarctic Survey.) “In the Arctic Ocean – because there is no land on which to build research bases – there is a lack of data about conditions there apart from the information we get from satellites and a few other sources,” tells the Observer. “We need to calibrate the data we get from space with events and the observations we make on the ground, or to be more precise at sea level, in order to get a more accurate picture of what is going on there.”
Consider the issue of sea-ice thickness in the Arctic. For more than 40 years satellites have swept over the north pole and charted dramatic declines in sea-ice cover as global warming has inexorably strengthened its grip on Earth. According to Nasa, the area covered by Arctic sea ice in summer has shrunk by about 40% since the 1980s. That represents the loss of several million square kilometres of sea ice – and as it disappears, more solar radiation will reach the dark, heat-absorbing waters of Arctic Ocean that once lurked underneath. As a result, temperatures will rise even further, researchers warn.
Photographs from most polar satellites only give a two-dimensional picture of the sea ice, however. They do not reveal the extent to which it may be thinning or thickening. In some places, it may be only wafer-thin and set to disappear with dramatic rapidity.
“Recent satellites have been fitted with radar that can measure ice thickness from space,” says Wilkinson. “They have been carefully tuned so they are not confused about levels of snow that have fallen on top of the surface of the ice and apparently altered its thickness.”
The European Space Agency’s probe CryoSat-2 and the French-Indian satellite AltiKa are examples of space missions designed to measure Arctic sea-ice thickness using radar. However, scientists have found these devices do not always pinpoint the surface of the sea ice properly. They still get confused by light snow lying on top of ice. “And that means we are getting errors in our measurements of ice thickness,” adds Wilkinson.
Mosaic should provide a solution. Radar instruments identical to those fitted to CryoSat and AltiKa will be taken on the Polarstern. “We will mount these on a sled and scientists will drag them across the sea ice,” says Wilkinson. “It will be like bringing the satellites down to the surface of the sea ice. Using them, we will then be able to compare the readings we get on the sea-ice surface with those that we got from space. We should be able to recalibrate the satellites’ instruments to get very much improved, more accurate readings of Arctic sea-ice thickness when measured from Earth orbit.”
There will be a perimeter with tripwires and a lookout on the bridge. Bears are a serious issue
In fact, he adds, dozens of related programmes will be carried out on Mosaic. “Other researchers are doing work on snow chemistry and snow properties and we can get our radar measurements married to their snow measurements to get this holistic understanding of how snow evolves in the Arctic.” 
Another key focus for the researchers will be the unexpected role that salt plays in influencing the Arctic climate. Salt is crucial to the formation of clouds, it transpires, because cloud droplets grow on salt grains, says Frey. This raises a problem in understanding the polar climate, because if an ocean is frozen over, how can salt get from the sea to the sky and help clouds form? Frey’s work has revealed a possible route. “The top of the sea ice actually has this very salty brine on it. Then when sweet, freshwater snow falls on top of it, the mixture is whipped up into the air by the winds and you get a flux of salt flying into the air, even though the ocean is frozen.”
Scientists still do not know exactly how this process works, however, and a key feature of Frey’s research will be to unravel the detailed way salt is spread round the Arctic atmosphere. “We need to understand how salt affects the formation of clouds. If you don’t understand that process, you will not get your climate forecasts right. It is a missing link in our meteorological knowledge, so this research is crucial. After all, clouds cut out sunlight and if they do not form for some reason, the region will heat up even more than is currently predicted.”
It is all intriguing work, though carrying out these projects is not without risk. For a start, polar bears pose a real danger to researchers who will have to be protected by armed guards when working on the ice floe. “The guards will have night-vision goggles and rifles fitted with infrared scopes,” adds Frey. “There will be a 700-metre perimeter placed around project sites that will be protected with tripwires. There will also be someone on the bridge looking out at what is happening on the ice floe. However that will still be a challenge at night, especially when visibility is bad during storms. We will have to take constant care. Bears are a serious issue.”
Nor will wildlife be the only risk. Extreme Arctic weather also poses danger as Frey found out during his last expedition. The N-ICE2015 project, led by the Norwegian Polar Institute, was a forerunner of Mosaic and involved the research vessel Lance getting frozen into the Arctic pack ice in January 2015 to study sea ice for several months. “It was a mini-Mosaic,” says Frey. “Just half a year in a much smaller boat.”
A lot of lessons were learned nevertheless. “Four weeks into the expedition, a huge storm shattered the ice floe into pieces,” he says. “Our equipment was thrown everywhere and some became frozen into the ice. It was a horrible mess. People were up to their waists in slushy, ice-cold water and after a while we had to abandon equipment as well. We had to reset our position and start all over again.”
What happens in the Arctic does not stay there. It affects the rest of the planet. It touches us all
This time, Mosaic’s explorers have got themselves a bigger boat and will have a larger ice floe, so they are hoping they will be no repeat of the hardships their predecessors had to endure four years ago.
“This is an extremely important project because it is clear that what happens in the Arctic does not stay there,” says Wilkinson. “The weather there affects the rest of the planet. It touches us all. Just consider the issue of ice. It reflects about 80% of the sunlight that pours down on it. Remove that ice, as we are doing now, and sunlight will shine straight on to the dark ocean. Its dark waters will absorb up to 80% of the radiation that hits it. Further heating is inevitable.
“In other words, ice is essential. It controls our weather patterns. But it is changing in nature and amount in the Arctic. And that is one of the driving forces of the Polarstern. It is going to help us re-evaluate our knowledge of the new Arctic that we are creating.” ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/apr/13/mosaic-measure-climate-change-expedition-anchor-research-ship-arctic-ocean-ice-floe

Danny Faure’s call for action, billed as the first live speech from a submersible, came during a visit to an ambitious British-led science expedition exploring the Indian Ocean depths.
“Oceans cover over two-thirds of the world’s surface but remain, for the most part, uncharted. We have better maps of Mars than we do of the ocean floor,” Faure said. “This issue is bigger than all of us, and we cannot wait for the next generation to solve it. We are running out of excuses to not take action, and running out of time.”
The president was speaking from a manned submersible 120 metres (400ft) below the waves, on the seabed off the outer islands of the African nation.
Wearing a Seychelles T-shirt and shorts, Faure said after his speech that the experience was “so, so cool”. It had made him more determined than ever to speak out for marine protection, he said. “We just need to do what needs to be done. The scientists have spoken.”
The oceans’ role in regulating the climate and the threats they face are underestimated by many, even though, as Faure pointed out, they generate “half of the oxygen we breathe”. Scientific missions are crucial in taking stock of underwater ecosystems’ health.
Small island nations are among the most vulnerable to rising sea levels caused by climate change. Land erosion, dying coral reefs and the increased frequency of extreme weather events threaten their existence.
During the expedition, marine scientists from the University of Oxford have surveyed underwater life, mapped large areas of the sea floor and explored the depths with manned submersibles and underwater drones.
Little is known about the oceans below depths of 30 metres, the limit to which a normal scuba diver can go. Operating down to 500 metres, the scientists were the first to explore areas of great diversity where sunlight weakens and the deep ocean begins.
By the end of the mission, researchers expect to have conducted more than 300 deployments, collected about 1,400 samples and 16 terabytes of data and surveyed about 25,000 sq metres (269,100 sq ft) of seabed using high-resolution multi-beam sonar equipment.
The data will be used to help the Seychelles expand its policy of protecting almost a third of its national waters by 2020. The initiative is important for the country’s “blue economy”, an attempt to balance development needs with those of the environment.
“From this depth, I can see the incredible wildlife that needs our protection and the consequences of damaging this huge ecosystem that has existed for millennia,” Faure said in his speech. “Over the years we have created these problems. We can solve them.”
About 5% of the world’s oceans are protected. Countries have agreed to increase the area to 10% by 2020. But experts and environmental campaigners say between 30% and 50% of the oceans outside nations’ territorial waters should get protected status to ensure marine biodiversity.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/14/seychelles-president-danny-faure-underwater-plea-protect-oceans

First, we are seeing record highs in land and ocean temperatures, sea levels and greenhouse gas concentrations. Second, we are seeing, more and more, the dramatic impact of extreme weather conditions. Last year, in the United States alone, we saw 14 weather- and climate-related disasters where the devastation cost more than $1 billion dollars each, with a total of some US$49 billion dollars.  Worldwide, more than 35 million people were affected by floods. Cyclone Idai in southern Africa is a particularly stark recent example, as it was demonstrated. Third, the impact on public health is escalating.  The average number of people exposed to heatwaves has increased by some 125 million since the beginning of the century, with deadly consequences. The combination of extreme heat and air pollution is proving increasingly dangerous, especially as heatwaves will become longer, more intense and more frequent.

There is no bigger story',article,http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/apr/14/april-de-angelis-mrs-noah-parliament-square-london-climate-change-warning,0,"On Monday, a day of civil disobedience kicks off around the world. It will be led by climate change activists aiming to bring maximum non-violent disruption to civic life. And among those converging on Parliament Square, London, will be a playwright and a troupe of actors dressed as biblical figures: Noah, a parade of animals (going in two by two, of course), and even God himself.
They might, on the face of it, look out of place and maybe even a little comical among the protesters and their placards: Noah’s wife’s dress has a touch of Wag about it, while God will be rocking a sharp white suit with his halo. There will be a crew of townspeople there, all readying themselves for a contemporary enactment of a medieval mystery play.
Mrs Noah is April De Angelis’s riotous retelling of the biblical flood story, starring Ade Adepitan as God and Naomi Paxton as Mrs Noah. But, far from being out of keeping with the day, this Christian tale of rising waves, endangered animals and near extinction of the human race could be the original “climate disaster” warning.
“It is about extinction,” she says. “There is no bigger story.”
De Angelis is a force of nature, as voluble, witty and rebellious as her work. A seasoned playwright and librettist, her dramas overlap with her activism, from her 80s entry point into theatre when she joined a women-only resistance group called Re-Sister (she chortles at the pun now) to her 1993 drama, Playhouse Creatures, set in the 17th century and exploring the moment when women were allowed to perform on stage. 
A desire to place women’s lives at the heart of her stories runs through her work, and Mrs Noah is no exception. In De Angelis’s rebooted mystery play, Noah’s wife is a rebel and upstart, refusing to leave her group of female friends for her place on the ark.
De Angelis did not need to invent Mrs Noah’s rebellion: “I had read the Chester Mystery Plays many decades ago and remembered that she refused to get on the ark in that version. It surprised me to reread it and realise that the writer, rather than being in service to the dogma of the church, was really getting inside Mrs Noah’s head.”
Paxton feels that her character’s refusal is based as much on her political idealism as her loyalty to her friends. “It won’t solve the problem for Mrs Noah to save herself and her family in the ark. The problem remains, and she would only be moving away from it. She feels it’s an issue for everyone and that she can’t escape it.”
It was last autumn that De Angelis had the idea to stage the biblical flood while she was at a meeting with members of Extinction Rebellion, the UK-based climate movement that counts Emma Thompson, Stephen Fry, Philip Pullman, Naomi Klein, and George Monbiot among its supporters.
At one point God says: Don’t you read page six of the Guardian? The end of the world is coming
She joined the group after coming across a Facebook post. “I was in a low-level panic,” she says, “and when I read the post it went to high-level panic. I wanted to do something. I was numb and shocked and frightened. I felt ineffectual and without power. Writing this play changed that.”
Now that politics appears so broken, she says it may be the case that the arts are becoming “the new politics” for younger generations. It’s certainly a great meeting place for the young to collaborate with other generations: the demographic of Extinction Rebellion ranges from millennials to people of her age. (She is 58.)
De Angelis has also written a short duologue – an encounter between two scientists from opposing ideological camps that features bird songs – that will be acted out on street corners as a piece of guerrilla theatre with an eco-message. And, having been commissioned to write a play for the Royal Exchange, Manchester, she is thinking of ways to tell another climate story.
The biggest challenge, for her, lies in turning the story of our planet’s destruction into compelling drama. Environmental disaster does not lack the dramatic elements, nor heart-wrenching personal stories. It’s just a case of rendering them in drama effectively. She recalls the divided critical opinions over 2071, a 75-minute talk by the scientist Chris Rapley (co-written with Duncan Macmillan) at the Royal Court, London, in 2014, which some said just wasn’t theatre. “I think he did a good job. There should not be one type of theatre – as long as it engages the audience and as long as it’s not preaching, because people don’t like to be preached to.”
Adepitan agrees: “I travel all over the world as part of my job, and I’ve seen the devastating impact climate change is having on communities in Africa whose homes are becoming deserts as a result of global warming. We have to make sure as many people as possible understand how urgent an issue this is, and drama is a powerful and effective way to get to get this message across.”
What is striking about Mrs Noah is the humour, song, rhyme and music that has been added to the climate message. God, frustrated by the town’s blindness to ecological danger, says at one point: “Don’t you read page six of the Guardian? The end of the world is coming.”
There are plenty of other such moments. De Angelis wanted to insert enough laughs and winking contemporary references to catch the attention of the crowd in Parliament Square. This is essentially street theatre, she says. It must reach out and grab its viewer.

Price approved the mine’s groundwater management plan last week after internal pressure from Queensland colleagues.
Asked on ABC TV’s Q&amp;A program on Monday night about the accuracy of the media reports, McGrath said four times: “I don’t talk about private conversations.”
The program, hosted in Brisbane, began with a spot of wishful thinking from one questioner, who pleaded with McGrath, Labor’s Terri Butler, the Greens senator Larissa Waters and the One Nation Senate candidate Malcolm Roberts to refrain from aggressive attacks.

“I want to be civil,” Butler said. “I think we can achieve that tonight … no matter what your politics, we’re all going to be civil.”
She was quite far off the mark.
Based on Roberts’ previous Q&amp;A appearance, expectations were low for the quality of debate about climate change.
But after mounting a defence of One Nation’s guns policy and the US trip of James Ashby and Steve Dickson, Roberts was mostly outshone by an aggressive McGrath.
McGrath was furious when Waters – who was wearing Stop Adani earrings – said the the Coalition supported the coal project only because of political donations.
The company gave $50,000 to the Liberal party and One Nation, according to the most recently released disclosures to the Australian Electoral Commission.
“That’s actually offensive … that a political party will take a position based on a donation,” McGrath yelled.
The pair also sparred over a question about allegedly rising racist sentiment in the Coalition.
How will Malcolm Roberts and James McGrath counteract the rise of white supremacy within their own parties? #QandA pic.twitter.com/vm1Z1p5lIY
“The Liberal National party is a party for all Queenslanders regardless of where you come from and how long you’ve been here,” McGrath insisted.
“As long as you share our values – and one of our values is its inclusivity, and we’re colour blind when it comes to the colour of your own skin … And I’m sure the Greens and I hope Labor would agree with that.”
“I’m not sure Peter Dutton would,” Waters retorted.
“I beg your pardon. Are you serious?” McGrath said.
When Waters pointed to Dutton’s immigration detention policies to justify the racist claim, McGrath exploded in rage.
“Where are your tears for those people who drowned at sea and were eaten by the sharks? Don’t come here with your crocodile tears talking to me about what Peter Dutton and Scott Morrison did. They made sure the borders of Australia were safe and secure,” McGrath bellowed.
“I’ll ask you not to shout,” the host, Virginia Trioli, responded.
McGrath even got angry with the studio audience when there was applause for a Greens policy to phase out coal by 2030.
“You clapped the destruction of the Queensland economy,” McGrath said. “You’ve clapped mass unemployment.”

Later Waters was asked whether she condoned the actions of vegans who staged blockades around the country and entered farm properties.
When she said she was a strong supporter of the right to protest but acknowledged “going into people’s homes is a little too far”, McGrath angrily invited people to target her home.

“A little too far? It’s home invasion,” he thundered.
“Let them go to your house. What’s your address? Put your address out there and let the farmers go to your house. That’s what’s happened to farmers … they have had these monsters, these eco-criminals invade their homes. Shame on you for defending them.”
“I’m sure I’ve left you with ringing in your ears,” Trioli said as she closed the show.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/apr/16/qa-james-mcgrath-furious-at-everything-silent-on-alleged-adani-threat

After the Extinction Rebellion activist group threatened to disrupt the city’s public transport network on Wednesday, Transport for London disabled wifi on the underground at the request of the British Transport Police.
Thousands of people have taken part in the civil disobedience protests since Monday, blockading four landmarks in the capital in an attempt to force the government to take action on the escalating climate crisis.
On Wednesday morning, the four sites – Marble Arch, Waterloo Bridge, Parliament Square and Oxford Circus – remained under the control of protesters, causing delays and diversions in the surrounding areas.
“We’re working closely with the police to manage the impact of disruption to London’s transport network,” a TfL spokesperson said. “Customer wifi in underground stations has been temporarily switched off. We will restore access as soon as we are able to do so.”
Passengers were not informed about the decision to turn off the network, and many travellers wrongly attributed the disruption to conventional technical faults.
Disabling public communications networks is an increasingly common tactic used in policing disruption across the world. Almost eight years ago, San Francisco’s Bart transit system turned off the mobile phone service across the network to prevent a similar campaign aimed at stopping trains in protest at the killing of a man by Bart police. That decision was criticised by the American Civil Liberties Union, which said it was reminiscent of censorship in the Middle East.
Extinction Rebellion is an international protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues. Demonstration have included blocking bridges to traffic in London and a semi-naked protest inside the House of Commons. 
The group says climate breakdown threatens all life on Earth, and so it is rebelling against politicians who 'have failed us', to provoke radical change that will stave off a climate emergency.
The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said that while he shared the passion of the protesters about the urgent need to tackle climate change he was “extremely concerned” about plans to disrupt the underground.
In a statement on Twitter, Khan said: “Targeting public transport in this way would only damage the cause of all of us who want to tackle climate change, as well as risking Londoners’ safety and I’d implore anyone considering doing so to think again.”
At least 168 arrests were made on Tuesday, the Metropolitan police said, bringing the total of Extinction Rebellion-related detentions since Monday up to 290.
Hundreds of Extinction Rebellion protesters were still dancing around a boat stage at Oxford Circus just after 10pm, as police tried – apparently in vain – to clear the area.
The events in London were part of an international “climate rebellion” organised by Extinction Rebellion. Organisers said demonstrations had taken place or were planned in 80 cities across 33 countries – from India to Australia, and around Europe and the US. In The Hague on Tuesday, activists occupied the international criminal court building. 
In Scotland, more than 1,000 protesters blockaded the North Bridge in Edinburgh, bringing one of the main routes into the city centre to a standstill. Police said they made 29 arrests.
The blockade began at 3pm, when groups of people on bikes converged from both sides of the bridge, before a human chain formed across the road.
At about 5.30pm, protesters crossed Princes Street and unfurled banners. Most were immediately carried off the road by police.
The biggest protests have been in London, with thousands of parents and their children joining scientists, teachers and environmentalists to demand urgent action in the face of “possible human extinction”.
Among the protesters was the prominent UN environment lawyer Farhana Yamin, who helped negotiate the Paris climate agreement. Just after 2pm, she glued her hands to the pavement outside Shell’s headquarters near the River Thames.
Nearby, police moved on to Waterloo Bridge to begin a second wave of arrests as hundreds of protesters continued their blockade.
Some of those on the bridge had been locked or glued to a lorry parked across the carriageway since Monday night.
By about 5pm, the atmosphere at Waterloo Bridge had calmed after police stopped arresting people. 
On Tuesday evening, police turned their attention away from Waterloo Bridge to Oxford Circus. Officers circulated around the crowd in groups, informing people that if they stayed in that location they were at risk of arrest.
The Guardian witnessed at least one person being carried away, while others left the crowd voluntarily after speaking to police. “We are peaceful, what about you?” protesters chanted as police made an arrest.
Many protesters said they were willing to remain at the junction all night in order to hold the space.
Harriet Gold, 26, a student from Bristol, was among them. “I feel really confident,” she said. “I was surprised to wake up to hear that they had Waterloo Bridge still.”
Elmo MB, 20, was manning a wellbeing tent. He said he was not worried about the police order to leave the area. “I think breaking the law is the point,” he said.
“There are lots of brave folk and a lot of people have been arrested so far, but they pull one person off and two people come back on. I’m not sure how long this will last, but I imagine it will last through the night.”
Extinction Rebellion was formed in the UK last year and held its first civil disobedience protests in London in November. It is calling on the UK government to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025 and establish a citizens’ assembly to devise an emergency plan of action to tackle climate breakdown and biodiversity loss.
On Tuesday, Supt Colin Wingrove of the Metropolitan police confirmed a section 14 order was in place and called on the protesters to leave Waterloo Bridge, Oxford Circus and Parliament Square but they could continue their demonstration at Marble Arch.

Scientists from Newcastle University, James Cook University, the University of New South Wales and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have spent the past two weeks surveying corals around the island in the far south Pacific Ocean after they were alerted to bleaching in isolated areas.
Bill Leggat, a coral biologist at Newcastle University, said the worst of the bleaching was in shallow water closer to the shoreline.
“It’s quite variable but where it’s severe it is actually quite severe,” he said.
“Some of the sites are looking at 80-90% bleaching going very close inshore.”
Other reef sites the scientists surveyed showed bleaching levels of 50%, 30% and some areas with as little as 5% bleaching.
Lord Howe Island was named a Unesco world heritage site in 1982. It is habitat for species that are found nowhere else on earth.
The bleaching has occurred over the past summer, with March the peak month of the year for coral bleaching due to warmer ocean temperatures.
Scientists have documented three bleaching events at Lord Howe Island in the past but it has been some years since it last occurred.
Leggat said although the bleaching was isolated to shallow areas, for scientists to be documenting 90% bleaching in some parts signalled the latest event “is really quite severe”.
“As far as we know it’s the most severe we’ve ever seen it on Lord Howe Island,” he said.
“Our concern now is we’re going to start seeing coral mortality.”
Leggat said some areas still remained healthy but researchers doing surveys last week could see the bleaching was progressing.
They will return in April to conduct fresh surveys to assess whether it has caused coral mortality.
While much of Australia’s focus on coral bleaching has been centred on the Great Barrier Reef, it is a worldwide occurrence due to climate change.
“Reefs around the world are being affected everywhere,” Leggat said.
“We’re starting to see beaching in sites where wouldn’t have previously expected to see it.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/apr/01/lord-howe-island-coral-bleaching-most-severe-weve-ever-seen-scientists-say

Scott Morrison has promptly declared it is carbon tax 2.0 and the regulations will impose massive costs on Australians. Given this partisan debate, which has paralysed Australian politics for a decade, has been characterised by hyperbole and misinformation, let’s work through this latest policy instalment, sector by sector, and then consider the implications.
Labor says if it wins the coming election it will try to implement the national energy guarantee abandoned by the Coalition, with a higher emissions reduction target – 45% by 2030. The government’s electricity target was 26%. If the Coalition in opposition declines to support the Neg, Labor will pursue plan B. Plan B involves topping up the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to the tune of $10bn and a new $5bn fund to modernise ageing transmission infrastructure. The objective of the intervention is to drive higher take-up of renewables in the grid. Labor has a target of sourcing 50% of electricity from renewables by 2030. Coupled with this, a Just Transition Authority will be established to help manage the retirement of the coal fleet, with generators required to give three years’ notice of closure.
As well as reviving the national energy guarantee, Labor is borrowing another existing Coalition policy to bring down industrial pollution. It will use the current safeguard mechanism, which is part of the Direct Action scheme, but will extend coverage so that more companies are captured. The scheme works like this: companies are allocated baselines, and if they pollute above that level, they need to buy carbon credits (more about this is in minute), which imposes a cost on their business. Labor says it will reduce pollution in the covered entities by 45% on 2005 levels by 2030, but is planning to consult with firms on what their baseline should be, and about the specific emissions reduction trajectory for each entity. It is also planning to assist emissions-intensive trade-exposed companies with the transition.
The approach in transport is two pronged. Labor is proposing to introduce vehicle emissions standards “in line with” 105 grams of CO2 pollution per kilometre, which is the same as the US. The standard is imposed on car retailers (not manufacturers), which means car dealers will have to offset sales of high-emissions vehicles with sales of low-emissions vehicles. Coupled with this, Labor is setting targets for the take up of electric vehicles. It wants a national EV target of 50% of new sales by 2030, and a government fleet target of 50% of new sales by 2025, and it will also allow businesses to claim deductions if they buy EVs valued at more than $20,000. It will also require all federally funded road upgrades to incorporate EV charging infrastructure.
Given Labor will impose significantly tougher pollution rules than the Coalition, it also wants to boost the supply of carbon offsets. With this market becoming more important, Labor is flagging a new certification framework to ensure that carbon credits are sufficiently high quality. It will also strengthen the Carbon Farming Initiative, which allows farmers and landholders to generate carbon credits which they can sell on the carbon market. It will also allow heavy emitters to use international permits to meet their pollution reduction requirements, but Labor is not yet saying what limits might apply. It will not use carryover credits from the Kyoto period, which the Morrison government intends to use to help meet the Paris target.
Farmers are largely off the hook in Labor’s policy. On the positive side of the ledger there are opportunities to generate carbon credits, which generates income. The sting is land clearing. Labor is signalling it wants to extend the Queensland regime to other jurisdictions, working through the Council of Australian Governments process. That’s a principle though. There’s no detail beyond that in the policy.
This is the big question. Unsurprisingly, given the toxic history, the Morrison government has resumed hollering about carbon taxes and environmental regulations that will bring Australia to its knees, but the fact is we don’t have a number of important details that would allow anyone to make fact-based conclusions. Labor says we’ll have a new vehicle emissions standard, but hasn’t said when that will apply, or the specific level of emissions reduction from transport it is factoring in as a consequence. Similarly Labor is arguing it will achieve a 45% cut from heavy emitters while allowing caveats like consultations on baselines and trajectories. Labor is not planning to release a carbon budget, which would make transparent estimates about the level of pollution cuts it is factoring-in in each sector. It is unable to say how carbon trading between the energy and industrial sectors might work because the proposed regulatory frameworks are conceptual rather than fully fleshed out. Given there are stakeholders sitting on the sidelines ready to go to war, and the Coalition is hoping that calling something that isn’t a carbon tax a carbon tax (again) represents a sound political strategy with an election in sight – the vagueness from Labor is deliberate. But there are significant unanswered questions here.
Another big question. The Coalition is not showing any sign of having a substantial conversion on climate change. Labor will likely need the Greens to get various changes legislated and the Greens will want a higher level of ambition than is evident in this policy. The Greens will want Labor to execute a faster transition away from coal, and they are already saying no to the use of international permits. So it’s entirely possible that the long unproductive deadlock will continue. We have a long way to go.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/apr/01/labors-climate-change-policy-explained-heres-what-we-know

The Irish airline, which transports 130 million people a year, declared 9.9 megatonnes of greenhouse gas emissions in 2018, up 6.9% on last year and 49% over the last five years, according to data in the EU’s latest emissions trading system registry.
Andrew Murphy, the aviation manager at the European Federation for Transport and Environment, said: “When it comes to climate, Ryanair is the new coal. This trend will only continue until Europe realises that this undertaxed and under-regulated sector needs to be brought into line, starting with a tax on kerosene and the introduction of mandates that force airlines to switch to zero-emission jet fuel.”
Ryanair’s chief executive, Michael O’Leary, dismissed climate change concerns as “complete and utter rubbish” in an interview two years ago. His airline is now ranked as Europe’s 10th worst emitter, after nine coal plants. Poland’s Bełchatów is the worst polluter, producing 38 megatonnes of planet-warming emissions annually.
Coal emissions are falling, though, as Europe’s transition to cleaner energy continues. In stark contrast, emissions from airlines, which are exempted from fuel taxes and VAT on tickets, have soared by 26.3% since 2014, outpacing all other transport sectors.
EasyJet was Europe’s next worst-performing airline, in 31st place on the list, after an 11% rise in emissions in 2018. It was followed by Lufthansa, Norwegian and British Airways, according to analysis of the EU data by the thinktank Sandbag and Transport and Environment.
Aviation is responsible for about 3% of Europe’s greenhouse gas emissions, but industry forecasts suggest this could rise by up to 700% by 2050 as the sector grows.
Murphy described aviation as “Europe’s biggest climate failure”. Europe’s airlines pay about €800m (£680m) a year for their rights to pollute. But some studies suggest this sum is eclipsed by the €27bn they would have to stump up if their fuel tax and VAT exemptions were ended.
Despite increased attention from policymakers, the sector receives up to 85% of its EU emissions trading allowances free, with Ryanair consequently saving €96.6m in 2018.
Kevin Anderson, a professor of energy and climate change at the University of Manchester, said: “Ryanair use new and efficient aircraft rammed to the rafters with passengers, illustrating how technology alone cannot reconcile aviation’s rocketing emissions with the Paris climate commitments.
“If we genuinely care for our children’s futures, we need to drive down the demand for aviation. This will require stringent regulations focusing on frequent fliers rather than those taking the occasional trip.”
A Ryanair spokesperson said: “Ryanair is Europe’s greenest and cleanest airline. Passengers travelling on Ryanair have the lowest CO2 emissions per km travelled than any other airline.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/01/ryanair-new-coal-airline-enters-eu-top-10-emitters-list

The opposition spokesman on the environment and water, Tony Burke, told Guardian Australia he would immediately convene the ministerial council and outline what he wants to achieve.
“If the states refuse to cooperate, I will look at powers in the Water Act,” he said.
So far the Murray-Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) has not used all its powers, preferring to work collaboratively with the states. However the act gives the MDBA the authority to take over the planning powers of the states in relation to the river system as well as allowing a greater role in enforcement.
Since Guardian Australia investigated the Murray-Darling in March 2018, the health of Australia’s greatest river system, and the $13bn plan to save it, have been thrust into the centre of the national political debate.
The drought that began to unfold in early 2018 has become prolonged and highlighted inadequacies in the plan.
The most dramatic warning has been the deaths of hundreds of thousands of fish at Menindee. The deaths of 40- and 50-year-old Murray cod, which survived the millennium drought of the early 2000s but perished this time around, horrified Australians and raised serious questions about the management of the river.
There are now marked policy differences between the Coalition and Labor at state and federal level over what should happen next under the plan, though both major parties remain committed to retaining the plan itself.
The question is: can the basin plan be reformed – and the remaining $4.5bn be spent constructively – without the key stakeholder states and the farming lobby pulling out of the plan?
The Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists has warned from the outset that the environmental water recovery target of 2750GL in the plan was a political compromise and is a bare minimum to restore the health of the Murray-Darling River.
Since then, serious management failures have led to a systematic weakening of reforms and undermining of the plan, they say.
“Without major changes in implementation, it is almost certain that the basin plan will fail,” the group has warned in numerous submissions.
The group’s spokesman, Prof Jamie Pittock, said there have been improvements in enforcement in New South Wales after the ABC Four Corners report in July 2017, which sounded the alarm over allegations of water theft by cotton irrigators in the north of NSW.
But he said: “The major part of the problem – bad rules in water-sharing plans – remain. NSW and Victoria haven’t changed their attitude towards fixing them.”
The most scathing and comprehensive criticism of the basin plan was delivered in February by a South Australian royal commission. It found officials at the MDBA and in government were guilty of maladministration, negligence and unlawful actions in drawing up the multibillion-dollar deal to save Australia’s largest river system.
The commissioner, Bret Walker SC, warned the plan’s failure to take account of climate change was “potentially catastrophic”.
While the Morrison government and the MDBA dismissed the findings (they had refused to participate in the inquiry) the royal commission heard from many of the leading scientists in the field. There was a distressing consensus in their assessments.
Many of its findings were backed up by the Productivity Commission’s five-year review, albeit in more temperate, bureaucratic language.
“Deficiencies in the way that governments have approached implementation of the plan have caused considerable concern in many basin communities. This has left a legacy of community distrust, which the commission considers is a risk to effectively implementing the next phase of the plan,” it said.
In the fine print, it noted the poor enforcement by states, that new plans to deliver on water sharing were way behind schedule, that programs to find water savings in other ways were highly ambitious and risky, and the MDBA’s evaluation frameworks were inadequate.
Then there were two reports – by the Academy of Science commissioned by Labor, and the Vertessy report commissioned by the government – in the wake of the fish kills. Both concluded that low flows had been responsible for the conditions that led to the mass deaths.
Australian National University professor and chairman of the Academy of Science’s panel, Craig Moritz, said his review found “there isn’t enough water in the Darling system to avoid catastrophic outcomes”.
“This is partly due to the ongoing drought. However, analysis of rainfall and river flow data over decades points to excess water extraction upstream,” he said.
A common theme in all of these reports is that flows in the northern part of the system are dramatically reduced compared with historical records, and it cannot be explained solely by drought.
The likely causes are climate change, which is changing rainfall patterns, and overextraction by irrigators – possibly in breach of the rules and floodplain harvesting, which involves diverting overland flows into private storages before it even reaches the river.
A study by the MDBA identified the problem. From 1990 to 2017, a period which covered the millennium drought, “Some individual flow events in the post-2000 period were seen to be very heavily attenuated in both the Collarenebri-to-Walgett and (particularly) the Walgett-to-Brewarrina reaches, contrary to the established pre-2000 trend,” the study said.
In other words, too much water was being diverted from the river.
But facing up to this new reality is proving difficult.
The Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists argue that the plan can be salvaged but requires governments and regulators to recognise its weaknesses and put the environmental objectives of the plan ahead of politics.
Over the past 12 months, there have been developments that are both positive and negative.
In the wake of the fish kills, Labor, Greens and minor parties joined forces to make one important change: an amendment that will lift the cap of 1500GL on water that can be bought back from farmers.
The cap had been put in place by the Abbott government in 2015 under pressure from the Nationals who feared the economic impact of more buybacks on rural communities.
But the change will only be relevant if the government of the day calls more tenders to buy back water or if other measures to reclaim water for the environment, such as the supply projects like Menindee Lakes are unsuccessful, forcing a government’s hand.
Burke said the cap on buybacks was never part of the original Murray-Darling Basin Plan.
“By removing the cap on buybacks, Labor is removing a legislative barrier to providing more water for the basin, if that is what is needed,” he said.
The more serious threats to realising the environmental outcomes are two amendments to the plan, supported by the government and opposition, which reduce the amount of water available for the environment. 
The plan always envisaged there could be changes, but the two changes – a 70GL cut to the environmental water target in the northern basin and agreement to allow 605GL of water to be recovered in the southern basin through efficiency projects – are controversial. 
Both have drawn almost universal criticism from scientists but were supported by the MDBA and by both major parties.
The 70GL is a straight cut that reduces the environmental water recovery target by about 31,000 Olympic swimming pools.
“I guess I was surprised by the figure. But the reality is the plan falls over if you do not support the independent process,” Burke said, explaining his decision to support the government.
But since the Menindee fish deaths, he said he would “not be surprised if MDBA review the 70GL cut”.
The 605GL adjustment in the southern basin is more complex.
The idea is that environmental outcomes equivalent to this amount of flows can be achieved by using water more efficiently often through building river infrastructure or removing it.
The problem is knowing whether the projects will work.
The Productivity Commission described the supply measures projects, as they are known, as “highly ambitious” and rated the risk of failure as “high”.
 The Menindee Lakes project, to reduce evaporation by shrinking the lake system, is a case in point. 
If the project fails to deliver on its 105GL of evaporation savings, it will mean a shortfall in environmental water that needs to be made in 2024.
 Then there is the glacial progress by the states in implementing key commitments under the plan. NSW has been slow on its new water resource plans, leaving in place old plans like the Barwon-Darling water-sharing plan, which have been roundly criticised for allowing pumping by irrigators during low flows at the expense of the environment.
Victoria is under fire for its failure to remove or rebuild bridges and roads and other assets that currently prevent the commonwealth environmental water holder from flooding the upper flood plains, which is critical for endangered ecosystems such as red gum forests.
“If I win the election, I would want to get the ministerial council together as quickly as possible,” said Burke. “One of the things we need is a clear work plan for constraints removal, particularly in Victoria.
“I am determined that I will get constraints removed and I am frustrated by the lack of progress. I would prefer a consensus approach but failure to remove them is not an option.”
Burke said he also expected the states to take notice that water-sharing plans underpin the reforms and there will be “no tolerance” for plans that subvert them.

The latest monthly climate breakdown shows that despite two severe tropical cyclones in the northern states, temperatures across Australia were 2.13C above the average throughout last month in part due to an unusually dry summer in Western Australia and the Northern Territory.
“One of the standout features of March was there was above-average temperatures just about everywhere; more than 99% of the country,” Blair Trewin, a senior climatologist at the bureau told Guardian Australia.
“Really a few things came together: the overall, long-term background trend [of rising temperatures] means you’re starting from a higher base, which increases the probability of records.
“Another major factor has been that the summer monsoon season in the tropics has been quite weak. Normally in the tropics in the summer you see fairly regular incursions of rainfall and moisture into the continent. That has been happening in Queensland but not really in Western Australia or the Northern Territory.”
The record temperatures in March follow records in January, while February was in the top five on record. Last year was Australia’s third-warmest year on record. It beat out the previous third-place holder, 2017.
The 2018 state of the climate report from the bureau and CSIRO found Australia was experiencing more extreme heat, longer fire seasons, rising oceans and more marine heatwaves consistent with a changing climate.
So, is this the new normal?
“It’s not as if we’re going to see records every month, even in the warmer overall climate we have now,” Trewin said.
“This is still a very abnormal summer, when you break the record for the warmest first quarter by 0.9 of a degree, that’s not a small number. It’s been an unusually hot few months, the background warming trend we see in Australia is in the order of 0.1 to 0.2 of a degree per decade.
“Even in the climate of 2019 this is unusual, but is not as unusual as it would have been in say 1980 or 1950.”
According to the bureau’s report, two severe tropical cyclones – Trevor and Veronica - contributed to very much above-average rainfall in parts of north Queensland, the east of the Northern Territory, north-east South Australia and parts of the Pilbara coast.
A wet end to the month brought totals to above average for eastern New South Wales, far-eastern Victoria and south-east Queensland.
However the report noted that “unfortunately, the rain needed to reduce significant rainfall deficiencies in drought-affected areas is substantial and will require above-average rainfall over a prolonged period to completely remove deficits at longer timescales”.
Trewin said that without those downpours, the overall average would have been higher.
“It had a bit of a cooling effect particularly in Queensland, though they still came in with their fifth warmest March on record,” he said.
The outlook is not particularly promising either. Trewin said most areas had a “neutral” outlook for rainfall, with the expectation of above-average temperatures to continue.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/apr/02/march-was-australias-hottest-on-record-with-temperatures-2c-above-average

Social security medicare the british health care systems are all socially subsidized and they do not mean the end of capitalism where they exist.
So also a universal subsidy to prevent overt starving and to provide necessities so we do not have to live like animals would remove the automatic necessity we all have to get jobs and keep them regardless of harm.
WE do not have to make all equal in wealth. People may work to make money above and beyond what is found in simply living simply. But if we provide above the necessity of starving and a few things of comfort, then also we can see to it people will when voting, go with a environmental consideration as opposed to simply jobs jobs jobs. 
Your side our side has to immediately understand this. If not it is socialism or communism against capitalism and really we will always loose that fight and even if we did win it is above what is necessary.
It is not money the problem it is that we all need jobs so desperately to prevent starvation and living on the ground in the cold. Third world places will always go for jobs if that is the choice and we cannot by force stop that.
We must share so jobs become a secondary consideration. Those using global warming as a excuse for communism or marx type socialism should really be ashamed of themselves. The whole world for human may end this is much more important than what economic model we follow.

If you are a rancher who has lost their cattle to drought, or a homeowner who has lost their home to wildfire or flood, or an island nation going under the waves, then dangerous climate change has already arrived.
Last summer just a two hour drive from me the Camp Fire incinerated the town of Paradise California. Maybe this summer it will be my town's turn.
Because of the tremendous momentum in Earth's energy system and climate we are likely to raise global average temperature considerably above 2 degrees C (1).
The higher we let global temperature rise the greater the risk of it going really high, and even just the 2 to 3 degree rise we seem locked into would push us to the limit of our adaptive capacity.
And still the main features in the news are things like Trump's latest tweet, or the failures of UK politicians to deal with Brexit.
The media has fallen down on the job of educating policy makers and the public to just how dangerous global warming is to humanity.

Some larger coal seams are, for example, 10 metres thick.

The USDA Forest Service today announced that an additional 27 million trees, mostly conifers, died throughout California since November 2016, bringing the total number of trees that have died due to drought and bark beetles to an historic 129 million on 8.9 million acres. 
The dead trees continue to pose a hazard to people and critical infrastructure, mostly centered in the central and southern Sierra Nevada region of the state.
“The number of dead and dying trees has continued to rise, along with the risks to communities and firefighters if a wildfire breaks out in these areas,” said Randy Moore, Regional Forester of the USDA Forest Service, Pacific Southwest Region. 
“It is apparent from our survey flights this year that California’s trees have not yet recovered from the drought, and remain vulnerable to beetle attacks and increased wildfire threat. The USDA Forest Service will continue to focus on mitigating hazard trees and thinning overly dense forests so they are healthier and better able to survive stressors like this in the future.”

These “orbital perturbations” caused huge changes in climate due to amplifying feedbacks like ice melt and release of CO2 from warming oceans and methane from permafrost.
From PNAS in 2014: 
BQSTART
Using satellite measurements, this analysis directly quantifies how much the Arctic as viewed from space has darkened in response to the recent sea ice retreat. 
We find that this decline has caused 6.4 ± 0.9 W/m2 of radiative heating since 1979, considerably larger than expectations from models and recent less direct estimates. 
Averaged globally, this albedo change is equivalent to 25% of the direct forcing from CO2 during the past 30 y.
BQEND
https://www.pnas.org/content/111/9/3322
As the other half of the surface area of Arctic sea ice largely goes away within the next several decades, that amplifying feedback will increase substantially. And the loss of seasonal snow cover in the North adds a similar amplifying feedback. 
And that warming is going into the melting of permafrost and release of methane.

On one side, there is grief and fear; on the other side, machines. I became an environmentalist because I love the living world, but I spend much of my life thinking about electricity, industrial processes and civil engineering. Technological change is essential, but to a natural historian it often feels cold and distancing. Today, however, I can write about something that thrills me: the most exciting field of research I have covered in years.
Most climate scientists agree that it is now too late to prevent 1.5C or more of global heating only by cutting our production of greenhouse gases. Even if we reduced our emissions to zero tomorrow, we would probably overshoot this crucial temperature limit. To prevent a full-spectrum catastrophe, we need not only to decarbonise our economy in the shortest possible time, but also to draw down carbon dioxide that has already been released.
But how? The best-known proposal is called bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). This means growing wood or straw in plantations, burning it in power stations to produce electricity, capturing the carbon dioxide from the exhaust gases and burying it in geological formations. Yet, if deployed at scale, it is likely to trigger either an ecological or a humanitarian disaster.
One BECCS proposal, favoured by certain governments, would cover an area three times the size of India with plantations. This involves converting agricultural land, in which case BECCS would cause mass starvation, or converting wild land, in which case almost lifeless plantations would replace 50% of the world’s remaining natural forests. Even so, it might not be effective, as any carbon savings would be counteracted by the use of nitrogen fertiliser and the release of greenhouse gases from the soil as it’s churned up for planting. BECCS can lead only to catastrophe, and should be immediately abandoned.
Another option is direct air capture: extracting carbon dioxide with machines. Aside from the expense, which is likely to be massive, the amount of steel and concrete required to build these machines could help to push the world beyond certain climate tipping points before the positive effects are felt.
None of this is necessary, however, because there is a much better and cheaper way of drawing carbon from the air. Natural climate solutions do it through the restoration of living systems. The greatest potential identified so far – as so much land can be used this way – is in protecting and restoring natural forests and allowing native trees to repopulate deforested land. The greatest drawdown potential per hectare (though the total area is smaller) is the restoration of coastal habitats such as mangroves, salt marsh and seagrass beds. They stash carbon 40 times faster than tropical forests can. Peaty soils are also vital carbon stores. They are currently being oxidised by deforestation, drainage, drying, burning, farming and mining for gardening and fuel. Restoring peat, by blocking drainage channels and allowing natural vegetation to recover, can suck back much of what has been lost.
These are the best-studied natural climate solutions. They could help to solve two existential problems at once: climate breakdown and ecological breakdown. Their likely contribution is enormous – bigger than almost anyone guessed a few years ago – and other possibilities have scarcely been explored. For example, we currently have little idea of what the impact of industrial fishing may be on the seabed’s vast carbon store. By disturbing the sediments and lifting the carbon they contain into the water column, trawlers and dredgers are likely to expose it to oxygen, turning it into carbon dioxide. One study suggests that repeated trawling in the north-west Mediterranean has caused a reduction in carbon storage in the top 10 centimetres of sediments of up to 52%. Given the vast area trawled every year (most of the seabed on the world’s continental shelves), the climate impact could be enormous. Closing large parts of the seas to trawling could turn out to be a crucial climate strategy.
Scientists have only begun to explore how the recovery of certain animal populations could radically change the carbon balance. For instance, forest elephants and rhinos in Africa and Asia and tapirs in Brazil are natural foresters, maintaining and extending their habitats as they swallow the seeds of trees and spread them, sometimes across many miles, in their dung. White rhinos can play a major role in preventing runaway wildfires in African savannahs: their grazing prevents dry grass building up. If wolves were allowed to reach their natural populations in North America, one paper suggests, their suppression of herbivore populations would stop as much carbon being released every year as that produced by 30-70m cars. Healthy populations of predatory crabs and fish protect the carbon in salt marshes, as they prevent herbivorous crabs and snails wiping out the plants that hold the marshes together.
What I love about natural climate solutions is that we should be doing all these things anyway. Instead of making painful choices and deploying miserable means to a desirable end, we can defend ourselves from disaster by enhancing our world of wonders. However, nothing should be done without the involvement and consent of indigenous people and other local communities. Nor should damaging projects, such as monocultural plantations, be passed off as natural climate solutions. As a paper published this week in Nature shows, several governments are attempting this deception.
Today, a small group of us is launching a campaign for natural climate solutions to receive the commitment and funding they deserve. At the moment, though their potential is huge, they have been marginalised in favour of projects that may be worse than useless, but which are profitable for corporations. Governments discuss the climate crisis and the ecological crisis in separate meetings when both disasters could be addressed together. We have set up a dedicated website, produced an animation and written a letter to governments and international bodies signed by prominent activists, scientists and artists.
We don’t want natural climate solutions to be used as a substitute for the rapid and comprehensive decarbonisation of our economies. The science tells us both are needed: the age of carbon offsets is over. But what this thrilling field of study shows is that protecting and rewilding the world’s living systems is not just an aesthetically pleasing thing to do. It is an essential survival strategy.

Think of the planet | Michael Segalov",article,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/03/domestic-flights-chris-grayling-planet-flybe-trains-emissions,0,"It’s not hard to see why Chris Grayling jumped at the opportunity to visit Heathrow airport early on Tuesday to welcome passengers landing on a dreary morning at Terminal 2. He was marking the launch of an air service from Flybe – which will now be operating four return flights from Newquay on the north coast of Cornwall to London seven days a week.
This is a transport secretary made famous for his inability to actually transport things, whether that be people by train or goods over water (he’s even managed to stop cyclists making it safely from A to B) – and so for Grayling, a plane on a new flightpath taking off and landing on time is a much needed chance to claim an easy win and arrange a photo-op.
But while I’m sure travellers were thrilled to be greeted by grinning Grayling at baggage reclaim, news that more domestic flights are set to take off and land in Britain is not a cause for celebration. It’s remarkably irresponsible, even by this government’s standards, to embrace a growth in domestic air travel when global carbon emissions are on the up, as are global temperatures. To put it bluntly: it is entirely unsustainable while we’re in the midst of a climate emergency.
Just this week, budget airline Ryanair was revealed to be one of Europe’s top 10 carbon emitters alongside nine coal plants; the company’s carbon footprint is up nearly 50% in the past five years. And while aviation accounts for about 3% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, it’s forecasted that by 2050 this could rise by up to 700% as growth in demand continues. There’s a complex conversation to be had about how we drastically limit international air travel in a way that reduces climate change while offering travel opportunities. But, let’s be honest, in a country as small as the United Kingdom the vast majority of domestic fights are far from essential.
That said, yesterday afternoon I took a quick look online to see the options for travel from Newquay to London and back for early next week. On Great Western Railway, a Super Off-Peak return ticket purchased in advance for the 250-mile journey would set me back £116, and it takes up to five hours each way. Meanwhile, I’d get change from £100 if I decided to fly, and I could be disembarking in just over one hour. It’s a broken system that’s reflected across the UK which urgently needs fixing.
It’s hard to quantify just how reckless unnecessary air travel is, and how misguided it is for our politicians to support it. According to the Aviation Environment Federation, taking a flight from Newquay to London sees (roughly) six times more emissions released per person than rail travel, and that’s before other emissions such as nitrogen oxides, which also contribute to global warming when released at such high altitudes, are taken into consideration.
But while it remains faster and cheaper to jump on a plane, it’s difficult to expect travellers not to. For families on a budget, the difference in cost can end up being huge; company bosses intent on efficiency are likely to want employees to be in transit for a short a time as possible. It’s why an antidote to our addiction to air travel won’t be found in “the market” or through consumer choice – no good will come of leaving it up to the individual to give up the short-term convenience of slightly faster journeys for the longer-term ambition of having a planet to live on.
That’s why we need bold governmental action if we’ve any chance of reducing emissions from travel. Instead of cosying up to airline executives at Heathrow, a transport minister should be campaigning to reverse the airport’s third runway plans. The state should be restricting all but essential domestic air travel in the UK and nationalising a sustainable rail service, subsidised where needed – intervention on this scale is sorely needed. It’s the role of the government to invest in sustainable employment for job losses that would follow: a Green New Deal in action. That should be a priority for any politician taking climate change seriously, but instead Grayling’s department is using public money to subsidise these Cornwall-London airfares.
These are the things he should have been talking about at Heathrow this week, rather than singing the praises of air travel. In fact, the only silver lining to Grayling’s airport announcement that he hopes to see more and more flights traversing the length and breadth of Britain is that, given his track record, it’s a plan that will end up failing miserably. Lo and behold, just this morning Flybe cancelled flights amid talks of hub closures. Failing Grayling strikes again – maybe there’s hope for the planet after all …

It was a smash hit in its home country, becoming the highest grossing non-Imax Australian documentary in history (since overtaken by Jennifer Peedom’s majestic 2017 doco Mountain).
Perhaps we shouldn’t have been surprised. Gameau took an issue relevant across cultures and demographics, and prised it open with a broadly accessible style that neither bored nor talked down to young people – who form much of his target demographic.
The director-presenter inhabited the role of a cool school teacher doing what all cool teachers aspire to do: making education fun.
For his follow-up film 2040, which had its Australian premiere this week at the Gold Coast film festival, Gameau turns his focus to the health of the planet, keeping broadly the same upbeat approach. While That Sugar Film contained horrific visions of dental apocalypse that no doubt compelled young’uns to brush their teeth out of sheer, gum-gobbling terror, the overall message remained optimistic – emphasising the power we have to shape our bodies and lives.
Similarly, when applying the stethoscope to the earth’s wellbeing, Gameau positions himself as a glass-half-full idealist, with his first mission to convince people that they can make a difference.
Dividing his focus into key areas, including renewable energy and alternative transportation, with corresponding on-the-road case studies, he structures the film as a one-way conversation with his four-year-old daughter, who will be 25 when the titular year arrives and, he hopes, part of a brighter and better world.
The outlook of the film is refreshing. There’s no shortage of gooseflesh-raising documentaries that tell us, not without justification, that the world is going – or has already gone – to the dogs.
“I think there’s room for a different story,” Gameau says, in the garden with shovel in hand, near the beginning of the film. It is peppered with Kids Say the Darndest Things-type interviews – pipsqueaks discussing their ideal solutions to the world’s problems. Presumably Gameau was delighted by the sight of thousands of Australian kids walking out of school last month, protesting against the government’s inaction on fossil fuel emissions.
The overarching approach of 2040 is not unlike aTV program, such as Todd Sampson’s Redesign My Brain, in which an engaging host tracks down experts who have spent their lives researching subjects that are relatively new to the presenter.
Gameau’s pitch is that he has the skills to distil complex ideas into thoroughly digestible chunks. This is where we see his auteurial voice emerging – creating visual innovations that add some bling to potentially dry subject matter.
For instance, he gives interviewees the Honey, I Shrunk the Kids treatment, reducing them to tiny figurines in aesthetically engaging environments –on a Monopoly board or perched atop a shovel.
But given the episodic nature of 2040, and the complexity of each topic – all of which could easily form entire documentaries themselves – it is clear that a feature-length film isn’t the ideal format.
A television series, with an episode per subject, would make an obviously more accommodating format. Although, given how well That Sugar Film went down, it is hardly a surprise that the producers decided to try and replicate its success.
A series would have given Gameau room to expand areas that are largely absent from his remit, such as the hurdles of revolutionising power grids, or replacing all cars with self-driving group rideshare vehicles. Or even, in a perhaps unfathomably optimistic thought, the end of billboard advertising.
It’s understandable why the film-maker didn’t want to get bogged down in tackling those awfully adult, awfully sobering ideas of vested interests, which in a nutshell explain many of the aforementioned hurdles. In 2040, Gameau defaults to the position of inspiring people rather than alarming or overwhelming them. You leave the film wanting more, not less, of these sorts of productions.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/04/2040-review-an-idealists-vision-of-a-healthy-earth

The Trump administration disbanded the 15-person Advisory Committee for the Sustained National Climate Assessment in August 2017. The group, formed under Barack Obama’s presidency, provided guidance to the government based on the National Climate Assessment, a major compendium of climate science released every four years.
Documents released under freedom of information laws subsequently showed the Trump administration was concerned about the ideological makeup of the panel. “It only has one member from industry, and the process to gain more balance would take a couple of years to accomplish,” wrote George Kelly, then the deputy chief of staff at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in a June 2017 email.
The advisory group has since been resurrected, however, following an invitation from New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, and has been financially supported by Columbia University and the American Meteorological Society. It now has 20 expert members.
The panel is now known as the Science to Climate Action Network (Scan) and has now completed work it would have finished for the federal government, releasing a report on Thursday warning that Americans are being put at risk from the impacts of a warming planet due to a muddled response to climate science.
“We were concerned that the federal government is missing an opportunity to get better information into the hands of those who prepare for what we have already unleashed,” said Richard Moss, a member of Scan and a visiting scientist at Columbia University, who previously chaired the federal panel.
“We’re only just starting to see the effects of climate change, it’s only going to get much worse. But we haven’t yet rearranged our daily affairs to adapt to science we have,” he added.
The fourth National Climate Assessment, released on the day after Thanksgiving last year, detailed how climate change is already harming Americans, with sobering findings on future impacts. At the time, Trump said he didn’t believe the report.
“The impacts and costs of climate change are already being felt in the United States, and changes in the likelihood or severity of some recent extreme weather events can now be attributed with increasingly higher confidence to human-caused warming,” the report, the work of 13 US government agencies, states.
On current trends, the US economy is set to lose $500bn a year from crop damage, lost labor and extreme weather damages, the report found. Rainfall levels and flooding have increased in much of the country, with the amount of the US west consumed annually by wildfires set to increase as much as sixfold by 2050, according to the assessment.
But these warnings have been only intermittently heeded in decisions made by cities and states across the US, due to a lack of knowledge, political will or funding. The US has no national sea level rise plan, for example, and the Trump administration has scrapped rules around building infrastructure in areas deemed vulnerable to climate change. These circumstances have led to haphazard planning that results in certain dwellings repeatedly lost to flooding or fire.
“We live in an era of climate change and yet many of our systems, codes and standards have not caught up,” said Daniel Zarrilli, chief climate adviser to New York City, one of the few US cities with such a person. “Integrating climate science into everyday decisions is not just smart planning, it’s an urgent necessity.”
In its new report, the Science to Climate Action Network recommends the creation of a “civil-society-based climate assessment consortium” that would combine private and public interests to provide more localized help for communities menaced by floods, wildfires or other perils.
“Imagine working in state or county government – you have a road that is flooding frequently and you get three design options all with different engineering,” Moss said. “You don’t have the capacity to know what is the best option to avoid flooding, you just know what costs more.
“Climate issues aren’t being raised in communities. They may know they are vulnerable but they don’t know whether to use, for example, wetlands or a flood wall to stop flooding. We need to establish best practices and guide people on how to apply that locally.
“This is extremely urgent. Every year that goes by means more people losing everything from flooding and fire, including the lives of loved ones. This needs to be addressed as rapidly as possible.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/04/climate-change-trump-advisory-group-report-warning-global-warming

Labor’s climate spokesman, Mark Butler, said “it shows how out of touch the Liberals are even with their own department” when it comes to cutting carbon pollution from transport.
Labor’s climate policy, announced this week,  included a target for 50% of new cars sold by 2030 to be electric.
The government has said Labor’s reforms could prove costly – the environment minister, Melissa Price, said the party’s stance on electric cars “lacks any credible planning or detail to back up its target”.
The Morrison government’s electric vehicles policy has not yet been written but Price said the Coalition was aiming for “25% +” of all new vehicles to be electric by 2030.
The environment department told estimates hearings that projected emissions cuts of 10m tonnes through the government’s proposed electric vehicles strategy were based on data indicating electric cars could account for 25-50% of new sales by 2030.
The projection, contained in the climate solutions package, was drawn from data prepared for the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation by consulting firm Energeia.
“That analysis indicated that electric vehicles could make up between 25 to 50% of new car sales in 2030 if supported by coordination and facilitation of local state and commonwealth actions coordinated through a national strategy,” Kristin Tilley, the first assistant secretary of the department’s climate change division, told the hearing.
“Just so I’m clear, the government’s climate solutions policy includes a climate solution package that’s projecting a 10 mega tonnes CO2 abatement number that could come from an electric vehicle strategy, that sees 25 to 50% of new car sales in 2030 as electric vehicles?” the Labor senator Kristina Keneally asked.
“That’s right” officials said.
Officials told the hearing the government’s electric vehicle strategy hadn’t been written and the announcement in the climate solutions package was that one would be developed.
This week’s budget included $400,000 for its development, something that could take until mid-2020.
“The hard-right of the Coalition have strangled any effective climate change policy,” said Butler.
“That’s why the Liberals don’t have a transport emissions policy, just like they have no broader emissions reduction policy.
“A Shorten Labor government will work with Australia’s transport sector to cut vehicle emissions, boost adoption of electric vehicles and help Australians save on their petrol bills.”
Labor’s policy also includes a proposal for vehicle efficiency standards, which it originally proposed to impose on car retailers.
But it changed course this week and instead will require this of car manufacturers, similar to other countries.
Price said the “embarrassing backflip” suggested a lack of planning in the policy.
“Rapidly increasing the number of electric vehicles on the road requires a plan for a multi-billion dollar investment in charging stations and supporting infrastructure, and the equity of the associated reduction in fuel excise,” she said.
“That’s why the Coalition is making targeted investments in charging stations and creating a national electric vehicle strategy to coordinate federal, state and local government policy.

The project aims to reverse environmental decline and help people reconnect with nature as part of celebrations marking 550 years since the birth of the founder of Sikhism, Guru Nanak.
Rajwant Singh, the president of the Washington DC-based environmental organisation EcoSikh, which is coordinating the Million Tree Project, said he wanted to mark the anniversary in a significant way.
“Guru Nanak was a nature lover. [He] had talked about nature as a manifestation of God and many of his writings talk about how we need to learn lessons of life from nature.”
One of Guru Nanak’s hymns, which many Sikhs recite as a daily prayer, includes the lyrical line: “Air is the teacher, water is the father, earth is the mother.”
Singh said he hoped the project would motivate Sikhs – especially the young – to improve their relationship with nature and would be seen more broadly as “a gift to the entire planet”.
The Sikh diaspora has taken on the challenge and tens of thousands of trees have already been planted. These are mostly in India – the majority of the world’s Sikh population lives in the state of Punjab, which is planning to plant 550 saplings in every village – but also in the UK, US, Australia and Kenya.
Sikh Union Coventry has started planting native trees, shrubs and flowers such as hazel and hawthorn at Longford Park, and is exploring locations in schools, parks and recreation areas.
Palvinder Singh Chana, the chair of Sikh Union Coventry, said: “As Sikhs, our connection to the environment is an integral part of our faith and identity. Future generations will benefit from the fruits of our labour, symbolising peace, friendships and continuity for generations to come.”
EcoSikh is also working with Afforestt, an organisation that trains people to design and build small native forests that grow quickly and are a sustainable part of the ecosystem.
Singh said more than 1,800 of these forests were planned across the world, and that the million tree target would be achieved by the time of Guru Nanak’s birthday in November.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/05/sikhs-sikhism-guru-nanak-550-anniversary-tree-planting

Comparing human beings to natural disasters is both lazy and dehumanizing, but perhaps this tendency to lean on environmental language when describing migration is an unconscious acknowledgement of a deeper truth: much migration from Central America and, for that matter, around the world, is fueled by climate change.
Yes, today’s Central American migrants – most of them asylum seekers fearing for their lives – are fleeing gangs, deep economic instability (if not abject poverty), and either neglect or outright persecution at the hands of their government. But these things are all complicated and further compounded by the fact that the northern triangle of Central America – a region comprising Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, and the largest sources of asylum seekers crossing our border in recent years – is deeply affected by environmental degradation and the impacts of a changing global climate.
The average temperature in Central America has increased by 0.5C since 1950; it is projected to rise another 1-2 degrees before 2050. This has a dramatic impact on weather patterns, on rainfall, on soil quality, on crops’ susceptibility to disease, and thus on farmers and local economies. Meanwhile, incidences of storms, floods and droughts on are the rise in the region. In coming years, according to the US Agency for International Development, countries in the northern triangle will see decreased rainfall and prolonged drought, writ large. In Honduras, rainfall will be sparse in areas where it is needed, yet in other areas, floods will increase by 60%. In Guatemala, the arid regions will creep further and further into current agricultural areas, leaving farmers out to dry. And El Salvador is projected to lose 10-28% of its coastline before the end of the century. How will all those people survive, and where will they go?
El Salvador is projected to lose 10-28% of its coastline before the end of the century. How will all those people survive, and where will they go?
This September, I travelled to El Salvador to report on the impacts of the US government’s family separation policy. I’d been to El Salvador many times before, but never to the Jiquilisco Bay, a stunning, shimmering and once abundant peninsula populated by mangroves and fishing communities and uncountable species of marine life. It is also one that, like many places in El Salvador, and like many places in the world, is also imperiled by climate change. Rising sea levels are destroying the mangrove forests, the marine life that relies on them, and thus the fishermen who rely on that marine life to feed themselves and eke out a meager economy.
I met a man there named Arnovis Guidos Portillo, a 26-year-old single dad. Many people in his family were fishermen, but they were able to catch fewer and fewer fish. The country’s drought and devastating rainfall meant that the area’s farming economy, too, was suffering. The land was stressed, the ocean was stressed, and so were the people. Arnovis got into a scuffle one day at a soccer game, which placed him on a hitlist with a local gang. He had been working as a day laborer here and there, but the drought meant there was less work, and it was hard to find work that didn’t require crossing into rival gang territory. If he did, he would be killed. So he took his daughter north to the United States, where border patrol agents separated them for two months, locking them up in different states and with zero contact.
Violence and environmental degradation are inextricably linked, and both lead to mass migration. An unstable planet and ecosystem lends itself to an unstable society, to divisions, to economic insecurity, to human brutality. When someone’s home becomes less and less livable, they move elsewhere. Wouldn’t each and every one of us do the same?
This week, the New Yorker’s Jonathan Blitzer published a series of pieces about the impacts of climate change in the Guatemalan highlands, where farmers are struggling to grow crops that they have been farming there for centuries. “In most of the western highlands,” Blitzer wrote, “the question is no longer whether someone will emigrate but when.” A few years ago, I reported from Guatemala’s dry corridor, several hours away from where Blitzer was reporting, where persistent drought had decimated the region’s agriculture, and particularly the coffee crop, on which roughly 90% of local farmers relied. It was a wildly different landscape from the one Blitzer described, but it faced the same problem: if you live in an agricultural zone, come from a long line of farmers and can’t reliably harvest your crops any more, what else is there to do but leave?
if you live in an agricultural zone, come from a long line of farmers and can’t reliably harvest your crops any more, what else is there to do but leave?
It’s abundantly clear that climate change is a driver of migration to the US – we have the data, we have the facts, we have the human stories. Still, the Trump administration has done nothing to intervene in this root cause. In fact, the US government has systematically denied the existence of climate change, rolled back domestic regulations that would mitigate US carbon emissions and thumbed its nose at international attempts – such as the Paris accords – to curb global warming.
Now, in his latest futile, small-minded and cruel attempt to cut migration off at the neck (something we know is not possible – an unhealthy societal dynamic must be addressed at the root, just like with a struggling tree or crop), Donald Trump announced last week that he would cut all foreign aid to the northern triangle. It’s a punitive move, and one that – just like building a wall, separating families, locking people up indefinitely, and refusing asylum seekers entry across the border – is a petty intimidation tactic that will do nothing to actually curb forced migration.
In fact, cutting aid to Central America will do quite the opposite, for as much waste and imperfections as there are in international aid, aid in Central America has been vital for creating community safety programs, job skills development and government accountability standards. It has also helped with drought mitigation and supporting climate-resilient agricultural practices. In other words, foreign aid to Central America – a place unduly hit by climate change – is supporting the kind of climate change resiliency that will keep people from having to leave in the first place.
Because people really don’t want to leave their homes for the vast uncertainty of another land, particularly when that land proves itself again and again to be hostile to migrants’ very existence. People don’t want to be raped along the route north, or die in the desert, or have their child ripped away from them by the border patrol, or be locked up indefinitely without legal counsel, without adequate medical care, with no idea what will happen to them and when. Who would risk this if things were OK back home? People like Arnovis leave because they feel like they have to.
Eventually Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officials convinced Arnovis to sign deportation papers with the promise that, if he did, he would be reunited with his daughter and returned to El Salvador. But he was shooed on to a plane back home without her. It took a tremendous amount of advocacy, but, after months locked up in the US, she, too was returned home. They are now back together, which is a good thing, but the fundamental problem hasn’t changed: he can’t find work. His society is ill. So is the planet, and the land and sea all around him.
Today, there are 64 million forced migrants around the world, more than ever before. They are fleeing war, persecution, disaster and, yes, climate change. The UN estimates that by 2050, there will be 200 million people forcibly displaced from their homes due to climate change alone.
Migration is a natural human phenomenon and, many argue, should be a fundamental right, but forced migration – being run out of home against one’s will and with threat to one’s life – is not natural at all. Today, whether we choose to see it or not, climate change is one of the largest drivers of migration, and will continue to be for years to come – unless we do something about it. If we want people to be able to stay in their homes, we have to tackle the issue of our changing global climate, and we have to do it fast.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/06/us-mexico-immigration-climate-change-migration

I can see how that might be the case in our rusty old constituency system with FPTP, but what impact does it have on EU elections, which send MEPs from large constituent areas, chosen by PR? I would have thought that any local concentrations of remain or leave voters would get evened out.
BQEND
The constituencies are regional. Remain is heavily concentrated in a few regions. Leave is more evenly spread across many more. The same applies. Look at that distribution map. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/eu_referendum/results
If it becomes a Remain/Leave battle then it'll be unlike 2014 where party tags still played a significant role. It will be far more binary. For example the London vote for 8 seats saw 4 Lab 2 Con 1 Grn 1 UKIP In the referendum London went ~ 60/40 for Remain
If it goes binary then I expect London to be 5 - 3 for remain. Essentially Leave gaining 2. through that binary/vote efficiency influence.
Then take EU seats for Yorks and the Humber. It returns 6 seats In 2014 it returned 3 UKIP 2 Lab 1 Con. In that EU seat the vote was more or less the reverse. 42% Remain 58% Leave. So it would be likely to return 4 Leave candidates. Leave gains 1
You see how it's working Leave gains in Leave areas and in Remain areas.
Here's a good visual for you:https://ig.ft.com/sites/elections/2016/uk/eu-referendum/
That's the 2016 result broken down by the 12 EU constituencies. Leave wins in 9 of the 12. The two where Remain would pile up the votes London Scotland and slightly less so in Northern Ireland represent 17 of the 73 seats. And using London as the measure Remain would take 10/11 Leave would take 6/7. 
In the other 9 EU Constituencies Leave was the majority. That's 66 seats. 
Here are the Leave / Remain % in 2016 rough figures as this is just a demo of the vote efficiency of Leave. 
W Midlands 59% Leave 3/2E Midlands 59% Leave 4/3East England 58% Leave 4/3Yorks & Humber 58% Leave 4/2NW England 53% Leave 5/3NE England 53% Leave 2/1SE England 52% 6/4SW England 52% 4/2Wales 52% 3/1
Most likely outcome overall is that in a binary EU election and based roughly on 2016 Ref votes that the effect of voting efficiency would be around a 45/28 win for Leave. The vote intention may have changed that's not my point. The point is that the distribution of votes means that even a national 52% - 48% split for Leave as per last time the result is magnified to a 45/28 win of MEP seats for Leave.', u'recommendation_count': u'16', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1554739482000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'13512306', u'in_reply_to': u'127850500', u'id': u'127855627', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'bonhiver', u'text': u'I find the criticism of arguments agaisnt free movement of EU citizens into the UK a bit perplexing.

I know I am; you take one day off from following the ins and outs and even though “nothing has changed” for weeks, you’re somehow behind. You know it’s important, but watching politicians and commentators trade macho insults is incredibly tedious. And now there could be European elections on the cards.
A European election might seem like a distraction when it can’t deliver what the country desperately needs: a general election and with it a new government that will fund our schools so they aren’t at the point of collapse and design an economy where the norm is not plummeting living standards and rising homelessness. 
European elections are a hard sell. We were told we’d have left the EU by now. A swift, successful departure is what leave MPs kept saying was possible – and it’s what Theresa May said she would deliver. For people who want Brexit over, the last thing they’re interested in is voting for more politicians they don’t even think should exist. But with the Commons in deadlock, elections on the 23 May is where we might be headed.
So it seems to me there’s a choice: either the elections end up as a rerun of the referendum campaign – with one side demanding Brexit and crying betrayal and the other rehashing the same uncritical pro-EU messages from three years ago – or we step away from these torturous, well-rehearsed arguments and try something different. Rather than resent the elections, perhaps they could be an opportunity to talk about all the things we haven’t been focusing on because of Brexit.
The British left has to engage. We have a pretty good idea what the right will say, focused as they are on ramping up anti-immigrant rhetoric, imperial nostalgia and mythical sovereignty. Their rhetoric poses a very real, violent threat that must be countered.
Whether, in the end, we remain just inside the EU, just outside of it or somewhere else altogether, there are issues the left has to consider and bring to the mainstream. It must tap into progressive internationalist movements – including explaining the importance of cooperation with the rest of Europe – and advocate for tackling tax avoidance, climate change, the rise of the far right and the mistreatment of migrants.
Last month, right in front of the building where MPs have been plotting their next moves and TV stations have almost permanently set up camp, thousands of schoolchildren gathered in Parliament Square as part of a global movement demanding action on climate breakdown. A few days of news coverage, some tone-deaf comments from Theresa May and the news cycle moved on, but the climate is still breaking down. We need to hear nonstop about Labour’s green new deal and how they are working with people around the world on climate change; about how MEPs might team up with their leftwing allies to develop this – and what this future cooperation might look like.
The far right is on the rise and already attempting to commandeer the levers of the EU. Matteo Salvini – the Italian deputy prime minister, who last year said he would expel Roma from his country, where there has since been an intensification of violent anti-Roma racism – is trying to build an alliance of far right parties for the elections. And though far from a unified force, the far-right already has a foothold in Poland, Hungary and Austria and is doing well in other parts of the continent. If it gains more power and is able to wield anti-immigrant politics to promote a racially homogenous Europe, the continent’s borders will become firmer – and member states’ policies will become ever more violent, exclusionary and racist. We need a united, anti-racist, pro-migrant left fighting across and against borders worldwide.
But of all the problems at the heart of Brexit, the one that has been most neglected is Britain’s deep and damaging anti-migrant politics. The left needs to take on anti-migrant narratives unashamedly and directly, including during the European elections. Arguing for free movement is one of many starting points. The failure of the Labour party to make the case for this, loud and proud, is hugely disappointing. But if the broader left can keep up the pressure, the leadership has shown it is not above changing course.
The Conservative party has been tearing chunks out of itself over Europe for decades and it’s conducting the final stage of that battle while in government, to the detriment of us all. All the while, our slow destruction of the planet accelerates, and inequality and anti-migrant politics grow. There is no quick fix but the left should use everything they can to change the debate for the better. The European elections should be seen not as an irrelevant distraction, but as an opportunity to campaign for a better future.

While stopping short of a promise to fully divest from fossil fuels, the pledge by the trustees marks an important first step towards assessing and reducing the effect of the pension fund’s investments – which are ultimately paid for by the taxpayer – on climate change.
The move is a victory for a group of MPs from all parties who have long campaigned for changes that would stop the funds – which amount to more than £700m – being invested in companies that promote or benefit from fossil fuels, thus exerting economic pressure on them to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP who has been campaigning for reform of the fund, said: “Protecting the natural world is now humanity’s greatest mission, so this change of tack from the MPs’ pension fund is very welcome. It has taken four long years to get to this point, but the trustees finally now appear to accept that fossil fuels are a risky investment, both for savers and the planet, and this marks a significant change in policy.”
Around the world, the divestment campaign targeting investors with large holdings in fossil fuels has gathered pace in the last five years and won notable victories. Last week, Norway’s national oil fund began to refocus on renewable energy. About two-thirds of the UK’s university pension funds, as well as other public pension funds, have also either divested or reformed their rules, though some have retained their fossil fuel focus despite strong public pressure.
Other funds to have divested include the Irish infrastructure fund, the New York state pension fund, and in the UK local authorities including Waltham Forest and Southwark.
The pensions of MPs are looked after by the parliamentary contributions pensionfund (PCPF). The trustees have written to Lucas, in correspondence seen by the Guardian, to confirm they will reconsider the funding guidelines to recognise the risks from climate change.
The trustees have committed to asking their advisers to “prepare a climate change policy” and added that they “do wish to show ambition in this area”. They will formulate a responsible business plan, and by October update the statement of investment principles.
They also said divestment would be considered alongside the option of keeping fossil fuel shareholdings in order to have a “voice” on the future direction of those companies, to put pressure on the businesses involved.
Five of the top 20 investments made by the fund, representing more than £20m, are in fossil fuel companies including the UK-based BP, which makes up the biggest single shareholding by the fund. Others include Royal Dutch Shell of the UK and Netherlands, and the French company Total.
Last December, more than 200 serving and former MPs from all parties, spearheaded by Lucas, called on the PCPF to phase out fossil fuel investment.
Lord Deben, chair of the Committee on Climate Change and former Conservative environment secretary, called the trustees’ initiative a “positive step” and said the PCPF should follow scientific advice as the basis of its investment policies.
“The PCPF should now adopt a strategy that shifts investment towards companies driving innovation in low-carbon technology, and over time remove their investments from coal, oil and gas altogether,” he said. “Aligning investment with the 1.5C aspiration of the Paris agreement is the best way to protect our prosperity for many generations to come.”
Sir Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat former secretary of state for climate change and energy, called on all pension funds to make the shift to investment in renewable energy and other low-carbon efforts. “All pension trustees ought to ensure their investments take account of climate risk, so it’s right parliament should take this initiative,” he said. “The best way is to switch funds from fossil fuels into clean technologies, as these are already highly profitable, but without the long-term carbon risk of oil, gas and coal.”
Moves to divest the MPs’ fund have faced opposition in the past. When Liz Truss, one of the names mooted as a possible leader of the Conservative party, was asked by the Guardian whether she supported such a move as environment secretary in 2015, she said she opposed it.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/09/parliament-pension-fund-fossil-fuel-divestment-climate-change

In a statement issued before a federal election date is announced, 23 former emergency services leaders and senior personnel have called on both major parties to recognise the need for “national firefighting assets”, including large aircraft, to deal with the scale of the threat.
The signatories include: Greg Mullins, the second-longest serving fire and rescue commissioner in New South Wales and now a councillor with the Climate Council; Neil Bibby, a former chief executive of Victoria’s Country Fire Authority; Phil Koperberg, a former NSW rural fire service commissioner and former Labor MP and NSW environment minister.
The document calls on the next prime minister to meet former emergency service leaders “who will outline, unconstrained by their former employers, how climate change risks are rapidly escalating”.
The group also wants the next government to commit to an inquiry into whether Australia’s emergency services are adequately resourced to deal with increased risks from natural disasters caused by climate change.
They said some large firefighting aircraft were prohibitively expensive for states and territories and leased from the northern hemisphere, and access to them was becoming more restricted as fire seasons started to overlap.
“I started firefighting in 1971 and the bushfire seasons were extremely predictable,” Mullins said. “They’d start in Queensland and move south progressively.
“You knew when there was a bad season coming because there was an El Nino and drought. In the 90s, I stopped being able to predict it.”
Australia’s emergency resources were still equipped for “what was happening in the 1970s to the 1990s”.
“The first thing is we need whoever is in government nationally to take climate change seriously, rather than making jokes about it in parliament with lumps of coal,” he said.
“It’s just frustrating to hear the lip service being given to ‘Oh yes, we now believe in climate change and need to do something’ when every effort to do something about it is rubbished.”
Last year, in Australia alone, the NSW fire season began in early August, a heatwave led to fires in rainforest areas of Queensland in early December, and forest in Tasmania’s world heritage area caught fire in January, Australia’s hottest month on record.
For the past week the government has been running attacks on Labor’s proposal for electric vehicle targets to reduce carbon emissions.
“You look at any of your headlines over the last six months,” Bibby said. “The hottest month. The hottest summer.
“We know the problem, and the only way to get politicians to do something about these things is put their jobs on the line.”
Bibby said an additional concern was that Australia relied so heavily on volunteers during natural disasters.
As extreme weather becomes more frequent, and fire seasons longer, that would put strain on the system and volunteers helping their communities were at risk of burnout.
There needed to be a review of the methods used to tackle large fires, cyclones and floods that was backed by research from experienced people working on the ground.
“We’re doing the same old things when things are getting worse. We need to find new ways to tackle this problem,” Bibby said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/apr/09/former-fire-chiefs-warn-australia-unprepared-for-escalating-climate-threat

In his first day at the helm of the Washington-based institution, David Malpass said helping developing countries cope with global warming would remain central to the bank’s mission.
Malpass also said there would be no change in the bank’s refusal to lend for new coal-fired power plants, despite Trump’s strong support for US coal producers.
“Climate change is a key problem facing people,” Malpass said. “It presents specific problems and we are addressing them through adaptation and through meeting our climate change action plan. My expectation is that the bank continues the direction it has been pursuing in terms of those goals.”
Malpass was appointed unopposed last week, continuing a tradition that the US gets to choose the president of the World Bank while the Europeans appoint the managing director of the International Monetary Fund.
But there were concerns, both among the bank’s staff and campaign groups, that the former US Treasury official would adopt a growth-at-any-cost approach that would downplay the organisation’s recent environmental focus. Bank sources said there was relief when, in an address to staff, Malpass mentioned climate change twice and called the challenge “immense”.
The World Bank’s climate change action plan has pledged to increase lending in poor countries vulnerable to global warming, warning that failure to act risks pushing an additional 100 million people into poverty by 2030.
Asked at a press briefing about his views on the bank’s anti-coal policy, Malpass said: “The World Bank board and the governors have established a policy on that. I don’t expect a change in that policy.”
He added: “The mission of the bank is urgent. There are 700 million people living in extreme poverty and that’s 700 million too many. I want to continue with the mission to alleviate and eliminate extreme poverty and the mission of shared prosperity.”
Malpass said his first visit as bank president would be to sub-Saharan Africa later this month and it was worrying that the world’s poorest countries were being affected by the slowdown in the global economy seen since the middle of 2018.
“It’s very important that global growth be faster. It is a key part of meeting the challenge on poverty and shared prosperity.”
In addition to tackling the problems of climate change, Malpass said it was important that developing countries had robust private sectors and encouraged women to take a full role in the economy.
The new World Bank president said there would be an evolution in its relationship with China but no dramatic change. As it grew richer, China would borrow less from the bank and contribute more capital.
There had been a shift in the bank’s lending towards lower-income countries with greater needs and away from middle-income countries, Malpass said. “China has not been singled out but the expectation is that countries that have done better will be reducing their lending from the bank.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/09/new-world-bank-chief-confirms-commitment-to-environment

BULLSHIT!
Of course we in Australia must do more, much more, to curb our emissions. However we have no control over what the big emitters such as China, EU and US do. We cannot stop the Brazilians and Indonesians destroying their forests. These are realities.
Failing to plan for worst case scenarios is folly.
Demonising people like me who urge governments to develop a ""plan B"" as ""neoliberal climate deniers"" is disgusting.
People like you are part of the problem, not part of the solution.

For a political party willing to indulge interventionist economic policy, interventionist development of the region would have a lot more to offer than a desperate cargo cult comprising a dodgy firm noted for its sharp practices. Recall too how the political class bent over backwards to make sure Australia got nothing from the last cargo cult – the Greatest Mining Boom (for Transnational Capitalism) That Australia Has Ever Had. Local manufacturers got a few percent.
An expansion of the public sector to provide critical infrastructure and services, a serious Skills Development framework, and a Job Guarantee that would provide public sector employment for all those willing and able to work, would offer more and better opportunities than Adani’s water pollution and tax havens.
Seldom mentioned in the regular discussion about “skill shortages” is that the obvious mismatches between the skills needed and the skills available arise substantially from the systematic destruction of GBEs (government business enterprises) over the last three decades. GBEs regarded serious training as a necessary part of their role; GBEs deliberately trained more people than were required, to counter the under-training propensity of the private sector, and did so to a higher standard. Profit-seekers want to spend as little as possible on training, preferably nothing, and import them – hence the inadequate skills and fewer opportunities for regions like North Queensland.
Serious money spent on support for public and profit-seeker ventures would not just offer much more, it would also deliver. 
ARENA (Australian Renewable Energy Agency) – which the Noalition worked so hard to destroy, then to neuter – recently invested $92 million in six plants in Queensland, five in New South Wales and one at Cervantes in Western Australia.

It may be necessary to own a car in a rural area where public transport is limited. It is optional to decide whether the car has a large or small engine. It is necessary to live in a decent sized home that can accommodate a family of four. It is optional to continue living in the same house once the kids have left the home. It is necessary to go on holiday. It is optional to take a cruise around the world. IN the new thinking we can derive rights - including the right to consumption and emissions - from activities that are necessary. Everything that is optional must be treated as a privilege.
The question resembles the debate about smoking, on a grand scale. Is there an innate right to smoke and must non-smokers tolerate the smoker? Or, is smoking a privilege and it is up to the smoker to behave in a considerate manner or ask for permission from non-smokers? In the good old days, smokers behaved as if they had a right to smoke and were permitted to call out non-smokers to be tolerant. In our modern world (at least in most Western countries) the mindset has shifted and smoking is treated as a privilege where the non-smoker has a right to a smoke-free space.
We might be able to find piecemeal solutions to climate change. What will change the dynamic is to change our fundamental perspective about the rights and privileges of consumption and its climate impact.
I am optimistic! Our way of life can change. We do it all the time, even if we generally seem to believe that change is difficult. We have done away with punishments which we would today consider inhumane. We no longer attend public executions. it has become second nature to put trash in bins and recycle.

Over the past decade, climate change politics has knocked off four prime ministers, and split political parties and allegiances apart at their core.
The political risks in this election campaign are no doubt even more exacerbated, with many calling this the “climate election”. Nor is this a battle that is limited to the Green versus Labor swing seats. It is perhaps even more acute in key traditionally safe conservative seats. Buoyed by the result in the Wentworth byelection, several high profile independents are taking on Tony Abbott, Josh Frydenberg and Greg Hunt. Central to their campaign is climate change action.
In the last few weeks the major parties have trepidatiously released their climate change policy platforms. The LNP policies reflect a party that needs to be seen to be doing something to fend off the independents. Simultaneously it needs to somehow be seen not to be doing too much to avoid deserting votes on the right. The ALP policies on the other hand reflect a party trying to be seen to be doing a lot to capture the political momentum from the school strike movement, and the broad majority of Australians who want more climate action. On the other hand, being too ambitious gives the Murdoch press the ammunition for headlines it has frothed over for the past decade.
Both parties’ climate policies of both parties are dominated by energy and by and large focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Such policies and actions are often grouped in the category of “mitigation”. Mitigation in this case refers to actions that are taken to limit the magnitude or rate of long-term global warming and its related effects.
The 2019 election should highlight the need for adaptation more acutely than any other previous election
What is missing from both parties’ policy platforms is any substantive commitment to deal with adapting to climate change. Adaptation recognises that even with the most aggressive mitigation efforts, Australian society is already being impacted by a changing climate and will continue to do so.
Even among environment and climate groups, adaptation is often missing from advocacy platforms, or a footnote. Perhaps this is because for many climate activists, promoting adaptation sometimes has that feeling that the battle to combat rising temperatures has been lost.
Adaptation has long been the poor cousin of climate change policy and funding so perhaps this is no surprise. But what is perhaps more intriguing is that adaptation has often been the area of climate change policy that has had more bipartisan support. One of the first national adaptation strategies came about during the Howard era, and in many states, adaptation activity carried through changes in government more in tact than mitigation.
If anything, the 2019 election should highlight the need for adaptation more acutely than any other previous election. The number of weather and climate records surpassed in this last term of government has brought climate change “home” to many Australians. Images of dead fish in the Murray Darling, burning rainforests and button grass plains in the Tasmanian wilderness, coral reef bleaching is front of mind for a large majority of Australians. So are the more personal experiences of hotter and drier conditions and more extreme weather events.
No longer an abstract concern for future generations, it is an issue that is affecting Australians now and in major and complex ways. Unsurprisingly it is this dramatic shift from the abstract to the tangible that is galvanising non-traditional political actors to speak up and demand more. Groups like Farmers for Climate Action, the School Strike for Climate movement, and the Climate and Health Alliance are new movements challenging the climate politics of the past decade.
Local governments and their communities across the country are on the frontline of climate change impacts right here right now and need federal support. Interestingly, in its 2018 annual survey of Australian attitudes towards climate change, an Ipsos poll found that Australians considered local governments leading when it comes to climate action compared to state and federal governments and industry/business.
Infrastructure upgrades to improve resilience to extreme weather events and hotter and drier conditions are obvious needs. Community and social resilience programs to ensure communities are informed, empowered and have capacity to respond to climate change are also crucial. Several programs are under way, led by local governments such as the Ramp Up Resilience project in rural shires in northern Victoria, and the Resilient South project in South Australia.
Critically, what is needed most is funding support to local communities to design local solutions to the very localised impacts of climate change already being experienced. This goes beyond disaster relief funding, but takes a more proactive approach so that communities can become more resilient to disasters as they will inevitably unfold.
In coming weeks hopefully we will hear both parties reveal the rest of their climate change policies, the much needed adaptation policies.

Obama's debts look bigger on paper than past presidents because the US dollars keep losing value to inflation. Obama borrowed many more dollars to get the same amount of wealth compared to Reagan. 
That, and Obama entered office with more of a mess, and equally important, all presidents are starting off with a given level of deficit spending. To judge how conservative or reckless they are, you have to compare it to what immediately preceded them. It takes more fiscal responsibility to cut a deficit from $100 down to $50 than it does to increase a deficit from $10 to $25.

We must be putting faith to use if we expect that divine intervention that we have these tools that will limit what we shall do to the 7.7 Billion already present, adding about 100,000,000 per year. Just listen to the idiocy in response to saying that the total U.S. population could be replaced in just one presidential cycle.
It is only in the abstract thinking, of which few are familiar, that suggest measures of procreation will have any direct effect on any solution what so ever. (It’s the endemic relationship between Lee, LDS and Utah.)
We have technology its benefits of expanding population and at the same time reducing the birth rate. 
Those are just facts, but in the leisured aftermath of easing labor we have developed no practicable intelligence to see that abstract picture, the relationship between the energy we use and just how it that carbon has already modified life over it presence with water and sunlight over reasons. 
The politicalized human adopting for governance variations of the general theme of a top down hierarchal power structure. That hierarchy begins in the home, were I to say nest we’d find it inconvenient to compare that sort of independence to the length social imperatives of home, village, and all the steps up the hierarchy up to the “deep state” conspiracy to assert power including those odd survivalist tool the “nuclear bomb”.
This hierarchy exist everywhere and might general called ‘money’ including the corporate ways to accumulate more. In the abstract this entrenched hierarchy cannot question itself; no real debate of what it is and not one single idea of how it may work; democracy has always succumbed to the brute force of the hierarchy. Democracy can be criticized for promising things to try yet exhaust itself again the conservative of no, no, impossible, can’t get there from here, my way or the highway, and outright fragrant denial.
Economic denial: (or the evangelical apocalyptic view of revelations and the chosen people; aka the end is neigh.)
1) Woman’s (man’s kingdom not) first invention was fire; allowing food to be easier digested, to yield 20% more calories, and the usual movement out of the caves to the farm lands. {Fiscal conservatives will deny that discovering fire paid for itself? Thought the market for spears, cubs and bows and arrows declined?}
2) Next was the draft animal, to save husbands, and farm that extra land, growing the farm to harvest fodder paid for the horses, oxen et. al. {Fiscal conservatives will deny that those ‘hay burning’ animals, expended the farm and paid for itself?}
3) Freed from the land, I dislike pendulant narratives, wooded ships to set sail and harvest the sea, expanded growth then paid the bills. {Fiscal conservatives will deny that expenditures for these explorations paid for themselves, by exploitation?}
4) On new land, work to done, oops - slaves and then soon the steam engine, the first direct use of fossil carbon, to power machines, produce goods, expended trade, growth and products paid the bills. {Fiscal conservatives will deny that mother nature buried these carbon resources to remove them from the living planet; it is utterly amazing that fiscal conservatives profiting from these carbon resources fail to see how central carbon is to life?} 
5) Vast capitalization and new enabling industry and limited corporate and stockholder liability, Congress you would know created a vast consumer network for paying the bills. {Fiscal conservatives will deny the government franchise ever expanded canals, railroads, highways and air lines reckless spending that again paid for itself; check you stock portofolio

It’s the kind of sober language typically used to describe a climate crisis which – if we continue on with business as usual – could end human civilization as we know it. McAdams, though, was describing a decidedly less grave threat, if it can be considered a threat at all: the federal deficit.
He and 26 other members of the so-called Blue Dog Coalition – centrist and fiscally-conservative Democrats – are pushing for a constitutional amendment that would prohibit the federal government from running a deficit if there isn’t a war or recession happening. Social security and Medicare would be spared from the brutal spending cuts the amendment would bring about ... but that’s it.
At a time when scientists are calling for governments to adopt a “wartime footing” to address the existential threat of climate change, the proposal isn’t just a stupid play into Republican hands. It’s climate denial.
McAdams’ proposal emerged after a lengthy fight between those so-called moderate Democrats and the 90 member Congressional Progressive Caucus over a proposed budget measure, which House Democratic leadership moved to cancel a vote on Tuesday afternoon amidst rising tensions. Progressive wanted more domestic spending and less for our already bloated military. Moderates – radically – want to curb spending overall.
And for what? There’s nothing inherently dangerous about a growing deficit; vigilante bondholders are not going to come knocking on America’s door threatening our sovereignty. And a country that issues debt in its own currency like the US is never going to face the kind of sadistic punishment the Troika visited upon Greece several years back. Deficits do matter, of course. But what’s important isn’t their dollar value. It’s whether the things that public money is pouring into are actually putting the economy on a stronger footing.
Republicans know this all too well. Famed small government deficit hawk Ronald Reagan ran up the third largest debt of any US president, after Franklin D Roosevelt and Barack Obama. And today’s Republican party didn’t bat an eye before passing $2tn worth of tax cuts that mainly benefit the wealthy.
Centrist Democrats, meanwhile, paint themselves as the fiscally responsible wing of their party out to curb waste on both sides of the aisle. Yet what’s so responsible about kneecapping the government’s ability to avert $32bn worth of infrastructure damage, $118bn from sea level rise and $141bn in costs due to heat related illness, according to the National Climate Assessment?
If there were some foreign invader threatening to inflict this much damage on the US, neither conservative Democrats nor Republicans would bat an eye before throwing as many resources as possible toward fighting them off. Because the threat is posed by climate change – and these politicians’ fossil fuel executive donors – their response has ranged instead from indifference to outright denial. They may not all quibble with the scientific consensus on global warming, but they’re doing everything they can to sabotage reasonable responses to it.
Most recently, they’ve taken to pushing back on calls for a Green New Deal – the only proposal on the table that remotely matches the ambition science demands. While Republicans fabricated a $93tn price tag for the Green New Deal, it’s impossible to predict how much any suite of programs will cost until you have something concrete to look at and cost out.
What is clear, however, is that any earnest response to the climate crisis will require significant federal investment to do things like electrify large swaths of the economy, scale up renewable energy and invest in communities likely to be hardest hit by a transition away from fossil fuels. Done right, these investments could radically improve Americans’ quality of life and salvage our chance for a livable future. A balanced budget amendment would take away the best tools we have to make one possible.
As Republicans pick and choose when to fearmonger about the deficit, Democrats like McAdams continue to describe its growth in apocalyptic terms – all the while ignoring the actual apocalypse the climate crisis could bring about. “It is clear we are on a dangerous and unsustainable course,” he wrote in the Deseret News. “The decisions won’t be easy, but our children and our grandchildren are counting on us to make this right.”
If McAdams and other centrist Democrats were actually worried about their children and grandchildren, they’d throw out their amendment and back the Green New Deal that so many young people have rallied behind. For now, they’re more interested in screwing them over.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/10/fiscally-conservative-democrats-green-new-deal

""The Medieval Warm Period was certainly not a global event and probably didn't even span the entire North Atlantic region,"" said Nicolás Young, a glacial geologist at Columbia University who was the lead author of the study, in an interview about that research. 
""These glaciers were almost just as big during the Medieval Warm Period as they were during the Little Ice Age in the Baffin Bay and Labrador Sea region,"" Young said. ""It probably wasn't all that warm during the Medieval Warm Period.""
BQEND
The Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age were concepts introduced about 50 years ago by early climate researchers, particularly Hubert Lamb, based on evidence available at that time, but the more they are investigated the more ephemeral they become.
The 11th century was about as warm as the 20th century before the 1990s, and the temperature around 1600 AD was about 0.7  C deg below the average of 1961–90.

For the six thousand years leading up to the Industrial Revolution the pattern was slow cooling at an average rate of about 0.2 degrees C per millennium.

The evidence from attribution studies is that human activity is the cause, not a cause.
Attribution studies specifically aim to attribute causes for the recent warming.
Here's one attribution study -
""Global temperature evolution 1979–2010"" - Foster & Rahmstorf, 2011
BQSTART
...........we list the linear trend in the signals due to ENSO, volcanic forcing and solar variation in table 3. 
The magnitudes of these trend contributions are quite small compared to the overall trends.
In fact the net trend due to these three factors is negative for all data sets except UAH, for which it is zero. Hence these factors have not contributed to an upward trend in temperature data, rather they have contributed a very slight downward trend
BQENDOK, that is quite technical but this means that without human activity, the Earth would be cooling very very slowly, due to natural cycles.
""A probabilistic quantification of the anthropogenic component of twentieth century global warming"" - Wigley & Santer, 2012.
BQSTART
For forcing by greenhouse gases (GHGs) only, we show that there is a greater than 90 % probability that the expected warming over 1950–2005 is larger than the total amount (not just “most”) of the observed warming.
BQEND
So by assessing how much effect the greenhouse gases would be expected to have, they showed that this process accounts for more than the actual warming recorded.
Which means - again - that if the greenhouse gases were not being added, the Earth would be cooling very very slowly.
The Earth's temperature is a response to various factors, called climate forcings, such as changes in the gases in the air, changes in the Earth's orbit and rotation (which alters the amount of energy reaching the surface from the Sun) and some others.
Here's a useful summary, produced by the British Geological Survey:

On issues that involves the environment the money to pay for mass trolling, is trifling and well worth companies paying certain `think-tanks` etc to do just that. Always at second hand of course, they pay others who arrange it. Its far more careful than what the Tobacco companies did by paying `Doctors` etc, they rarely get involved themselves, that would be very dangerous PR wise. However, most is just funding organizations who are already Climate Change skeptics on Capitalist lines, low tax small government types mostly. 
I have researched this for twenty years with great interest, for the companies it is peanuts, but well worth it to create `uncertainty`. Anti Vaxers tend to be non paid fanatics, Russia does political trolling, but Climate Change trolling is a mix of individual nut jobs and paid for trolls, mostly - in my opinion - the later.

He ended up spending decades applying this technique to more and more examples of similar sedimentary successions - the process works because a beetle wing-case is usually sufficient to identify a species, and the species have not changed much in a long time.
Any given collection of species taken together indicates a very precise temperature.
His discovery tells us that the Earth's climates are not necessarily stable.
These rapid climate events were confirmed a few decades later by ice cores from the Greenland ice sheet..... the events he discovered had a number of natural causes.

The Tobacco companies denied the smoking/cancer link, long after they themselves knew it was true. That was evil.

There is no more room to question the science, when nearly every climate scientist is in agreement that the implications of a global rise in average temperature will spell drastic changes for human civilisation. In the face of such a rapidly encroaching threat, political niceties and traditional incrementalism and compromise cannot come close to the level of change and upheaval required to solve, or even mitigate, the problem of global climate change.
Climate scientists continue to stress the importance of lowering carbon emissions significantly, yet they are currently increasing at an accelerating rate. A 2018 UN study found that unless promised emission reductions under the Paris agreement were tripled, they would cause the global temperature increase to reach 3C by 2100 and continue to rise after that. Meanwhile, some of the most influential people in the world continue to deny the very existence of climate change. Even as the relatively tame 2018 IPCC report states that we must cut our emissions in half within the next decade, people are feeling that their elected leaders, and mainstream political avenues as a whole, cannot measure up to this task.
The current ineptitude and impotency of the ruling class is unacceptable when the consequences of inaction are so far-reaching. More than ever, it is time for workers – those who will be hardest hit by soaring food and healthcare costs, and by property destruction caused by natural disasters and the rising sea – to exert their power and force the hand of major players (governments and corporations) to avert what is almost certain to be the next global mass extinction.
As such, climate activism of all types is blossoming. Greta Thunberg’s school strikes led to one of the largest global climate demonstrations in history. Extinction Rebellion has shut down major intersections in London and held events around the world. The Sunrise Movement caught the attention of the US when children in San Francisco confronted the Democratic senator Dianne Feinstein over her climate policy. Indigenous groups across the globe have been fighting tooth and nail against resource development on their ancestral lands. And Earth Strike is preparing for a global general strike on 27 September 2019.
Through all of this, as Greta Thunberg has said, one thing must be made clear. There is no greater way to capture the attention of the public, and the powers that be, than a general labour strike. An old and effective strategy, it is the holy grail of activism. And in such dire times, there is no question that a general strike is sorely needed once more. Earth Strike is seeking to revive the general strike in service of a global, apocalyptic problem – one that encompasses the lives of every creature on the face of this planet.
The reason Earth Strike exists is that shutting off the global labour supply will force governments and industry giants to listen. There’s no way to avoid the conversation when profits are in danger of eroding, and production has stalled to a halt. Every day we go into work and spend our time and labour building a system that is burning us alive. The top polluters in the world are directly dependent on this effort. It is time to withhold it.
Some will inevitably argue that labour action is too disruptive, and too messy, but that’s the very point. The system causing this crisis needs to be disrupted. A general strike is an exceptionally powerful tool with a long history of gaining concession. In Iceland in 1975, a women’s general strike was instrumental in guaranteeing equal pay; and in India earlier this year, a general strike by between 150m and 200m workers illuminated the injustices inflicted on them by Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata party. We simply don’t have the time to forge a new tool from scratch.
In fact, the opposite reaction is more likely. 27 September is only the first strike, and sympathisers all over the globe are bound to take notice. To those who do not feel like they have the power alone, organise. Unions and workers must work together in solidarity. The growing number of participants in this general strike, numbering in the tens of thousands, are already talking about what will come next. For whatever comes, we will fight, and strike, together.

The consultation with 76,000 girls and young women aged from four to 25 in the UK by the Girlguiding organisation, also found bullying, gender stereotypes and pressures to look a certain way were among primary concerns.
Student and brownie leader Juliet Dowley, 19, who helped to conduct the research, said: “Among younger age groups, girls are more aware of the barriers that face them.”
Those aged 14 to 25 said tackling sexual harassment and unhealthy relationships were top priorities they wanted to see addressed for the future. A study by Hollaback! and Cornell University found that 90% of British women report experiencing street harassment before age 17.
For younger girls, climate change topped concerns, with 36,309 seven- to 10-year-olds wanting to live in a world where people cared more about the environment and recycling.
“I found those results really interesting because climate change isn’t really something girlguiding has been talking about,” said Dowley. “I think people like Greta Thunberg, who also happens to be a young woman, are having a big impact.”
On Tuesday, during a speech to MPs, the 16-year-old activist Thunberg hit out at the UK government’s continued support for fossil fuels and airport expansion.
In light of their research, Girlguiding has launched Future Girl, a manifesto that will help to inform its campaign work and practices. Among the goals listed are better regulation of social media platforms, and for women’s sport to be treated equally to men’s sport among its goals.
For 15,800 girls aged 10 to 14, not being able to do the same things as boys was the most unfair thing about being a girl today. Ruyuan, a 15-year-old girlguiding advocate, said: “When it comes to the important decisions that will affect our futures, we aren’t being listened to. We deserve better than that.”
The organisation’s previous campaigns have included one to bring an end to period poverty and the No More Page 3 campaign against the publication of topless women in the Sun.
Damian Hinds, the education secretary, said: “In many ways there has never been a better time to grow up, but this generation also faces new or heightened pressures in their lives.
“As education secretary, but also as a father of two daughters, I want to see happy, confident, resilient young women making their voices heard on issues that affect them.”
The minister for women, Victoria Atkins, said: “I want girls today to feel empowered to be at the centre of tomorrow’s issues. Future Girl can play a key part in this.
“It is awful, but sadly not shocking, that more than a third of girls are put off from going into politics because of how female politicians are represented in the media.”
In a survey by the organisation last year, more than half of girls aged 11 to 21 who responded said social media was a main cause of stress for them. More than two-thirds believed their life chances were getting worse, while 73% said women had to work harder than men to succeed.
Girlguiding’s CEO, Angela Salt, said: “Girls are growing up in a time of some uncertainty, but they are clear about the future they want, as our research with them shows.
“They care about personal issues such as free period products in schools, they care about their own communities and they care about our environment.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/apr/25/climate-change-and-sexual-harassment-top-list-of-girls-concerns

We check Coalition's claims about Labor's climate change policy,article,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/25/fact-or-fiction-we-check-coalitions-claims-about-labors-climate-change-policy,0,"Short answer: no.
As reported on page one of the Australian on Wednesday, the Coalition says the country’s largest companies would face a combined bill of up to $26bn under Labor’s 2030 climate target (a 45% cut in emissions below 2005 levels). It says it will “strangle growth” and is effectively a carbon tax.
Among those claimed to be in the gun were the energy giant Chevron (allegedly facing a carbon bill of up to $1.6bn), the aluminium producer Alcoa ($867m) and BlueScope steel ($890m). Woolworths was said to face a $77m bill, potentially pushing up food prices. Similar stories appeared in News Corp papers across the country based on short spreadsheets and background material provided by the Coalition.
Versions of it, yes. Headlines have claimed Labor’s climate policies could cost anywhere between $25bn and $60bn. Those estimates were dismissed by some of the researchers whose work the articles cited.
They spring from changes Labor plans to make to a scheme known as the safeguard mechanism, which was set up by Greg Hunt as part of Tony Abbott’s Direct Action climate policy.
Big polluting industrial sites that emit more than 100,000 tonnes each now get a limit on how much carbon pollution they can release. The limit is known as a baseline. There is no cost on the businesses if they stay within their baseline but, if they exceed it, they must buy an emissions offset – a carbon credit – for every tonne they go over it.
Hunt implied that baselines would be reduced after 2020 to cut emissions but the Coalition doesn’t talk about that now. Instead, companies have been allowed to increase their baselines and, in most cases, pollute without penalty.
Labor says it would expand the safeguard mechanism so it also covered smaller industrial sites – those that emit more than 25,000 tonnes. It would also reduce pollution limits over time, as Hunt intended. To stay within their baseline, industrial sites would either have to cut emissions on site or pay for offsets for every tonne they go over their limit. Conversely, businesses that emitted less than their baseline would earn free carbon credits they could sell – a reward for reducing pollution.
There are questions about Labor’s approach that are yet to be answered – how rapidly it would require industrial sites to cut emissions over the next 11 years, for instance – but the Coalition has based its analysis on assumptions that have little to do with how the scheme would operate in the real world.
Crucially, it seems to have assumed that businesses under the mechanism would not cut pollution. The analysis seems to works on the idea they would just pay for international offsets to meet their obligations.
The Coalition has used two reports to assume these offsets would cost between $62 and about $100 a tonne by 2030 on an international market. That market does not now exist. (There are a handful of carbon markets that are mostly not linked.)
For starters, it not yet clear what sort of offsets will be available to businesses under Labor’s version of the safeguard mechanism. The Coalition assumes a flood of international offsets, but Labor’s policy says it would allow only limited use of credits from overseas.
Australia has its own carbon offsets market, where credits sell for about $16 a tonne. The market is small owing to limited demand, reflecting that businesses are mostly allowed to pollute without penalty. Most of the offsets are created through native vegetation projects and paid for by taxpayers via the $2.55bn emissions reduction fund. Labor plans to expand it and have polluters pay for the offsets.
Internationally, an obvious market Australia could link to is the European emissions trading scheme, where the carbon price is now about $43 a tonne. That’s unlikely to be appealing to business in the short term.
Other offset markets may develop but it is also likely it will be cheaper to cut emissions or buy local offsets rather than pay for credits from overseas, especially in the early years. Analysts at RepuTex found the cost of emissions cuts should line up with the relatively cheap Australian carbon market – less than $20 a tonne – and that a 45% emissions target would push down wholesale electricity prices.
An analysis by Citigroup reportedly found that total costs for major emitters under Labor’s scheme were likely to rise by less than 1% a year from 2020 to 2030.
It is also worth noting that it is highly unlikely Labor would require every industrial site under the safeguard mechanism to cut emissions by 45%. It says it would provide “tailored treatment” for trade-exposed big polluters such as aluminium, steel and liquefied natural gas. It implies they would be shielded from some of the cost if their competitors overseas did not face a similar regulation.
Both. While notable industrial players have repeatedly obstructed attempts to introduce bipartisan climate policy, many companies have been planning for a shift to a low-carbon world for a while. Some multinationals including Rio Tinto have contingencies for future carbon prices of up $140 a tonne built into their decision making.
Clean technology is getting cheaper. Some businesses under the safeguard mechanism would use offsets but others are investing or planning to invest in renewable energy and energy efficiency.
Not explicitly, but it is worth asking.
One of the odd things about the Coalition’s analysis is that it is partly based on a World Bank-backed study that found global carbon prices in 2030 would need to be between US$50 and US$100 to limit global warming to two degrees. But it doesn’t acknowledge that the Coalition has also committed to the two degrees goal (and more) by signing the Paris agreement.
Should we also assume the equivalent of up to a US$100 carbon price under Coalition policies? Or is it walking away from its commitment to Paris?
Media reporting often focuses on the cost of climate policy while ignoring the other side of the equation – the cost of doing nothing. Several studies have suggested it is significant.
A paper in the journal Nature estimated warming of between two and a half and three degrees could cut per-capita economic output by between 15% and 25% this century. Four degrees would be worse again.
This sort of scenario is increasingly being considered and factored in by insurers and long-term investors, who say they want action to avoid it. Whether political leaders and newspaper editors are listening is another question.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/25/fact-or-fiction-we-check-coalitions-claims-about-labors-climate-change-policy

The forests store huge amounts of carbon and are teeming with wildlife, making their protection critical to stopping runaway climate change and halting a sixth mass extinction. But deforestation is still on an upward trend, the researchers said. Although 2018 losses were lower than in 2016 and 2017, when dry conditions led to large fires, last year was the next worst since 2002, when such records began.
Clearcutting of primary forest by loggers and cattle ranchers in Brazil dominated the destruction, including invasions into indigenous lands where uncontacted tribes live. Losses were also high in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Indonesia. Indonesia is the only major country where government protections appear to be significantly reducing the losses.
Ghana and Ivory Coast recorded the biggest percentage rises in rainforest destruction, driven by gold mining and cocoa farming.
“We are nowhere near winning this battle,” said Frances Seymour from the World Resources Institute, part of the Global Forest Watch (GFW) network, which produced the analysis. “It is really tempting to celebrate a second year of decline since peak tree cover loss in 2016 but, if you look back over the last 18 years, it is clear that the overall trend is still upwards.”
“The world’s forests are now in the emergency room – it is death by a thousand cuts,” she said. “Band-Aid responses are not enough. For every hectare lost, we are one step closer to the scary scenario of runaway climate change.” There are many government and corporate efforts to combat deforestation, but they are not proving to be enough, Seymour said.
The analysis looked at all tree losses in the tropics, but focused on primary forests. These are untouched and store the most carbon and have the highest populations and variety of wildlife. Their destruction is seen as largely irreversible, even over decades.
More than 3.6m hectares (8.9m acres) of pristine rainforest was cut down in 2018, according to the data. “Most of the 2018 loss [1.3m hectares] is clearcutting in the Amazon,” said Mikaela Weisse, a GFW manager. “Shockingly we are also seeing some invasions into indigenous lands that have been immune to deforestation for years.”
For example, at the Ituna Itata reserve in Brazil there was more than 4,000 hectares of illegal clearing in the first half of 2018, more than double the total loss since 2002. The reserve is home to some of the world’s last remaining uncontacted peoples, who have conserved the forest for centuries. Forest protection is being weakened under Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, who took office in January, but these impacts will only be seen in the data for 2019.
In the DRC, primary forest loss was 38% higher in 2018 than the average from 2011-2017. Expansion of small-scale forest clearing for agriculture and firewood is thought to have caused about three-quarters of this loss.
The destruction of Indonesia’s pristine forests has been driven by palm oil plantations, but has begun to fall and is at its lowest level since 2003. The government’s policies appear to be working, but 2019 is likely to be a drier year in the country than the last two and fires exacerbated by the draining of land could spike again. “Indonesia is not out of the woods yet,” said Weisse.
Forest destruction jumped by 60% in Ghana and 26% in Ivory Coast. “The good news is the cocoa industry has taken steps to combat this trend,” said Caroline Winchester, a GFW research analyst. “In 2017 the cocoa and forests initiative launched to end further deforestation.” However, 70% of tree felling in Ghana and Ivory Coast was in protected areas, she said.
Seymour also highlighted the direct human tragedies. “Behind the bars on these charts are heartbreaking losses in real places,” she said. “All too often the loss of an area of forest is also associated with a funeral, because every year hundreds of people are murdered when they try to stop the miners, loggers and ranchers. The moral imperative to act on this story is unquestionable and urgent.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/25/death-by-a-thousand-cuts-vast-expanse-rainforest-lost-in-2018

Of a total 302 pipelines in some stage of development around the world, 51% are in North America, according to Global Energy Monitor, which tracks fossil fuel activity. A total of $232.5bn in capital spending has been funneled into these North American pipeline projects, with more than $1tn committed towards all oil and gas infrastructure.
If built, these projects would increase the global number of pipelines by nearly a third and mark out a path of several decades of substantial oil and gas use.
In the US alone, the natural-gas output enabled by the pipelines would result in an additional 559 million tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide each year by 2040, above 2017 levels, according to Global Energy Monitor, citing International Energy Agency figures.
This surge in emissions is set to take place at a time when scientists have warned of punishing heatwaves, floods and economic damage if greenhouse gases are not drastically cut. A landmark UN report released last year warned that global emissions must be halved by 2030 and essentially nullified by 2050 to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.
“This is a whole energy system not compatible with global climate survival,” said Ted Nance, co-author of the Global Energy Monitor report. “These pipelines are locking in huge emissions for 40 to 50 years at a time, with the scientists saying we have to move in 10 years. These pipelines are a bet that the world won’t get serious about climate change, allowing the incumbency of oil and gas to strengthen.”
New gas pipelines outnumber oil pipelines by around four to one, bolstered by a glut of abundant natural gas that is swiftly replacing coal as the leading electricity source for US homes and businesses.
The most active area for pipelines is the Permian basin in west Texas, a sprawling formation that contains huge deposits of oil and gas. Other active zones include the shale formations in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia, and the Canadian tar sands of Alberta.
Several of these pipeline projects have spurred bitter protests from climate and indigenous activists, such as the Dakota Access project, which resulted in violent clashes at the Standing Rock reservation in North Dakota. The extension to the Keystone pipeline, which would link the Alberta tar sands to refineries on the Gulf of Mexico, has also aroused opposition that Donald Trump has vowed to sweep aside by pushing the project forward.
While domestic energy use increased last year – Americans consumed 4% more energy than in 2017, according to US government figures – the boom in oil and gas pipelines is largely set to cater for the US’ increasing role as an energy exporter. Nance said there are “unrealistic expectations” over exports of liquified natural gas to Asia, in particular, due to an increase in gas production there and concerns over climate change.
International goals to limit global warming to 2 degrees celsius (3.6F) above pre-industrial times will be “difficult or impossible to achieve” with the completion of the new pipelines, according to Heidi Peltier, an energy expert at the University of Massachusetts, who was not involved in the new research.
“From a climate perspective, this is very bad news,” she said. “What we need is increased investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency, not increased investments in fossil fuel infrastructure.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/25/us-oil-gas-boom-climate-change-report

It took me a long time to see that the problem is not the adjective but the noun. While some people have rejected capitalism gladly and swiftly, I’ve done so slowly and reluctantly. Part of the reason was that I could see no clear alternative: unlike some anti-capitalists, I have never been an enthusiast for state communism. I was also inhibited by its religious status. To say “capitalism is failing” in the 21st century is like saying “God is dead” in the 19th: it is secular blasphemy. It requires a degree of self-confidence I did not possess.
But as I’ve grown older, I’ve come to recognise two things. First, that it is the system, rather than any variant of the system, that drives us inexorably towards disaster. Second, that you do not have to produce a definitive alternative to say that capitalism is failing. The statement stands in its own right. But it also demands another, and different, effort to develop a new system.
Perpetual growth on a finite planet leads inexorably to environmental calamity
Capitalism’s failures arise from two of its defining elements. The first is perpetual growth. Economic growth is the aggregate effect of the quest to accumulate capital and extract profit. Capitalism collapses without growth, yet perpetual growth on a finite planet leads inexorably to environmental calamity.
Those who defend capitalism argue that, as consumption switches from goods to services, economic growth can be decoupled from the use of material resources. Last week a paper in the journal New Political Economy, by Jason Hickel and Giorgos Kallis, examined this premise. They found that while some relative decoupling took place in the 20th century (material resource consumption grew, but not as quickly as economic growth), in the 21st century there has been a recoupling: rising resource consumption has so far matched or exceeded the rate of economic growth. The absolute decoupling needed to avert environmental catastrophe (a reduction in material resource use) has never been achieved, and appears impossible while economic growth continues. Green growth is an illusion.
A system based on perpetual growth cannot function without peripheries and externalities. There must always be an extraction zone – from which materials are taken without full payment – and a disposal zone, where costs are dumped in the form of waste and pollution. As the scale of economic activity increases until capitalism affects everything, from the atmosphere to the deep ocean floor, the entire planet becomes a sacrifice zone: we all inhabit the periphery of the profit-making machine.
This drives us towards cataclysm on such a scale that most people have no means of imagining it. The threatened collapse of our life-support systems is bigger by far than war, famine, pestilence or economic crisis, though it is likely to incorporate all four. Societies can recover from these apocalyptic events, but not from the loss of soil, an abundant biosphere and a habitable climate.
The second defining element is the bizarre assumption that a person is entitled to as great a share of the world’s natural wealth as their money can buy. This seizure of common goods causes three further dislocations. First, the scramble for exclusive control of non-reproducible assets, which implies either violence or legislative truncations of other people’s rights. Second, the immiseration of other people by an economy based on looting across both space and time. Third, the translation of economic power into political power, as control over essential resources leads to control over the social relations that surround them.
In the New York Times on Sunday, the Nobel economist Joseph Stiglitz sought to distinguish between good capitalism, which he called “wealth creation”, and bad capitalism, which he called “wealth grabbing” (extracting rent). I understand his distinction. But from the environmental point of view, wealth creation is wealth grabbing. Economic growth, intrinsically linked to the increasing use of material resources, means seizing natural wealth from both living systems and future generations.
To point to such problems is to invite a barrage of accusations, many of which are based on this premise: capitalism has rescued hundreds of millions of people from poverty – now you want to impoverish them again. It is true that capitalism, and the economic growth it drives, has radically improved the prosperity of vast numbers of people, while simultaneously destroying the prosperity of many others: those whose land, labour and resources were seized to fuel growth elsewhere. Much of the wealth of the rich nations was – and is – built on slavery and colonial expropriation.
Like coal, capitalism has brought many benefits. But, like coal, it now causes more harm than good. Just as we have found means of generating useful energy that are better and less damaging than coal, so we need to find means of generating human wellbeing that are better and less damaging than capitalism.
There is no going back: the alternative to capitalism is neither feudalism nor state communism. Soviet communism had more in common with capitalism than the advocates of either system would care to admit. Both systems are (or were) obsessed with generating economic growth. Both are willing to inflict astonishing levels of harm in pursuit of this and other ends. Both promised a future in which we would need to work for only a few hours a week, but instead demand endless, brutal labour. Both are dehumanising. Both are absolutist, insisting that theirs and theirs alone is the one true God.
So what does a better system look like? I don’t have a complete answer, and I don’t believe any one person does. But I think I see a rough framework emerging. Part of it is provided by the ecological civilisation proposed by Jeremy Lent, one of the greatest thinkers of our age. Other elements come from Kate Raworth’s doughnut economics and the environmental thinking of Naomi Klein, Amitav Ghosh, Angaangaq Angakkorsuaq, Raj Patel and Bill McKibben. Part of the answer lies in the notion of “private sufficiency, public luxury”. Another part arises from the creation of a new conception of justice based on this simple principle: every generation, everywhere, shall have an equal right to the enjoyment of natural wealth.
I believe our task is to identify the best proposals from many different thinkers and shape them into a coherent alternative. Because no economic system is only an economic system but intrudes into every aspect of our lives, we need many minds from various disciplines – economic, environmental, political, cultural, social and logistical – working collaboratively to create a better way of organising ourselves that meets our needs without destroying our home.
Our choice comes down to this. Do we stop life to allow capitalism to continue, or stop capitalism to allow life to continue?

Extinction Rebellion plan to cause rush-hour disruption in London’s financial district before they bring an end their climate “rebellion” that has led to protesters occupying sites across London for more than a week.
On Thursday morning, 13 protesters attached themselves the front and back entrances of London Stock Exchange and were said to be preventing people from entering. They wore LED signs reading: “Climate emergency”, “Tell the truth” and “You can’t eat money”. Police are in attendance, but no arrests have been made, according to the group.
At Canary Wharf, at least four protesters have climbed on top of a train on the Docklands Light Railway holding signs saying “don’t jail the canaries” and “business as usual = death”, in what the group said was a reference to “the financial sector’s role in our collective suicide”. A number of police officers are at the scene.
It follows a similar action this month after which three people were remanded in custody until their trial in May.
The climate “rebellion” to highlight the escalating global ecological crisis will draw to a voluntary close with a “closing ceremony” and a day of disruption in which demonstrators plan to swarm into the Square Mile to cause roadblocks, targeting big business and banking.

On Wednesday, protesters in London agreed to remove blockades and campsites at Marble Arch and Parliament Square.
The Extinction Rebellion group, which has been backed by senior academics, politicians and scientists during nine days of peaceful mass civil disobedience, said its action in the City of London was likely to last a few hours, and comes on the day it is due to end blockades at Parliament Square and Marble Arch.
A spokeswoman said the area is being targeted because “the financial industry is responsible for funding climate and ecological destruction and we are calling on them, the companies and the institutions that allow this to happen, to tell the truth”.
Extinction Rebellion said in a statement that it would leave its remaining blockades on Thursday, but added: “The world has changed … A space for truth-telling has been opened up.
“Now it is time to bring this telling of the truth to communities around London, the regions and nations of the UK, and internationally. In this age of misinformation, there is power in telling the truth.”
The group said it would like to “thank Londoners for opening their hearts and demonstrating their willingness to act on that truth”.
The statement added: “We know we have disrupted your lives. We do not do this lightly. We only do this because this is an emergency.”
The activists said protesters had “taken to the streets and raised the alarm” in more than 80 cities in 33 countries. “People are talking about the climate and ecological emergency in ways that we never imagined,” they said.
The group said it would work to build up a resilient movement to force politicians to address the climate crisis, and further direct action protests may take place as soon as the coming days.
The move came as it emerged that the environment secretary, Michael Gove, had agreed to the meet representatives of the group. A spokesperson for XR said this was “totally unconnected” to its decision to end the current phase of the protest, adding that the meeting was under consideration.
“It may or may not go ahead, depending on the details of how public it is and who will be attending,” they said.
Support for Extinction Rebellion has quadrupled in the past nine days as public concern about the scale of the ecological crisis grows.
Since the protests began last Monday, 30,000 new backers or volunteers have offered support to the group. In the same period, it has raised almost £200,000 – mostly in small donations of between £10 and £50 – making a total of £365,000 since January.
The group said the figures showed the public was waking up to the scale of the crisis, adding that pressure was growing on politicians to act.
The group said numbers of people on the streets for the protests had dwindled from a high over the Easter bank holiday weekend, but the number of people who had signed up to offer ongoing support and backing for future demonstrations had risen from 10,000 before the protest to 40,000 by Wednesday morning.
The decision to call a halt to the protests came a day after Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish student who inspired a global youth-based movement when she began a “climate strike” outside Sweden’s parliament last year, visited Westminster.
In a speech to MPs, she said: “You lied to us. You gave us false hope. You told us that the future was something to look forward to. You don’t listen to the science because you are only interested in solutions that will enable you to carry on like before.”
XR’s youth group wrote to MPs on Wednesday as parliament restarted after the Easter break, pleading with them to act swiftly to address the crisis.
The letter, which was handed to Labour’s Diane Abbott outside parliament, states: “We are writing to ask you to hear the science, to feel the public’s change of heart and to act now to save our futures … Now the time has arrived to stand up and be counted – you are our elected representatives and we need your help.”
In response, the shadow home secretary backed XR demonstrators, telling a crowd of up to 100 protesters – one of whom towered above the group on two-metre stilts while others wielded banners – that she acknowledged a “climate emergency”, one of the activists’ key demands.
Abbott said MPs needed to come together to host a “broad conversation” on one of the group’s requests to bring the country’s greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025.
Abbott also suggested meeting XR for a detailed discussion of policy aims, a proposal met with rapturous applause.
More than 1,000 XR activists have been arrested in the past nine days. Protesters occupied four sites across London and staged acts of civil disobedience including blocking roads, disrupting a railway line and demonstrating at Heathrow airport.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/24/extinction-rebellion-declares-end-to-london-protests

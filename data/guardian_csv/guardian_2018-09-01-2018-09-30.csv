In the wake of the Coalition government removing the emissions reduction component from its signature national energy guarantee before Scott Morrison replaced Malcolm Turnbull, the issue is shaping up as a major test before the Wentworth byelection.
Turnbull’s son Alex has spruiked for donations on behalf of Labor’s candidate Tim Murray, citing energy policy as a key consideration when the progressive Liberal inner-city electorate goes to the polls.
On Sunday Birmingham said that Morrison “has made very clear we will continue to honour our commitments” including the Paris climate agreement, as Australia had done for the first and second round of Kyoto targets.
“We continually see, in terms of that abatement target required to meet the 2030 targets, that gap is closing with each update and we’ll continue to work on the policy settings to make sure that is achieved,” he told Sky News.
Asked if this would include emissions reduction in the electricity, agriculture or transport industry, Birmingham said the government would “encourage adoption of new technologies and new practices, all of which have played a big role meeting targets to date”.
“We will continue to watch closely in terms of the projections around the abatement task and work hard to make sure Australia meets and fulfils our obligations.”
On Saturday Scott Morrison said that Australia’s commitments to its Paris targets “haven’t changed”.
“Australia stands on its record. I mean, we hit our first target, exceeded it by 128m tonnes,” he told reporters in Indonesia. “We’re on track to meet our second Kyoto target and exceed it by 294m tonnes.”
Alex Turnbull has intervened in the Wentworth campaign over the issue of energy policy, calling for donations Labor’s candidate for Wentworth on Twitter. He cited the need for a federal integrity commission, donations reform and a “sane energy policy”.
Best bang for the buck you'll get in political donations in your life. Tight race, tight margin for government, big incremental effect whatever happens. If you want a federal election now this is the means by which to achieve it. https://t.co/YgTQGhQwBa
At a press conference in Sydney, Morrison played down Turnbull’s intervention, suggesting that “I’m sure Alex’s only message today is happy father’s day to Malcolm”.
Asked if it was odd that Turnbull’s son was seeking donations for the Labor candidate, Morrison said it “strikes [him] as a democracy”.
Far from staying silent on Sunday, Turnbull doubled down on his earlier comments, arguing that “the market disagrees” with the proposition that the Liberal Party’s energy policy will reduce wholesale prices. “Paris agreement had zero impact on prices [by the way],” he said.
Turnbull argued that energy market participants had an incentive to correctly predict the trajectory of prices. “It is crystal clear what those with the right incentives think about what scrapping the Neg means – prices will rise.”
On Sunday the former member for Wentworth – Liberal Peter King – signalled his intention to seek preselection. 
Appearing on Sky New’s Outsiders, King suggested the ideal candidate for Wentworth would be someone with experience, “not associated with big business”, with resources and “campaign muscle” who has shown “through his public record he has the long-term interests of the community at heart”.
King did not articulate a vision for emissions reduction, instead focusing on the need to lower power prices.
“We’re exporting our coal and our gas to India and China, they’re then using it to produce cheap power and selling back products to us at a higher rate – so we lose out twice,” he said.
King argued that renewable energy is given $2.8bn a year in subsidies – a figure generated by the Minerals Council most of which is accounted for by solar feed-in tariffs provided by state governments.
King suggested that blockchain technology could be used so that “if you want to pay more for green power, fine, but if you’re doing it tough or want to pay less you ought to have that opportunity too”.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/sep/02/australia-will-honour-paris-climate-agreement-simon-birmingham-says

To put it another way, if climate was impossible to predict as an average probability, you would be as likely to retire to norther Canada as to Florida, as it would be so chaotic that you'd have no way of knowing which would be warmer. Different places have different climates- these change over time, and they have very varying weather, but the overall climate can be more or less predicted within a certain range. So it is not ""chaotic"" in the sense that you're implying.
Oboy. This is so....ridiculous is the only word I can think of and even that doesn't quite do it....that it is hard to know how to respond. Yes, we can predict winter will be colder than summer.

simply posting up EIA or whoever is not a source- I did try and google your words and got nothing in return- it may be made up it may be true. As for GDP it is everything- it allows for the value of those subsidies to be assessed- a very rich country can spend a lot on a subsidy and for it to be insignificant.

Like it or not and you can grit your teeth and hate it if you like the world is spending a lot on renewables- China alone installed 200 GW of wind and 150 GW of solar in the last few years outstripping the US and EU, and despite really wanting nuclear it is struggling to build 50 GW - it had plans for a lot by 2030 but has rolled back ambition.
China also wants to be a global car maker but it is not very good at ICE or engines- for which the US and EU excel- and it has pumped in 4billions to make EVs happen- it is also the major producers of solar and wind and clearly has plans to be the next super energy giant. It is the largest economy in the world and it has a plan- and that plan is the lucrative world of storage.

At the national level, more often we see actions that aggravate existing problems or create new ones. California – the country’s most populous and economically powerful state – has been a welcome exception.
California has been battered by extreme weather intensified by climate change. From 2012 to 2016 the state was scorched by its worst drought in over a millennium. Weather whiplash struck in 2017, when much of the state broke precipitation records. This combination led to devastating mudslides and created the conditions for the most destructive and costly wildfire season on record in 2017, followed by the state’s largest-ever wildfire in 2018, which broke the previous record (set in 2017) by more than 60%.
All of these impacts have been exacerbated by global warming. The past five years have been California’s five hottest on record. And so, the state’s leaders decided to do something about it. California had already set a renewable portfolio standard in 2002, strengthened by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger’s 2008 executive order requiring that 33% of electricity be generated by renewable sources by 2020. Governor Jerry Brown signed Senate Bill (SB) 350 in 2015, expanding the requirement to 50% renewables by 2030. 
Last week, California state lawmakers passed State Senator (and candidate for US Senate) Kevin de León’s SB 100, which amps up the target to 50% renewables by 2026, 60% by 2030, and 100% from “renewable energy resources and zero-carbon resources” by 2045.
The more aggressive clean energy targets are justified. Not only does California need to make up some of the climate slack created by the Trump administration, but the state is now ahead of its targets, with 29% of electricity last year generated from renewables and over 50% from zero-carbon sources (including nuclear and hydroelectric power).
According to the latest California Climate Change Assessment Report, global warming impacts will continue to batter the state:
Kevin de León specifically cited the record-breaking wildfires as a key factor in generating the votes to pass SB 100, which had been under debate for nearly two years. 
""Our state is one big tinderbox,"" says @kdeleon in closing on #SB100. ""Wildfires are not longer seasonal."" @HunterCutting, in case you're still wondering whether #cawildfires affect #SB100 debate.
Similarly, with its air badly polluted by smoke from wildfires, the Spokane, Washington City Council approved an ordinance setting a goal to get 100% renewable electricity by 2030. And after being struck by Hurricane Harvey in 2017, an increasing number of Houston-area residents accept human-caused global warming (64%) and are concerned about its impacts (52%).
It’s hard to deny the reality and adverse impacts of human-caused climate change when they’re hitting people at home.
California has long been a leader in climate solutions. The state is home to nearly half of all electric vehicles in the country (over 350,000), with by far the highest per-capita EV ownership of any state. California uses the least electricity per capita of any state, has a carbon cap and trade system, and a thriving economy.
California is also leading the way in fighting the Trump administration’s backwards climate policy rollback. Next week, the state will even host a Global Climate Action Summit. 
Unfortunately, a new study found that while local climate action like California’s is important, it’s insufficient to make up for the Trump administration’s inaction. To achieve the needed cuts in carbon pollution, federal policy is needed. That means replacing the current Republican leadership and its platform of climate denial with a Democratic leadership like California’s.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/sep/03/californias-response-to-record-wildfires-shift-to-100-clean-energy

After a huge El Nino weather system surprised scientists in 1982-83, the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean Project, or TAO, was set up by the US, Japan and Australia to monitor atmospheric conditions and those of the sea down to 500 metres below the buoys. 
El Niño’s, and their opposite pattern, La Niña’s, typically shift rain east or west over the Pacific, often bringing drought or heavy rains to many parts of the world, including Australia. Early warning of an El Nino could save farmers millions of dollars by helping them modify their choice of crop and the timing of planting. The cost of the US portion of the array - 55 buoys in a total of just under 70 - is about $10 million a year.
Data decrease from the buoys in recent years due to vandalism by fishing fleets, bad weather, and maintenance cuts now exceeds 40%.

“We” – those of the abbott/Newman obsessive-compulsive fossil-fuel psychosis - are very willing to disregard the damage our asylum-seeker brutalities and climate-change denial are doing to the societies of Nauru and Manus Island. “We” are very willing to ignore the growing social and economic collapse of our neighbours. Exactly the reverse is the sort of model the world needs. Exactly the reverse is most certainly the sort of model this region needs. 
All our littoral neighbours are suffering problems of the same general type as those driving the refugees - increasing social and economic tensions, degradation of the carrying capacity of their environment, violence and corruption, and poverty.
“We” all in fact need to do far more than just provide band-aid relief, and fund corrupt local politicians. 
Our region needs a comprehensive economic and social structure and relationship that combines an enforcement of political and economic discipline (as distinct from the prevailing culture of brazen theft and bribery) plus littoral trade relations that greatly increase employment and income (rather than the brutalities of globalisation), in a way that forces better government. Effectively an international division of labour based on the island nations supplying labour-intensive goods to Australia via a government business enterprise, inevitably requiring increased tariff barriers, quotas, and/or other trade barriers to other countries. 
Doing so requires that “we” develop and maintain such a strategy in the face of opposition from ignorant and corrupt powerbrokers in the littoral states, as well as the many domestic groups philosophically opposed to government interventionism, plus the ferocious opposition of transnational capitalism.

Xavier Matsutaro, the national climate change coordinator for Palau, a small nation in the north-west Pacific, said Australia’s relationship with the Pacific was “dysfunctional”, adding that Australia was also responsible for diluting the strength of previous regional declarations on climate change.
“Australia is a bit of an anomaly, because on the floor [of climate summits] they’re basically sometimes as far right as Trump in some of their views on climate change, at one point they even denied that it existed … But then on a regional basis they’ve actually given a lot of support to our region,” said Matsutaro.
“Sometimes the way I think about it ... it’s like you’re in a relationship and you get abused by your spouse but at the same time they feed you and clothe you and things like that,” he said. “You could say it’s a bit of a dysfunctional relationship.”
Matsutaro spoke to the Guardian in Palau a week before leaders, including Palau’s minister of state Faustina Rehuher-Marugg, met in Nauru at the Pacific Islands Forum, where climate change was a key issue discussed by the group.
 Leaders are set to sign a new security agreement that labels climate change as the “greatest threat” to the Pacific region. Citizens of the region have been among the first to feel the effects of climate change, with rising sea levels and increased natural disasters in the region.
The summit comes at an awkward time for Australia, as the new prime minister, Scott Morrison, faces pressure from some members of his party to abandon Australia’s commitment to reducing emissions under the Paris agreement.
Matsutaro said Australia, which has historically been the key aid partner for the Pacific region, had supported projects in Palau related to climate change, including a coastal erosion project and research on coral bleaching. Australia even provided research on the impact of climate change on Palau which formed the basis for a section of Palau’s climate change policy.
But when it came time to make commitments on climate change, Matsutaro, who has attended COP meetings on Palau’s behalf for the last five years, said Australia was regularly out of sync with the rest of the region, and was responsible for diluting the strength of resolutions on the environment.
“They’re responsible for making our declarations weaker sometimes in the region. So there’s been forums that were formulated so [Australia] won’t be involved in it, they’re not members, so that whatever language that really reflects our views and our circumstances is actually reflected in the declaration,” he said.
Pacific leaders have called for Australia to do more to reduce emissions and act to curb the effects of climate change.
Last week in a blistering speech in Sydney, the Samoan prime minister called climate change an “existential threat ... for all our Pacific family” and said that any world leader who denied climate change’s existence should be taken to a mental hospital.
The prime minister of Fiji, Frank Bainimarama, who has opted to travel to Bangkok for an extra session of the COP23 climate change negotiations instead of attending the Pacific Islands Forum, excoriated global leaders for their inaction on climate change, saying leaders had promised much but delivered little.
“If all the noble intentions of all the good people who have built this process since 1992 could be converted to clean energy, we could resolve the crisis now. But intentions are not actions.”
He said history would condemn leaders who failed to properly address the impacts of climate change.
“Would any of us like to return to our people and tell them that we had the chance to do something truly great and truly necessary for the world we will pass to our children, but we lacked the will to get it done?”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/05/australia-relationship-with-pacific-on-climate-change-dysfunctional-and-abusive

Shush! Forget about all the times that the rest of the UK imposed a Tory government on Scotland and double forget that the current Tory government only got close enough to get propped up by the DUP in 2017 when Scotland imposed a Tory government on the rest of the UK), coalitions could be the way of things for the future anyway, even under first-past-the-post so that's no reason to turn away from a proportional system. 
Hopefully the smaller parties won't drop the ball and get 'three card monte-ed' out of demanding that the electoral system get changed from first-past-the-post to something proportional/ranked choice so we're finally all on a level playing field.
Do remind Labour that their leadership elections are enacted on the basis of an alternative vote/instant run off system. Do also remind Labour that it was they who enacted the Jenkins Commission to look at electoral system alternatives. Leverage them. Get the system changed so that I can vote Green as my first choice and get more people to the polls in general, knowing that their hands have been untied. 
I'm still hoping that Labour shifts its ground on Europe/the EU/a People's Vote after the September conference but, if not, how about running the next election as a coalition (like they do in many South American countries) rather than throwing a coalition together in the hours after an election and screwing the voters (how many of those who gave their votes to the Liberal Democrats in 2010 were happy to see them prop up the Tories?

The past is the key to the future.
For example, CO2 levels are now similar to the Pliocene over 3 million years ago.
Modern humans didn't exist - there was no complex global society relying on stability for agriculture.
Global average temperatures then eventually reached 3 or 4 degrees C (5.4-7.2 degrees F) higher than today’s and as much as 10 degrees C (18 degrees F) warmer at the poles.
Sea level ranged between five and 40 metres (16 to 131 feet) higher than today.
Earth systems take time to respond to forcings.
For example, sea level can't suddenly rise on that scale, because it takes time for enough heat to be accumulated to melt enough ice.
The first step is to stop looking for any more fossil fuels.
If we burn all the fossil fuels we've already located, we'd create enough CO2 to ensure that eventually Antarctica would be ice-free.
There's a scientific paper on that - ""Combustion of available fossil fuel resources sufficient to eliminate the Antarctic Ice Sheet"" - Winkelmann et al 2015.

I suggest you read about some previous warming events, like the end-Permian, the PETM, the Toarcian, and the ETM2. They are seen in the geochemical record as negative carbon isotope excursions.
These NCIEs mark sudden releases of sequestered carbon, are always associated with global warming, and with extinction events of varying severity.
At least one mass extinction is associated with lots of CO2 being formed by burning fossil fuel, and there is a NCIE in the geochemical record confirming it.
It was volcanic action that burned coal then, in Siberia.
There are a number of papers on that such as:
""Initial pulse of Siberian Traps sills as the trigger of the end-Permian mass extinction"" - Burgess et al, 2017
There's also
""Catastrophic dispersion of coal fly ash into oceans during the latest Permian extinction"" - Grasby et al, 2011.

Leave vote was not entirely down to UKIP but UKIP moved the “Overton Window” so that Far Right ideas became sufficiently mainstream to dominate May’s government. This small political party (and its foreign funders and puppetmasters) created the biggest existential threat to UK since WW2. And we have not seen the end of it yet. Greens are a party of the Left, not likely to be used as a vehicle by Putin, but nevertheless their campaigns can shift the Overton Window Left again. Which might help a Labour victory. Who knows?

Renewables aren't actually renewables because they omit key aspects of the production process. Non-fossil energy would cost trillions to phase in, with respect to intermittency.
The Government decided to destroy our nuclear industry and out education system is paltry. We now have to beg the Chinese and French to build them for us. That is the only, reliable commercially viable way to achieve aims at this moment in time. It is its own baseload.

For us, as the newly elected co-leaders of the Green party, we’re about to enter the most exciting period of our political lifetimes.
We’re ready to mobilise a fiercer Green resistance than ever before. In council chambers across the country, brave, independent Greens are already leading a political revolt against the status quo. We want to put the Green party on course to become the third party in Britain, building on this year’s local election success, and get a Green on every council in England and Wales.
But politics isn’t confined to council chambers or the halls of Westminster, and we are not afraid to join protesters taking direct action for what is right. We have just lived through the joint hottest summer on record. Despite environment secretary Michael Gove’s claim to have painted the government green, all he has offered are empty promises, while his government wreaks as much destruction as any Tory government, with fracking, airport expansion and new roads gouging out chunks from our countryside. Yet the scale of the climate crisis calls for a system overhaul. That is why we will always stand with those risking arrest to protest against the environmental destruction of fracking or airport expansion.
Meanwhile, the Windrush scandal has exposed just how deep runs the cruelty and incompetence of the Home Office. We believe there needs to be root-and-branch reform of an immigration system that is rotten to its very core. We are proud to support activists and campaigners who are putting their bodies on the line in the fight against the inhumanity of indefinite detention and the forced removals of refugees and migrants. Not only are we proud to say migrants and refugees are welcome here, but we will always celebrate the gift of freedom of movement.
Then there’s Brexit. After being laughed at, derided and called delusional, it looks increasingly likely that our calls for a People’s Vote could come to fruition. You’d be forgiven for not immediately thinking of the Greens when it comes to Brexit, because the media has maintained a wall of silence when it comes to our longstanding call for a democratic conclusion to this debate. But we’re not just another party opposing the government’s Brexit fantasies – we’re the only party who can be trusted to oppose Brexit and also offer genuinely bold and radical policies to fix the ailments in this country that led to Brexit.
With a government in chaos and a Labour party that’s split down the middle, we could well be on the cusp of another political revolution. But while we will always campaign with others to oppose Brexit, we think it’s time to say loudly and clearly that the Green party will never be part of any vapid centrist blob. Nor will we join the multimillionaires trying to start new parties in an attempt to return Britain to the centrism that so utterly failed people earlier this century. We stand firmly and unequivocally against the forces of racism that whipped up a culture war with so little opposition from the political mainstream in the run-up to the referendum.
We want to overhaul the world of work so it is fit to face the challenges of our times, from the role of automation to the rise of insecure working in the gig economy. With the autumn budget fast approaching, we think it’s time to take stock and ask again whether the economy is the master or the servant of the British people. Specifically, we think it’s time for politics to shift away from an obsession with economic growth and a culture of work that sees people slaving away at jobs that offer little material or emotional reward.
That’s why our party was the first in Britain to propose a four-day working week, and why we are continuing to think of ideas that will give people more free time to live the lives they choose. While governments must of course focus on the scourge of low pay, precarious work and joblessness that too many people face, they must not do so at the cost of refocusing the economy away from a culture that sees people working themselves to the brink.
This country is not broken, but our governments have been for many years. We won’t heal our wounds by facing backwards and grasping for an economic and political settlement that has failed for so long. Instead, we must be fresh in our thinking and bold in our actions if we’re to get the country facing a future that people feel hope about, and where they know that every citizen and their wellbeing will be valued.
The Green party will be bold, or we will be nothing, and we will always be up for picking a side in the debates that define this country. Our leadership won’t be shackled by the chains of old-school politics, and we’re starting our leadership as we mean to go on, by putting the big questions at the heart of what we do.

Canavan told Sydney broadcaster Alan Jones on Friday he had never been to Paris, and was “happy to leave the Champs-Élysées for others”, but people needed to be clear the treaty Tony Abbott committed Australia to in 2015 “doesn’t actually bind us to anything in particular”.
Abbott said in 2015, when he announced Australia would be signing up, that the government was making a “definite commitment” to a 26% reduction in emissions by 2030 and “with the circumstances that we think will apply ... we can go up to 28%”.
But Canavan said on Friday the Paris commitment was a three-page document that allowed Australia flexibility to build new coal plants. The resources minister said rather than focusing on the situation in 2030, “what I want to focus on is solving the crisis we have in energy today”.
“We have to build power stations. There’s nothing in the [Paris] agreement that would stop us building power stations, including coal-fired power stations,” Canavan said.
“We need new ones”.
Canavan said Queensland was “propping up” New South Wales with the newest coal fleet in the country.
Jones prefaced his interview with Canavan with a long condemnation of the new foreign minister, Marise Payne, and the decision to sign on to a communique at the Pacific Islands Forum this week nominating climate change as the single greatest security threat to the Pacific.
The communique said all countries must meet their commitments under the Paris climate agreement.
Jones declared the prime minister, Scott Morrison, needed to “recall Marise Payne and replace her”. He said the Morrison government would have no hope of winning the next federal election if it wanted to “persist with the global warming rubbish and the Paris agreement”.
The 2GB host said Paris needed to be “ripped up”.
“Do you want to win an election or don’t you?” Jones said to Canavan on Friday morning.
Canavan dead-batted. “Of course I want to win the election, Alan. But, more importantly, what I want to do is have good policies for Australia and make our country strong”.
The Queensland Nationals have been campaigning for months for government backing for new coal plants.
In his first major speech in the energy portfolio, the new minister, Angus Taylor, signalled he wanted to encourage new investment extending the life of existing coal and gas plants, and upgrading ageing facilities.
Taylor said the government was intent on boosting supply, and that meant expanding existing plants, upgrading ageing “legacy” generators, as well as pursuing new “greenfield” projects.
Taylor is currently working up options for cabinet.
A recent forecast by the Australian Energy Market Operator predicted 30% of Australia’s coal generators will approach the end of their technical life over the next two decades, and it said it was important to avoid premature departures if the looming transition in the national energy market is to be orderly.
But it was also clear that the most economical replacement for the ageing coal fleet was not new coal, but “a portfolio of utility-scale renewable generation, storage, distributed energy resources, flexible thermal capacity, and transmission”.
Aemo concluded that mix of generation could produce 90 terawatt hours of energy per annum, “more than offsetting the energy lost from retiring coal-fired generation”.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/sep/07/paris-climate-deal-doesnt-stop-us-building-new-coal-plants-canavan-says

It is no coincidence that the most prominent Brexiters are also climate change deniers because they perceive climate change legislation as a major threat to industrial profit. This is the reason that the Department of Energy and Climate Change was dissolved, the reason that climate change has been omitted from the remit of the government’s new green watchdog, and the reason that Brexiters fulminate against the Climate Change Act.
The ruinous aspect of their delusion is that climate change offers huge opportunities to UK businesses that invest in energy efficiency, clean energy or ultra-low emission transport, as these new technologies can then be exported, something that Brexiters are apparently keen to promote. Instead, the government has scrapped zero-carbon buildings, abandoned the tidal barrage in Swansea Bay and frozen the fuel escalator, thus encouraging the rapid growth of diesel vehicles.
The chancellor boasted that this had saved motorists £47bn over the past seven years. Unfortunately, air pollution has cost the NHS £140bn over the same period and 280,000 premature deaths. How tragic that Brexit generates politicians of such limited vision who can only look backwards.Dr Robin Russell-JonesChair, Help Rescue the PlanetMarlow, Bucks
In Robin McKie’s article about social drinking (“Why social drinking is an ancient ritual”, Focus), you may be interested to know that the photograph of “drinkers in a hotel bar in 1939” featured my mother, Camille Cowtan (nee Silvera), at the age of 22 years. She is now 101 years old and in good health, residing in a nursing home in Stockport, Greater Manchester. Perhaps this backs up the theory that social drinking can be beneficial.Susan EhrenzweigLondon N12 
James Hawes on the far right in Germany reminds me of a guided tour in 1982 in Czechoslovakia (“Germany’s far right never went away, but festered in its eastern stronghold”, Comment). The minibus group was a mix of British and West German tourists.
The Czech guide, when we arrived at Lidice, mentioned that her mother had died in Auschwitz. I asked how she felt about dealing with the West Germans. She responded that the West Germans were fine as they had faced up to their past. She feared the East Germans because they had never been “de-Nazified”. Thirty-six years later, reunification hasn’t changed that mindset.Jennifer HenleyLondon W5
Kenan Malik is right to note that some aid is guided less by poverty than by geopolitical and strategic interests (“As a system, foreign aid is a fraud and does nothing for inequality”, Comment). However, the piece doesn’t mention the importance of “quality” in aid.
When aid is good quality it makes a real change in the lives of poor and marginalised people. When aid is bad quality, it fails to tackle poverty and work for those it was meant to help. For aid to live up to what’s expected of it – for it to be “real” aid – it must bespent in the areas and on the people most in need. It must prioritise those it is intended for, be properly monitored and offer value for money. And it must be transparent, so spending can be tracked.
Almost all UK aid meets this definition. In recent years, UK aid has helped to vaccinate 37.5 million children, and a further 11.4 million children receive a decent education. The public are attuned to this and support aid that is good quality. When a tabloid howls at “wasted aid”, the programme in question is rarely “real” aid addressing poverty. Far from “entrenching inequality”, real UK aid makes a difference to the lives of millions.Romilly GreenhillUK director, the ONE CampaignLondon WC2
I would like to clarify some points about the Press, a newspaper in West Yorkshire that featured in an article last week (“The far-right activist and the editor: how paper is ‘sowing division’ where an MP died”, News). The story appeared to confuse editorial comment with news reporting in respect of opinion columns. Editorial comment is free to be more partisan within certain legal restrictions.
I was responsible for newsgathering at the Press from March 2011 to August 2016. The news reporting was factual, impartial and written in a neutral tone. It also had an investigative side, centred on public affairs journalism.
Great effort was made to report facts accurately. There was no twisting or spinning to suit an agenda – and any alleged mistakes were certainly not intentional. The responsibilities were taken seriously. Any problems with the factual nature of the reporting were corrected immediately online and then in the next print edition.
Issues were also looked at from as many sides as possible. These ranged from trade union officials to environmental campaigners, councillors of all political parties, headteachers and hospital managers among many sources. And, yes, that did mean contacting extremist groups on occasions and recording their views accurately. Also, the newspaper covers not just Batley, where it is based, but other places including Dewsbury, its former home.David MillerBirstall, BatleyWest Yorkshire
School authorities, parents and students should be advised that there is an alternative perspective to that peddled by the barbarous defence/war industry (“Who spends millions to push its brand in our schools? The world’s arms industry”, News investigation).
The arms trade is an inefficient use of vast resources, manufacturing harmful products. The manufacturer’s balance sheet and the country’s GDP state that it is profitable. Measured in money, the value of adverse production is calculated to be equal to prosperous production: a problem of economics deeming all production to be wealth creation and of positive value, even when contrary to the (international) common good.
Arguably, because of the absence of any benefit for the target/human life/civilisation/environment, the manufacturing process is destroying existing wealth and, in so doing, devaluing the money used as the measure. The arms trade is negative value production that adversely affects international currencies as well as life, living standards and the natural world.Geoff NaylorColden CommonWinchester, Hants",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/09/observer-letters-climate-change-brexit-threat

When I taught finance courses, one of the hardest concepts to get across to students is that stock prices are not subject to supply and demand (we always speak in terms of the long-run). This is because the supply of any security approaches the infinite in theory due to derivative security markets--and this is by design in order to help guarantee free markets as it prevents corporations from being able to manipulate their stock prices by merely buying or selling large quantities.
So, at best, the sell off of divestiture dumps stock on the market causing a short-term price decline. This presents a good buy opportunity for professional investors and corporate managers (to buy back their shares at a discount). The price will correct in the long term to reflect long term projected cash flows which have nothing to do with secondary stock markets (who owns their stocks). If you want to devalue those stocks, you have to change the projected cash flows of the industry. Again, this has nothing to do with secondary markets. Activists pursue this divestiture thing because they can't deliver on much else. It works like a trump strategy that looks good to the ill-informed and rallies them up.

I learned from a Canadian dairy farmers' website that giving cows growth hormone (which can increase milk production up to 10%) is not dangerous to humans because very little makes its way into the cow's milk, and what little there is is destroyed during the heat of the pasturization process. No, it seems that the reason Canada doesn't want their farmers to add hormones to their cattle to increase milk production is because the government believes it is inhumane to cows, causing an increase in mastitis (you'll have to look that one up since I doubt you've ever touched a cow in your life, much less milked one), higher frequency of aborted calves, and some increased incidents of anecdotal lameness. Basically what this means is that your comment is uninformed. Here, read the Canadian Assn. article:https://www.dairynutrition.ca/facts-fallacies/product-quality/cows-and-hormones-----
However, this is quite irrelevant to Trump divesting himself of Canada since you are quite welcome to pay $5 a gallon for your Canadian milk if you don't live near the U.S. border.

London was hot and dry while New York had days and days of rain. According to leading scientists, the heatwave in Europe over recent months was made twice as likely by climate change resulting from human activity. There is also growing evidence of the link between climate change and the frequency of major floods, as well as the severity of hurricanes.
We can send a clear message to the fossil fuel industry: change your ways now and join us in tackling climate change
It’s clear that what we think of now as freak weather in our cities is likely to become the new normal, and that climate change poses a huge threat to the futures of our children, and many generations to come.
As mayors, we are not only committed to taking bold action to tackle climate change and to improve the lives of those we represent, but also to showing others the way. That’s why, ahead of the Global Climate Action Summit in California, we are calling on other cities to stand with us to divest their assets from fossil fuel companies. Today we are announcing a new global initiative for cities on divestment and sustainable investment. Working through the C40 Climate Leadership Group, London and New York will co-chair the Cities Divest/Invest forum, a global network for cities that will not only enable us to share tools, knowledge and experiences, but also to advocate for action on divestment and green investment.
London and New York are two of the world’s most dynamic, innovative and forward-thinking cities, and we are determined to push ahead with the goals of the Paris agreement – stealing a march on many national governments.
We know that tackling climate change requires action across the board – from how we run our transport networks to using cleaner energy and making our buildings more energy-efficient. But we must also use our economic might to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy.
We believe that ending institutional investment in companies that extract fossil fuels and contribute directly to climate change can help send a very powerful message that renewables and low-carbon options are the future. If we want to fund the scale of transformation the world needs, we must foster sustainable investment and use the power of institutional investors, such as pension funds.
That’s why – in both London and New York – we are taking all possible steps to divest our city pension funds from fossil fuels.
Already, less than 2% of the London Pension Fund Authority’s investments of £5.5bn ($7.1bn) are in extractive fossil fuels – this year, the authority has rid itself of a further £700,000 of fossil fuel investments, including stakes in Shell and BP, and has plans in place to divest its remaining investments.
In New York, divestment is under way, with the goal of total divestment within five years. This will mean removing some $5bn (£3.8bn) in investment from the industry.
Both our cities are also investing in a sustainable future. London recently launched the £500m Mayor’s Energy Efficiency Fund, working with the European Regional Development Fund and private sector investors to help hospitals, museums, offices, libraries, social housing and universities to become greener and more energy efficient.
New York City has increased its solar-energy capacity six-fold since 2013 and is investing $2.7bn in energy-efficiency projects that save New Yorkers money and cut emissions. City government now has more than 1,200 electric vehicles and 500 charging stations.
Of course, we acknowledge that divestment and accelerating green investment is not always straightforward. The major portfolios held by public entities are typically pension funds, which aren’t generally under the control of mayors. But we can make progress if we work together with a range of partners – including pension funds, local authorities, campaign groups and the private sector.
We believe we can demonstrate to the world that divestment is a powerful tool and a prudent use of resources. And that, together, our cities – New York, London and many others around the world – can send a clear message to the fossil fuel industry: change your ways now and join us in tackling climate change.
Climate change knows no borders, and taking this kind of action now could help us make a crucial difference to the people we represent and the future of our planet.

A study into temperatures in Brussels and the Pajottenland region south-west of the Belgian capital has raised doubts over the future of the sour lambic beer produced exclusively in the region.
Lambic is fermented in the open air through exposure to wild yeasts and airborne native bacteria. It relies on night-time temperatures of between -8C and 8C (18F-46F) for cooling and inoculation.
The traditional brewing season runs from October to April, with bezomerd – Brussels dialect for a beer that has had “too much summer” – a possibility if it is produced any later.
After cooling, the lambic is placed in wooden barrels where it is exposed to microbes living on the wood. The perfect temperature for ageing lambic is below 25C, above which the risk of unwelcome bacteria spoiling the beer rises.
A joint project between the climate scientists Mark and Asa Stone, Adam Harbaugh from the beer research site Lambic.info and the Brussels brewery Cantillon found this limited brewing window has shortened from 165 days in the early 1900s to about 140, as temperatures have pushed it later into the autumn and brought the season prematurely to an end in early spring.
It is feared the number of brewing days will shrink further, bringing the risk of a similar disaster to 2015, when beer had to be thrown away due to excessive temperatures.
Dr Mark Stone, a director at the University of New Mexico’s Resilience Institute, said: “The impacts of climate change are often gradual until a tipping point is crossed. Our results show that Cantillon is experiencing shifting brewing conditions, and that adaptation to avoid crossing a threshold will require changes in brewing operations that are outside of their traditional methods.
“The threat of climate change on traditional lambic production at Cantillon is indicative of the broader issue. That is, the impacts are not fully recognised until a threshold has been crossed, and adaptation strategies often exacerbate the problem while delaying the inevitable.”
Cantillon, which produces 400,000 bottles of the sour beer a year, has warned its ability to produce the beer could be under threat in the long term.
Jean Van Roy, Cantillon’s owner, told the Brussels Beer City blog that he believed if he artificially cooled the wort – a liquid extracted during the mashing process – it would change the taste of the beer.
“If tomorrow I would have this problem every season, financially it could be a bit difficult, so we would have to change something,” he said.
“[But] I would hate to do that … Or we move the brewery to go up north to begin to brew in Denmark, in Sweden, I don’t know.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/10/belgium-sour-lambic-beer-climate-change-risk

As examples, Guterres pointed to Kerala, India’s worst monsoon flooding in recent history, almost 3,000 deaths from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico last year, disappearing Arctic sea ice, some wildfires so big that they send ash around the world, oceans becoming more acidic threatening food chains, and high carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere threatening food security for billions of people.
Guterres said scientists have been warning about global warming for decades, but “far too many leaders have refused to listen, far too few have acted with the vision the science demands”.
When some 190 nations signed the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change they agreed to limit the global temperature increase by 2100 to less than 2C and as close as possible to 1.5C.
“These targets were the bare minimum to avoid the worst impacts of climate change,” Guterres said. “But scientists tell us that we are far off track.”
“According to a UN study, the commitments made so far by parties to the Paris agreement represent just one-third of what is needed,” the secretary general said.
Guterres said the mountain that needs to be climbed is very high but not insurmountable.
“We need to rapidly shift away from our dependence on fossil fuels,” he said. “We need to replace them with clean energy from water, wind and sun. We must halt deforestation, restore degraded forests and change the way we farm.”
He appealed for leadership “from politicians and leaders, from business and scientists, and from the public everywhere” to break what he called the current “paralysis” and act now.
“If we do not change course by 2020, we risk missing the point where we can avoid runaway climate change, with disastrous consequences for people and all the natural systems that sustain us,” Guterres warned.
The alternative to moving to green energy, he said, “is a dark and dangerous future”.
Guterres said that when he addresses world leaders at their annual general assembly gathering in two weeks, he will tell them “that climate change is the great challenge of our time” and what is missing is leadership and a sense of urgency to respond.
He said an international meeting in Bangkok that ended on Sunday made some progress on negotiations to help reach an agreement in December in Poland on guidelines for implementing the 2015 Paris accord “but far from enough”.
“Nothing less than our future and the fate of humankind depends on how we rise to the climate challenge,” Guterres said. “Keeping our planet’s warming to well below 2C is essential for global prosperity, people’s wellbeing and the security of nations.”
He said that is why he will convoke a climate summit for world leaders in September 2019 “to bring climate action to the top of the international agenda”.
Guterres said technology is on the side of those seeking to tackle climate change.
He cited the rising use of renewable energy, saying “today, it is competitive with and even cheaper than coal and oil, especially if one factors in the cost of pollution”. And he singled out innovative programs in China, Sweden, Morocco, Scotland and Thailand.
Guterres also pointed to other signs of hope including oil-rich Saudi Arabia investing heavily in renewable energy and oil-rich Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the largest in the world, moving away from investments in coal, as well as in palm and pulp paper companies because of the forests they destroy.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/11/fossil-fuel-dependence-poses-direct-existential-threat-warns-un-chief

But a report published today sets out a roadmap that could quicken that pace and cut carbon emissions to 24% below 2005 levels by 2025 in the absence of federal leadership.
Many US states, cities and businesses have rallied around the Paris commitments since Donald Trump pulled out from the agreement in June 2017. The America’s Pledge on Climate initiative was set up the same year by the former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg and the California governor, Jerry Brown, to map “bottom up” US climate action.
The US is already almost halfway to meeting its 2025 Paris Agreement emissions goal of 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2025. The report claims existing commitments and policies will drive US emissions to 17% below 2005 levels by 2025 – around two-thirds of the original Paris goal.
It also sets out 10 climate action strategies – across most major economic sectors including electricity, transportation and buildings – that, if implemented broadly, could lower emissions to 21% . Broader engagement and collaboration could bring this figure to 24%, the report suggests.
Strategies include setting and implementing more stringent renewable energy procurement policies, accelerating the phase-out of super-polluting refrigerant gases, and mapping and repairing methane leaks from natural gas pipelines.
Researchers at the University of Maryland and the Rocky Mountain Institute, an independent thinktank, surveyed all 50 states, the largest 285 cities (100,000-plus population) and a cross section of businesses to map climate actions nationwide. Those committed to the Paris Agreement represent over half the US population (173 million people), over half the US economy ($11.4tn) and over 35% of nationwide greenhouse gas emissions.
Paul Bodnar, managing director at the Rocky Mountain Institute and a co-author of the report, told the Guardian: “There have been growing coalitions in the US – cities working together, states working together, businesses working together. What’s changed in the last year and what’s new is this cross-cutting perspective. When states pass laws that help cities’ [emissions] strategies, or when states’ renewable portfolio standards are designed to help businesses – that’s really where we’re seeing really interesting, high-impact results.”
The report, launched on the eve of Governor Brown’s Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco this week, showcases examples of states, cities and businesses pioneering climate change initiatives.
Arkansas is the only state in the south-east with energy efficiency resource standards (EERS), which require electric and natural gas utilities to propose and administer energy efficiency programs. Since 2009, strategies ranging from customer outreach to new technology have supported these programs, resulting in megawatt-hour savings enough to power 28,000 homes for a year.
Los Angeles’s mayor, Eric Garcetti, was the driving force behind BlueLA, the city’s first all-electric car share program designed to serve low-income residents. Stations are located in LA’s most disadvantaged neighborhoods and the program is expected to take 1,000 vehicles off the road by 2020. BlueLA also employs community members to lead on education and outreach.
New Jersey’s largest utility, Public Service Electric &amp; Gas used methane leak data collected by EDF and Google Street View vehicles equipped with leak detection sensors, leading to a 83% reduction in leakages.
Brown signed a bill this week pledging that the state will obtain 100% of its power from clean sources by 2045. California is the second US state to do so, following Hawaii’s pledge in 2015.
The report comes in the same week that the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released proposals to ease monitoring of methane gas leaks. These would unpick the raft of rules introduced under the Obama administration in 2016 to monitor methane leaks because of their negative contribution to climate change.
Mary Nichols, chair of the California Air Resources Board and vice-chair of America’s Pledge, acknowledged that the bottom up approach “has no sanctions or penalties” but that it represented “a coalition of entities that have the capacity to make a difference”.

An attribution study by scientists ahead of Florence’s landfall, expected in North Carolina on Thursday, found that the storm will be about 50 miles (80km) larger in diameter than it would be if human activity had not warmed the planet.
The hurricane is expected to bring about 50% more precipitation, delivering as much as 20in (51cm) of rainfall in coastal areas, due to climate change. The forecast was completed by researchers at Stony Brook University and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
“Dangerous climate change is here, it’s not a problem for future generations,” said Michael Wehner, staff scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. “These risks have been permanently increased and we have to accept that fact.”
Previous attribution studies have looked at the impact of climate change on hurricanes after the storms occur, such as Hurricane Harvey, which researchers said had three times more rainfall than it would have done without global warming when it crunched into Texas last year.
But this is the first such attribution made before a storm actually reaches the shoreline. “We are now confident enough to make forecasts rather than hindcasts,” said Wehner.
Scientists were previously reluctant to link individual storms, wildfires or heatwaves to the background trend of climate change. However, the field of attribution science has advanced rapidly, to the point where researchers now feel able to ascertain a level of influence before a disaster even unfolds.
“The idea we can’t attribute individual events to climate change is out of date, it’s just no longer true,” said Wehner. “We’ve reached the point where we can say this confidently.”
Climate change fuels hurricanes by increasing the amount of moisture in the atmosphere and heightening the warmth of the oceans. Several storms that form in the Atlantic have intensified to unusual strength in recent years, as part of a trend that scientists say is consistent with a warming world.
Hurricane Florence peaked as a category four hurricane, threatening winds of 130mph, although it has since weakened slightly. It is still expected to bring a storm surge of up to 13ft (4 metres), plus waves, at the North Carolina coast on Thursday before slowing down and dumping a huge amount of rain, triggering damaging flooding further inland.
More than a million people have been told to flee coastal areas, with states of emergency declared in North and South Carolina, Virginia, Georgia, Maryland and Washington DC. The National Hurricane Center has called Florence a “storm of a lifetime”.
The tempest is expected to have a wide impact, reaching deep into North Carolina. Elvia Walkingstick, a teacher, said even her community in Cherokee, near the Tennessee border, was making preparations for the storm.
“There’s a very real possibility it could be that bad, so we will wait to see what happens,” she said. “We are bracing for climate change because we are on the front lines, we are living it.
“It’s ignorant and suicidal not to think of climate change as a reality . We’d be dumb to think it isn’t true. Ignorance isn’t an excuse any more.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/13/climate-change-means-hurricane-florence-will-dump-50-more-rain

The figures from NDEVR Environmental for the year up to the end of June 2018 show the country’s emissions were again the highest on record when unreliable data from the land use and forestry sectors was excluded.
It is the third consecutive year for record-breaking emissions.
NDEVR replicates the federal government’s national greenhouse gas inventory (NGGI) quarterly reports but releases them months ahead of the official data. Previous NDEVR figures have been within 1% of the official figures when eventually released.
The government has yet to publish any emissions data for 2018. Its last update was for the year to December 2017, which it published in May and showed Australia’s emissions continue to soar.
NDEVR’s report projects Australia will miss its Paris targets by about a billion tonnes of carbon dioxide if emissions continue on their current trajectory.
It projects that emissions, excluding land use, will be 558m tonnes, the highest since records began in 2002.
It finds that transport emissions were the highest on record in the final quarter of the 2018 financial year and continue to rise. NDEVR said this was due to the rapid increase in the use of diesel fuel in both passenger cars and heavy transport.
Emissions from stationary energy and fugitive emissions continue to trend upwards. The rise in stationary emissions is mostly attributable to energy industries excluding electricity generation
NDEVR’s report projects a drop in emissions from the electricity sector for the final quarter of the 2018 financial year because of a reduction in total electricity generation in the national electricity market states and an increase in generation from renewables.
But Matt Drum, the managing director of NDEVR Environmental, said Australia was still not on track to meet its Paris targets.
“Tracking the Paris trend line, they’re still heading north and missing Paris by a long way and our 2050 two-degree target by an even greater margin,” he said.
“The data’s telling us clearly again that we’re not on a trajectory to meet our targets, there’s no effective policy to meet our targets, but we’re still hearing commentary from the government that we’re on track to meet our targets.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/sep/14/australia-on-track-to-miss-paris-climate-targets-as-emissions-hit-record-highs

The Global Climate Action Summit is acting as a rallying point for cities, businesses and regions from around the world to outline plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The event has been hosted by Jerry Brown, the governor of California who has been lauded as a progressive climate leader and bulwark against the Trump administration.
But community representatives claim Brown has largely abandoned certain neighborhoods to pollution from oil and gas drilling operations. California’s Central Valley has some of the worst air quality in the country. Across the US, sicknesses linked to air and water pollution are disproportionately felt by people of color, who are far more likely to live near power plants, landfills and other toxic sites.
“Jerry Brown needs to stop oil drilling expansion and if he doesn’t do that, what kind of leader is he?” said Alicia Rivera, a community activist in Wilmington, a district of Los Angeles with six oil refineries, several chemical plants, scrap yards and hundreds of oil wells. “He has failed in a big way.”
Several thousand protesters marched through San Francisco on Thursday before attempting to block the entrance to the summit, where mayors, prime ministers, executives from companies such as McDonald’s and celebrities including Alec Baldwin were gathering.
Activists chanted “Tell Jerry Brown to keep it in the ground” and held signs reading “Don’t drill” and “We’re drowning”. There were scuffles as police attempted to remove several protesters who chained themselves to the gates of the conference building in downtown San Francisco. Inside the venue, protesters interrupted a speech by Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York, by chanting: “Our air is not for sale.”
Brown’s critics claim California’s cap-and-trade emissions system, which allows major polluters to trade emissions allowances and offsets, is overly generous to fossil fuel interests.
They have also attacked the governor for allowing more than 20,000 drilling operations during his tenure, as well as for an alleged conflict of interest in which his sister, Kathleen Brown, sits on the board of Sempra Energy. Sempra owns the Aliso Canyon gas facility near Los Angeles which suffered a major leak in 2015, releasing more than 100,000 metric tons of natural gas before it was finally plugged.
“It is appalling that Governor Brown would celebrate himself as a climate leader while he sentences my community to suffer from severe breathing problems, rare cancers, nosebleeds and rashes,” said Jane Fowler, a resident of the Porter Ranch area, near the site of the leak. “There isn’t any reason why he shouldn’t shut Aliso Canyon down now.”
The discontent highlights deep-seated inequities in housing and health exposed by climate change even in places considered progressive on the issue. This week, Brown signaled the end of unabated fossil fuel use in California, signing a bill to bring about 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045 and an executive order that would bring emissions to zero across all sectors, including transport and agriculture, by the same year.
These commitments, some of the most ambitious in the world, come at a time when the Trump administration is dismantling pollution rules for coal-fired power plants, cars and trucks.
“I’m tremendously supportive of leaders today who are moving as fast and far as they think they can,” said Gina McCarthy, who was administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under Barack Obama. “A leader like Jerry Brown has gone so far so we shouldn’t make it about him, we should make it about the issue.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/13/san-francisco-global-climate-action-summit-protests

The Guardian 2015: Peter Costello's five most 'profligate' decisions as treasurer cost the budget $56bn a year
BQSTART
The reason we have a budget deficit today is in no small part due to the efforts of Peter Costello. He gifted Joe Hockey the budget’s current structural deficit, mainly through tax giveaways to the rich. 
While countries like Norway took the benefits of resource price booms and banked them in their sovereign wealth fund, Peter Costello chose to cut taxes for the wealthy instead. He knew at the time that his populist generosity to the highest income earners would force future treasurers to choose between budget deficits or cutting spending on the sick, the poor and the elderly.

1% of world population is - 76,000,000 people.
76,000,000 divided by 24,770,600.
The figure is 0.329.
So we have 0.329% of the worlds population but produce 1.8% of the greenhouse gas.
Australians produce 5.47 times the average person in the world produces.

This third manifestation of the Coalition government is true to its original plan, the use of fossil fuels above anything else and at any cost. (It actually predates the Abbott opposition and has its roots in the Howard governments).
Abbott won an election based on the abolition of ""the carbon tax"", telling lies and ably assisted by just about anyone: the IPA, Gina Rinehart, the MCA, the MSM and others.
Ever since, and despite all the available scientific and empirical evidence, the Coalition has pursued its plan single-mindedly, even if it means its annihilation at the next election.

The Liberal Party, which has always represented the interests of corporations and the wealthy, and has convinced sufficient working people to vote against their own interests, is now captive to the religious right linked to similar Pentecostal religious groups who have invaded the Republican Party in the USA. 
In Australia, where religioun has tended to be practiced with a light touch, a majority are non-practicing (albeit 'believers') and more and more people are non-religious, the takeover of the Liberal Party by science denying, fundamentalist Christians puts it out of step with the majority of Australians.

Finkel did conduct that review at the behest of Malcolm Turnbull and the states when the objective was to fix the problems that have cascaded through the energy market since Tony Abbott opposed Labor’s carbon price to win an election.
The chief scientist proposed a clean energy target as the fix. Abbott and the deep feelings brigade inside the Coalition didn’t like it. It wouldn’t fly, so Turnbull and the energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, retreated and regrouped. They then got officials to produce the national energy guarantee, hoping that would work, given the Neg mechanism dealt with both reliability and emissions reduction, and that might subdue some of the conservative opposition.
But the deep feelings brigade didn’t like that either, and we all saw what happened next. Now let’s make our way back to Finkel, talking to mildly punch-drunk renewable energy types, in a small function room in the parliament this week.
Once Finkel moves on from being chief scientist, someone should give him a diplomatic posting, because he has been stoic in the face of a rolling cluster cuss, fronting up with a placid expression and some polite words of encouragement at every stage of the derangement in an effort to endorse the government’s underlying objective, which is to fix a serious problem.
Finkel was polite again this week, given the absurdity of being in a room with a new federal energy minister lacking any riding instructions to say anything apart from exchanging pleasantries; still no solution to an important problem; and the prime minister who asked him to help fix the mess now in exile in New York, out of office, and messing with the minds of the people who deposed him.
The chief scientist was talking about hydrogen at an annual showcase organised by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. He’s put together a strategy for energy ministers on hydrogen in the event that our elected representatives are still capable of serving the national interest. Dare to dream, Alan. Go, you good thing.
Finkel spoke about the excitement that was building in energy circles about the potential for hydrogen to be “the last piece of the jigsaw” in the inexorable energy transition. He spoke about Japan, a country that was “determined to decarbonise, unlike some other countries …” – a droll little aside that returned a sardonic laugh in the room – “and meet its 2030 commitments”.
Japan, like Australia, was a fossil-fuel heavy economy, but lacked some of the natural advantages of a country like Australia, with its abundant sunshine, and thin population. Japan, Finkel said, “was crying out for a zero-emissions alternative” and Australia had an opportunity to “capture the export market” and develop domestic opportunities as well.
A moment had arrived, in other words, in Australia’s national story. But to make this all happen, government would need to step up to the plate. Finkel told the room he’d given a presentation to energy ministers at the last Coag energy council meeting – the one that kept the Neg alive but put it on life support.
They were enthusiastic, he said. “Ministers, asking for a strategy,” Finkel said, deadpan, again, to a ripple of sardonic laughter in the room. “Think about this, a great thing.”
Finkel’s gentle homily gives you some insight into the resting disposition around Australia’s energy sector, which you might describe as gallows humour. The Coalition has plunged the country into an almighty mess, and there is no obvious way the mess can be fixed.
It really is dire.
Because of the civil war inside the Coalition that has delivered three party leaders in two terms, the Morrison government has parked the medium-term approach to solving the problems, which a sector such as energy, with generation assets with 30-year operating lives, requires.
Morrison and the new energy minister, Angus Taylor, are currently fixated on conjuring up a short-term fix they can offer voters before the election – a noticeable reduction in power prices – never mind the obvious point that having a medium term roadmap would help deliver your short-term objective.
Then there’s the climate imperative. The government can’t talk about emissions reduction except to offer a talking point that Australia will meet its Paris climate commitments “in a canter”.
This is nonsense, because there are no policies to deliver the commitment. As the conservative MP Craig Kelly asked in a meeting of the backbench energy committee this week – what am I supposed to say when people ask me how we’ll meet the Paris target? Good question Craig. Very acute.
The government is being hit with precisely that question, because it’s the obvious question to ask, and the answer appears to be “technology” (not clear what technology or why anyone would invest in it, given the cluster cuss); “the emissions reduction fund” (which is a creaking vestige of Abbott-era pretend climate action policies that the government chose not to top up in last year’s budget, and Josh Frydenberg, the new treasurer, is giving no commitment to funding in the future); and the vibe.
Right at the moment, the Morrison government has nothing to say to voters on emissions reduction. Unless this changes, this will be the first time in my reporting lifetime where a party of government goes to an election minus a concrete emissions reduction policy. Even Abbott, who campaigned on revoking Labor’s policy, coughed up a fig leaf called Direct Action.
Perhaps the new environment minister, Melissa Price, will have the wit to conjure up an emissions reduction policy that doesn’t actually reduce emissions, to give Morrison something to say when he has to face the voters, but I’m not hopeful, because the Neg was a policy that in practice would have reduced emissions in the electricity sector by 2% between 2012 and 2030, and the feelings brigade couldn’t even stomach that.
So where does this leave us? Of course voters care about lower prices, and many would rank lowering their power bills well ahead of emissions reduction. But the omission on cutting pollution, if it persists, won’t be cost-free for the Coalition.
The country is in the grip of a crippling drought. When the country was last in the grip of a crippling drought, and the Coalition was in a weak political position, on the brink of losing an election, John Howard (that would be the same prime minister who refused to ratify the Kyoto protocol) supported an emissions trading scheme because it became politically impossible to do anything else.
The data tells us emissions are rising, and basic logic tells you they will go on rising as long as there’s no plan to curb them. Some long-term survey research released this week also suggests two things: Australians are more worried about climate change than they were 12 months ago, and regional voters – the ones the Morrison government is currently most worried about leaking to populist political disrupters or community-minded independents – are less inclined than they once were to consider climate science a hoax.

Here the input record goes back to the 1700's. It was the worst year ever recorded for all farmers except for fruit, which was an abundant year. Some 25.000 hectares burnt, the most since 1878. Since the ground waters became so low, most farmers had no possibility of irrigation. Up 70 percent of the harvest for grains was lost. There was extensive emergency slaughter, since farmers could not feed their cattle. It was really bizarre. An interesting observation is that producers of organic farming had substantially smaller losses. The main reason being that they used old types of grains, which produces less but they have a natural resistance to drought. One of the reasons are that organically farmed soils retain water better, but that is not the whole story… 
So, how does this relate to vine growing? Someone further down in the thread made the statement that “organic” wines do use pesticides. That is true but it is a simplification of the matter at hand. Now, since I am European I choose to explain how organic farming for vines are regulated here. The difference is quite simple, in organic farming you can use what is considered “natural” pesticides. They include copper sulphate against mildew, which is the most criticised. However, as I can understand the criticism, I can easily weigh that against the incredible avalanche of synthetic pesticides that “conventional” production use. The same goes for fertilisers. The same goes for yeasts.
If I am going to criticise organic production in EU, it will instead be for this reason; according to EU regulation, organic wine only has to be “organic” in the vineyard. Once you are harvesting, you are free to use any treatment that “conventional” (industrial) production techniques uses. That includes that you can add some 59 additives. See a list here: http://www.morethanorganic.com/additives-in-wine .
So, what is the point I am trying to make here? I fell in love with wine culture in the 70’s, before there was conglomerates owning vineyards internationally. Basically, it was before modern mass production. I fell in love with the classical romantic view of the culture. One of the oldest measure of quality for a vineyard in Europe is the age of it. In France you say “vielles vignes”; old vines. The quality of a wine is directly related to the age of the vine. The older the vine the better wine. Why? Well, the vine needs to develop a root system that can supply the grapes with all the minerals that shape the character of the wine. The deeper roots, the more character. According to most national regulation in Europe the vine has to be 3 to 5 years old before you can legally make wine from it. The oldest vines I have seen are an average of 175 years. Here comes the blow, industrial mass production rips up the vines at approximately 15 years of age. At that moment, the bank says it’s not economically sustainably to keep the vines. Rip it up, plant again, in a never ending rape of the soil.
Now, serious quality (artisanal) organic or biodynamic viticulture, is the contrary, because the older the vine, the less help it needs. An old vineyard has a natural protection, its own biodiversity. It is resistant to mildew and drought in a way that young vines are not. Interestingly, wines produced from old vines has a significant higher amount of anti-oxidants compared to young vines. So, sure you are allowed to spray, but your need to do so is dramatically reduced.
Ok, if you want to do something about this, it’s very simple. First of all stop buying cheap industrial wines, regardless if they are organic or not. Forget, the BiB and check the producer online what their production methods are. In the UK artisanal or good organic wines start at 10 to 15 GBP. Note that many artisan producers refuse to certify their wines organic. It’s a jungle but drink less and drink better. Do your part, if you care.

Apparently roman wine was pretty awful. That's why they always added loads of sweet stuff (Honey) and spices to make it palatable.

""It's the grapes, James"", someone says. Well grape varieties are, I believe, changed not infrequently. I've heard that the southern Rhone valley, which was known as ""vin de table"", that is, no good, was completely replanted some time between the sixties and eighties. And is now among the best.

He also says however that with climate change also comes wild and unpredictable swings in temperature and other anomalies like short-lived variations such as a sudden frost cold snap in an otherwise warm period, or a brief warm period in an otherwise cold season. 
Both of these situations along with longer droughts or heavier downpours and floods, and damaging winds all are becoming increasing concerns.
As a result he notes that consistency of wine quality may begin to vary noticeably from year to year.

This summer’s heatwave was the pretext for an awful lot of these “and finally” moments, in which the tone is unfailingly flippant: never mind the melting Arctic, the shires will take over from Champagne!
Well, hoorah for that. Except, of course, the impact of climate changeon wine isn’t quite as straightforward as a few nice summers and guaranteed bumper vintages in Sussex. What the larky local-radio questions about Bordeaux-on-Thames tend to gloss over is that itwon’t necessarily make the UK, or anywhere, a better place to grow wine. Erratic weather, floods, hurricanes, extreme, unseasonal frost and drought: none of these are friends of the winemaker.
Winemakers are attuned to the minutest changes in the weather – differences that they can, literally, taste in their wines. A line-up of past vintages offers a sensorial record of climatic patterns, and the message sent by those bottles has been troubling the world’s winemakers for years.
With each new record-breaking hot summer, the long-term viability of swathes of the wine world is called into question
On one level, this is purely a question of quality and style. With grapes accumulating high levels of sugar (and therefore potential alcohol when they ferment) much sooner than they used to, as vintages get hotter – and way before the other elements, the tannins and the polyphenols that give wine its complex flavours, are ready – winemakers have a dilemma. They can either harvest much earlier, sacrificing complexity for acceptable alcohol levels, or produce wines with an undrinkable alcoholic force.
With each new record-breaking hot summer and earliest-ever vintage, the long-term viability of whole swathes of the wine world is called into question – grape varieties, the location of vineyards, access to dwindling supplies of water,the ability to produce wines in anything like the same style, quantity and quality. As the great Californian wine producer Randall Grahm put it matter of factly to the New Yorker’s Adam Gopnik earlier this year: “It’s everywhere. Burgundy may be fucked. The northern Rhône is partly fucked … the southern Rhône is fucked.”
Grahm’s ambitious latest project is near Santa Cruz, an attempt to breed a new grape variety that can cope with the current Californian climate, one capable of being dry farmed (without irrigation) and to withstand heat. This is urgent, serious business in a part of the world where wildfires have destroyed thousands of acres of vineyards, and taken many lives and livelihoods, in the past two years – and where nobody is treating climate change as a funny sign-off on the news.

As in England, changes in the climate have had some positive effects in cool, northerly Germany, with fewer bad (cold, wet) vintages than in the past. Whether the country will still be capable of producing such intricate, lacy, delicate riesling as this in 2050 is a whole other question, however.

The Centre for Global Development annually ranks 27 wealthy countries on their commitment to development across the policy areas of aid, finance, technology, environment, trade, security and migration.
The Commitment to Development Index is dominated by Scandinavian countries – which fill the top three spots – and European countries, which complete the top 12. The world’s biggest economy, the US, is at number 23 on the list: it has the worst aid and finance ranking of the assessed countries.
Australia trails New Zealand (13th), in 14th position overall, with a jump of four spots on last year. Australia and New Zealand are the highest ranked non-European nations on the index.
Report author, Ian Mitchell, said: “Australia’s trade policies are among the most development-friendly and the foreign aid it gives is high quality. But if Australia wants to become a development leader, it needs to increase the quantity of aid, and tackle environmental issues and focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.”
The report said that, on the environment, Australia was a laggard.
“Its low rank is largely due to its poor performance curbing climate change. It has very low gasoline taxes (only the United States and Canada have lower), high fossil fuel production and the highest greenhouse gas emissions per capita of all [index] countries, although it has also had among the steepest emissions reductions over the past 10 years.
“Australia is also the third-largest tropical timber importer.”
Australia has a strong trade rating in the index, ranking third of all countries on that policy, with low tariffs and agricultural subsidies.
“It’s a leader in providing equal access to goods from development countries … its barriers to trade in services are also low,” the report said.
It also ranks well on migration “in part because of its exceptionally open borders for students from developing countries”.
“Its integration policies are also above average. But Australia could improve the number of refugees and asylum seekers it accepts. The proportion of positive asylum decisions is below average and has fallen for the past three years. The number of refugees in Australia is below average relative to population and relative to land area.”
The report also said Australia’s treatment of migrants would be improved by ratifying the convention on the treatment of migrant workers and the migration for employment convention.
Australia has dedicated just 0.23% of its gross national income towards development assistance, a decrease on 2016, and its smallest contribution in 15 years. Australia’s aid contribution has been falling for half a decade.
The UN set out the 0.7% commitment to development spending in 1970, and it has been consistently reaffirmed as a benchmark since. But few countries meet it.
“[Australia’s] foreign aid is of good quality, however,” the report found. “Australia spends 70% of its aid bilaterally and 30% multilaterally.”
Mitchell told Guardian Australia that the dominance of Scandinavian and European countries was a product of historical commitment, community expectation and conscious government policy.
“When you talk to the officials in these countries, they take it competitively, it’s something that has a profile in the public arena, it’s a matter of pride in their public policy.”
He said the 0.7% of GNI target for aid spending – when compared with Nato’s declared 2% goal for defence budgets – was a sensible and achievable target.
“I think if all the countries got there, the acceleration of development would be substantial, and we’d live in a much more prosperous world, and that would be to the benefit of everybody and every country’s national interest.”
But Mitchell said the current global uncertainty – the retreat to economic isolationism through tariffs and trade wars, and the rise of populist nationalism – was a threat to the progress and prosperity of developing countries.
“I think the move against migation, against open trade, will damage development. We’ve had a remarkable period of development over the last half a century, with open trade, rising aid levels. And I think that’s in real danger.”
The president of the Centre for Global Development, Masood Ahmed, said: “Good development policy is about much more than foreign aid.
“While aid is important, policymakers in rich countries need to assess all the ways their choices, from the environment to trade to migration, help or hinder developing countries.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/18/australias-rank-on-global-development-index-hurt-by-climate-change-inaction

But many who weathered the tempest, deep in Trump country, don’t believe global warming fueled it and don’t think humans are the problem – or the solution.
As the world’s oceans warm at a faster rate, hurricanes become more likely, and there has been an increase in storms since the start of the 20th century. Experts warn more numerous and even more ferocious hurricanes are on the way, and the US government is not addressing the central issue even as America’s coasts get battered and inland areas inundated.
But based on the evidence in North Carolina on Wednesday, the random man and woman in the street is still not convinced about the science – even those who have faced two major storms in two years.
“We live on the coast. It’s cyclical,” said Bob Slattery.
“We may get two or three in a year, then go four or five years with nothing,” he added.
Slattery, 74, and his wife Gerda, 73, were sitting in the pretty downtown area of Fayetteville on Wednesday. The couple live six miles south-west of Fayetteville and weren’t hit too badly by the storm, but much of the city was, as the Cape Fear river reached record flood levels, spilling over its banks into neighborhoods and roads.
While miles of North Carolina is inundated, downtown Fayettevillehad been fortunate enough to avoid flooding this week, although locals said a wine bar roof had partly caved in.
“There’s a group of people that want to control things, and they’re using climate change to control things, and they want to put a tax on things,” Bob Slattery said.
There is scant evidence for a shady group using the concept of climate change to control and tax society – but it appears there is wider support for the theory in these parts.
“That’s our opinion,” Gerda Slattery said.
“And many other people I speak to think that, too,” Bob Slattery said.
Florence hit North Carolina just two years after Hurricane Matthew blew through the state. Matthew set a slew of unwanted flooding records in October 2016 and at the time was described as a “once in a 500 year event”. But just 23 months later, Florence has shattered that prediction, surpassing Matthew’s flooding totals and in many places having a worse impact.
Mother Nature is its own entity. Whatever happens it’ll fix itself eventually
Despite the proximity of the storms, and expert views, some believe the science is overblown and it’s no more than natural global rhythms.
“It comes down to cyclical climate change,” said Matthew Coe.
“I don’t think we play as big a factor in climate change as people say we do – when you think of the fact that the sea level rises naturally anyways.”
Coe 37, originally from Florida, is studying for an associate’s degree, alongside working at a downtown Fayetteville cafe. He lost power for three days after Florence roared in.
“Mother Nature is its own entity,” he said. “Whatever happens, it’ll fix itself eventually.” He pointed out that there had been fluctuations in the Earth’s temperature before, and predicted there could be another “ice age” which would correct the current trajectory of the climate.
“I think everything is hyped up a bit,” he said. In his opinion, there are “scientists on both sides” of the climate change argument.
There is actually a 97% expert consensus among climate scientists that humans are responsible for global warming, although Coe and the Slatterys are far from alone in their beliefs: a 2016 Pew Research Center study found that 51% of Americans do not believe global climate change is due to human activity. Donald Trump is among the 51% – or at least was in 2015. That year he wrote in his book Crippled America that climate change was not human-caused, although he did not explain the reasoning behind his belief. During the 2016 presidential election, he called it a Chinese hoax. On Wednesday he was in North Carolina and South Carolina, promising “100% support” to displaced residents and those with flooded neighborhoods and power outages, but not mentioning measures to deal with climate change, different impacts on rich and poor, or coastal over-development.
Further along Hay Street, the thoroughfare through downtown Fayetteville, the retired air force member Andre Altman was sitting in the Huske Hardware House bar.
“Ask Mother Nature,” said Altman, 57. He echoed Coe’s belief that Earth’s capricious matriarch could be responsible for climate change and the ensuing increase in the number and force of storms.
“Really the Earth goes through cycles. So it’s just we’re on that particular cycle where we’re grabbing more storms,” Altman said.
“Back in the industrial age we were burning coal and it didn’t get hotter then.”
Despite his belief that climate change was mostly a natural phenomenon, Altman accepted some of the science that said man was also to blame. He recycles, he said, but believes his own actions are likely to have little impact.
“I try to worry about what I can affect. If I could actually do something about it, I would,” Altman said.
“But I’m not in politics.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/19/hurricane-florence-climate-change-deniers-north-carolina

Despite Florence roaring ashore in this exact spot last Friday and now causing catastrophic flooding inland, the hurricane had not destroyed the beach, as many had expected. 
That could be because the US army corps of engineers and the state and local government this winter spent more than $9m dumping sand onto the beach to build it up, in a precarious and controversial effort to hold back nature. The corps has done this every four years for more than 30 years – and is now approaching a spending cap for the project.
Maintaining beaches this way, through what is called “renourishment”, will soon be more complicated than just finding funding, however.
Sea levels will rise up to several feet by 2100, and tougher hurricanes are likely to form in a warmer ocean, whirling in and repeatedly beating against the coast. With Wrightsville Beach, the city of Wilmington and the wider Carolinas suffering one of the region’s worst storms of all time, expensive, human-bolstered beaches like this one won’t work, ultimately.
That will be a problem, not just on the eastern seaboard, but everywhere with a beach. Rising oceans could also destroy two-thirds of southern California’s beaches by the end of the century, experts predict.
Some scientists have begun to argue for a retreat from the shore, after relentless development, but are emphatically shot down, particularly after a disaster. On Wednesday, visiting the storm zone, Donald Trump was upbeat about recovery from the hurricane.
But scientists are alarmed.
“Within a decade or two or three, it depends on where you are, we’re looking for a time when beach nourishment doesn’t work, so what do we do next?” asked Orrin Pilkey, an emeritus geology professor and coastal expert at Duke University. “Nobody, I don’t think, is thinking about how, when sea level rises, beach nourishment will be out of the question, will be economically impossible.”
The corps remakes beaches that are eroding from waves in an attempt to brace against major storms. It is hard to immediately determine how much sand survived after a storm. A beach can flatten out and look normal but have lost significant mass.
The corps is assessing the damages, but the Wrightsville Beach town manager, Tim Owens, said the area was lucky the storm landed where it did and wasn’t more intense and that renourishment “did what it was supposed to do, kept the water from overwashing and taking over property and infrastructure”.
While the replenished beach seemed to help, Owens said “all bets are off when you have a category 4 storm or 5 storm.” Florence landed as a category 1 but easily could have slammed into North Carolina with higher winds.
Asked about Pilkey’s retreat proposal, however, Owens quickly interjected.
“It won’t happen. It just won’t happen until it’s absolutely necessary … I won’t have to worry about it. It will be after my lifetime,” he said.
Typically, the US government pays for 65% of storm protection projects on public beaches. In Wrightsville Beach, the state and the town together pay the other 35%, with the town using revenues from a tax on room rentals. Sometimes after a disaster, the federal government pays to make a beach whole again. Owens said Wrightsville Beach may inquire about a touch-up following the hurricane.
Natalie English, the president of the Wilmington chamber of commerce, said the projects are a way of life on the coast, where tourism is a significant part of the economy.
“I think there’s been a lot of claims that beaches have been obliterated in North Carolina, English said. “I think it’s best that people understand that’s not the case. We will have a strong robust tourism economy again. We will be right back where we were.”
Erin Carey, the coastal coordinator for the North Carolina chapter of the environmental group the Sierra Club, lives about a mile and a half from Wrightsville Beach and was at headquarters in Raleigh earlier this week after evacuating.
Carey said: “When people fall in love with a place like they do with Wrightsville Beach, it will take an act of God or nature – maybe not even that – to pull them away.”
Because North Carolina has a law prohibiting more invasive seawalls, renourishment is seen as the main option for protecting development along the ocean. State lawmakers in 2012 also barred state agencies from considering long-term predictions of sea level rise. 
North Carolina has about 320 miles of shoreline, with around half owned publicly and half privately, said Andrew Coburn, the associate director of the Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines at Western Carolina. Most developed coastline has been supplemented with extra sand in many states, he said.
Coburn said the effectiveness is unproven. 
“The bottom line is we just do not have any evidence that spending that much money nourishing shorelines is even close to worth it,” Coburn said.
 
If the government is always willing to step in and recreate a beach, people will keep buying and building in vulnerable places, he warned.
“We are artificially changing shorelines and trying to make shorelines do what we want them to do,” Coburn said. “The problem is they’re going to do what they’re going to do.”
David Cignotti, who was mayor of Wrightsville Beach until the end of 2013, said beach towns are stashing away money in case the federal government ever stops paying for restoration.
“These beaches are used by people from all over the country … To me it’s worth it, ” he said.
Cignotti, who acknowledges climate change, favors stronger federal restrictions on development.
“It would be good to see our government not be one of only a couple in world that’s in denial this is happening,” Cignotti said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/20/beach-rebuilding-hurricane-florence-climate-change

Reinforcements dropped into California’s firefight from as far away as Australia and American Samoa to bolster strained state and federal crews, reaching a high point of 14,000 firefighters on the ground.
Yet other crews have pulled into the fires’ path with a less grandiose purpose: to save only select addresses. These are the private firefighters of the rich or otherwise well-insured: private crews hired by insurance companies to minimize damages and keep policyholders’ homes from going up in smoke.
“This year to date has been busier than any prior years to date,” David Torgerson, the president of the firefighting company Wildfire Defense Systems in Bozeman, Montana, told the Guardian in an email, “and we are expecting to respond to [more] wildfires this year than any prior year.”
This year’s wildfire season has produced the largest burn in California’s history and, in the northern part of the state, an awe-inspiring “firenado”. As scientists say that “megafires” are the new normal, climate change capitalism is finding an increasing number of customers. This echoes a global trend: cottage industries have sprung up to serve those who can afford to be a bit more protected and comfortable while the weather grows more cataclysmic. The uber-wealthy have bought estates in New Zealand (to the point that the country is in the midst of passing legislation to stymie foreign buyers) and luxe underground bunkers in Kansas and elsewhere to escape civic or natural collapse.
In western states, the wildfire-evacuated masses have huddled in Best Westerns or on gymnasium floors and are often locked in insurance-claim limbo, while the affluent check into five-star luxury hotels – usually reimbursable by their insurance – confident that their homes are being looked after.
Needless to say the bills were high. It was just paid through Pure
Ronald DeKoven is a New York attorney, English barrister, and a tech entrepreneur, regularly flying to London or Singapore, where his startup MyLawyer is headquartered. In 2011, he and his wife, Linda, bought an estate with three guesthouses in the center of a 30-acre Napa Valley vineyard. It was meant as a second home, but after falling in love with wine country, the couple moved in permanently.
Last year, one of his workers texted to report that a blaze, which would eventually become the catastrophic wine country fire, had started just down the road. Within minutes of the text, he and Linda sped away to a friend’s. “We put our shoes on and grabbed coats and left,” he says. “We probably were the first to leave this area. Given that I’ve practiced law for 50 years, you might say I’m cautious.” An insurance crew showed up to remove any combustibles around the house and spray fire retardant around the property’s edges. Meanwhile, the DeKovens checked in at the tony Clift Hotel in San Francisco. Their insurance company, Pure, explained over the phone to the couple that the company would prepay the hotel bills.
After a night at the Clift, the DeKovens moved to Four Seasons hotels in Silicon Valley and then San Francisco for three weeks. “Needless to say the bills were high,” DeKoven says. “It was just paid through Pure.”
While many other evacuees were locked in months of bureaucracy with insurance carriers, the DeKovens sailed through the recovery process. When they returned to their stone-and-stucco estate – which escaped the fire – Pure had already filtered the air to get rid of the heavy smoke smell. Pure sent out a team to test for carcinogenic dust in the house, detecting some in the main house’s attic. DeKoven hired their general contractor to vacuum the dust in hazmat suits and replace the insulation – a nearly $50,000 job that Pure prepaid with a check in the mail.
“I found it astonishing they would be so focused on our best interest,” DeKoven said. Insurance is a suddenly sexy conversation topic in California, and DeKoven has been handing out his adjusters’ name like some others pass around the name of their skilled masseuse.
AIG, the publicly traded insurance carrier, rolled out pre-emptive wildfire protection in 2005 to their Private Client Group, which the company says serves 40% of the Forbes 400 richest Americans. They were followed by competitors in so-called high net-worth insurance – Chubb, Pure and Nationwide Private Client, the types of companies who also typically offer insurance for such rarefied concerns as yachts and employment claims made by domestic help. Such coverage tends to keep out the hoi polloi, costing from thousands to tens of thousands or even six figures in annual premiums. Pure typically offers insurance to homes valued at more than $1m.
Insurance crews don’t battle back flames like the government-contracted ones do. Their services happen before and after a fire passes. Generally, when a policy is purchased, a risk assessor surveys the property for fire risks. Clients of some plans receive texts about evacuations and the paths fires are taking. When fires are encroaching, crews stop by to cart away flammable objects or brush from around the house that could catch fire from an ember, and sometimes install temporary sprinklers. They might spray flame retardant around a property’s perimeter, and seal vents to keep out drifting embers and smoke. In more dangerous spots, they might spray a house down with fire-retardant gel and even extinguish a spot fire.
To argue against this two-tiered response is to argue against capitalism itself, suggest industry insiders. “Insurance is a capitalist system, by and large, with for-profit companies,” said Amy Bach, the executive director of United Policyholders, a not-for-profit that educates insurance consumers. “So they’re always going to try to compete with each other and offer enhanced value to their higher-end customers who will pay the higher prices.”
Yet Bach added a note of regret, saying she would prefer wildfire fighting “not being a class system, where first class gets a full meal, and in coach you get peanuts”. The high-end insurers market to the exceptionalism of their clients – “families who have more to protect,” as Pure’s website reads. Chubb’s site features a 72-year-old named Gerry in Ventura, California, who escaped the Thomas Fire last year, and contrasts his story with the relative misfortune of his neighbors: “Not only was Gerry treated first class every step of the way, as Chubb clients, he says he and his wife were the only two in their development able to rebuild.”
Still, insurance-dispatched crews are now trickling down to companies with more middle-class clientele. For instance, for the past two years, USAA, a kind of insurance exchange for members of the military and their families, has offered the service to 1.4m properties in western states. USAA has no home value requirement; they’ll send firefighters out to your “modest cabin”, said a representative.
The head of one privately held firefighting company, Wildfire Defense Systems of Bozeman, Montana, argued against charges of elitism. Its president, David Torgerson, said that 90% of the policyholders’ homes are the average local market price, and that despite the exclusive image of private firefighting, the service is also offered by several mainstream insurers. He also said that private firefighting can redound to the public good, as more resources on the ground “contributes to the overall effort”. Crews could theoretically pitch in when called upon by incident command.
Even so, when a fire hits, insurance firefighting crews are “treated like civilians, basically”, said Scott McLean, a spokesman for CalFire, the California firefighting agency. They must get permission from the incident command to proceed into evacuation zones or pass roadblocks, and must leave if ordered to. Private crews do not play a role in the official fire response, he wrote in an email: “It is just another external situation that [incident command] has to deal with.”
Eliza Kerr has lived on the edge of Yosemite national park for two decades, rock-climbing and leading yoga and backpacking retreats through her not-for-profit, Balanced Rock, when not treating clients with ayurvedic medicine. She’s aware that her love of California’s natural grandeur puts her squarely in the fire zone. Still, she’s betting on the long term. “Yosemite’s been my home for a long time,” she says. “It’s part of the vision.” In fact, she has decided to increase her ties to the area, and is making good on her dream to build a retreat guest residence and a yoga studio amid the scrubby brush overlooking the Merced river.
The buildings were in mid-construction when the Ferguson fire evacuation order hit in mid-July. Kerr was away on a surfing trip in Indonesia at the time, but Chubb’s firefighting crew sprayed retardant around the property’s edge, sealed attic vents, and soaked the all-wood deck with water. They called her husband, who was still in California, with daily updates.
Though these measures lent her peace of mind, Kerr ultimately thanks official state crews for saving her property. “I want to give huge credit and kudos to the local firefighters,” she said. As she heard it, they intentionally burned off vegetation up to her property line, stopping the incoming fire in its tracks. Her dream of a yoga retreat in the middle of wildfire country is safe – for now.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/20/private-firefighters-wildfire-insurance-climate-change-capitalism

The company was a notable holdout when the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OCGI) was launched, but will now join European peers BP, Shell and Total in contributing $100m (£75m) to curb the impact of global warming.
The move is the clearest sign yet the US company is taking a more progressive stance on global warming.
Exxon, which promoted climate denial for years despite knowing about the risks since 1981, had shifted its tone on climate change under the leadership of Rex Tillerson. But while acknowledging global warming was real and linked to fossil fuel use, Tillerson said fears over climate change were overblown.
Darren Woods, who became the chief executive in 2017 when Tillerson became US secretary of state, has taken that shift further. “It will take the collective efforts of many in the energy industry and society to develop scalable, affordable solutions that will be needed to address the risks of climate change,” he said of the firm’s decision to join the OCGI.
Two other US oil companies, Chevron and Occidental Petroleum, have also joined the initiative, taking its total climate fund to $1.3bn.
The project, which has been derided as “greenwash” by campaigners, previously had 10 members, which represented 20% of global oil and gas production. The new additions have taken that figure to 30%.
Exxon’s annual contribution, which works out at $10m a year over a decade, represents just 0.04% of its planned capital expenditure of $25bn in 2018.
Greg Muttitt, a campaigner at Oil Change International, said: “It is hardly surprising that ExxonMobil, when faced with lawsuits for lying for decades about what it knew about climate change, should want to join an initiative that claims oil companies care about climate.”
Patrick Pouyanné, the chief executive of the French oil and gas company Total, said the new members would give more impact to the industry’s response to climate change.
🇺🇸👍 Happy to welcome @ExxonMobil @Chevron &amp; @OXY_Petroleum into the #OGCI! The 13 members now represent 30% of Oil &amp; Gas production and 20% of primary #energy consumption. The addition of 3 #US companies gives us more impact to lead the industry’s response to #ClimateChange.
The announcement of the OCGI’s new members comes weeks before a UN science panel publishes a report on whether the world can meet the Paris climate deal’s tougher global warming target of 1.5C.
Separately, Donald Trump tweeted on Thursday that Opec countries should bring down oil prices, which are hovering at about $80 a barrel. His comment came despite an agreement by the oil cartel to pump more oil in an effort to lower prices.
We protect the countries of the Middle East, they would not be safe for very long without us, and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices! We will remember. The OPEC monopoly must get prices down now!",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/20/exxonmobil-joins-oil-gas-climate-change-alliance-global-warming

A paper published this year by The Journal of Glaciology said the retreat of Asian glaciers was emblematic of a “historically unprecedented global glacier decline.” 
“I would say that climatologically, we are in unfamiliar territory, and the world’s ice cover is responding dramatically,” said Lonnie G. Thompson, a glaciologist at Ohio State University who helped found a project to study climate change on the Tibetan Plateau.

During the past six weeks, sheets of grey silk have spun out to veil two-thirds of the shrub. The creators of this premature Halloween decor are tiny brown ochre-coloured caterpillars, the larval stage of the hawthorn moth (Scythropia crataegella).
They are predominantly associated with their namesake, but can be found on other members of the rose family and are considered a minor fruit crop pest as they occasionally attack damsons and blackthorns. The young larvae are leaf miners. Where they have burrowed into fresh tissue, the glossy green leaves are marked with pale beige meandering trails. As they mature, they graze the surface, leaving the foliage shrivelled and brown. Some sprays have been completely defoliated, clusters of scarlet berries clinging to the naked branches. The plant should recover, though the damage inflicted may affect the development of new shoots.
I was surprised when, at the end of August, adults began appearing among the crisscrossed threads. At first glance the slender-winged, 15mm-long insects appeared relatively nondescript, but closer inspection revealed that their silvery-white forewings were beautifully marked with two broad, irregular, reddish-brown crossbands, interspersed with blotches and pinprick spots. The trailing edges of both the fore- and hindwings were delicately fringed, like the trim on a 1920s flapper dress.
The hawthorn moth is widespread in central and southern Europe, but in Great Britain it is rarely found north of Yorkshire. Across much of its range the species is bivoltine, producing two broods in a season. In Great Britain there is typically only one flight per year, with adults on the wing from mid-June to late July. The life cycle takes around 12 months, so infestations are usually noticed in the spring when the overwintered larvae emerge and begin feeding communally beneath their protective homespun shroud. Climate change is altering the reproductive phenology of many organisms; it seems likely that the unusually warm temperatures we experienced this summer have resulted in this unexpected second generation.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/21/country-diary-trails-of-the-unexpected-hawthorn-moth-larvae

Erik Solheim, executive director of UN Environment, was travelling for 529 out of the 668 days audited, spending $488,518 (£370,380), according to the report. The audit also said he had “no regard for abiding by the set regulations and rules” and claimed unjustified expenses.
The development comes amid growing concern among some UN Environment officials, with sources claiming his “haphazard and dictatorial management style” has “already made us dysfunctional in many respects”.
Solheim told the Guardian he had already paid back money for instances of oversight and made changes where other rules had been broken. He said he could not comment in detail on the audit until it was completed and published: “If any other mistakes are found, we will immediately correct them.”
Responding to staff concern over his leadership of the UN Environment Programme (Unep), he said: “To secure unprecedented environmental action, we need to change, as individuals, as society, indeed as the UN. No one is immune to the difficulty that type of systemic change often brings.”
The draft audit, leaked to the Guardian, was compiled by the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) and will be finalised after responses from the individuals named. It is particularly critical of Solheim’s frequent flying, which included a weekend trip from the US to France and back.
“The extensive travel patterns of [Solheim] did not set an example for the rest of the staff to follow,” it said. “In 2011 … the secretary general stated that ‘What we demand of others, we must do ourselves’. Such extensive travel therefore presents a reputation risk to the organization, especially [given] that Unep is supposed to be the lead on sustainable environment matters.”
It also said Unep, unlike several other UN organisations, did not have policies and incentives for staff to reduce their carbon emissions. In August, Solheim told a Norwegian aviation magazine, people should not have a “guilty conscience” about flying and said he held gold frequent flyer cards at all three major airline alliances.
“This is simply embarrassing,” said Truls Gulowsen, head of Greenpeace in Norway. “Solheim has made Unep much more visible, which is a good thing, partly through travels and discussions with so many people. But this report puts him in an extremely bad light and weakens the credibility of UN’s entire environmental organisation.” 
Solheim said: “Making good on our global agenda demands engagement with the world and indeed an expanded approach to our work. I am therefore determined to continue to focus on our mandate to create real results for real people, with real impact on the ground.”
The draft OIOS audit also criticises Solheim’s management style as “having no regard for abiding by the set regulations and rules, and correspondence seen showed management willingness to circumvent regulations and rules which were termed as ‘bureaucratic’.”
The audit said Solheim’s travel had been approved by a manager who reported directly to him, not someone more senior. “We have immediately put new procedures in place whereby my travel is approved by the office of the secretary general,” Solheim told the Guardian.
The audit also said Solheim had not provided justification for 76 days spent in Oslo and Paris on official travel. After a request from a UN official to account for days spent in his home country, Norway, Solheim, emailed: “We cannot accept this question on holiday vs job … we are not any longer living in the industrial age and they must stop treating me as if I am a 07 to 16 factory worker … the other side of this coin is that they must stop asking this stupid question.”
Solheim told the Guardian: “It’s true that I have vented frustration with what I perceive as excessive bureaucracy in the UN system. I believe fully in reforming the UN so we’re better able to confront the urgent challenges facing our planet.” But he added: “If administrative rules are found to have been overlooked, I accept personal responsibility and offer my unflinching commitment to refining a process that prevents them from ever occurring again.”
The OIOS report also criticises Solheim for allowing two senior managers to work unofficially from Paris, rather than Unep headquarters in Nairobi. A source said staff saw this arrangement as the managers “getting away with murder”.
In one case, the unofficial teleworking resulted in additional travel costs of $23,750, according to the draft audit. Questioned by officials over the unofficial arrangement in emails seen by the Guardian, Solheim said: “Please blame it on the erratic executive director.”
On another occasion, discussing management reform, Solheim emailed colleagues to say: “There is no need to be the most legalistic implementer of nonsense. Very often it is easier to get forgiveness for non compliance than to get permission for change.”
Numerous Unep staff have contacted the Guardian, on condition of anonymity, criticising Solheim’s leadership of the organisation, which is governed and funded by UN member states.
“He thinks he is a CEO when he is actually an international civil servant,” said one source. “A lot of us were very excited when he came. He’s Norwegian and an ex-environment minister. It was the dream CV that turned into a nightmare.”

Every 91 days, the $1bn, decade-in-the-making creation will orbit over more than 1,000 paths. The satellite, about the size of a Smart car, will point six lasers at ice sheets in the Arctic and Antarctica. It will then calculate how long the beams take to bounce back. Nasa will be able to more accurately measure the heights of ice sheets and the thickness of remaining sea ice.
“With sea ice, we’ve been able to measure the extent (or area) really well since about 1980 … but what we haven’t been able to measure is the thickness,” said Tom Neumann, Nasa’s deputy project scientist for the mission. “Thickness is a key piece of the puzzle because thinner sea ice is broken up more easily by storms. It melts faster. So it gives you some insight into why the area is changing the way it is.”
Melting ice in Greenland and Antarctica has increased the global sea level more than a millimeter per year, a third of the overall increase, according to Nasa. Sea-level rise is getting faster, and seas could be several feet higher by the end of the century.
The IceSat-2, launched Saturday, replaces an original satellite that has been out of commission since 2009. Between 2003 and 2009, the measured sea ice lost 40% of its thickness, Neumann said.
Since then, Nasa has used a plane to take more rudimentary measurements of ice melt for about a month per year in the Arctic and Antarctic. That covered less ground but allowed Nasa to monitor the fastest changing parts of the ice sheets and sea ice.
Neumann said it’s possible the satellite will find ice loss beyond what Nasa has measured so far. Gaps in data, including in east Antarctica, could show ice shrinking or growing.
The new satellite will provide more complete coverage and measure to within a centimeter.
“In the time it takes someone to blink, sort of half a second, IceSat-2 is going to collect 5,000 measurements in each of its six beams, and it’s going to do that every hour, every day … it’s a tremendous amount of data,” Neumann said.
While Donald Trump doubts the scientific consensus around man-made climate change and his administration is rescinding standards to stall warming, Neumann said multiple federal agencies want to see the satellite data when it starts coming back in October.
The US Geological Survey is interested in the elevation data, and the navy would like to look at how changes will affect shipping channels, he said. With ice melt, new routes are expected to open through the Arctic, significantly reducing shipping times.
Nasa has an entire fleet of satellites observing Earth, including for signs of climate change. Trump this year proposed cutting the budget that funds many of the others.
Private companies and public interest groups and even the state of California have announced their own plans for climate-related satellites.
A collaboration between the Environmental Defense Fund and Harvard University is expected to launch in 2021 and as will pinpoint methane leaks from oil and gas operations.
Steven Hamburg, chief scientist for EDF, said researchers realized they could build the satellite faster and cheaper than the government. EDF research suggests oil and gas companies in the US leak 60% more methane than environmental regulators estimate.
Methane traps far more heat than the more common carbon dioxide. Because it is short-lived, cutting emissions would have a rapid impact on temperatures, Hamburg said.
The European Space Agency has a satellite that measures greenhouse gases, but it doesn’t specify in detail where leaks are happening. GHGSat, a private company, expects to launch a second greenhouse-gas-monitoring satellite soon.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/sep/21/nasa-new-satellite-ice-melt-ice-sat-2-launches

Further south from me in southern Australia a poor winter wet season due global warming causing the wintertime Southern Ocean lows to stay south of the continent, there has been crop damage due to frosts - cold and dry, not warm and dry.

Therefore, we conclude that despite statistical correlations between SST and Atlantic hurricane activity in recent decades, it is premature to conclude that human activity–and particularly greenhouse warming–has already caused a detectable change in Atlantic hurricane activity. (“Detectable” here means the change is large enough to be distinguishable from the variability due to natural causes.) However, human activity may have already caused some some changes that are not yet detectable due to the small magnitude of the changes or observation limitations, or are not yet confidently modeled (e.g., aerosol effects on regional climate).

And from James Hansen in a 2012 TED Talk:
BQSTART
Global warming is already affecting people. The Texas, Oklahoma, Mexico heatwave and drought last year, Moscow the year before and Europe in 2003, were all exceptional events, more than three standard deviations outside the norm. 
Fifty years ago, such anomalies covered only two- to three-tenths of one percent of the land area. In recent years, because of global warming, they now cover about 10 percent -- an increase by a factor of 25 to 50. 
So we can say with a high degree of confidence that the severe Texas and Moscow heatwaves were not natural; they were caused by global warming.

While the months of soaring temperatures provided an initially welcome ray of sunshine after a long, cold, wet winter, the two extremes have damaged our gardens – and highlighted how vulnerable labour-intensive, primped-and-pruned plots can be. Mature trees and shrubs (with deeper root structures), perennial crops and wildflower-laden areas suffered less from the heat; but potted plants, which dry out quickly, became a time-consuming burden, requiring endless watering, while salad leaves stopped growing or wilted and died. Mediterranean, sun-loving produce such as tomatoes, aubergines, grapes, cucumbers, thyme, rosemary and oregano thrived; but leeks, broccoli, onions, carrots and potatoes were hit hard, a fact mirrored in farmers’ worrying crop yields this year.
Soil erosion and heat stress left plants more vulnerable to pests and diseases, while the wet winter threatenedsoil fertility and increased the risk of nutrients being washed away. Cyclical natural phenomena, predicted to amplify the effects of global warming over the next four years, could result in greater extremes. The RHS recently partnered with Cranfield University to recruit the UK’s first garden water scientist, to research how gardeners can better deal with drought and flood; but in the meantime, what can we do to repair the damage and increase our gardens’ resilience? Here’s how to get started. 
Pulling out, clearing plants and digging over the soil is the worst thing you can do, opening up your loam to the elements. A plant with roots in the ground helps to hold together the soil (and its goodness); allowing flowers and crops to rot down naturally provides greater protection. Even non-invasive weeds are better than nothing at all.
Good old-fashioned, slow-release compost contains everything plants need and promotes deep-down resilience. It’s easy to make: in a basic cold composting system, add a roughly 50/50 mix of green waste (fruit and veg, grass cuttings, plant trimmings) with brown (newspaper, cardboard, garden pruning, fallen leaves). During a heatwave, it can also be used as a mulch around thirstier plants, helping to hold moisture in. Ground that has been well composted throughout the year will be better able to deal with winter rain, as it has an enhanced structure and can absorb more water. 
Climate change could result in an increase in pests, and weather-stressed plants are more vulnerable to attack. Predators provide a more balanced ecosystem where it’s harder for one type of creature to dominate. Allow a small area of your garden to be entirely wild, to encourage frogs, toads, ground beetles, ladybirds and their ilk. Attractive habitats over winter include leaf litter, a wood pile, compost heap, stinging nettles, old plant stems and pots under which insects can hide.
Their deeper root structure enables them to seek out moisture and thrive in harsher conditions than many flightier annuals, making them lower-maintenance and hardier. Easy additions include rhubarb, asparagus, cardoon, daubenton kale, winter herbs and the likes of jerusalem artichoke and oca, which will grow back if you leave a few tubers in the ground. Lavender, hardy geraniums and coneflowers also stand their ground well.
As well as completing the gardening circle in a way that is very rewarding, this will give you seeds adapted to the conditions in your garden or allotment, making them more resilient. Some of the best plants for this are parsley, coriander, calendula, nasturtium, poppies, camomile and aquilegia.
Autumn is the time to collect rainwater. This means upsizing or increasing the number of butts you have, so you are better prepared for the next drought. A pump can be used in butts, baths or paddling pools to help access every available drop. Trees and shrubs near the top of your garden will make a protective barrier, helping to absorb excess winter rainwater and provide a defence against wind. Allowing grass to grow long also helps. 
Rather than growing crops in blocks, take a more cottage garden approach,mixing produce in with flowers, herbs and small shrubs. This provides greater biodiversity, encourages pollinators, makes it easier to create ground cover and provides resilience against pest attack.

But the organisation Flannery helped start from the ashes of Abbott’s climate bonfire, the Climate Council, says that attitudes have shifted substantially since 2013 – at least those outside federal parliament.
“We’re being held hostage at a federal level,” Flannery told Guardian Australia.
“It has been a disgrace. Our failures are the failures of a small group of politicians who are supposed to be acting in the national interest. Instead, they’re using energy policy as a cudgel, they’re listening to paid lobbyists and doing their bidding.”
“I don’t want to say any more because I’ll just get angry.”
Flannery was the chief commissioner of the Climate Commission, a government-backed research body whose remit was to communicate reliable and authoritative information about climate change.
The commission lasted just two years, and was almost immediately scrapped by the Abbott government after the 2013 election. Flannery and other commissioners decided to subsequently launch the Climate Council as an independent not-for-profit body.
“We raised $1.5m in 10 days,” recalls Amanda McKenzie, the council’s chief executive.
“At the time we went out, quite on a limb, because we had no funding. We said we will go ahead if the public backs us. It was the largest crowdfunding campaign in Australian history. Thousands of people were contributing.”
“I look back on that time as a really hopeful moment, thinking the community is behind us on this. More and more Australians are concerned about the issue. That concern has elevated over time.
“We had no idea that we would still be, five years later, battling for any action on an federal government level.”Flannery points out that Australia’s emissions continue to increase “at a time when they need to be going down”. The federal government has abandoned any commitment to meeting the Paris emissions reduction targets. The new prime minister, Scott Morrison, famously used a lump of coal as a prop in parliament.
That state of affairs might cause some to question whether any progress had been made during the past five years. But putting federal politics to one side, both Flannery and McKenzie say strides have been made by individuals, local and state governments.
“I think [without the Climate Council] we’d be a long way behind in terms of public awareness, we’d be a huge distance behind,” Flannery said. “Those who were seeking to mislead would be [not held to account].”
“I’m immensely proud of it and I think we’ve made a huge difference”.
Flannery said the Climate Council initially sought to be a research and information body, filling the gap left by the disbanding of the commission. But in recent years it has taken on a broader remit, actively running programs to support action.
“We decided we needed to expand our remit, we’re running out of time to deal with this issue and we needed to pull out all stops.
“I think we’ve got to use every leverage point we can at the moment because we’re running out of time. We need to find those programs that work, get involved and start leading them.”
One of those programs, which Flannery says he is “most proud of”, is a partnership that supports local governments to transition to clean energy.
“What we didn’t realise [five years ago] was that state governments would step into the vacuum and that local governments would step into the vacuum,” McKenzie said.
In five years, the council has released more than 100 publications.
“If we had failed, it would not only have set back the entire climate change discussion in Australia, it would have given the conservatives an opportunity to say how little everyone cares about climate change,” Flannery said.
“There will be a need for the Climate Council I think for decades, because the problem isn’t going to be solved for decades. It’s a pretty tough thing to be pushing against this and find you’re constantly going backwards. But I’m nothing if not stubborn.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/23/energy-policy-captive-to-lobbyists-and-mad-ideologues-tim-flannery-says

She packed her possessions into dozens of boxes, tried not to think of the mold and mildew-covered furniture and retreated to a second-floor condo that should be beyond the reach of pounding rains and swelling seas.
Boineau is leaving behind a handsome, early 20th-century house in Charleston, South Carolina, the shutters painted in the city’s eponymous shade of deep green. Last year, after Hurricane Irma introduced 8in of water into a home Boineau was still patching up from the last flood, local authorities agreed this historic slice of Charleston could be torn down.
“I was sloshing through the water with my puppy dog, debris was everywhere,” she said. “I feel completely sunken. It would cost me around $500,000 to raise the house, demolish the first floor. I’m going to rent a place instead, on higher ground.”
Millions of Americans will confront similarly hard choices as climate change conjures up brutal storms, flooding rains, receding coastlines and punishing heat. Many are already opting to shift to less perilous areas of the same city, or to havens in other states. Whole towns from Alaska to Louisiana are looking to relocate, in their entirety, to safer ground.
The era of climate migration is, virtually unheralded, already upon America.
The population shift gathering pace is so sprawling that it may rival anything in US history. “Including all climate impacts it isn’t too far-fetched to imagine something twice as large as the Dustbowl,” said Jesse Keenan, a climate adaptation expert at Harvard University, referencing the 1930s upheaval in which 2.5 million people moved from the dusty, drought-ridden plains to California.
This enormous migration will probably take place over a longer period than the Dustbowl but its implications are both profound and opaque. It will plunge the US into an utterly alien reality. “It is very difficult to model human behaviour under such extreme and historically unprecedented circumstances,” Keenan admits.
The closest analogue could be the Great Migration – a period spanning a large chunk of the 20th century when about 6 million black people departed the Jim Crow south for cities in the north, midwest and west.
By the end of this century, sea level rise alone could displace 13 million people, according to one study, including 6 million in Florida. States including Louisiana, California, New York and New Jersey will also have to grapple with hordes of residents seeking dry ground.
“There’s not a state unaffected by this,” said demographer Mat Hauer, lead author of the research, which is predicated on a severe 6ft sea level increase. There are established migration preferences for some places – south Florida to Georgia, New York to Colorado – but in many cases people would uproot to the closest inland city, if they have the means.
“The Great Migration was out of the south into the industrialized north, whereas this is from every coastal place in the US to every other place in the US,” said Hauer. “Not everyone can afford to move, so we could end up with trapped populations that would be in a downward spiral. I have a hard time imagining what that future would be like.”
Within just a few decades, hundreds of thousands of homes on US coasts will be chronically flooded. By the end of the century, 6ft of sea level rise would redraw the coastline with familiar parts – such as southern Florida, chunks of North Carolina and Virginia, much of Boston, all but a sliver of New Orleans – missing. Warming temperatures will fuel monstrous hurricanes – like the devastating triumvirate of Irma, Maria and Harvey in 2017, followed by Florence this year – that will scatter survivors in jarring, uncertain ways.
The projections are starting to materialize in parts of the US, forming the contours of the climate migration to come.
“I don’t see the slightest evidence that anyone is seriously thinking about what to do with the future climate refugee stream,” said Orrin Pilkey, professor emeritus of coastal geology at Duke University. “It boggles the mind to see crowds of climate refugees arriving in town and looking for work and food.”
Pilkey’s new book – Sea Level Rise Along Americas Shores: The Slow Tsunami – envisions apocalyptic scenes where millions of people, largely from south Florida, will become “a stream of refugees moving to higher ground”.
“They will not be the bedraggled families carrying their few possessions on their backs as we have seen in countless photos of people fleeing wars and ethnic cleansing, most recently in Myanmar and Syria,” Pilkey states in his book. “Instead, they will be well-off Americans driving to a new life in their cars, with moving trucks behind, carrying a lifetime of memories and possessions.”
Dejected with frigid New York winters, Chase Twichell and her husband purchased a four-bedroom apartment in Miami Beach in 2011, with the plan of spending at least a decade basking in the sunshine. At first, keeping a pair of flip-flops on hand to deal with the flooded streets seemed an acceptable quirk, until the magnitude of the encroaching seas became apparent when the city spent $400m to elevate streets near Twichell’s abode.
Twichell began to notice water pumps were spewing plastic bags, condoms and chip packets into the bay. Friends’ balconies started getting submerged. Twichell, a poet, found apocalyptic themes creeping into her work. Last year, she sold the apartment to a French businessman and moved back to upstate New York.
“It was like end of the world stuff,” she said. “It was crazy for us to have such a big investment in such a dangerous situation.” Her neighbours initially scolded her but now several are also selling up, fretting that the real estate and insurance markets for properties like theirs will seize up.
“It was horrible but fascinating to see it,” Twichell said. “It’s like we got to see the future and it wasn’t pretty. It’s like a movie where there’s a terrible volcano that is destroying everything, only it’s much slower than that.”
A sense of fatalism is also starting to grip some local officials. Philip Stoddard, mayor of South Miami, has seen a colleague, spooked by sea level rise, move to California and some neighbours sell their houses before an expected slump in prices. Stoddard and his wife regularly discuss buying a fallback property, perhaps in Washington DC.
“Most people will wait for the problem to be bad to take action, that’s what I worry about,” he said. “We can buy a lot of time, but in the end we lose. The sea level will go over the tops of our buildings.”
Sanitation is an immediate preoccupation for Stoddard, given the large proportion of residents who aren’t served by sewage works. “If you’re using a septic tank and your toilet starts to overflow into your bathroom because of water inundation, that’s a basis-of-civilization problem,” he said. “A medieval city wasn’t a nice smelling place and they had a lot of diseases.”
Those living near the coasts will face pressures of the gradual (sea level rise) as well as dramatic (storms) nature but people inland will also be harried to move by climate change.
Farming techniques and technology have improved immeasurably since the Dustbowl but rising temperatures are still expected to diminish yields for crops such as maize, soybeans and wheat, prompting the departure of younger people from farming. By 2050, Texas county, the largest wheat-producing county in Oklahoma, could spend an extra 40 days a year above 90F (32C) compared with now.
A study published last year found that the economies of the southern states, along with parts of the west, will suffer disproportionately as temperatures rise. In what researchers called potentially one of the largest transfers of wealth in US history, the poorest third of counties are expected to lose up to 20% of their income unless greenhouse gas emissions are severely curtailed. Wealth, and potentially people, are expected to shift north and west.
Meanwhile, cities already struggling with heat will see wealthy residents head for cooler climes. Last year, 155 people died in Phoenix due to a particularly fierce summer. Increasing heat will start testing the durability of the populace, even those shielded by air conditioning. In the western states, wildfires are getting larger, razing homes in ever more spectacular ways and choking thousands of people with carcinogenic smoke.
Further to the south, at the border, there are suggestions that people from Central America are being nudged towards the US because of drought and hurricanes in their homelands, part of a trend that will see as many as 300 million climate refugees worldwide by 2050.
“People will get very grumpy and upset with very hot temperatures,” said Amir Jina, an environmental economist at the University of Chicago who co-authored the research on economic losses. “Even if you have air conditioning, some areas start to look less habitable. By the middle of the century parts of the south-west and south-east won’t look attractive to live in.
“That insidious climate migration is the one we should worry about. The big disasters such as hurricanes will be obvious. It’s the pressures we don’t know or understand that will reshape population in the 21st century.”
Prodded to name refuges in the US, researchers will point to Washington and Oregon in the Pacific north-west, where temperatures will remain bearable and disasters unlikely to strike. Areas close to the Great Lakes and in New England are also expected to prove increasingly attractive to those looking to move.
By 2065, southern states are expected to lose 8% of their US population share, while the north-east will increase by 9%. A recent study forecast that the population in the western half of the US will increase by more than 10% over the next 50 years due to climate migration, largely from the south and midwest.
But these population shifts are uncertain and are bound by a tangle of other factors and caveats. People will still largely follow paths guided by nearby family or suitable jobs. Even those who do want to move may find favoured locations too expensive.
Some will just grimly hang on. “With property rights as strong as they are in the US, some people may choose to go down with the ship,” said Harvard’s Keenan. “The question is whether they have the means and the options to do anything else.”
“People can usually cope with being a little less comfortable, but if you see repeated storms or severe damage to crops, that will trigger change,” said Solomon Hsiang, who researches how climate change will affect society at the University of California.
“There will be pressure to move a little north. It won’t be everyone, though, it won’t be like the great migration of wildebeest in Africa. Whole cities picking up and moving would be hugely expensive.”
Smaller towns are giving relocation a go, however. In 2016, the community of Isle de Jean Charles in Louisiana was the first place to be given federal money to replant itself. The population, situated on an island being eaten away by the sea, is looking to move to a former sugar cane farm 30 miles inland.
“We are called climate refugees but I hate that term,” said Chantal Comardelle, who grew up in the Isle de Jean Charles community.
“We will be the first ones to face this in the modern US but we won’t be the last. It’s important for us to get it right so other communities know that they can do it, too.”
About a dozen coastal towns in Alaska are also looking to relocate, as diminishing sea ice exposes them to storms and rising temperatures thaw the very ground beneath them. One, Newtok, has identified a new site and has some federal funding to begin uprooting itself.
A buyout of damaged and at-risk homes has already occurred in New York City’s Staten Island in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, while certain flood-prone houses in Houston, pummeled by Hurricane Harvey last year, are also being purchased and razed.
But the cost of doing this for all at-risk Americans would be eye-watering. Estimates range from $200,000 to $1m per person to undertake a relocation. If 13 million people do have to move, it seems fantastical to imagine $13tn, or even a significant fraction of this amount, being spent by governments to ease the way.
“As a country we aren’t set up to deal with slow-moving disasters like this, so people around the country are on their own,” said Joel Clement, a former Department of the Interior official who worked on the relocation of Alaskan towns.
“In the Arctic I’m concerned we’ve left it too late. Younger people have left because they know the places are doomed. These towns won’t be relocated within five years and I’m sure there will be a catastrophic storm up there. My hope is no lives will be lost.”
Ultimately, the US will have to choose what it wants to defend and hope its ingenuity outstrips the environmental changes ranged against it. Not everyone will be able to shelter behind fortifications like the ‘big U’ planned to defend lower Manhattan. Wrenching decisions will have to be made as to what and where will be sacrificed.
“We won’t see whole areas abandoned but neighborhoods will get sparse and wild looking, the tax base will start to crumble,” said Stoddard, mayor of South Miami. “We don’t have the laws to deal with that sort of piecemeal retreat. It’s magical thinking to think someone else will buy out your property.
“We need a plan as to what will be defended because at the moment the approach is that some kid in a garage will come with a solution. There isn’t going to be a mop and bucket big enough for this problem.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/24/americas-era-of-climate-mass-migration-is-here

Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, will declare on Tuesday that the party is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to zero by the middle of the century. The UK’s current goal is an 80% cut by 2050.
Such a move would put the UK ahead of the EU and signal that it intends to be a strong international climate leader post-Brexit.
It would also leapfrog Labour ahead of the Conservatives on climate-change action. The government is shortly expected to instruct its climate advisers to explore what a tougher global-warming goal means for the UK’s domestic carbon targets but has not yet pledged to hit zero emissions.
Long-Bailey, who is seen by some as a potential future leader, will also outline a series of new proposals on energy to meet the long-term carbon goal. Experts said they were far more ambitious than the party’s current policy.
The plan envisages 85% of electricity coming from renewable and low-carbon sources by 2030, a dramatic increase on the 50% they provide today.
That would involve a sevenfold increase in offshore windfarms and a tripling of solar power, enabling nearly 20m homes to be powered by wind and solar.
The party would also “remove the barriers” the Conservatives put in place for onshore windfarms. Labour would like to see doubling of onshore windfarms by 2030.
Long-Bailey said: “The potential benefits of transitioning to a sustainable economy are enormous and we want to make sure these are shared by everyone … the Tories are not up to the job of dealing with the existential threat posed by climate change.”
Beyond electricity, the party is also grappling with how to keep the UK warm without burning fossil fuels.
Around 85% of the country uses gas for heating, with most of the rest coming from oil and a tiny proportion from renewable sources such as heat pumps and biomass.
Labour is mulling a goal of providing 44% of heat from renewable sources by 2030 and reducing heat demand from buildings by almost a quarter. The party is expected to officially adopt the energy goals later this year.
Jim Watson, director of the UK Energy Research Centre, said: “These proposals are envisaging a much more ambitious approach than current policy. With respect to renewable electricity, particularly wind, the ambitions look achievable by 2030.”
Industry sources told the Guardian that the proposals for more green electricity were ambitious but could be met provided there was a rethink on onshore windfarms, which are currently ineligible for subsidies.
However, Watson said that meeting the targets on low-carbon heat would be more difficult and “a tall order”.
Greenpeace said the adoption of a net-zero emissions goal for 2050 was “truly transformative”. Friends of the Earth said the energy proposals could help the UK seize the potential of “huge innovations happening in renewable energy technology.”
Labour said it had created a working group with unions to “ensure workers are protected” as the energy industry shifts from fossil-fuel power stations to a renewable future.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/24/labour-wants-green-energy-to-power-most-uk-homes-by-2030-greenhouse-gas-emissions

The bar was packed with people double-fisting drinks and dancing. But every now and then you caught someone go quiet, stare at the ceiling, take a deep breath and sigh, eyes glimmering.
“It’s a lot to take in,” said a woman to a friend standing next to her. “Where are you gonna go for happy hour now?” she asked.
“I don’t know,” her friend answered. “Nowhere.”
A grey-haired man behind the bar gave a bottle of vodka to a customer who knocked back its last dregs. Barry O’Meara was not just the bartender – he also owned the place, which he had opened 14 years ago. But on 27 January 2018, it was coming to an end. O’Meara would close Bait &amp; Tackle for good.
Until then, Bait &amp; Tackle had been a neighborhood bar in Red Hook, Brooklyn. O’Meara was shutting it down because the neighborhood was not what it used to be. The people moving to Red Hook – “the new people”, he said – were displacing his customers, who could no longer afford their rent.
“And the people moving in don’t frequent establishments like this,” O’Meara said. “So that’s it.”
It was not the ending anyone had expected five years earlier. In October of 2012, O’Meara had stood on the street outside Bait &amp; Tackle watching the ocean draw nearer and nearer. Soon water was pouring into the basement of his bar.
With its narrow rivers, estuaries and islands, New York City is extremely vulnerable to coastal flooding. Red Hook lies on the city’s floodplain. Flood maps show that Red Hook – a low, flat peninsula, surrounded by water on three sides – wouldn’t stand a chance in the case of a “100-year flood”, a weather event so massive it has a 1% chance of occurring every year.
It might not sound like much of a risk, but “1%” is a deceptively small number. As Arctic glaciers melt, and oceans grow warmer and expand, sea levels are rising. Storms that would have been too weak to push the water to shore in the past will become powerful enough to do so. In the near future, what we think of as 100-year floods might be more like 30- or 40-year floods.
Soon, it won’t take a heavy storm for Red Hook’s streets to flood. According to scientists’ projections, the city’s piers will vanish under high tide in the 2020s. By 2080, a normal high tide will flood some streets. Part of Van Brunt Street, Red Hook’s main thoroughfare, is expected to flood daily.
Hurricane Sandy, in 2012, offered a grim preview of Red Hook’s future. The storm, which devastated areas all over New York and left 43 dead in the city, hit Red Hook particularly hard. As water gushed out of sewers and into streets, parks and basements, residents were forced to remember that Red Hook used to be a tidal marsh and that old, hidden creeks still stream under the asphalt like veins under the city’s skin.
After the storm, Red Hook residents who owned their homes believed their property had lost its value overnight. The truth was more surprising. Over the next several years, Red Hook’s home prices soared. It turned out that, storm or no storm, there were people in New York City and beyond who were willing to pay more than $1m for the chance to live on a floodplain.
Red Hook’s transformation was tangible. Two blocks of new luxury townhouses rose on King and Sullivan Streets. In 2016, Tesla opened a showroom there. More and more tourists wandered in for new and rebuilt galleries, restaurants and bars. An old factory, right by the water, was turned into million-dollar condos. The Puerto Rican family that owned the Bait &amp; Tackle building sold it to an investment company in 2016, and O’Meara’s rent shot up by 30%. Rising rents pushed more than a dozen of O’Meara’s friends out of the neighborhood and, in many cases, out of the city entirely.
Many Red Hook residents saw their neighborhood as the last bastion of real New York: a place where regular people with regular jobs could still afford to live. That “authenticity” was also part of its charm in the eyes of newcomers – but that didn’t reassure people like O’Meara, who felt the bastion was under attack, not only from the rising sea but from newcomers and their middle-class lifestyle too.
Five years after the storm, O’Meara said that Sandy was the beginning of the end for the neighborhood. Then he corrected himself: “There’s no such thing as a fucking end. But it was the beginning of something different.”
Andrew Amendola is the fourth Amendola to live in the slender, four-story 19th-century building on Van Brunt Street. He is an only child who grew up without a mother but who shared the house with his father, grandmother, great-uncle and two great-aunts.
When Amendola was a kid, Bait &amp; Tackle was still a bait and tackle shop. Back then, in the late 1990s, Amendola and his father used to break through a fence, on to the shore that is now home to the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal, and go crabbing. All they needed was a net and the huge blue claws were theirs for the taking. The silhouette of lower Manhattan shone just a mile away but there was nobody else by the water.
Amendola was 13 years old when he saw Barry O’Meara for the first time. The teen had sneaked over to his window to smoke a cigarette when he saw a white guy, back then a rare sight on Van Brunt Street, walking by below.
He didn’t know the guy, so he shouted: “Go home, yuppie!”
O’Meara, a fourth-generation bartender, was hardly a yuppie. He had grown up in a small Irish village where his great-grandfather had a bar. He had served his first drink when he was eight. When he heard Amendola’s shout, he looked up and shouted back: “Andrew? I’m gonna tell your father that you’re smoking.”
Immediately, the window slammed shut.
One afternoon in November 2017, Amendola was volunteering behind the bar at a VFW veterans’ club across from his home. His girlfriend came in and took a seat. Amendola fixed her a bloody mary, went to the other end of the bar, and made a quick phone call.
“What did the guy want?” Amendola’s girlfriend asked.
“He wanted to offer $2.8m for the building. I said no, we’re not getting rid of it.”
Amendola gets calls from real estate developers and private equity firms on a regular basis. When his great-aunt Sue Amendola died last fall, the calls got even more frequent.
“These people are predatory,” Amendola said.
He witnessed the same happen after Sandy. After the market took a hit because of the storm, people came to Red Hook looking to buy. But Amendola has no intention of selling the house where he grew up. Neither $2.8m nor the threat of another hurricane are enough to make him abandon a place that holds all his memories. More than money or safety, he values that he can walk down the block and be annoyed that he has to say “hi” at least to three people.
“Like, ‘Oh, this fucking guy, I don’t want to see him right now.’ But I actually like not wanting to see them,” he said.
At 26, Amendola plans to spend the rest of his life in Red Hook, just like generations of Amendolas before him did.
Red Hook’s desirability is rising because, unlike elsewhere in Brooklyn, townhouses are still relatively affordable there. Some gentrifiers come because they want their kids to attend the local private school that opened a year after Sandy. (Next year’s tuition: $30,200.) Others come because Red Hook is different from most other parts of the city. It is quiet, like a seaside village, except you can see the Statue of Liberty. You can see the sky. You can breathe.
It’s easy to forget that people didn’t always want to live on the waterfront. In cities, the rivers used to smell. Water meant pollution and waste, and waterfronts were where the cities pushed the working class, the poor, the new immigrants. It is not a coincidence that Fifth Avenue is as far from any river as possible.
This started to change in 1972, when Congress passed the Clean Water Act and water quality across the United States started to improve. At the same time, industry was abandoning cities, leaving behind vacant parcels that eventually attracted commercial developers and wealthy new residents. Across the world, urban waterfronts have become the most desirable, expensive locations, even though water is rising.
That’s one of the many quirks of Red Hook and places like it. After more than a century of living inland, the rich – suddenly yearning to live by the water – are pushing the poor and middle class out. This migration might save longtime waterfront residents from rising waters, but it doesn’t save them from losing their homes.
On the other hand, many of the low-income residents who still live on the shore don’t have any choice but to stay. Much of New York’s public housing is concentrated by the water, in Red Hook, Coney Island, the Lower East Side, the Rockaways. Red Hook has one of the oldest and biggest public housing projects in the country. More than half of Red Hook’s 12,000 residents are tenants of the New York City Housing Authority. Without government investment in flood protection, they are in harm’s way.
Coastal megacities from London to Tokyo and Rotterdam to Shanghai have installed seawalls, storm surge barriers, super-levees and dyke-rings to keep the water out of the streets. New York has not. Americans are better at immediate disaster response than planning for the future, experts say.
In the future, there could be less and less government support for struggling working people in places like Red Hook. Flood protection, many urban planners predict, may only be available to those who can afford to pay for it themselves.
In November 2017, Andrew Amendola was decorating the vacant lot next to his house for Christmas. Mounting a nativity scene was a family tradition. The afternoon sun made the plastic angels shimmer gold, while a gust of wind blew a reindeer over.
“Go home, reindeer, you’re drunk,” Amendola said.
The lot is home to four cats. After Sandy, he was sure that they had died. But a few days after the storm, they found their way back. Unlike many people, they had evacuated.
If you asked real estate developer Chris Ward, he might say that the vacant lot is another parcel of scarce New York land being underutilized. Ward, now a senior vice-president at the global engineering giant Aecom, has a long history of working with New York’s waterfronts.
In September 2016, Ward told the Brooklyn Eagle, a local paper, that Red Hook had two options: to become populated with high-rise buildings, co-ops and condos, or to remain the “underutilized low-income, unconnected community it is today”.
Aecom had just announced a proposal to radically transform the neighborhood into a hub of gleaming skyscrapers. The plan included a subway line from Manhattan and 45,000 new apartments in high-rises.
In his 2018 State of the State address, New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, put “revitalizing” Red Hook on his agenda and called on the Port Authority to consider relocating the operations of Red Hook’s remaining port, the Red Hook Container Terminal, to Sunset Park. He also asked the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to study options to extend the subway from lower Manhattan to Red Hook, a key component of Aecom’s vision for Red Hook’s reinvention.
Robert Pincus, a climate scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, moved to Red Hook after Sandy because his rent in Carroll Gardens, on the other side of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, spiked. In Red Hook, his family could afford to rent a home. He wouldn’t buy property in Red Hook: he’s too aware of the climate risks. But he understands why Aecom and other developers have their eyes on the neighborhood.
“There are billions of dollars to be made,” Pincus said. “The developers make them in 30 or 40 years, and only then the land will flood.”
Chris Ward disagrees with this view. He sees new development as a way to build and finance flood protection in waterfront cities across the globe.
“Most cities are taking the approach that with thoughtful architectural design and engineering we can ameliorate the risk at at an acceptable level,” he told the Guardian.
Aecom is not the only company going after the neighborhood. According to the New York Times, Related Companies, a major real estate developer, is also circulating a draft plan on Red Hook’s revitalization. The plan is titled “New York’s Next Big Thing”.
On his final night at his bar, Barry O’Meara got to the bar’s tiny stage for his final speech. He had to wait a little for the crowd to quiet down and listen.
“We have made friends for life and we have made enemies for life,” O’Meara said into a microphone, with his usual flair for drama.
A slideshow of pictures ran on a screen behind him. In one photo, a sign outside Bait &amp; Tackle said “FREE HURRICANE ADVICE”. In Sandy’s aftermath, Bait &amp; Tackle became one of the central neighborhood hubs where people went for help and company.
In the years since Sandy, residents of Red Hook and New Yorkers in general have been asking themselves: what is the right thing to do after such a disaster? How do you make plans when you know that it might happen again, but you don’t know if it’s going to be next month, next year, or in three decades? It seems like the rational thing to do would be to leave the waterfront and find a new home – somewhere on higher ground, somewhere safe.
But that’s not how people choose a place to live. There are other, more immediately compelling factors to consider. What can you afford? Where feels like home? Where are your friends and family, your favorite bar, your kid’s school? Knowing your neighbors or having a perfect view of the Statue of Liberty can outweigh a far-off-seeming flood risk. It’s not easy to leave a place you love – even if the place, by virtue of its geography, promises to one day kill you.
In Bait &amp; Tackle, O’Meara’s speech was almost over. People raised their voices. First, one at a time: “We love you, Barry!” And then all together: “Barry! Barry! Barry!”
O’Meara told them to shut up. “I’m not sad,” he said, interrupting the chant. “This room has been too great and too beautiful with happiness and laughter and joy to be sad. I’ve been fucking privileged. Let’s continue the night. I love you all. Thank you.”
After the speech, the DJ put on David Bowie’s Let’s Dance.
Amendola stood next to the bar wearing a T-shirt bearing the words he once shouted to O’Meara: “Go home, yuppie!” Now, he wiped away tears.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/25/red-hook-climate-change-floodplain-hurricane-sandy-gentrification

The audit also said Erik Solheim, a former Norwegian environment minister, had “no regard for abiding by the set regulations and rules” and had claimed unjustified expenses. Now, Denmark and Sweden have frozen their funding until the audit is finalised.
Concern over Solheim’s activities is also growing in Nairobi, where the UN Environment programme (Unep) is based, with the UN staff union there calling some of the findings in the draft audit “mind blowing”. A prominent climate scientist has also criticised Solheim’s globetrotting as “obscene CO2 hypocrisy”. Solheim spent $488,518 (£371,100) in 22 months and was travelling 80% of the time, according to the audit.
Solheim said he had already paid back money for instances of oversight and made changes where other rules had been broken. On the frozen funding, first reported by Norway’s Aftenposten newspaper, he said it was “completely natural” for countries to wait for a final audit before releasing funds.
Denmark’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said it was withholding its 2018 contribution of about $1.6m to Unep. “The ministry is familiar with the criticism of Solheim’s travel activities,” an MFA spokeswoman told the Guardian. “We take this seriously. We are now awaiting the final audit report and its possible recommendations before we pay additional funds.”
Sweden’s International Development Agency (Sida) said they would not approve any new funding until all the issues raised had been resolved. “Sida takes all signals of misuse of funds very seriously,” a spokeswoman said.
Ole Jacob Sending, from the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs thinktank said he thought the freezing of funds was probably unprecedented. “There are many who don’t think Unep is functioning as it should, and that there are other means of promoting environmental issues that can be more effective,” Sending told Aftenposten. Some observers have praised Solheim for raising the profile of Unep.
A Unep spokesman said: “We do not comment on the contributions of individual member states. However, UN Environment takes great pride in its reputation as both an environmental authority and trusted steward to our donors. As always, we remain in close consultation with every member state to ensure concerns are urgently addressed and resolved.”
UN staff appear increasingly unhappy with Solheim’s leadership, claiming it is damaging Unep. A statement on Monday issued by Martin Njuhigu, president of the UN staff union in Nairobi, said: “The Union is deeply concerned ... Some items mentioned in the report are mind blowing. They require serious attention.”
Prof Kevin Anderson, a climate scientist at the University of Manchester, UK, said deep and immediate cuts in global carbon emissions are needed to tackle climate change: “Despite this, there’s a cohort of climate glitterati for whom climate change is less a scientific and moral imperative, and more a vehicle for their own prosperity and prestige.”
The draft audit, leaked to the Guardian, was compiled by the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) and said Solheim’s extensive travel was “contrary to the ethos of carbon emission reduction” and was a “reputation risk to the organization”. It will be finalised after responses from the individuals named.
Solheim said on Friday that he could not comment in detail on the audit until it was completed and published: “If any other mistakes are found, we will immediately correct them.” He said there was “excessive bureaucracy in the UN system” and that travelling was essential to his job: “Making good on our global agenda demands engagement with the world.”

Satellite photos taken in 2018 of locations in China reveal cooling towers and new buildings that were not present a year earlier at plants that were meant to stop operations or be postponed by orders from Beijing.
The projects are part of an “approaching tsunami” of coal plants that would boost China’s existing coal capacity by 25%, according to the research group Coalswarm.
The total capacity of the planned coal power stations is about 259GW, bigger than the American coal fleet and “wildly out of line” with the Paris climate agreement, the group said in a new report.
“This new evidence that China’s central government hasn’t been able to stop the runaway coal-fired power plant building is alarming – the planet can’t tolerate another US-sized block of plants to be built,” said Ted Nace, executive director of CoalSwarm, which is funded by international green groups and private donations.
Many of the power stations date back to a 2014-16 surge when the regime permitting construction was devolved from Beijing to provincial authorities. That led to a threefold increase in permits being issued between 2013 and 2015. In response, during 2016 and 2017 the Chinese government ordered projects to be slowed down, postponed or cancelled.
But satellite photos analysed by Coalswarm show many power stations have continued to be built, including the Huadian Nanxiong station in south-east China. Despite the government ordering the plant to be suspended in January 2017, two cooling towers had sprung up by March 2018.
Other photographs show water vapour emerging from cooling towers where there was none before, such as at the Zhoukou Longda power station in central China, which indicatesa plant burning coal and generating electricity.
Some plants seem to have been built but not connected to the grid, which Coalswarm said appeared to be officials using a “sleight of hand” to avoid busting the government-imposed cap on coal.
China’s current five-year plan dictates that there should be no more than 1,100GW of coal by 2020, but the 259GW increase via new plants comes on top of 993GW of existing capacity.
Coalswarm said that given China had about half the world’s coal power capacity the country’s “coal policies have an outsized effect on global climate prospects”. The group called on China to act quickly to cancel the projects.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/26/satellite-images-show-runaway-expansion-of-coal-power-in-china

Alternatives there are few. Solar energy is limited to daylight hours and these vary wildly in many countries, the same is true of wind. Mass storage systems using rare earth metals and plastics present as great a long term environmental threat and hazard as do fossil fuels.
And ending fossil fuel use in wealthier economies drops the commodity price as demand falls below supply increasing the attractiveness of (now) lower fossil fuel prices to developing economies. And what right do we have to press these struggling economies to slow growth and development for not return?
Ending fossil fuel use will reduce specific pollutions, it will end dependency on oil producers of all political and religious hues and it will deliver great opportunity to those economies able to afford to participate, IF and only IF it is cost competitive with fossil fuels whose prices will fall rapidly along with demand from wealthier nations. 
Wind and solar are not panaceas. They are very costly and will remain so as the infrastructure of metals and plastics needs service, repair and replacement on land and at sea. Both provide variable levels of supply and fossil fuel backups cannot realistically be retained and turned on and off as needed to allow an economy both Labour and the Tories want to undertake manufacture, would be paying sky-high electricity prices to provide that manufacture.
In our business raw materials once regularly purchased from Germany are now four times more expensive than the UA/Canadian equivalents because Germanies green energy costs are unsustainably high. Insanely (but sensibly) many German manufacturers of these products now manufacture in South Americas where lower energy and labour costs allow manufacture of materials at prices German (and EU) customers will pay.
Jobs exported, fossil fuel energy used, goods sent back to the EU at competitive prices. Is this what Germany wanted when it turned to Russian Federation gas and green energy for most of its needs?
Nuclear is not a viable option due to its huge costs and the problems of dealing, long term, with waste in use and after decommissioning. Nuclear fuel dump? Not in my back yard matey. Fracking may be unpopular in some quarters, nuclear fuel spent or otherwise will raise far greater public ire.

But you also have to set the allowance at the appropriate level to actually be worthwhile. And the wailing and gnashing of teeth at the difference between current consumption levels and the sustainable level is the issue.
For instance, if we take oil, a quick Google suggests that most (80%) of oil was thought to be formed before the Cenozoic (65 million years ago). And that there might be 2,000 billion barrels of reserves remaining worldwide. And that oil consumption worldwide is about 30 billion barrels a year. You might quibble on any of these figures, but we can still play with them to get a ballpark idea.
If we conservatively say that all oil is only 65 million years old, then the current reserves were formed at a rate of roughly 30,000 barrels per year (2,000 billion/65 million). One way of classifying sustainable use would be to use oil only at the rate it is produced. That would have to see our current usage drop by a factor of a million, from 30 billion barrels a year to 30 thousand.
Now, you might say that we've maybe already used half the reserves, so we should double that calculated natural production rate, or say that there are far greater reserves. Or maybe that my definition of sustainable is far too extreme.
But it's maybe a useful starting to start getting one's head around the magnitude. However you guesstimate the figures, we're not going to reduce that factor of a million to, say, a factor of two.

The assumption that electric cars are green. Forgoing the issues with Lithium mining, batteries in cars are simply capacitors. They do not convert energy in to a usable form but store electrical energy to be converted in to kinetic energy by the motors on the axles / wheels of a vehicle. So, we must review the source electricity which is used to charge the batteries. As it stands, most of our grid is supplied by coal. Significant work has been done in reducing the emissions from power plants such as Drax. In direct comparison to the internal combustion engine, the power produced by Drax is cleaner and more efficient. The control of NOx, reduction in acid gases, heavy metals, Mercury etc is far more effective in this large scale, with superior technology. The Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) is at least 40 years behind current available technologies. A super critical boiler such as Drax will provide a 40% conversion of the chemical energy stored within the fuel into electrical energy (losses include efficiency of combustion, heat loss through the boiler, mechanical loss over generator). An ICE will be at 30%. On first glance, this would deem electric cars superior. 
There are, however a few issues with this methodology. The current demand on the grid already surpasses our capabilities to supply and electricity is imported from mainland Europe. Secondly is the push for new technologies. In Formula one, the ICE engine efficiency has been pushed to 70%, well beyond what any power generation by the form of steam production can achieve. This technology is starting to take effect, driven by high performance super cars and being fed down in to standard hybrid cars. We need to move away from fossil fuel combustion across the board, electric cars allow for fossil fuels to continue as a source, as long as people can’t directly see the result of said combustion.
There are alternatives to these fuels, but sadly much of the research and development is being subdued and supressed by oil companies, which have far too much influence over public knowledge and opinion. The fact that Shell have direct control over the British Science museum is frightening. Politicians, as a rule, do not seem to have the best interest of people in their hearts. Even if they have some content of character, decisions are made on successful re-election in less than 5 years than a long term plan for developing and providing changes on industrial scale.
It is the duty of news sources, such as this one, to link with scientific institutes and provide enough information to the public to make an informed decision. Only with education can we move forward. I understand this is an opinion piece, but without the correct information it merely dilutes the argument and allows the status quo to remain.

The acquisition of goods is a relatively small component, so while environmentalists laud things like energy saving light bulbs, which do reduce energy use, in practice the effect is trivial compared to the level of energy you need to cut from your daily consumption to really have an impact. 
So if you want to cut fossil fuel use yourself by enough to make a difference you have to rewind the way of living back to the 1920s. Turn off your central heating and heat just one room. If it's cold add clothes and sit under blankets, or better still go down the pub so as to share heat with others. Heating a whole house for just one person is massively energy wasteful. 
Secondly, stop travelling except under your own power - not even by train, as then the number of train services can be cut. That means you have to live where you work or study. Don't commute. Don't take holidays overseas. Fashion, jewellery, cosmetics are all energy wasteful and can be cut (the Guardian could take a lead by closing its travel and style sections). Buy local, but not just by distance but also what grows best locally and is in season - turnips rather than tomatoes. So going localist rather than globalist.
You also have to realise that growth in GDP in the first world is mostly growth in services (80%+ of the economy) - the effect of growth essentially comes from increased productivity - producing more with less labour, with the benefit of things like a health service or education as an outcome - the wealthy buy comfort, holidays, wellness, schooling, culture, information and entertainment - 'things' are proportionally smaller parts of their budget that someone really poor.

Compromise is the key; we need hybrid ideas not idealistic utopias. Hybrid cars have the benefit of internal combustion for long journeys and could be automatically switched to electric by smart city networks. Transition to electric technology requires us to accept that nuclear power is necessary; these are the real choices.
It is also interesting to think about the effect our monetary system has on overall consumption. Fractional reserve banking has many benefits in terms of enabling economic activity but in its current form the reserve ratio is set such that growth in consumption is absolutely necessary to prevent a deflationary collapse.

BQEND
'All we have to do is share' is doing a hell of a lot of work in the sentence. I agree with you. But how do you make this happen, in practical terms?
Like it or loathe it (and personally I'm not a fan), capitalism is the system we live in. Capitalism requires continual profitable opportunities for investment for it to continue to exist. The gives it an inherently expansionary character- something on which both Adam Smith and Karl Marx agree.
Capitalism is also inherently unequal, since it depends upon the accumulation of capital by capitalists.
Now, clearly you can have more or less unequal forms of capitalism and the one we have now is extreme in this regard, but even in less unequal phases (such as the post WWII decades) it still meant a huge difference between the poorest and richest. This is a structural feature of capitalism- if you don't have capitalists controlling vast amounts of capital then it's not capitalism. 
So again, any fundamentally more fair distribution of resources (as opposed to tinkering at the edges), and any state of zero growth, requires an end to capitalism. Not in one country- everywhere. How do you propose to make this happen? Words about how we ought to share more aren't going to cut it. Any proposal needs to explain how it will face down every substantial political and economic interest in the world whose fate is bound up with the capitalist system (ie all of them).

It absolutely definitely certainly is NOT. It is not building ANY!
There is one proposed lignite palnt, which will never be approved. There is one coal power plant in construction, Dateln, which has been stuck nearly done for years. It may or may not switch on.
Germany has closed coal power plants too.

A fraction of one wind farm subsidy would have also allowed for better scrubbing and carbon capture at them also.
BQEND
do you have any evidence?
Scrubbing is expensive because it is difficult- sulphur emissions are relatively easy [a slurry of limestone is poured into rising exhaust - that goes to make plaster board btw- other emissions are expensive. Aberthaw in S.Wales had a retrofit system where the gases were passed through sea water to lock away emissions - it cost a fortune and still does not meet full standards.
CCS- carbon capture and storage is multiple problems- the most efficient method is oxyburn- the powerplant uses 25% of electricity production to make oxygen from the air- it then burns the oxygen and coal to produce a pure stream of CO2 and water- the water needs removing, the CO2 then requires energy to compress and then be piped to an old gas field.
None of this is cheap and the infrastructure to pump and store CO2 does not exist- and coal power costing 25% more just cannot compete with wind or even solar.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1537964829000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'it is difficult- sulphur emissions are relatively easy', u'effect': u'scrubbing is expensive poured'}], u'author_id': u'4738374', u'in_reply_to': u'120873102', u'id': u'120873865', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'TheWatchingPlace', u'text': u'BQSTART

We’re making the transition towards an all-electric future. We can now leave fossil fuels in the ground and thwart climate breakdown. Or so you might imagine, if you follow the technology news.
So how come oil production, for the first time in history, is about to hit 100m barrels a day? How come the oil industry expects demand to climb until the 2030s? How is it that in Germany, whose energy transition (Energiewende) was supposed to be a model for the world, protesters are being beaten up by police as they try to defend the 12,000-year-old Hambacher forest from an opencast mine extracting lignite – the dirtiest form of coal? Why have investments in Canadian tar sands – the dirtiest source of oil – doubled in a year?
The answer is, growth. There may be more electric vehicles on the world’s roads, but there are also more internal combustion engines. There be more bicycles, but there are also more planes. It doesn’t matter how many good things we do: preventing climate breakdown means ceasing to do bad things. Given that economic growth, in nations that are already rich enough to meet the needs of all, requires an increase in pointless consumption, it is hard to see how it can ever be decoupled from the assault on the living planet.
When a low-carbon industry expands within a growing economy, the money it generates stimulates high-carbon industry. Anyone who works in this field knows environmental entrepreneurs, eco-consultants and green business managers who use their earnings to pay for holidays in distant parts of the world and the flights required to get there. Electric vehicles have driven a new resource rush, particularly for lithium, that is already polluting rivers and trashing precious wild places. Clean growth is as much of an oxymoron as clean coal. But making this obvious statement in public life is treated as political suicide.
The Labour party’s new environment policy, published this week, rightly argues that “our current economic model is threatening the foundations on which human wellbeing depends”. It recognises that ecological collapse cannot be prevented through consumer choice or corporate social responsibility: the response to our greatest predicament must be determined by scientific research, and planned, coordinated and led by government. It pledges “to meet the Paris agreement goal of limiting global temperature rises to no more than 1.5C”. But, like almost everyone else, it ignores the fundamental problem. Beyond a certain point, economic growth – the force that lifted people out of poverty, and cured deprivation, squalor and disease – tips us back into those conditions. To judge by the devastation climate breakdown is wreaking, we appear already to have reached this point.
The contradiction is most obvious when the policy document discusses airports (an issue on which the party is divided). Labour guarantees that any airport expansion must adhere to its tests on climate change. But airport expansion is incompatible with its climate commitments. Even if aircraft emissions are capped at 2005 levels, by 2050 they will account for half the nation’s carbon budget if the UK is not to contribute to more than 1.5C of global warming. If airports grow, they will swallow even more of the budget.
Airport expansion is highly regressive, offending the principles of justice and equity that Labour exists to uphold. Regardless of the availability and cost of flights, they are used disproportionately by the rich, as these are the people with the business meetings in New York, the second homes in Tuscany, and the money to pay for winter holidays in the sun. Yet the impacts – noise, pollution and climate breakdown – are visited disproportionately on the poor.
I recognise that challenging our least contested ideologies – growth and consumerism – is a tough call. But in New Zealand, it is beginning to happen. Jacinda Ardern, the Labour prime minister, says: “It will no longer be good enough to say a policy is successful because it increases GDP if it also degrades the physical environment.” How this translates into policy, and whether her party will resolve its own contradictions, remains to be determined.
No politician can act without support. If we want political parties to address these issues, we too must start addressing them. We cannot rely on the media to do it for us. A report by the research group Media Matters found that total coverage of climate change across five US news networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox and PBS) amounted to 260 minutes in 2017 – a little over four hours. Almost all of it was a facet of the Trump psychodrama (Will he pull out of the Paris accord? What’s he gone and done this time?) rather than the treatment of climate chaos in its own right. There was scarcely a mention of the link between climate breakdown and the multiple unnatural disasters the US suffered that year; of new findings in climate science; or of the impacts of new pipelines or coalmines. I cannot find a comparable recent study in the UK. I suspect it is a little better, but not a lot.
The worst denial is not the claim that this existential crisis isn’t happening. It is the failure to talk about it at all. Not talking about our greatest predicament, even as it starts to bite, requires a constant and determined effort. Taken as a whole (of course there are exceptions), the media are a threat to humanity. They claim to speak on our behalf, but they either speak against us or do not speak at all.
So what do we do? We talk. As the climate writer Joe Romm argued in ThinkProgress this year, a crucial factor in the remarkable shift in attitudes towards LGBT people was the determination of activists to break the silence. They overcame social embarrassment to broach issues that other people found uncomfortable. We need, Romm argues, to do the same for climate breakdown. A recent survey suggests that 65% of Americans rarely or never discuss it with friends or family, while only one in five hear people they know mention the subject at least once a month. Like the media, we subconsciously invest great psychological effort into not discussing an issue that threatens almost every aspect of our lives.
Let’s be embarrassing. Let’s break the silence, however uncomfortable it makes us and others feel. Let’s talk about the great unmentionables: not just climate breakdown, but also growth and consumerism. Let’s create the political space in which well-intentioned parties can act. Let us talk a better world into being.

A massive, immediate transformation in the way the world’s population generates energy, uses transportation and grows food will be required to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5C and the forthcoming analysis is set to lay bare how remote this possibility is.
“It’s extraordinarily challenging to get to the 1.5C target and we are nowhere near on track to doing that,” said Drew Shindell, a Duke University climate scientist and a co-author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, which will be unveiled in South Korea next month.
“While it’s technically possible, it’s extremely improbable, absent a real sea change in the way we evaluate risk. We are nowhere near that.”
In the 2015 Paris climate pact, international leaders agreed to curb the global temperature rise to 2C above the era prior to mass industrialization, with an aspiration to limit this to 1.5C. The world has already warmed by around 1C over the past century, fueling sea level rises, heatwaves, storms and the decline of vulnerable ecosystems such as coral reefs.
Shindell would not share exact details of the IPCC report, but he said that the more ambitious 1.5C goal would require a precipitous drop in greenhouse emissions triggered by a rapid phaseout of fossil fuels, particularly coal, mass deployment of solar and wind energy and the eradication of emissions from cars, trucks and airplanes.
Even then, emerging technology will be required on a global scale to capture emissions at the source and bury them in the ground or remove carbon directly from the air.
“The penetration rate of new technology historically takes a long time,” Shindell said. “It’s not simple to change these things. There aren’t good examples in history of such rapid, far-reaching transitions.”
The fading prospect of keeping the global temperature rise to below 1.5C has provoked alarm among leaders of low-lying island nations that risk being inundated should the world warm beyond this point.
“Every country must increase the ambition of their existing targets,” said Hilda Heine, president of the Marshall Islands, which announced a plan to reach net zero emissions by 2050 at the UN general assembly in New York this week. “If we can do it, so can everyone else.”
The UN general assembly has again pitted the world’s countries against Donald Trump when it comes to climate change, with the US president using his keynote speech to praise “clean coal”. Trump has vowed to exit the Paris accord, a stance that Emmanuel Macron, the French president, told the UN should be met with consequences such as a refusal by countries to enter into trade deals with the US.
“It’s a lot more difficult without the US as a leader in climate change negotiations,” Ola Elvestuen, Norway’s environment minister, told the Guardian. “We have to find solutions even though the US isn’t there.”
Elvestuen said countries, including Norway, which is one of the world’s largest oil and gas producers, need to transition away from fossil fuels, embrace electric cars and halt deforestation.
He admitted these changes had not happened quickly enough since the Paris deal. Last year, global greenhouse gas emissions rose slightly again after a short period of stasis.
“We are moving way too slowly,” Elvestuen said. “We have to do more of everything, faster. We need to deliver on policies at every level. Governments normally move slowly but we don’t have the time.”
“The 1.5C target is difficult, but it’s possible. The next four to 12 years are crucial ones, where we will set the path to how the world will develop in the decades ahead. The responsibility in doing this is impossible to overestimate. To reach the goals of the Paris agreement we need large structural changes.”
A difference of 0.5C in temperature may appear small but the IPCC report, which is a summary of leading climate science, is expected to warn there will be major impacts if warming reaches 2C.
“Even 1.5C is no picnic, really,” said Dr Tabea Lissner, head of adaptation and vulnerability at Climate Analytics.
Lissner said a world beyond 1.5C warming meant the Arctic would be ice-free in summer, around half of land-based creatures would be severely affected and deadly heatwaves would become far more common. “0.5C makes quite a big difference,” she said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/26/global-warming-climate-change-targets-un-report

This simple realisation prompted Greta Thunberg, 15, to protest in the most effective way she knew. She is on strike, refusing to go to school until Sweden’s general election on 9 September to draw attention to the climate crisis.
Her protest has captured the imagination of a country that has been struck by heatwaves and wildfires in its hottest summer since records began 262 years ago.
Every day for two weeks, Thunberg has been sitting quietly on the cobblestones outside parliament in central Stockholm, handing out leaflets that declare: “I am doing this because you adults are shitting on my future.”
Thunberg herself is a diminutive girl with pigtails and a fleeting smile – not the stereotypical leader of a climate revolution.
“I am doing this because nobody else is doing anything. It is my moral responsibility to do what I can,” she says. “I want the politicians to prioritise the climate question, focus on the climate and treat it like a crisis.”
When people tell her she should be at school, she points to the textbooks in her satchel.
“I have my books here,” she says in flawless English. “But also I am thinking: what am I missing? What am I going to learn in school? Facts don’t matter any more, politicians aren’t listening to the scientists, so why should I learn?”
Thunberg’s protest might come as a surprise to anyone seduced by Sweden’s reputation as a climate pioneer and champion of the environment. This year the country enacted “the most ambitious climate law in the world”, aiming to become carbon neutral by 2045 and comfortably beating the 2015 Paris climate targets along the way.
“This is too little too late, it needs to come much faster,” Thunberg says. “Sweden is not a green paradise, it has one of the biggest carbon footprints.”
Her parents want her to give up her protest and go back to school. “My teachers are divided,” Thunberg says. “As people they think what I am doing is good, but as teachers they say I should stop.”
One teacher to have downed tools to join her protest is Benjamin Wagner, 26. He expects to lose three weeks’ wages – and his job – as a result of his strike.
“Our inability to stop climate change is like the efforts to stop world war one – we knew for years it was coming, they arranged all sorts of conferences, but still they didn’t prevent it,” Wagner says.
“Greta is a troublemaker, she is not listening to adults. But we are heading full speed for a catastrophe, and in this situation the only reasonable thing is to be unreasonable.”
There are signs that more Swedes are listening. The Green party, a partner in the centre-left coalition government, was languishing in the polls before the country was hit by more than 60 forest fires, which raged for weeks through a rural tinderbox created by the unprecedented drought. Now the party’s support is up by half to about 6%.
“I am very impressed by Greta’s courage and determination,” says Janine Alm Ericson, a Green member of parliament.
“But I am also sad that she feels she has to be there – the political parties in Sweden have not done enough. Thanks to the hot summer it has become easier for people to imagine what climate change can mean for us and others in Europe if we continue to ignore what is happening.”
Outside parliament, Stella d’Ailly, 45, an art director, has come to join Thunberg’s protest.
“I feel like I am dying inside if I don’t protest,” she says. “Sweden may be well organised to recycle our trash, for example, but we do nothing to cut the amount of plastic bottles and packaging in the first place. We need drastic change.”
Thunberg’s own awakening to the climate crisis a few years ago caused upheaval in her family. Her mother, the well known opera singer Malena Ernman, has given up her international career because of the climate effects of aviation.
“Greta forced us to change our lives,” says her father Svante. “I didn’t have a clue about the climate. We started looking into it, reading all the books – she has read them too.”
Her teachers were telling her to turn off the lights and save paper, then flying off to New York for a holiday. For Greta, this was just not good enough: “Everyone believes that we can solve the crisis without effort, without sacrifice,” she wrote in an article widely circulated on social media and translated into English.
While on strike, she has done a lot of homework and read three books, her father says.
“She is supposed to be in school, we cannot support her action. But we respect that she wants to make a stand. She can either sit at home and be really unhappy, or protest and be happy.”
Greta has Asperger’s syndrome, which in the past has affected her health, he says. She sees her condition not as a disability but as a gift which has helped open her eyes to the climate crisis.
“The best thing about my protest has been to see how more and more people have been coming and getting involved,” Greta says.

Canavan unleashes flood of hate on avo-munching, anti-dam hipsters
A report touting the benefits of building dams in Northern Australia says anything but, despite the efforts of Matt Canavan to spin it.
Bernard KeaneSep 04, 2018
What do you do when you’re the Minister for Northern Australia, your government’s landmark “Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility” is known only for its failure to fund any infrastructure, and one of the nation’s pre-eminent research organisations releases reports showing how uneconomic building new infrastructure in remote locations is? 
If you’re Matt Canavan, attack inner-city avocado eaters.
Last week, the CSIRO released its Northern Australia Water Resource Assessment, three reports looking at the Mitchell catchment in far north Queensland, the Fitzroy catchment in Western Australia and the Darwin catchment in the Northern Territory. The reports were spun by Canavan and his party leader, paving the way for major new dam investment.
“Investing in dams is one of the key ways we can make our country more resilient from drought,” Canavan said. “If we had had the Pinnacles dam there right now, they would be growing sorghum cotton seed and molasses that could be trucked to these drought-affected areas in Queensland to provide relief.” He added “these reports have been conducted by the pre-eminent scientific body in our country, the CSIRO”. His party leader, who is also infrastructure minister, joined in on “the potential for 387,000ha of crops such as cotton and sugarcane”.
Canavan decided to go further, anticipating critics of dam-building. “They will pontificate from the salons of West End about the evils of irrigated agriculture in between mouthfuls of smashed avocado … they know nothing about farming, even though they still want to eat the best produce all year round.” The Courier-Mail — which referred to a dam producing “$720,000 million in farm produce”, more than 10 times the actual entire Australian agricultural output — described this as “challenging hippies”, yet again demonstrating News Corp editors are old white men whose frame of cultural reference was frozen in 1978.
But you’ll never pick it: the CSIRO reports actually detail how frighteningly uneconomic building dams in northern Australia are. Take its conclusions in the Mitchell catchment report: “Viable new irrigation development in the Mitchell catchment would require challenging combinations of low-cost infrastructure, high-productivity farms, management of a wide range of risks, and/or off-farm value adding.” The CSIRO warns of “the systematic tendency of proponents of large infrastructure projects to substantially under estimate development costs” and concludes “even when technically feasible options are found, many of these are unlikely to be profitable at the returns and over time periods expected by many investors. The results presented below suggest that development costs above $15,000/ha (plus $7424/ha farm setup costs) would be difficult to cover from farm gate revenues alone.” You could add other uses, such as food and fibre processing, to the mix but that would also increase risk along with potentially increasing revenue.
The CSIRO goes on to note “scheme development costs for the most promising potential dam sites in this Assessment were estimated at about $20,000/ha to $30,000/ha”.
It’s a similar story for the Fitzroy catchment. So similar, the CSIRO cut and pasted pretty much the entire economic analysis. “Viable new irrigation development in the Fitzroy catchment would require challenging combinations of low-cost infrastructure, high-productivity farms, management of a wide range of risks, and/or off-farm value adding.” Ditto the Darwin catchment. “Viable new irrigation development in the Darwin catchments would require challenging combinations of low-cost infrastructure, high-productivity farms, management of a wide range of risks, and/or off-farm value adding” although the numbers there were a little different: “scheme development costs for the most promising potential dam sites in this Assessment were estimated at about $18,000/ha to $25,000/ha.”
But it was the same conclusion for all three catchments: “On this basis, farm gate revenues alone would fall short of reaching a 7% return on capital invested.” And all that’s assuming construction and operational costs don’t blow out.

So utterly bereft of reason on the issue and so completely consumed by climate change denial the government is now at the point where even the pretence of doing something to reduce emissions is viewed with distrust.
Perhaps somewhat surprisingly I have a degree of sympathy for members of the public who are climate change deniers. I have this sympathy because I was once one of them. 
I don’t mean I was a climate change denier in the sense of believing it all was some gigantic hoax perpetrated by the deep state and the UN. I mean denying in the sense of doing my level best to deny it was happening. 
Because it scared the bejeezus out of me. 
In the late 1980s and early 1990s when I was finishing high school and studying at university I was of course well aware of climate change. As a politically engaged, super-serious youth who listened to Midnight Oil and U2 and read every newspaper and news magazine I could afford, I was across all the news about the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions. 
And it didn’t sound good. 
So subconsciously I wanted to ignore it. I would read articles spelling out the dire future ahead and would spend the rest of the day in a depressed funk, because the problem with facing up to the reality of climate change is to face up to the fact that your life thus far has played a role. Your preference for driving a car, the aerosol sprays you used, the food you consumed, or heck, the generation of the electricity you depend upon had all contributed to producing greenhouse gases. 
It is real, it is happening, it is getting worse and we need to act
It brought with it a level of guilt my 18-year-old self could do without, and even worse, a fear of having to change my lifestyle that I didn’t want to face.
And so I would hold on to anything that would suggest it was not so bad. I would cling to those who suggested that each individual couldn’t really make much of a difference (so I can keep those lights switched on). I would inwardly cheer when a friend would (wrongly) suggest he’d read that it was all due to natural factors and things would balance out; or when another would (wrongly) say he’d heard that ironically the hole in the ozone layer apparently cancelled out the impact of global warming, or yet another who would (also wrongly) assert that the changes would in reality be so small that we wouldn’t notice it.
And if all else failed I just sighed and thought, well, the impact was likely to happen only by around 2050 or so, and in 1990 to an 18-year-old that meant there was ample time and opportunity for something to get done. Surely a fix would occur – we always end up finding a fix. 
And yet ... and yet. I knew I was burying my head in the sand. I was not so much denying the science as wanting to deny reality. The more I read the less able I was to do so. But even now I still get a faint glimmer of hope when I read some dumb article suggesting some research has found evidence that it’s all fine. 
Because I don’t want climate change to be a real thing. I would love it to all be a hoax. 
But it is not. 
And so I understand why people choose to believe those who say climate change is not the issue, that the issue is power prices and thus we need to fire up the coal furnaces. 
Denial is a very easy way out of guilt that your lifestyle is leaving your children and grandchildren an awful legacy. Denial is a good way to throw away concerns that you might have to actually wear a cost – either through lifestyle changes or monetary loss. 
It is a scary thing to hear talk of the impacts of climate change and the suggestions that it might be too late to do anything. It is so much easier to live in denial, especially when you have charlatans in the media and politics who have seen this fear and have sought to profit from it. 
So I have some sympathy for those who feel overwhelmed by it all. 
But I have none for those in the media and politics who seek to profit from this fear. 
There is no excuse for those trying to lull people into believing it is all a great scam, that there is nothing to worry about, or no need for concern, or that little can or should be done. 
According to Nasa, of the 1,663 months since January 1880, the top 100 for temperature anomaly have all occurred since 1990, and every month since December 2014 is in the top 100. 
2018 is on track to be the third-hottest year behind 2016 and 2017; fourth is 2015. 
It is real, it is happening, it is getting worse and we need to act.
And yet this week Taylor gave a speech that made zero mention of wind power – the main renewable energy in Australia – and in which he declared he wasn’t sceptical of climate change, just of subsidies for renewable energy, the Gillard government’s emissions trading scheme and of “excessive renewable energy targets.” This is despite that fact that renewable energy not only reduces our emissions, it also provides cheaper electricity.
It’s a bit like the health minister saying she is not an anti-vaxxer, she is just sceptical of the merits of the National Immunisation Program.
But don’t worry, it’s unlikely the Morrison government will withdraw from the Paris agreement, because, why bother? It just won’t do anything to actually ensure our emissions targets are achieved. Rather than risk offending those lunatics in his party who would rather destroy a prime ministership than have a policy with even a slight reference to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, Morrison appears to have decided to do nothing. 
The costs of responding to climate change increase, the longer it is put off by those whose wilful ignorance sees them continue to proffer policy based on the premise that climate change is fake.
We have gone from a government under Malcolm Turnbull that at least tried to look like it was aiming to reduce emissions (even if it wasn’t) to one under Scott Morrison that is making no pretence about the fact it is beholden to the charlatans in the party who want to scam votes by lying about the facts of climate change.
And a political party that refuses to act on climate change is not fit to govern.

Controversial.
Animals and plants form the biomass. To substantiae your claim tyou'd have to plot the mass of each species over time, show their CO2/methane emissions per kilo of biomass relative to other species (obviously you can't compare a termite to a cow) in order to show what effect a certain species is having on the atmosphere. 
To demonstrate an overall negative effect though, you would have to show the ancillary impact or lack of it on the environment generally. To give you an example. Wolves eat meat, emit CO2 and fart. On the face of it - climate changing species. But the Yellowstone experiment shows that wolves have had the effect of increasing the overall biomass. 
Even something as simple as a cow - the way we farm them look like ecological disasters. But let them loose in fields, and their gut bacteria have an overwhelming positive impact on the soil, increasing the biomass in the soil itself. 
So to make your argument that animals cause climate change (I assume in a negative sense), you would have to make a fairly sophisticated argument.

Ms Cato, if reduction of CO2 emissions is an absolute priority, and allowing CO2 levels to continue is the ultimate danger, why does the Green Party oppose the use of civil nuclear power.
Is it:
a. Because nuclear power is more of a threat than CO2?b. Because the purpose of the climate scare is to dominate the democratic process while espousing anti-capitalist policies?c. Because greenery grew from CND and can't let go?

Don’t debate with them | Molly Scott Cato,article,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/03/far-right-climate-change-deniers-debate-ukip-emp-report-eu,0,"After a long, hot summer beset by record temperatures, drought and deadly fires, imagine my shock, on returning to the European parliament, to be confronted with a report that denies the reality of climate change. Given it could influence the allocation of the next round of environment funding under the EU’s Life programme, it is deeply disturbing to see such a report, based on wholly discredited science, wending its way down the corridors of Brussels.
Some of the claims made by the report’s author, the Ukip MEP Stuart Agnew, are, frankly, pretty hair-raising. For instance, he claims that the effect of CO2 levels on our climate is “negligible”, and that it is “one of agriculture’s greatest friends”. Agnew claims there is a lack of concentration of CO2 and as a result there is no problem for the EU to solve.
So how could it be that someone with a track record of shameful ignorance of the science of climate change ends up being assigned the task of compiling this report?
Unbelievably, the decision to appoint Agnew was met with support from Christian Democrat, Conservative and Liberal members of the European parliament’s agriculture committee, while the Socialists and Democrats, supported by the Greens, attempted to challenge the decision to give Agnew the leading role.
Quite rightly, in response to this news, climate experts have reacted with disbelief and anger. Bob Ward, from the Grantham Research Institute on climate change and environment at the London School of Economics, said: “There is not a single scientific institution in the world that would agree with this daft assessment. This document demonstrates how Ukip’s climate change denial is putting at risk the lives and livelihoods of people in the UK and across the European Union.” Dave Reay, professor of carbon management at the University of Edinburgh, also ridiculed the report: “The hackneyed, pseudo-scientific arguments here would make the dinosaurs blush. This will be a wonderful resource when [my students] discuss the ill-informed ideas that bounce around the echo chamber of climate change denial.”
What this fiasco reveals is the huge threat to rational climate action posed by the rise of the far right. It also shows the risks from Brexit, as the links between climate denial and Brexit are well documented. For example,the long-standing supporter of Brexit and arch-neoliberal Nigel Lawson founded the Global Warming Policy Foundation to oppose climate change mitigation policies. He labelled the Kyoto protocol “wrongheaded”, and has called for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to be shut down.
Lawson may be considered an irrelevant dinosaur, though he still manages to platform his nonsense at regular intervals on the BBC. But the man who Conservative MP Anna Soubry declared was now running the country, the hardline Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, has blamed high energy prices on “climate alarmism” and has said it was unrealistic for scientists to project future climate changes, just as it was difficult for meteorologists to correctly predict the weather. Meanwhile, Nigel Farage, adding to a litany of ill-informed comments on climate change, earlier this year declared that the “beast from the east” was proof that global warming wasn’t real. And of course, favouring supposed “alternative facts” on climate change is a prejudice shared by other far-right groups, most notably Donald Trump’s circle.
Given the dangers posed by the far right and the very real threat of a significant bloc of populist, climate change-denying MEPs after next year’s European elections, it is time for those of us who back the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change to take back control. That is why I joined other politicians, scientists, academics and campaigners in signing a letter pledging we would refuse to debate those who deny that human-caused climate change is real. We can no longer give voice to the pseudo-science of climate change deniers; we must urgently move the debate on to how we address the causes and effects of dangerous climate breakdown.
The large right and centre-right groups in the European parliament could and should have blocked Ukip from taking charge of a report on climate change. We can only hope that the mainstream groups in parliament – right, left and centre – that are likely to continue to control the majorities will show a greater degree of responsibility in future.

It's not 'dormant' because not enough people are aware of it. It's dormant because nobody can do anything about it. Tackling climate change - which I agree is important for the survival of the planet - would require a fundamental unwinding of our direction of travel since at least the industrial revolution (unless you're a techno-fix Pollyanna). Neither is going to happen.

As the world's population increases, so too does production and consumption.
The energy required to keep 7.6+ billion people alive at the present juncture, is extracted in large part from the planet.
Any meaningful attempt to lessen our impact thereon, without resorting to violence, requires a radical shift in our relationship with materials, production and consumption. 
It is not a matter of building less and consuming less, which is the idea of the return to some sort of pre-technological era, but rather to build and consume in ways that we are not yet accustomed to.
Inevitably, this means a change to the polis, the socius, the ways in which we structure life itself. This cannot be implemented on a top-down basis alone. And it cannot be left to evolve organically from the bottom up. It must be a combination of both.

The physicality of the signs brings a different perspective.Public exposure to climate change as an issue is nearly exclusively obtained through the media. It is thus distanced from the reality of people's day to day lives, alongside advertising, entertainment, puerile jokey presenters, social media gossip, movies and all the other crap.This reduces climate change to an abstract third hand experience. Like political debate.But these signs intrude into the physical spaces of peoples lived experience. That is different. It is unexpected and makes for a thoughtful jolt, as can be seen in the turned heads of the pedestrians in the images.
The permissions required and the funding obtained came from an arts budget of the city.So officially, it is art.
But is it art? The surest guide to any contemporary art is 'The Artist's Statement'.So I went to the link in the text:https://www.climate-signals.org/Then clicked the link 'about the exhibition'. There is a brief biography of the artist and another link to locations and other information about partners of the project.But the closest to an artist statement I found was this:
Climate Signals breaks the climate silence, encouraging thought, dialogue, and action to address the greatest challenge of our time.
Well, as someone used to reading artists statements, that is a bit thin, to be kindly. Nineteen words. No contextualisation. No theoretical underpinning. No placement of the execution in the canon of art in public spaces. No discussion of genre. No hint as to why the temporality of the 'installations' might be relevant.This last point of temporality occurred to me as possibly being interesting. But it appears to be an unrelated function of the arbitrary funding period rather than any artistic intent on the part of the practitioner.It could be argued it is not even a true statement.There is no link to any reviews or critiques. I suppose I could research the project online to hunt some down. But frankly, if the artist and the august bodies that supported and funded this project can't be arsed to bother, why should I?

As an example of 'art' making a difference, I'm sure it was effective, because it cut through all of the posturing political BS, and said something which was fundamental to people. It didn't browbeat, but it really did 'make you think'. It was motivational.
By contrast, these signs seem to be telling people something which I'm pretty sure they already know. It IS heavy handed brow beating and posturing political BS of the worst kind. It's not the kind of art that people want, it's the kind of art they've come to expect.

The 10 large solar-powered signs have been placed in locations in each of New York’s five boroughs, including areas deemed particularly vulnerable to the sea level rise and powerful storms associated with climate change, including the Rockaways in Queens and the west side of Manhattan.
Messages such as “Climate change at work” and “Climate denial kills” will be displayed in English, as well as in languages commonly spoken in the areas they will be deployed, such as Spanish, Russian and French.
The signs are part of a project by the Climate Museum and a host of partners, including the New York City’s mayor’s office. The installation, called Climate Signals, has been done by Justin Brice Guariglia, an artist who regularly focuses on environmental themes in his work.
“These signs sound a warning about the climate crisis and they call us to think and act on the issue,” said Miranda Massie, director of the Climate Museum. “When you see a flashing traffic signal your initial response is that there are uncertain conditions ahead, and that is exactly what climate change is. This is the perfect medium for bringing up this alert.”
Some of the sites will include elements such as voter registration and appearances by climate scientists. Massie said the work is not overtly activist in nature, despite the unfolding agenda of Donald Trump, a native of Queens, to dismiss the science of climate change and dismantle policies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
“Anyone who is aware of the climate crisis is appalled and alarmed by the disgraceful assault by the administration on climate progress,” she said. “But this project isn’t political in a narrow sense, it’s about social and cultural action. We need a social shift to deal with climate change. It shouldn’t be a political lightning rod.”
Daniel Zarrilli, New York City’s chief resilience officer, said: “Climate change is one of New York City’s greatest challenges and requires creative approaches to educate and engage all of us about its risks and solutions. Art can play a valuable role in this effort.”
Climate Signals will be visible across New York City until 6 November",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/sep/04/climate-signals-climate-change-installation-new-york

As part of the Pacific Islands Forum, Australia was a signatory to the Boe declaration in Nauru on Wednesday which said climate change represented “the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific”.
But Australia attempted to water down the language of the declaration, other Pacific countries have said, resisting language around urgent action to cut emissions, and issued qualifications to part of the Pacific Islands Forum communique over the Paris climate agreement.
The prime minister of Tuvalu, Enele Sopoaga, said the name of the country seeking qualifications “[started] with capital A”. Australia is the only country in the PIF beginning with A.
Several sources from the PIF forum have corroborated Australia’s efforts to weaken the Boe Declaration. Vanuatu’s minister for foreign affairs Ralph Regenvanu said: “I was there, and can confirm this is true. And unfortunate.”
Asked specifically by Guardian Australia whether Australia had sought to weaken the language of the declaration, Australia’s foreign minister Marise Payne neither rejected nor confirmed the allegation.
“The communique is an agreed document of the Leaders’ Retreat. It is not appropriate to discuss the internal talks of the private Leaders’ Retreat. Pacific Island Forum leaders’ discussions are typically robust and frank and canvas a broad range of issues, including regional security, economic growth, climate change, fisheries and disaster response.”
Payne said Australia understood the centrality of the climate threat to many Pacific Islands, and “the importance that Pacific countries place on effective global action to combat climate change”.
Australia has pledged $300 million for climate change action in the Pacific between 2016 and 2020, and has also contributed $200 million to the Green Climate Fund.
Dr Bill Hare, managing director of Climate Analytics and a lead author on the IPCC fourth assessment report, told Guardian Australia that Pacific leaders were growing increasingly disenchanted with Australia’s refusal to commit to cutting carbon emissions, even as their nations faced massive economic, physical and social disruption, even existential threat.
“The leaders are not fools, and they are increasingly confronted by the problems of climate change, in all its different dimensions,” Hare said. “The problem for Australia is it doesn’t have credibility on climate. Australia is an important player for many of the Pacific Island countries, well-respected and well-liked by the populations and the political leaders, but on climate change there is a chasm opening up.
“I hear it from Pacific leaders all the time: they are fighting to save their countries and their people and they cannot understand why the Australian government leadership can’t see the problems they’ve got.”
Hare said while the language in the Boe declaration was strong, the real test for Australia would be in its actions to address its own emissions, and in helping the Pacific with adaptation.
“The actions will not match the gravity of the declaration or the gravity of the need. There is a credibility gap: Australia is not acting on reducing its own emissions. All the leaders know that whenever the prime minister or energy minister says Australia will meet its Paris targets ‘in a canter’, that that it is wrong, it is factually incorrect – it is bullshit.
“They know Australia is working to slow down action on meeting Paris targets, they know Australia is promoting coal, and they know it’s going to cause a climate catastrophe. Australia has dedicated and able diplomats across the region, but the political leadership of the government is so far removed from reality, it opens up major problems for the country.”
Pacific leaders were confronting losing large proportions of their territory, and the forcible displacement of their populations, Hare said. He said leaders did not want their next generations to grow up dislocated, living in foreign cities like Sydney and Auckland, with the attendant loss of identity, culture and self-esteem.
Support for Australia could ebb away, with Pacific Islands looking to other benefactors – in particular China – which has made massive in its aid spending and diplomatic engagement in the region. China is set to overtake Australia as the largest donor to the Pacific, after pledging US$4bn in aid to the region last year.
But climate action is acutely politically sensitive for the Australian government, having just abandoned the National Energy Guarantee - which would have mandated emissions cuts - and new prime minister Scott Morrison facing pressure from some members within his own party to abandon Australia’s Paris agreement targets.
Morrison said specific emissions reductions targets were not necessary to meet Australia’s Paris goals: “the business-as-usual model gets us there in a canter”.
That directly contradicts advice from the government’s own Energy Security Board that says business as usual will mean the electricity sector will “fall short of the emissions reduction target of 26% below 2005 levels”.
The Australian Conservation Foundation chief executive officer, Kelly O’Shanassy, said Australia’s Boe declaration commitment was welcomed but must be matched by domestic action.
“It’s not surprising that Pacific leaders have been unhappy with Australia on climate change with the Morrison government turning up at the Pacific Islands Forum with no real plan to cut our domestic pollution and without a clear indication that it intends to develop one.”
Ahead of the Pacific Islands Forum, Xavier Matsutaro, the national climate change coordinator for Palau, said Australia’s relationship with the Pacific was “dysfunctional” and akin to an abusive spouse, saying Australia was also responsible for diluting the strength of previous regional declarations on climate change.
“Australia is a bit of an anomaly, because on the floor [of climate summits] they’re basically sometimes as far right as Trump in some of their views on climate change … but then on a regional basis they’ve actually given a lot of support to our region.”
Hare said Matsutaro spoke the “real and growing truth” about Pacific sentiment towards Australia.
“It reflects a major political and diplomatic crisis in the Pacific. If Pacific leaders lose faith in Australia, then they will turn to others, and this is already becoming a major source of discussion. Pacific leaders are not naive about the strings that will come with development from China, but they are beginning to feel abandoned.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/07/australias-authority-in-pacific-being-eroded-by-refusal-to-address-climate-change

The Rise for Climate protests was spearheaded by what organizers called the largest ever climate march on the US west coast. The march, which snaked through the heart of San Francisco, came ahead of a climate change summit in the city next week that will gather mayors and business leaders from around the world.
The San Francisco march, which called for California governor Jerry Brown to end fossil fuel extraction in the state, attracted around 30,000 people, organizers said.
An array of activities, including rallies, voter registration drives and vigils, were scheduled to take place across the US, in cities such as Boston, Miami and Portland, Oregon. Events were also planned in Puerto Rico. In New Orleans, protesters planned to agitate for the halt of the Bayou Bridge pipeline, an extension of the controversial Dakota Access project that last year spurred a lengthy standoff at the Standing Rock reservation.
Hundreds of other actions took place in cities around the world, as part of a coordinated effort to counter what climate activists see as the dangerously regressive policies of Donald Trump’s administration, which has sought to dismantle rules to lower greenhouse gas emissions and has thrown open vast areas of land and water to drilling.
“Today, people across the country are rising up for climate, jobs and justice in their communities to fight back against Trump’s toxic agenda and to send a message to every politician that the time for action is now,” said Michael Brune, executive director of environment group the Sierra Club.
“Families living in the shadows of coal plants and oil refineries, losing homes and livelihoods to wildfires and extreme weather, and struggling to make a living wage are coming together because we know we don’t have time to waste.”
The activists’ ire is largely aimed at governors who though relatively progressive on climate issues, such as Brown and New York governor Andrew Cuomo, are deemed not to be ambitious enough in phasing out fossil fuels. On Thursday, several thousand people took part in a climate march in New York City. Ten activists were arrested after blocking the street in front of Cuomo’s Manhattan office.
A week of protests are planned surrounding the summit in San Francisco, with organizers hoping to draw attention to air pollution and social inequity that has tainted California’s economic growth.
“Climate change, economic inequality, the housing crisis, increased criminalization, attacks on immigrant communities – all these challenges are driven by systemic devaluation of the lives of people of color and choosing profit over people and the planet,” said Gladys Limon, executive director of the California Environmental Justice Alliance.
“We are standing up to life destructive industries, from big oil to natural gas companies, that obstruct progress toward a healthy, sustainable and just society.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/08/rise-for-climate-protests-san-francisco-new-york

The six-day meeting, which ended on Sunday, was scheduled to step up progress in the battle against rising global carbon emissions by adopting a completed text that could be presented at the COP24 conference in Katowice, Poland, three months from now.
A primary objective of the 2015 Paris agreement, to which 190 nations subscribe, is to limit the global temperature increase by 2100 to less than 2C and as close as possible to 1.5C, which is vital to the survival of island nations threatened by rising seas. But the absence of guidelines for meeting that goal has led to fears that not enough action is being taken.
There have been notable disagreements over fair financing for implementation of the rules by developing countries, and the technical details of their reporting on progress.
Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, said on Sunday at the closing press briefing for the Bangkok meeting that progress was made on most issues but nothing was finalised.
The meeting was attended by representatives of most of the countries party to the Paris agreement, as well as the United States, which has announced that it is pulling out of the pact.
Espinosa said there was “limited progress” on the issue of contributions from developed nations to developing countries, adding that she is “hopeful” that future discussions will be productive because of the importance of the issue.
“On the core issues of forward-looking climate finance and the degree of flexibility developing countries should be given on the information and reporting requirements for national commitments under the Paris Agreement, negotiators were stalemated in Bangkok,” said a statement from Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists, a US-based activist group.
“It’s now up to the incoming Polish presidency and officials leading negotiations to find ways to bridge the deep differences on these issues and to secure agreement in Katowice on a robust, comprehensive package of rules to implement the Paris Agreement,” he said.
Harjeet Singh, climate policy manager for ActionAid International, said that a vital component of the Paris agreement is for wealthy nations to provide financial assistance to developing countries as they fight natural disasters brought by climate change.
But he said wealthy and developed countries “led by the United States and including countries such as Australia, Japan and even the European Union” refused to clearly show “how much money they are going to provide and how that is going to be counted.”
Advocacy for the developing countries was led at the meeting by China, said Meyer, but was also supported by others, including India, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia.
Activists were critical of Washington’s lobbying at the meeting, especially because president Donald Trump has announced plans to have the US withdraw from the Paris pact, which had been heavily promoted by his predecessor, Barack Obama.
“The US has announced its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement but still negotiates as if it is a party, weakening international cooperation by not contributing to finance and technology transfer to developing countries,” Meena Raman, legal adviser at Third World Network, said in an emailed statement.
Climate change is a polarising issue in the United States, and some states and local communities have announced policies supporting the Paris agreement.

Hunger afflicted 821 million people last year, the third annual rise since 2015, with most regions of Africa and much of South America showing worsening signs of food shortages and malnutrition. More than half a billion of the world’s hungry live in Asia.
The reversal of progress made in slowing malnutrition in the first half of this decade has caused serious concern among international agencies. Climate shocks, such as droughts and floods, were identified by the UN as “among the key drivers” for the rise in 2017, along with conflict and economic slowdowns. Nearly 100 million people were left dependent on humanitarian aid during the year.
The UN report covers last year, and does not take account of 2018’s extreme weather which has brought heatwaves and high temperatures to much of the northern hemisphere, accompanied by droughts in some parts of the globe and floods in others. However, the changing climatic trends are likely to spell trouble for years ahead.
Robin Willoughby, head of food and climate policy at Oxfam GB, said the last few months were likely to have made the situation even worse, and called on governments to commit funds to help poor countries adapt to the effects of global warming. “The extreme weather we have seen this year is likely to have exacerbated the crisis,” he said. “A hotter world is proving to be a hungrier world.”
According to the report, there are more undernourished people in areas of the world that are highly exposed to extremes of climate. The authors note that there have been more frequent spells of extreme heat in the last five years, and that the nature of rainfall is changing in some areas, with rainy seasons starting earlier or later. Staple crops such as wheat, rice and maize are particularly at risk from climate extremes.
“It is shocking that, after a prolonged decline, this is the third consecutive year of rising hunger,” said Willoughby. “The inescapable fact is that climate change is now leaving people around the world without enough to eat.”
Adapting to climate change can be a matter of switching to less thirsty crops in some areas, and selectively breeding varieties for drought-resistance, or diversifying crops and using natural methods to make the best use of rainfall. Giving farmers access to transport to take their produce to market, and modern technology, such as weather forecasting communications, can also help.
The UN’s State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2018 report, released on Tuesday, is the joint work of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, Unicef, the World Food Programme and the World Health Organisation.
The heads of the agencies combined to warn of a worsening future, if action is not taken to help people adapt to climate change. “If we are to achieve a world without hunger and malnutrition in all its forms by 2030 [as the sustainable development goals state] it is imperative that we accelerate and scale up actions to strengthen the resilience and adaptive capacity of food systems and people’s livelihoods in response to climate variability and extremes,” they wrote in the foreword to the report.
Cindy Holleman, a senior economist at the FAO and editor of the report, said: “What is alarming about this analysis is that climate variability and climate extremes now are contributing to the rise in hunger. Not just emergency levels of hunger, but chronic hunger.
“We see this report as an early warning call that we need to accelerate and scale up climate resilience especially in countries in Africa and Latin America that are most vulnerable.”
 She added: “This is the beginning of a very serious situation. We have a target to end hunger by 2030, and we are not going to do that unless we are going to tackle new challenges and the new challenges are climate extremes and variability.”
 The analysis also showed that one in eight of the world’s adults – 672 million people – are now obese. This is increasingly regarded as a form of malnutrition associated with poverty, as poor people often lack access to good quality food.
Other effects of malnutrition noted include 151 million children under five too short for their age owing to malnutrition, a fall from the 165 million recorded in 2012, with Asia accounting for 55% of the total. One in three women of reproductive age around the world have anaemia, which can also affect the development of their children, and only 40% of babies are breastfed exclusively to six months.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/11/global-hunger-levels-rising-due-to-extreme-weather-un-warns

Please don't make up alternative facts. It was the cuts of the LNP under Newman that there was a shortage of trained drivers. The ALP had to fix up the mess.
BQEND
Your argument may have some small amount of merit except for the fact that there was a couple of years between Newman losing office and the railway extension opening which means that the lack of drivers was something that the Labor government simply ignored until it was too late. So when it comes to attributing blame I think taht its more the fault of Labor than the LNP something the sort of admit because the minister fell on his sword over it.

However, this needs to be seen in the context of the total (projected) emissions. According to data elsewhere, current total emission in Australia run at >500 million tonnes p.a. So, over 12 years out to 2030, and if they stay same roughly the same (no reason to think they'll drastically decrease), we're looking at some 6 billion tonnes total. So, our 65 million tonnes is barely 1% of that. My point is really that in spite of improvements in vehicle emissions efficiency over the years, total Australian emissions per capita have increased. This means one or more of a couple of things: we're driving more cars per capita, and/or for more miles (enough to outweigh greater efficiency/km travelled). I don't mean to assume a morally superior standpoint: I myself drive a quite old car whose fuel efficiency has dropped somewhat over 15 years or so (as I confirmed on a long trip recently).

A population of a few million human hunter-gatherers was apparently beyond the carrying capacity of the planet as most places where we showed up the megafauna disappeared.
Around 10-12,000 years ago, when large climate oscillations settled down, we developed agriculture which allowed us to double our population many times into the billions.
But agriculture faces big challenges if we don’t change our ways soon (1), as do our fisheries, and if they both decline significantly, forcing us back to being largely hunter-gatherers, history tells us that out of every 1000 people you see maybe one survives.
Except this time, during the 6th mass extinction, it won't be meat on the hoof, spearing mastodons and large, flightless birds and picking lobsters off the beach. So one in a thousand is likely wildly optimistic.

The report from the Climate Council, due to be released on Thursday, finds that Australia’s transport-related emissions have continued to rise because of policy inaction.
The nation’s move to electric vehicles has been hampered by a lack of incentives and a lack of mandatory pollution standards for vehicles, which have been implemented in almost all other OECD countries.
“We’ve been having a big national debate about electricity sector emissions,” said senior climate and energy solutions analyst Petra Stock, “but [we] really wanted to draw attention to the growing problem of greenhouse gas pollution from the transport sector.”
Calling for the government to implement a climate and transport policy plan, the report said Australia ranked behind Russia, Mexico and Indonesia on transport efficiency due to high polluting cars, high car use, a low share of trips taken by public transport, and low capital spending on public transport compared to roads.
Transport is the nation’s second largest source of greenhouse gas pollution after electricity, the report says. Transport-related greenhouse gas pollution levels increased by 3.4% in the 12 months to December 2017. Since 1990, they have increased by 62.9%, a higher rate than any other sector.
“Australia’s transport emissions or transport greenhouse gas pollution levels have been steadily rising and are projected to continue going up,” the report said.“Factors such as population growth have led to a higher number of cars on the road, while increased demand for freight is also driving up truck emissions.”
Other findings included that:
Nearly 87% of Australian commuters travel to work by car
Transport makes up 18% of all greenhouse gas pollution in Australia (electricity is the largest source at 33%)
Road-based transport pollution contributes to a greater proportion of emissions in Australian than the global average
Domestic air travel alone makes up 9% of Australian transport emissions
Energy policy paralysis continues in Canberra, exacerbated by the Morrison government’s decision to ditch the national energy guarantee.
Since 2015, the government has been consulting on mandatory fuel emissions standards, which have been in place for at least a decade in the US, Japan and China.
The report said if strict standards were introduced, Australia could prevent up to the equivalent of 65m tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions by 2030.
“This is equivalent to the annual emissions from seven Liddell power stations. Urgency is key. Mandatory emissions standards have wider benefits, reducing fuel bills for car owners, saving an estimated $8,500 over a vehicle’s lifetime.”
The report said Australian cars pollute more per kilometre than other comparable countries. The lack of mandatory emissions standards was a factor, but so was vehicle size and the purchasing decisions made by individuals, business and government fleet buyers.
Stock said the government had already done the work required to “put these greenhouse gas emissions standards in place for vehicles and bring Australia in line with 80% of the global car market”.
“But we need to do it as soon as possible because these standards work as people replace their cars over time,” she said.
“It takes time for these standards to drive down emissions in the transport sector. So the sooner they are in place, the greater effect they will have on transport pollution.”
The report said the adoption of electric vehicles in Australia had been held back by “the lack of policy support or incentives, higher upfront cost, limited choice of available electric vehicles for sale in Australia, and the availability of public vehicle charging infrastructure”.
In New Zealand, which has a target of 64,000 electric vehicles on the road by 2021, there were 3,659 new electric cars sold in 2017, compared with only 2,284 in Australia, the report said.
It also calls on the government to focus on improving public transport, cycling and walking infrastructure, praising initiatives such as Melbourne’s move to a solar power tram network.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/13/transport-emissions-continue-to-rise-as-australia-lags-behind-other-nations

Hurricane Florence slammed into the eastern US on Friday as the Philippines and Hong Kong braced for Typhoon Mangkhut. Hurricanes and typhoons are no surprise at this time of year, but what is noticeable is that these tropical storms are not barrelling along as fast as they used to.
Research published in Nature earlier this year showed that the average speed at which tropical storms track has slowed down by 10% since 1949. Over land, speeds have decreased even further; around 30% for western North Pacific storms and 20% for North Atlantic ones. Changes in atmospheric circulation, caused by global warming, are thought to be behind the decrease in pace.
Hurricanes that proceed at a trot instead of a canter are not good news. “The slower the storm moves, the more rain falls on the area under it. Inland fresh-water flooding increases and this is the No 1 factor, by far, that causes loss of life associated with hurricanes,” says James Kossin, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Wisconsin. Hurricane Harvey demonstrated this last year when it stalled over Texas, and right now Hurricane Florence appears to be lingering too.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/sep/14/weatherwatch-slower-tropical-storms-are-raising-flood-threat

Climate campaigners would, therefore, be forgiven a few moments of despair in the era of Donald Trump. Trump's election elicited two large public howls from those concerned about climate change – the People's Climate March and the Science March, held within days of each other in April last year – but any hopes of persuasion have now given way to attritional confrontation and attempts to bypass the administration altogether.
Now a series of marches and other events across 70 countries on Saturday called Rise for Climate Action, is framed as a grassroots movement aimed squarely at spurring local mayors, businesses and state leaders to slash emissions regardless of Trump, with the hope a future president will find the momentum impossible to ignore.
“I'd hesitate to say we are giving up on the federal government at the moment but we have to be realistic,” said May Boeve, the executive director of 350.org, a climate change campaign group that is a lead organizer for Saturday. “Quite a lot can be done at the city level and we have an opportunity to highlight that. We are up against huge obstacles and Donald Trump is a massive one. This is about being clear what we are asking for when the opportunity presents itself.”
The message being honed for the Rise for Climate Action is one of a swift transition to 100% renewable energy, with the image of fossil fuel companies painted as being little different from their tobacco counterparts.
Many of those taking part in the various marches and other events in the US will be highlighting the aspects of society worsened by climate change, such as inequality and racial prejudice.
Miya Yoshitani, of the Asian Pacific Environmental Network, will be taking part in the main climate march, which expects to attract tens of thousands of people in San Francisco, to decry the air pollution suffered largely by black and Asian American communities in the Bay Area.
“There are refineries and freeways so air quality is a big issue for everyone, but race is a bigger factor than income as to how bad you get it,” she said. “The Bay Area is known to be a very progressive place, with its technology and innovation, but it's also a place of extreme inequality. There is massive gentrification and displacement of people and climate change is a huge threat multiplier for those things.
“Here, climate change is things like sea level rise, wildfires and drought but it's also housing affordability and energy costs. The effects are going to be borne by low-income communities that already miss out on school and work days because of air pollution. It's not a distant threat, it's here right now.
“I grew up in Chicago but moved here in the 1990s and have seen these huge changes with the growth of the dotcom companies. We feel [California governor] Jerry Brown has failed some of these communities and we have to let him know we will hold him accountable.”
The San Francisco march, timed as an unofficial curtain raiser for the Global Climate Action Summit that starts in the city next week, will demand that Brown end fossil fuel extraction and begin the complete shift to renewable energy recently backed by California lawmakers. Activists fear that even states purportedly progressive on climate change, such as California, are leaving behind certain communities.
“California is on fire at the moment and we have flooding and heatwaves caused by a fossil fuel industry that is being allowed to continue when everything needed for a just transition is available,” said Pennie Opal Plant, an environmental campaigner of Yaqui, Mexican, Choctaw, Cherokee and European descent.
“Native people are going to be at the very front of the march because we are on the frontlines of fossil fuel extraction and processing. In the Bakken oil fields [an area in Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota] there are high rates of cancer, in the tar fields of Canada they've destroyed and poisoned huge areas of boreal forests where people hunt and find medicines.
“My family has lived in the Bay Area since the 1930s and Chevron and the other refineries have just got bigger and bigger. It's been a constant struggle and the rates of cancer and asthma are very high. In our tribal traditions we understand we are responsible for the wellbeing for the coming seven generations. As a grandmother I'm concerned we are not handing a healthy environment on to my grandson and his generation.”
Opal Plant said it was “devastating” to see the Trump administration throw open large tracts of land for oil drilling and coalmining, including areas in the Arctic and Utah considered crucially important both spiritually and for hunting.
“It's an horrendous nightmare to think they'd drill in the Grand Canyon or Bears Ears [national monument in Utah],” she said. “We've got to rise up because that's how slavery was abolished, that's how women got the vote and how civil rights came about. There's nothing more important right now than to rise up to ensure a livable environment for the future.”
Protesters in Puerto Rico will demand that the US territory rebuild its electricity grid, which was shattered by Hurricane Maria last year, with renewable sources such as solar and wind, while people will gather in Miami to call for greater urgency to confront the threat of sea level rise.
Others will target specific projects, such as a planned electricity substation in Boston, located in a flood-prone area of a diverse neighbourhood, and a new oil pipeline near New Orleans that acts as an extension of the controversial Dakota Access endeavour.
“This pipeline starts on indigenous land and it ends in St James, an African American area that is already surrounded by a dozen petrol-chemical facilities,” said Anne Rolfes, who grew up near the heart of the oil industry in Lafayette, Louisiana. “We will be demanding that people in St James get an evacuation route for when one of these plants explodes, because there isn't one at the moment. It's a pretty pathetic request really, to be frank.
“Stopping the pipeline is an urgent issue too but we need a damn evacuation route. If you're rolling over the top of these communities you've at least got to let them have a way out.
“Elected officials pretend to care about flooding but they've never met a petrol-chemical project they didn't like. These areas in Louisiana are going underwater but it's just one big anti-climate science parade.
“It's not as if we have any level of government that is responsive at the moment but acting now is better than if we just did nothing. To some degree you need blind faith in some sort of miracle down here. I think we will have around 200 people for the protest, which is quite good for Louisiana.”
Some of those taking part dismiss any focus on Trump as merely a distraction from decades of decisions in the US that have placed minority communities directly in harm's way from power plants, landfills and other sources of insidious pollution.
“I'm tired of doing marches in Minnesota. People do them and go home and say 'I've done my bit now,' which isn't how it works. We need a strong, lasting movement,” said Sophia Benrud, a chef who is helping set up an event explaining the dangers of climate change in a district of east Minneapolis historically blighted by industrial pollution.
“The Trump administration isn't what is motivating me. I hate politics. This is about my life, my family. We have had white people setting our agenda for a long time. Look at Flint and the problems there. Would you ever see that in a wealthy white neighbourhood? Obviously not.
“I've always cared about the planet. I'm the woodland creature out of all of my friends; I would happily never live in the city again. Climate change is a symptom of people not being taken care of. If we don't take care of people and of inequality, we will never solve this problem.”
… we can’t turn away from climate change. For The Guardian, reporting on the environment is a  priority.  We give climate, nature and pollution stories the prominence they deserve, stories which often go unreported by others in the mainstream media. At this critical time for humanity and our planet, we are determined to inform readers about threats, consequences and solutions based on scientific facts, not political prejudice or business interests. But we need your support to grow our coverage, to travel to the remote frontlines of change and to cover vital conferences that affect us all.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as $1 – and it only takes a minute.

Most of Joshua Tree national park could become uninhabitable for its eponymous trees, glaciers will continue to melt away at Glacier national park, and many other of America’s most treasured beauty spots could be rendered virtually unrecognizable by climate change, Patrick Gonzalez, the lead author of the study, writes in the journal Environmental Research Letters.
Even the tiniest of creatures are at risk in the worst-case predictions: the American pika, a small alpine mammal, may no longer be able to survive on park land.
“We are preserving the most remarkable ecosystems, and they happen to be in extreme environments,” said Gonzalez, a climate scientist at the University of California, Berkeley. Gonzalez is also the principal climate change scientist for the US National Park Service but conducted and spoke about the research in his university capacity.
The study finds that temperatures in national parks could go up 3 to 9C by 2100, under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s worst-case scenario, which shows what could happen without policies to decrease greenhouse gas pollution. With lower emissions, temperatures could still increase more than 2C (3.6F) for 58% of park land, compared to 22% of the US as a whole, according to the study.
They are particularly vulnerable because most US park land is in areas that are heating up quicker: in the mountains, the Arctic and the dry south-west.
Alaska parks would see the most extreme heat increases, and the US Virgin Islands parks face 28% less rainfall by the end of the century. In Glacier Bay national park, the Muir Glacier melted 640 meters between 1948 and 2000.
In Yellowstone national park, trees are dying because bark beetles are thriving in warmer winters. Yellowstone will also become far more vulnerable to wildfires. The area burned could be up to three to 10 times higher by 2100. Joshua Tree national park in California could lose up to 90% of the habitat suitable for its namesake trees.
Gonzalez explained that parks at a higher elevation have a thinner atmosphere that warms faster. Higher temperatures are also melting snow cover and making the ground darker so that it absorbs more heat. Parks in California and the south-west US have seen both high temperatures and record-low rainfall, he said.
The research is the first comprehensive look at climate change impacts on national parks, Gonzalez said. He said he has been using the climate impacts research to develop plans for parks to adapt and reduce the greenhouse gas pollution they contribute.
The Trump administration has rescinded government efforts to slow climate change. The interior department, where the National Park Service is housed, nixed a policy that would have urged management decisions based on science, including climate change research. Park officials in New England scrubbed references to climate change and flooding risks in a report this summer, according to Reveal. The National Park Service did not immediately respond to a request to comment on the study or climate change policies for parks.
Jonathan Jarvis, the National Park Service director under Barack Obama who now works at UC Berkeley, said he relied on climate change projections to decide where to relocate and bolster structures in the Everglades national park in Florida, an area that has been hit by hurricanes and faces sea-level rise.
Jarvis said he worries that under Trump parks won’t be able to plan long-term for climate change.
“The park service manages these assets, these places, for the benefit of the American people, and they should be based on the best available sound science in the long-term public interest, not for some short-term political agenda,” Jarvis said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/25/us-national-parks-climate-change-impacts

While the Morrison government has abandoned the national energy guarantee because conservatives complain that emissions reduction policies drive up power prices, the new research finds that critique is misguided.
Power prices for households would fall by 2030 under four different scenarios modelled by Frontier Economics – business as usual and emissions reduction targets of 26%, 45% and 65%.
The research says the price reductions would vary state-by-state, but business as usual would result in an average saving of 18.5%. Under the 26% scenario – which is the government’s now abandoned electricity target – the average saving would be 20.8%; under the 45% scenario, which is Labor’s target, the average saving would be 18.3%; and under the 65% scenario, the average saving would be 15.0%.
The savings are forecast by taking the residential retail price for 2030 for Queensland, Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia, and creating an average.
The modelling shows the benefits for households would increase if the government allowed emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries to be part of the emissions reduction effort, rather than excluding them, as was proposed under the now defunct Neg.
The chief executive of Acoss, Cassandra Goldie, told Guardian Australia the Frontier modelling made it clear that a variety of emissions reduction policies – the Neg, a clean energy target or an emissions intensity scheme “with the right settings” – could drive more rapid emissions reductions in the electricity sector and contribute to lower power bills.
“The idea that we need to choose between cheaper energy prices and limiting global warming is misleading and short-sighted, and does a huge disservice to our community, especially to people on low incomes,” Goldie said.
“People on low incomes are the most vulnerable to both escalating electricity prices and the effects of global warming. We must tackle both. Both are a social justice issue.”
The Neg, which would have imposed a 26% emissions reduction target on the electricity sector by 2030, has been shelved because the Coalition’s internal fight over emissions reduction got tangled up in the leadership war that resulted in Malcolm Turnbull being deposed and Scott Morrison taking over as leader.
Since junking the Neg, the new energy minister, Angus Taylor, has recommitted the government to pursuing heavy-handed interventions in the energy market worked up in the last days of the Turnbull government, including “last resort” divestiture powers to break up power companies if they engage in price gouging, and default pricing for consumers.
Taylor, who Morrison has dubbed the minister for lowering power prices, is also working up fresh options to take to cabinet.
The Greens are calling on the Coalition and Labor to allow the existing renewable energy target to be extended for the life of the next parliament.
The Greens climate change and energy spokesman, Adam Bandt, said rolling over the RET would allow “the renewables boom to continue while the climate and energy policy impasse is resolved after the next election”.
Bandt said the big build of renewable energy coming into the national electricity market courtesy of the RET was playing a significant role in driving down power prices, but the scheme wound down from 2020, and there was no clear sense of how the current energy policy deadlock would be resolved.
The latest renewable energy index compiled by Green Energy Markets has confirmed analysis by the Energy Security Board that wholesale electricity prices are on the way down because of an addition of 7,200 megawatts of extra large-scale supply from renewable energy.
“Our preference is to increase and extend the RET until 2030, but an interim measure to 2022 is needed to avoid an investment freeze in renewable energy,” Bandt said.
“If the RET isn’t extended, there’s a real risk that the next government will not be able to implement a new policy in time to avoid an investment drought.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/sep/18/steep-emissions-reductions-targets-wont-drive-up-power-bills-modelling-shows

A leaked document shows that BusinessEurope, Europe’s biggest business lobbying group, will urge members to oppose any moves by the European Commission to ratchet up the bloc’s 2030 targets for clean energy, carbon cuts and energy efficiency.
The commission is considering whether to set more ambitious goals in November after a key international science panel report on meeting tougher global warming targets is published in October, and before a UN climate summit in December.
But, at meeting in Brussels on Wednesday, BusinessEurope will ask big companies to agree a “line to take” on the prospect of steeper carbon cuts. If the commission’s measures have teeth, the group’s “advocacy and communication strategy” recommends companies agree to fight them. “To oppose the new increase of ambition, using the usual arguments of global playing field, we cannot compensate for others, etc,” the document said.
If the commission opts for warm words and a political statement rather than a material ratcheting up of the targets, the group suggests it should react by being “rather positive”.
BusinessEurope’s members include household names in the energy and technology sectors, many of which have spoken of the need for strong action on climate change.
When contacted by the Guardian to ask if they agreed or disagreed with the lobby group’s suggested opposition, UK business trade body the CBI, German conglomerate Siemens, French energy firms Engie and EDF Energy, and Japanese multinational Hitachi all failed to distance themselves from the proposal.
Tech giants Facebook, Google and Microsoft, all of which source renewable energy and have stressed the importance of cutting emissions, also failed to comment on where they stood on the proposal.
A CBI spokesperson said the group “has always been supportive of the ambitious and challenging climate targets set by the EU and the UK”. BusinessEurope said the meeting was a starting point to discuss what its position should be.
Kate Blagojevic, head of climate and energy at Greenpeace, which obtained the leaked document, said: “This powerful industry lobby is busy plotting behind the scenes to derail further action from the EU ahead of a major climate summit.”
Blagojevic said she was surprised companies appeared willing to go along with the proposal and urged them to “reject this cynical plan and use Wednesday’s meeting to stop it in its tracks”.
EU energy chief, Miguel Arias Cañete, said in August that the commission was weighing up whether or not to increase the goal of cutting carbon emissions by 2030 from 40% to 45%.
The plan has the support of the commission’s president, Jean-Claude Juncker, who has said that he shared Cañete’s conclusions on the carbon target. “This summer’s droughts are a stark reminder – not only for farmers – of just how important that work is to safeguard the future for generations of Europeans. We cannot turn a blind eye to the challenge in front of our noses,” Juncker said this month.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/19/tech-giants-fail-to-distance-from-businesseurope-fight-against-eu-climate-targets

The review, published on Thursday, examined climate risk disclosures by 60 companies in the ASX 300, in 25 recent initial public offering (IPO) prospectuses, and across 15,000 annual reports.
Of the 60 companies, Asic found 17% identified climate change as a material risk to their business.
The regulator said that while most ASX 100 companies had considered the potential risks posed to them by climate change at least to some extent, the practice of disclosing these risks to investors was “considerably fragmented, with information provided to the market in differing forms across a wide range of means of disclosure”.
“In some cases, the review found climate risk disclosures to be far too general, and of limited use to investors,” Asic said in a statement.
The review found few listed companies outside of the ASX 200 were disclosing climate risks to their investors.
Discussion of climate change in annual reports had also gone backwards, particularly for companies outside the ASX 100.
It found the percentage of annual reports of all listed companies that contained climate change-related content had fallen from 22% in 2011 to 14% in 2017.
“Climate change is a foreseeable risk facing many listed companies in the Australian market in a range of different industries,” the Asic commissioner John Price said.
“Directors and officers of listed companies need to understand and continually reassess existing and emerging risks (including climate risk) that may affect the company’s business – for better or for worse.”
He said climate change disclosure practices were still evolving and Asic would “monitor market practice as it continues to evolve and develop in this area”.
But financial analysts said the report highlights problems with Australia’s generic risk disclosure laws for companies and the understanding of how they apply to climate change.
“It shows there’s a difference between what Asic says the laws say and what companies are doing,” said Will van de Pol, a campaigner at Market Forces.
“It’s clear from this report and our financial research that many Australian companies are not meeting their legal requirements.
“It means that investors are being left in the dark about the risk to the companies that they own from climate change.”
He said it was up to investors to demand detailed risk disclosure from companies and for the regulator to take action against companies that failed to meet disclosure requirements.
Dan Gocher, director of climate and environment at the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, said the results in the review suggested mandatory reporting of climate risks might need to be considered.
“In the absence of that, this is the result,” he said. “It points to a systemic issue. Without mandatory reporting from Asic it will require a cultural change.”
He said investors should be taking action against companies that weren’t making progress.
“We’re suggesting they used the tools that they’ve got and the only ones are voting against directors and voting against remuneration,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/sep/20/australian-businesses-must-do-more-to-disclose-climate-change-risks-to-investors-asic-says

The UK government’s committee on climate change (CCC) said the Scottish National party government was well on track to hit its 2020 target to cut emissions by 56%, reducing them faster than the UK as a whole. However, that was largely because of substantial gains from the closure of Scotland’s last coal-fired power station at Longannet in Fife in 2016 and gains from cutting CO2 emissions from waste, which were relatively easy things to achieve.
While emissions from energy plummeted, transport emissions had barely fallen and made up more than a third of Scotland’s overall emissions of 41.5m tonnes’ equivalent of CO2 (MtC2e) in 2016.
To achieve Scotland’s post-2020 target to cut emissions by 66% by 2032 and by 90% by 2050, that volume of transport emissions needed to be cut heavily. “Transport is now Scotland’s biggest sectoral challenge,” the committee’s annual report to the Scottish parliament said. “The Scottish government’s ambition is good but we need to see much more action, particularly on road transport, if Scotland is to achieve more rapid emissions reductions than the rest of the UK.”
The CCC said ministers should:
• consider free parking and special lanes for electric cars• set targets for cutting nitrogen fertilisers in farming• plough more money into planting new forests to soak up CO2 • set much tougher energy efficiency and low carbon heating standards in new homes.
Sturgeon said last year she wanted to see sales of new petrol and diesel cars end in Scotland by 2032, eight years earlier than the UK government target. The CCC said it saw little evidence that the 2032 target would be met.
Sturgeon announced last month another £15m towards electric charging points for cars and £20m for a low carbon loans fund. She has said the A9 trunk road from Perth to Scrabster would become the UK’s longest “electric highway” with regular roadside charging points.
Even so, sales of ultra-low emission cars have been consistently slower in Scotland than in the rest of the UK. The latest UK government data shows 7,700 ULEV cars were sold in Scotland in the first three months of 2018 compared with 130,000 in England, or about 4,000 less than Scotland’s population share.
Supported by new funding, Scotland is catching up on low emission buses. Data from the Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership shows 12% of Scotland’s bus fleet is low carbon, including 10 hydrogen-powered buses operating in Aberdeen, compared with 16% in England and only 2% in Wales.
However, bus travel is falling in Scotland, dropping by 10% over the past five years, while private car use is continuing to grow. Train travel is up but so too is aviation.
Tom Ballantine, the chairman of the umbrella group Stop Climate Chaos Scotland, said MSPs at Holyrood should amend the new climate bill going through the Scottish parliament to toughen up policy.
“This new independent report is clear that we need decisive and urgent action to keep Scotland’s climate change emissions falling rapidly,” he said. “Science is telling us we need to act faster. We are starting to see the serious effects of wilder weather, with droughts and heatwaves close to home and around the world this year.”
A Scottish government spokesman said they welcomed the CCC’s confirmation it was on track to hit its emissions reductions target but he did not respond in detail to the committee’s recommendations.   “The committee’s report shows Scotland continues to lead the UK in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and that we have met our statutory emission reduction target for the third successive year,” he said. “We will continue to look at what more we can do to address climate change and will consider the report’s recommendations carefully.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/24/scotland-needs-tougher-policies-to-meet-2020-co2-targets-say-experts

Spread in model climate sensitivity is a major factor contributing to the range in projections of future climate changes (see Chapter 10) along with uncertainties in future emission scenarios and rates of oceanic heat uptake. Consequently, differences in climate sensitivity between models have received close scrutiny in all four IPCC reports. Climate sensitivity is largely determined by internal feedback processes that amplify or dampen the influence of radiative forcing on climate. To assess the reliability of model estimates of climate sensitivity, the ability of climate models to reproduce different climate changes induced by specific forcings may be evaluated. These include the Last Glacial Maximum and the evolution of climate over the last millennium and the 20th century (see Section 9.6).

Because tropical cyclones are carried along within their ambient environmental wind, there is a plausible a priori expectation that the translation speed of tropical cyclones has slowed with warming. In addition to circulation changes, anthropogenic warming causes increases in atmospheric water-vapour capacity, which are generally expected to increase precipitation rates9. Rain rates near the centres of tropical cyclones are also expected to increase with increasing global temperatures10,11,12. The amount of tropical-cyclone-related rainfall that any given local area will experience is proportional to the rain rates and inversely proportional to the translation speeds of tropical cyclones. Here I show that tropical-cyclone translation speed has decreased globally by 10 per cent over the period 1949–2016, which is very likely to have compounded, and possibly dominated, any increases in local rainfall totals that may have occurred as a result of increased tropical-cyclone rain rates.""

This increase in predictability when dealing with temperatures averaged out over three months compared to daily temperatures is relevant the greater predictability of climate which is averaged out over three decades rather than three months. Averaging out daily maximum temperatures over three months reduces the day to day weather variability and increases predictability.

Four decades later, ‘climate sensitivity’ estimates remain virtually unchanged, but some climate contrarians have argued that the number is at the low end of that range, around 2°C or less.
BQENDThis is out of date.
The issue of climate sensitivities below 2℃ (in the 1.5℃ to 4.5℃ range ECS [Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity]) being less likely is addressed by the Royal Society's report from last November and it is not substantively in question.
The accepted most likely level of ECS is circa 3°C and has been since 1979 - the more work climate science does on this, the more sure we are of that.
BQSTART
we are indeed on track to burn through the remaining Paris carbon budget by 2030, and under current international climate policies, we’re most likely headed for about 3.4°C warming by 2100.
BQEND
The Royal Society projections to for 2100 come out significantly lower (2.2℃ on an ECS of 2.8℃) than the 3.4℃ figure from Climate Action Tracker above, because they make the assumption that efforts to curb emission continue and emissions cease rising at 2040.
For this to happen, the vested interests, political groups and NGOs must either stop opposing what needs to be done or become less successful than they have to date.
Given the accepted science, surely the question is, when will the organisations who oppose the accepted steps in cutting emissions do what is required?
WE are ever more certain of the causes - society needs to accept the solutions even if those solutions are ideologically challenging and/or are costly in the short term. The imperative is to cut emissions using the most effective tools at our disposal.

BQSTART
The equilibrium climate sensitivity quantifies the response of the climate system to constant radiative forcing on multi-century time scales. It is defined as the change in global mean surface temperature at equilibrium that is caused by a doubling of the atmospheric CO2 concentration. Equilibrium climate sensitivity is likely in the range 1.5°C to 4.5°C (high confidence), extremely unlikely less than 1°C (high confidence), and very unlikely greater than 6°C (medium confidence). The lower temperature limit of the assessed likely range is thus less than the 2°C in the AR4, but the upper limit is the same. This assessment reflects improved understanding, the extended temperature record in the atmosphere and ocean, and new estimates of radiative forcing. {TS TFE.6, Figure 1; Box 12.2}

My issue though was that when you mention ""contrarian scientists"" and ""alarmist one's"" that there is actual a third group which overstate a very narrow range and don't acknowledge how this sits in the big picture.
The main thing is that the IPCC WG1 in its main report makes it very clear that the model's that they are showing for their summary report are not including ESS (Earth System Sensitivity) and the Geology Society issued their ""addendum"" which points out that ESS can double the final temperature.
While ESS is separated from ECS, this is only done because we don't have a good way to model the component from ESS but it will effect the temperatures even in the TCR timescales (70 years).
All we actually know from many of the models is a range for given assumptions where ECS is likely to sit. We are not sure precisely where as we have too many unknowns.
From our best guess of ECS without ESS perhaps we come out at 450ppm CO2 being where 2C will be crossed. From the ice-core which is where we evaluate the risk of 2C we crossed this at 300ppm CO2. 
The above study is useful but when he states he used the observations of the atmosphere and Oceans. This has a problem because there are potential lags in the system such as ESS. Without initial conditions this leaves unknowns.
Essentially what his estimate becomes is a lower bound of the actual equilibrium temperature at each point. Do we know how much higher than the lower bound we might be not really. But the proxy record suggests that even 450ppm CO2 is far too high for 3C. Yet many people fixated on the middle imply that 500ppm or even higher is not a massive failure.

BQEND
CP ducked this, but I actually looked at the WG3 SPM you provided a link to.
The very first paragraph of the introduction (page 4) says
BQSTART
The Working Group III contribution to the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) assesses literature on the scientific, technological, environmental, economic and social aspects of mitigation of climate change. It builds upon the Working Group III contribution to the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), the Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation (SRREN) and previous reports and incorporates subsequent new findings and research. The report also assesses mitigation options at different levels of governance and in different economic sectors, and the societal implications of different mitigation policies, but does not recommend any particular option for mitigation.
BQEND
which initially suggests that the ""definitive"" statement you ask for cannot be inferred, however indirectly, from the SPM ...
... HOWEVER (!), 1 page later you find
BQSTART
Effective mitigation will not be achieved if individual agents advance their own interests independently.
BQEND
which is a variant of the common ""the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few"" type of argument.
If you equate ""individual agents advanc[ing] their own interests independently"" with ""elements of the environmental lobby"", then all you need is to find something saying ""Effective mitigation"" = ""the environment"" ... or at least it includes elements equivalent to ""the environment"" (?) ...
Just 4 paragraphs later (at the bottom of page 5) you find :
BQSTART
Climate policy intersects with other societal goals creating the possibility of co-benefits or adverse side-effects. 
These intersections, if well-managed, can strengthen the basis for undertaking climate action. Mitigation and adaptation can positively or negatively influence the achievement of other societal goals, such as those related to human health, food security, biodiversity, local environmental quality, energy access, livelihoods, and equitable sustainable development; ...
BQEND
If you close your eyes and squint hard enough the combination of these elements can be taken as implying that ""the environment"", as one of the declared ""societal goals"" that would allow the considered ""mitigation"" policies to be described as ""effective"", is more important than the ""individual agents advanc[ing] their own interests independently"" exemplified by ""elements of the environmental lobby"".', u'recommendation_count': u'2', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1538058306000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'3985037', u'in_reply_to': u'120898287', u'id': u'120914892', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'ComfortablyPlumb', u'text': u'BQSTART

why do we import as much LNG as the UK exports piped gas
BQEND>sigh<
No, the UK is a net importer of gas - 60% and rising.120-150,000GWh of our 800,000GWh gas demand is imported LNG
Imported LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) at 21.05kgCO₂ (e)/GJ or domestic natural extracted gas at 5.9kgCO₂(e)/GJhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/553488/2016_methodology_paper_Final_V01-00.pdf
So, 150,000GWh of gas is 539,999,999GJ
With domestic gas that's 3,185,999,994kg of CO₂Imported LNG is 11,366,999,979kg of CO₂
Soa total saving of 8,180,999,985kg of CO₂
That may not sound massive - but the per capita emission in the UK is circa 8 tonnes of CO₂.
In other words, this simple measure would completely eliminate the carbon of approaching one million British people.Gas, heating, cars, electricity - the lot.

In 1979, top climate scientists led by Jule Charney published a report estimating that if we double the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from pre-industrial levels of 280 ppm to 560 ppm, temperatures will warm by 3 ± 1.5°C.  Four decades later, ‘climate sensitivity’ estimates remain virtually unchanged, but some climate contrarians have argued that the number is at the low end of that range, around 2°C or less.
It’s an important question because if the contrarians are right, the 2°C resulting global warming would represent significantly less severe climate change consequences than if mainstream climate scientists are right and temperatures rise by 3°C.  It would also mean our remaining carbon budget for meeting the 2°C Paris target is about twice as large than if the mainstream consensus is right.  If the consensus is correct, we’re on pace to blow through the remaining Paris carbon budget by around 2030.
Studies published in March 2014, May 2014, and December 2015 identified two critical flaws in the contrarians’ preferred so-called ‘energy balance model’ approach: it doesn’t account for the fact that Earth’s sensitivity can change over time, for example as large ice sheets continue to melt, or that the planet responds differently to different climate ‘forcings’.
Last week, the journal Earth’s Future published a study by the University of Southampton’s Philip Goodwin that took both of these factors into account.  Goodwin ran climate model simulations treating every forcing separately, including changes in greenhouse gases, solar activity, particulates from volcanic eruptions, and from human fossil fuel combustion.  For each, he included feedbacks from changes in factors like atmospheric water vapor, clouds, snow, and sea ice, including how these factors change over different timescales, as Goodwin explained:
I ran 10 million simulations with a relatively simple climate model. These 10 million simulations each used different climate feedback strengths, and so the way that climate sensitivity responded over time was different in each simulation.  To check which of the 10 million simulations were most realistic, I checked each simulation against observations of warming in the atmosphere and ocean up to the present day. I kept only the simulations that agreed with the observations for the real world. 
This left 4600 simulations, where the values of the climate sensitivity (and changes in climate sensitivity over different timescales) agree with the atmosphere and ocean warming observed so far. It is from these final 4600 simulations that evaluate how the climate sensitivity evolves over time.
Essentially, adding up all of the warming contributions from all of these factors at any given time tells us how sensitive the climate is on that timescale, whether it be a month, a year, a decade, or a century after atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have doubled.  
Over the shortest timeframes of a year or less, Goodwin found that temperatures will rise by about 2°C once carbon dioxide levels have doubled, consistent with the conclusions of the contrarian studies.  That makes sense because those studies applied current climate measurements into energy balance models, but since carbon pollution is still rising, the climate still has a large energy imbalance.  Climate sensitivity, on the other hand, is usually evaluated at the point when the Earth reaches a new energy equilibrium, long after carbon dioxide levels have stopped rising.
Once our carbon pollution levels decline close to zero (hopefully by mid-to-late century), the planet will start to reach that new equilibrium.  The slower feedbacks like melting ice will continue to kick in, and Goodwin found that on timescales close to a century thereafter, temperatures will rise by 1.9–4.6°C, most likely 2.9°C, consistent with mainstream climate science estimates since the 1979 Charney report.
In other words, we are indeed on track to burn through the remaining Paris carbon budget by 2030, and under current international climate policies, we’re most likely headed for about 3.4°C warming by 2100.  
Climate contrarians want to gamble on the long shot that the climate sensitivity is on the low end of the possible range, which would give us a few extra decades before we burn past the Paris target.  But even that relatively rosy scenario would require more aggressive international climate policies than are in place today.  We still have to change course even to limit ourselves to a doubling of carbon dioxide-equivalent in the atmosphere.
And the body of scientific research keeps refuting the contrarian case.  If anything, recent research suggests the climate sensitivity is toward the high end of the possible range, but Goodwin’s study finds that it’s most likely right where climate scientists have expected for decades. As Goodwin concluded,
some of the lowest estimates of climate sensitivity from before do not appear to hold on the long timescales",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/sep/24/new-study-reconciles-a-dispute-about-how-fast-global-warming-will-happen

Abstract
BQSTART
Large, abrupt, and widespread climate changes with major impacts have occurred repeatedly in the past, when the Earth system was forced across thresholds. Although abrupt climate changes can occur for many reasons, it is conceivable that human forcing of climate change is increasing the probability of large, abrupt events. Were such an event to recur, the economic and ecological impacts could be large and potentially serious. Unpredictability exhibited near climate thresholds in simple models shows that some uncertainty will always be associated with projections. In light of these uncertainties, policy-makers should consider expanding research into abrupt climate change, improving monitoring systems, and taking actions designed to enhance the adaptability and resilience of ecosystems and economies.

Primary succession is based on a lot of local climatic and ecological factors. Looking at the paper, it does not surprise me that a location in the high northern latitudes takes longer to re-establish a soil layer than the balmier regions of the UK.
Whilst I take your point about it taking longer in the Canadian and Russian north, we can skip through a couple of the stages of ecological succession if we were so minded. But even then, it would take a few decades and or a hell of a lot of money.

I've long pointed out that nobody here on OiF should use their background as any sort of justification. In a debate, caiming expertise is a weak point: only our words count, and therefore if one's words don't show expertise, then claiming expertise only emphasises the lack of substance in one's words.
This does not rule out stating that there are many experts in many fields here on OiF. This can in part be deduced from the readership of these pages, supported by the occasional below-the-liner contributing articles, and last but not least, by deduction from what they say - and not, I repeat, what they claim to know.

That is certainly not reflected in the climate change science literature - not even close.

Rignot: It’s a little bit shattering to say, “hey this is it”, even for the scientists looking at it. It’s kind of a big step to say “I think this place is falling apart”. 
Interviewer: How do we communicate this to the public?
Rignot: I don’t know, but we're not doing a good job at that. I think most of the scientists are not trained for that, so they've been taken by surprise, they don't know how to deal with that very well.
I'm trying to learn. I talk to people from digital media to ask them how do we reach the people? The feedback I get right now is, “you guys really suck at it, you're not doing it right, I can tell that you're not trained to do this. The message is not passing.
You know you talk about these things like [monotone voice] ‘business as usual, this glacier is falling apart.

We should be a little bit more vocal and direct about these things. You have some how to take your scientist hat off and take a different hat to communicate that.
You cannot communicate to the public the same way you communicate to your colleagues. It has to be a different level of communication.

""October Revolution Island, Severnaya Zemlya.October Revolution Island (Russian: Остров Октябрьской Революции, Ostrov Oktyabrskoy Revolyutsii) is the largest island of the Severnaya Zemlya group in the Russian Arctic.
The area of this island has been estimated at 14,170 km2 (5,470 sq mi) making it the 59th largest island in the world.[1] It rises to a height of 965 m (3,166 ft) on Mount Karpinsky. Half the island is covered with glaciers reaching down into the sea. In the sections free from ice, the vegetation is desert or tundra.""
Calling these glaciers an ice cap or five ice caps is rather misleading, but the nomenclature for ice is variable. What matters is that it is a large island that lies between two marginal Arctic seas, both of which melted away to open waters this year. Ice from the glacier will flow into the sea but calling this ice an ""outlet"" glacier is also misleading because glaciers on an island can be nothing else but ice falling into the sea.

A problem I see very often is the popular understanding of science getting sidetracked into false questions.
BQEND
I find this, and subsequent remarks like ""It's not a meaningful question"" and ""Asking about a particular storm is a stupid question"" quite troubling. First, it seems quite arrogant to dismiss any questions asked in a genuine spirit of enquiry (as distinct from JAQ-off graffiti from deniers). No genuine question is false, or without meaning - and they are certainly not 'stupid'. The question itself may be based on a false premise, but anyone seeking to communicate science to lay people will address and correct the premise e.g. extreme weather is not caused by climate change, but can be made worse by it.
When the public ask questions based on faulty premises, they are offering scientists and writers like me an incredibly valuable opportunity to improve the understanding of science. To fail to take such questions seriously, to ignore them or dismiss them, does a great disservice to a public ever more in need of understanding, as science becomes central to their very way of life. What you seem to suggest is that we should leave people as ill-informed today as they were yesterday, and you do so on the basis that because you already understand an issue, anyone not understanding it is foolish, stupid or worse.
And lastly, can I tell you how amused I was by your attempt at science writing, starting at ""The answer should be..."" If I were teaching basic science journalism, and wanted a prime example of how not to do it, it would be hard to find a better example than the paragraph you wrote: unnecessarily complex, inept, confused, inaccurate, laboured and hard to follow. 
And you end with a classic: 'there's no doubt about it'. There is always doubt in science - it is exactly the scepticism that we discuss so often in this forum.

Indeed, there are huge strides being made. But these are making little headway yet against the power of vested interests. Also there are big cultural barriers based on religion and ideology. Just look at the middle east, the US republican party and third world corruption.Re Nukes, it is useful to distinguish between nuclear reactors and nuclear plants that have multiple reactors.

The takeaway message is that once we thought these large bodies of ice responded slowly to changing conditions. But this research shows us differently. It shows that ice sheet can move quickly and once we pass a threshold, they may be hard to stop. This finding makes it more crucial for us to slow down global warming before it’s too late.

BQEND
Let's start with :
""it’s becoming increasingly evident that one of the horrors of the global warming story is a failure of mainstream science to know what’s really going on in a timely fashion, always late to the party."" This is a wild generalisation, and they seem to think that the IPCC is the only element of ""mainstream science"". They quote several people, including Rignot, who I would very much regard as part of mainstream science.
""It alone carries enough ice melt (16 feet) to flood NYC and Tokyo, forget Miami, it’s already a goner."" While this may be true a very long time in the future, saying ""it's already a goner"" is hardly responsible reporting.
""Totten lost 18B tons of ice every single year from 2002-2016, a clear signal that risk of inordinate sea level rise is now officially “on the move.”"". Using the word 'inordinate' is completely uncalled for and is why I would call the article hysterical.
""It is axiomatic that wipeouts are never anticipated!"" Wipeout ? Really ?

I disagree.

There is NO consensus on whether global warming is dangerous. There is NO consensus on whether anything should be done about it. Roughly two-thirds of climatologists believe greater than 50% of the warming of the Earth since the 1950s has been caused by Man. The other third believe it is less than 50%.

BQSTART
The IPCC’s AR5 attribution statement: 
It is extremely likely that more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together. The best estimate of the human induced contribution to warming is similar to the observed warming over this period.
BQEND
Observed.  This image
BQSTART
The best estimate of the warming due to anthropogenic forcings (ANT) is the orange bar (noting the 1�� uncertainties). Reading off the graph, it is 0.7±0.2ºC (5-95%) with the observed warming 0.65±0.06 (5-95%). The attribution then follows as having a mean of ~110%, with a 5-95% range of 80–130%. This easily justifies the IPCC claims of having a mean near 100%, and a very low likelihood of the attribution being less than 50% (p < 0.0001!). Note there is no ‘downweighting’ of any argument here – both statements are true given the numerical distribution. However, there must be some expert judgement to assess what potential structural errors might exist in the procedure. For instance, the assumption that fingerprint patterns are linearly additive, or uncertainties in the pattern because of deficiencies in the forcings or models etc. In the absence of any reason to think that the attribution procedure is biased (and Judith offers none), structural uncertainties will only serve to expand the spread. Note that one would need to expand the uncertainties by a factor of 3 in both directions to contradict the first part of the IPCC statement. That seems unlikely in the absence of any demonstration of some huge missing factors.

BQENDStrongly suggests that total forcing from CO2 is near 100% of current observed warming and that other factors such as natural ocean cycles and cooling sulphates are confounding* the global temperature from displaying the full forcing from CO2. .

Checking through the various links ends up with the Clark et al (2007) ""SAP 2.1a report to the USCSSP"" (back when the ""GCAM"" model was called ""miniCAM""), which said :
BQSTART
Each modeling group first produced a reference scenario under the assumption that no climate policies are imposed beyond current commitments, namely the 2008-12 first period of the Kyoto Protocol and the U.S. goal of reducing reduce GHG emissions per unit of its gross domestic product by 18% by 2012. The resulting reference cases are not predictions or best-judgment forecasts but scenarios designed to provide clearly defined points of departure for studying the implications of alternative stabilization goals.
BQEND
The NHTSA then said in its report :
BQSTART
For the analysis of direct and indirect impacts, NHTSA used the Global Change Assessment Model Reference scenario to represent the Reference Case emissions scenario (i.e., future global emissions assuming no additional climate policy)

They did not say, or even imply, how ""likely"" they thought that scenario was, it was simply used as a reference point, ""Alternative 0"", to compare their (8) alternative proposals against.

he temperature changes at mid‐ and high latitude stations separated by less than 1000 km are shown to be highly correlated; at low latitudes the correlation falls off more rapidly with distance for nearby stations. We combine the station data in a way which is designed to provide accurate long‐term variations. Error estimates are based in part on studies of how accurately the actual station distributions are able to reproduce temperature change in a global data set produced by a three‐dimensional general circulation model with realistic variability. We find that meaningful global temperature change can be obtained for the past century, despite the fact that the meteorological stations are confined mainly to continental and island locations. The results indicate a global warming of about 0.5°–0.7°C in the past century, with warming of similar magnitude in both hemispheres; the northern hemisphere result is similar to that found by several other investigators. A strong warming trend between 1965 and 1980 raised the global mean temperature in 1980 and 1981 to the highest level in the period of instrumental records.

For recent decades the generalized least squares estimator mitigates most of the error associated with the use of a naive area weighted average. The improvement arises from the fact that coverage bias in the historical temperature record does not arise from an absolute shortage of observations (at least for recent decades), but rather from spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of observations, with some regions being relatively undersampled and others oversampled. The estimator addresses this problem by reducing the weight of the oversampled regions, in contrast to some existing global temperature datasets which extrapolate temperatures into the unobserved regions. The results are almost identical to the use of kriging (Gaussian process interpolation) to impute missing data to global coverage, followed by an area weighted average of the resulting field. However, the new formulation allows direct diagnosis of the contribution of individual observations and sources of error.

1) ""It seems to me that most of the people who think they are 'experts' are climate change deniers"" - I agree. Most experts on here won't say ""I'm an expert"" which is correct. Dogmatic commentators, however, will tend to say ""I'm right because I am etc., etc.""I've had long discussions with persons trying to winkle my profile out of me, for example, which I won't do: it's pointless since there's no verification possible.
2) The problem with ""this bit of pedantry"" is that this is a public understanding of science, and though Abraham's right in what he says, it's not well put.That's the point, and that is not pedantry.The use of ""melting ice can cause..."" is OK if he's talking to scientists and not OK in the popular press. I'd suggest being straight right from the start: ""Ice on land melting and flowing into the sea raises sea levelt"".
It's not critical, but reading this article I also thought, before I read robertpinker's comment, that JA was less good this time than usual.
And therefore I agree rather than automatically defending J. Abrahams :)
That also covers the point about certainty, which also goes to the heart of this spat concerning RP saying ""avoid ""can"" mr. Abrahams!"" :
A problem I see very often is the popular understanding of science getting sidetracked into false questions. 
The biggest example is ""Did global warming cause suchandsuch a cyclone / flooding / event ?""
It's not a meaningful question. And the tendency by scientists to engage with it is a mistake. We see articles saying ""Well, the warming made this event more likely, by so much, and so we think this one we can state unequivocally that global warming is a contributing factor. This other one, we can't tell exactly because it's somewhere else and the factors etc., etc., etc.""
The answer should be: ""Global warming has increased sea tempertures by X which has led to heat flux as far as we can tell increasing by Y - see this map here - and that means that atmorpheric water content has increased by Z and circulation by A and the result of that is more water, more circulation, more heat in the atmosphere and all these increases definitely increase the frequency and power of storms, there's no doubt about it.Asking about a particular storm is a stupid question, it's as pointless as asking if a particular snowflake falling in December is the result of evaporation from a river, or an ocean, or a lake: Some questions are the wrong question to ask.""

The significant feature of a thermosyphon is that it is passive and does not require any external power to operate. During the winter, the air is colder than the ground around the supports. The liquid ammonia at the bottom of the thermosyphon is vaporized by heat absorbed from the ground, cooling the surrounding permafrost and lowering its temperature. During the summer, the thermosyphons stop operating, since there is no liquid ammonia available at the top of the heat pipe, but the extreme cooling during the winter allows the ground to remain frozen.""', u'recommendation_count': u'4', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1538128112000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'this', u'effect': u'the pipeline to sink and possibly be damaged'}], u'author_id': u'3684556', u'in_reply_to': u'120934388', u'id': u'120934531', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'TTauriStellarbody', u'text': u'BQSTART

OK Mr Clever, why are people so worried about AGW? We hear and read a lot about extreme weather events, water scarcity, acidifying oceans,

We are concerned that rising temperatures will have a steadily increasing impact on our economic growth and capacity to spread wealth to the peoples of the world. That some will be devastatingly negatively affected. On the balance of risks the working assummptions are that either 1.5C or 2C warming is something we can live with economically. Above these two limits (that are debated) the assumption is negative impacts increase exponentially.

ncreasing magnitudes of warming increase the likelihood of severe, pervasive, and irreversible impacts. S ome risks of climate change are considerable at 1 or 2°C above preindustrial levels (as shown in Assessment Box SPM.1). Global climate change risks are high to very high with global mean temperature increase of 4°C or more above preindustrial levels in all reasons for concern (Assessment Box SPM.1), and include severe and widespread impacts on unique and threatened systems, substantial species extinction, large risks to global and regional food security, and the combination of high temperature and humidity compromising normal human activities, including growing food or working outdoors in some areas for parts of the year ( high confidence ). The precise levels of climate change sufficient to trigger tipping points (thresholds for abrupt and irreversible change) remain uncertain, but the risk associated with crossing multiple tipping points in the earth system or in interlinked human and natural systems increases with rising temperature ( medium confidence ). 45

For example, changing weather patterns or water crises can trigger or exacerbate geopolitical and societal risks such as domestic or regional conflict and involuntary migration, particularly in geopolitically fragile areas.

This movement is the topic of a very new scientific study that was just published in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters.  The Arctic is warming much faster than other parts of the planet and the ice there is showing the signs of rapid warming.  This fact has serious consequences. First, melting ice can cause sea levels to rise and inundate coastal areas – it also makes storms like hurricanes and typhoons more destructive.  Melting ice also causes a feedback loop, which can cause more future warming and then more ice loss.
It should be noted that there are different types of ice.  Some ice floats on water and is called sea ice.  When it melts, the ocean water level hardly budges because the ice is already in the sea displacing liquid water.  But, sea ice is really important for this feedback loop I mentioned above. 
Other ice is on land and may be a large ice sheet or a smaller glacier.  These ice bodies sit atop the land and “rest” there.  In some cases, they extend out off the land and into the ocean where they partly float on liquid water.  When this land ice melts, the liquid flows into the oceans and can cause significant ocean level rising.
So, the importance of ice depends on what type it is, where it is located, and how fast it is melting. And this brings us to the new paper.
The researchers looked at a type of high latitude glacier in their study.  These glaciers hold enough water to cause about 1 foot (about a third of a meter) in sea level rise. Typically, they exist in cold and dry areas, where snowfall is limited.  
How do glaciers move?  Well really by either sliding over the underlying bedrock or surface that they sit on, or by deforming and stretching under their weight. The colder glaciers tend to move by the deforming and stretching process.  Glaciers that have wetter and more temperate regions involve more sliding.  But regardless of how they move, these glaciers, particularly the glaciers that have both cold and temperate parts, experience surges in their motion.  These surges are short duration times where the glacier moves a lot.  During a surge, ice is redistributed from one part of the glacier to another region.
The authors in this study observed such a glacier surge.  It happened at an outlet glacier that is mainly of the “cold” type in Russia.  At the Vavilov Ice Cap on October Revolution Island, the authors find it “is undergoing extraordinary acceleration and thinning but displays no previous evidence of surging.”  The authors write,
the 300-600 meter thick 1820 square kilometer Vavilov Ice Cap is frozen to its bed over the majority of its area, apart from a region along its western margin where basal sliding is potentially important for faster flow. 
In 2010 the ice in the region began to accelerate and the next year, crevasses were observed that matched the patterns of ice acceleration. The researchers were able to watch this surge in ice motion in real-time using satellite images. They could track the motion and show the incredible speed of flow. 
What caused the rapid motion? This is an important question because if the motion is caused by human warming, we can expect the behavior to be repeated elsewhere as temperatures rise.  Importantly both air and ocean-water temperatures could be a factor.  One potential cause is surface meltwater.  The top of the ice can melt, and liquid water then can flow downwards, into the ice through cracks and holes.  This flowing water can precondition the ice for rapid motion. 
This fact may be a contributing cause to the motion.  Basically, the melted water lubricated the ice/ground interface causing more sliding and more friction.  The friction caused some of the bottom ice to melt and released more liquid water, and a cycle had begun.
The researchers also took measurements of elevation to better understand areas where ice was becoming thicker or thinner.  In addition, they studied the forces that exist within the ice itself to help elucidate the cause of the increased speed. Obviously, this is an evolving area of study and all of the questions have not yet been answered.  However, I was impressed when I read that even though these types of surges are becoming more common, what the researchers observed in Russia was still unique.  They describe the rate of ice loss at Vavilov as “extreme.” The authors also point out, 
It is startling that the Vavilov Ice Cap, until recently, an apparently stable ice cap with an almost entirely frozen bed that is almost entirely above sea level, is able to rapidly discharge such a large proportion of its ice in the ocean over such a short period.
So, to answer the question, how fast is it moving?  In 2015, it reached speeds of up to 82 feet in a single day. It currently is sliding 15–35 feet a day. For comparison, that is much faster than the average 2 inches per day we would see with no surge events.
The takeaway message is that once we thought these large bodies of ice responded slowly to changing conditions.  But this research shows us differently.  It shows that ice sheet can move quickly and once we pass a threshold, they may be hard to stop.  This finding makes it more crucial for us to slow down global warming before it’s too late.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/sep/26/new-research-shows-the-worlds-ice-is-doing-something-not-seen-before

I'm in favour of remain, but in this case the UK (in 2013) went alone and set up the Carbon Price floor on top of the weak EU carbon tax - and it is the CPF that is taking us off coal, despite, not because of, the EU.
 In point of fact France has asked Germany to copy the UK and sign up to a UK style CPF -But despite these calls from French President Macron to implement additional carbon taxes, the German coalition government refuses to hold polluters accountable. “We say no to a price on CO2,” say CDU members, once again punting on climate change leadership.
So Macron’s appeals [to implement additional carbon taxes like the UK 'Carbon Price Floor'] have seemingly been rejected. Germany’s new Grand Coalition between the center left SPD and conservative CDU continues to disappoint green energy advocates whilst fluffing both the renewables and coal power&mining sectors with a masterly piece of greenwashing that a surprising number of self styled environmentalists seem entirely at peace with.

Theresa May pledged last January to create a “world-leading, independent, statutory body” to ensure ministers stick to their commitments – replacing the power of the European commission to take governments to the European court of justice (ECJ) for not fulfilling their obligations.
Yet the UK watchdog will not have any powers relating to climate change, an issue of heightened public concern since the summer heatwave that has seen wildfires in the north of England and outbreaks of tropical diseases in parts of Europe.
Matthew Pennycook, Labour’s Brexit spokesman, said: “Our EU membership has been key to delivering and enforcing UK emission reductions. In choosing to exclude climate change from the remit of their environmental watchdog, ministers are deliberately weakening the tools we have to hold them to account. The Brexit process cannot be used as a cover to water down the UK’s leadership on climate change.”
The public deserves to have a watchdog with teeth that can enforce climate policy and ensure our pledges become reality
Greener UK, which represents 13 of the UK’s biggest environmental organisations including Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, the RSPB and the National Trust , said it is very concerned about the omission of climate policy from the watchdog’s remit. About 55% of the UK’s planned carbon reductions are tied to regulations derived from the EU and would have been enforced by the European commission.
The watchdog should cover issues such as protecting harbour porpoises, ensuring that water quality and air quality remain high, and protecting wildlife habitats – issues that the European commission has taken action against the UK government.
Environmentalists believe the ECJ has been effective in getting Whitehall to live up to its pledges. According to research by the Institute for Government, between 2003 and 2016 the commission started 753 actions against the British government, of which about 120 related to the environment. Yet ministers were quick to settle matters before they reached the ECJ, which only passed judgments on 63 cases. However, 29 of those cases related to the environment, indicating that ministers would often not take action unless forced to do so.
In announcing its plans for the watchdog, the government argued that climate change was already covered by the Climate Change Act 2008, which created the committee on climate change and international treaties. But the CCC, which said recently that the UK would miss its 2025 and 2030 carbon reduction targets, only has powers to advise and report.
Its chairman, Lord Deben, told the environment secretary Michael Gove that excluding climate policy from the watchdog’s remit would be “artificial and potentially create problems”. But Gove is not responsible for government policy on climate change. The issue has now been passed over to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS).
Shane Tomlinson, director at E3G, part of Greener UK, said: “The government says it wants to be a leader in tackling climate change. However, leadership is not just about the promises you make, but being accountable for delivering on them.
“The UK public deserves to have a watchdog with teeth that can enforce climate policy and ensure that our pledges become reality.”
A spokesman for the BEIS said the government was committed to meeting its climate change targets.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/02/green-watchdog-powerless-climate-change-post-brexit

Renewed criticism of the centrist French president’s approach to green issues came as Macron replaced his former environment minister, the TV personality Nicolas Hulot, who quit last week saying the government was in thrall to powerful lobby groups and taking only “mini-steps” that were insufficient to deal with climate change.
Macron replaced Hulot with the parliament speaker, François de Rugy, a former Green party figure who jumped ship to Macron’s party, La République En Marche, last year. 
De Rugy was active in environmental politics for 25 years before opposing what he called a shift further left by the French Green party. He is described as a pragmatist and reformist who is loyal to Macron.
But environmental groups immediately questioned whether De Rugy would be able to have an effect on the government’s approach to climate change, saying Macron must better defend biodiversity and address environmental threats. 
Macron insists he has gone further on green issues than any other French government, but Jean-François Julliard, the director general of Greenpeace France, said it was clear “the environment is not a priority for Emmanuel Macron and [the prime minister] Édouard Philippe who just use it as window dressing without any real will to engage on environmental transition”. He said he feared De Rugy would simply be “his master’s voice” and added: “Macron must at last take measure of the huge responsibility on his shoulders.”
Karima Delli, a Green member of the European parliament, said people wanted “a new pact for ecology”.
Pascal Canfin, the head of the World Wildlife Fund in France, who was a development minister in the last leftwing government, said a 21st-century shift was needed on clean energy “but the state is still set up as if it’s the 20th – or even 19th – century”.
 Although Macron did not make environmental issues a major part of his election manifesto last year, he later attempted to push them to the forefront as a symbol of progressive politics and to counter Donald Trump’s decision to take the US out of the Paris climate accord. Addressing the US Congress in April, Macron told American lawmakers: “There is no Planet B.”
The first challenge for De Rugy will be addressing future energy plans for France, a country overwhelmingly dependent on nuclear energy. The government announced in November that France’s long-held goal of bringing its reliance on nuclear energy down to 50% by 2025 was not feasible and was likely to take a decade longer.
Taking office, De Rugy said there was an “urgent” need to act on the environment. “I’m here to take action,” he said.
In recent weeks, Macron’s approval ratings have dropped to the lowest since he came to power, as he faces slower economic growth, and struggles to shake off the label “president of the rich”. Over the summer, he faced the first major political scandal of his presidency when a senior security aide was filmed violently assaulting a young man and woman at the edge of a Paris demonstration.
Also, it was reported on Tuesday that the surprise resignation of the popular sports minister and Olympic medallist, Laura Flessel, was linked to her tax situation. The French investigative website Mediapart reported that tax investigators had recently notified France’s tax infraction commission over suspicions she had under-reported her earnings.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/04/emmanuel-macron-under-attack-over-climate-change

The first assertion of the strongly worded Boe Declaration says all Pacific nations, including Australia, “reaffirm that climate change remains the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific, and our commitment to progress the implementation of the Paris agreement.
“Leaders reaffirmed the importance of immediate urgent action to combat climate change and … called on countries, particularly large emitters, to fully implement their … mitigation targets, including through the development and transfer of renewable energy, in line with committed timeframes.”
Leaders of the Forum Islands countries also called for the US to return to the Paris agreement and the commitments it made under President Barack Obama.
The Boe Declaration said the security challenges being faced by Pacific nations were broader and more complex than in previous generations. The forum committed its members to addressing humanitarian assistance, environmental and resource security, transnational crime and cybersecurity.
Australia will work with regional security agencies to establish a Pacific Fusion Centre to better share intelligence and target threats including illegal fishing, drug trafficking and other cross-border crimes.
But the forthright declaration on climate is awkward politically for Australia, with its new prime minister, Scott Morrison, apparently at odds with his own government’s Energy Security Board over whether Australia will meet its Paris targets of a 26% reduction in emissions from 2005 levels.
The government does not have any emissions reductions policies in place to achieve the target.
Morrison told a radio program on Wednesday that “the business-as-usual model gets us there [meeting the Paris targets] in a canter”.
But the Energy Security Board said business as usual – and a failure to implement the now-discarded national energy guarantee – would mean the electricity sector would “fall short of the emissions reduction target of 26% below 2005 levels”.
The Australian government’s apparent ambivalence towards a low-emissions climate policy has disquieted its Pacific neighbours.
As a region, the Pacific has produced the least carbon of any areaon Earth but its citizens have felt the impacts of climate change first, and most acutely, through rising seas, increased salinity, and more frequent and severe natural disasters.
Low-lying island Pacific countries including Kiribati are forecast to be among the first on the plant to disappear underwater if rising sea levels are not arrested.
Xavier Matsutaro, the national climate change coordinator for Palau, a small nation in the north-west Pacific, told the Guardian Australia’s relationship with the Pacific was “dysfunctional”, adding that Australia was also responsible for diluting the strength of previous regional declarations on climate change.
“Australia is a bit of an anomaly, because on the floor [of climate summits] they’re basically sometimes as far right as Trump in some of their views on climate change, at one point they even denied that it existed … But then on a regional basis they’ve actually given a lot of support to our region,” Matsutaro said.
“Sometimes the way I think about it ... it’s like you’re in a relationship and you get abused by your spouse but at the same time they feed you and clothe you and things like that,” he said. “You could say it’s a bit of a dysfunctional relationship.”
In a blistering speech in Sydney last month, Samoa’s prime minister, Tuilaepa Sailele, called climate change an “existential threat ... for all our Pacific family” and said any world leader who denied climate change’s existence was “utterly stupid”.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/06/australia-signs-declaration-climate-change-greatest-threat-pacific-islands

In a briefing note sent to all staff warning them to be aware of false balance, the corporation has offered a training course on how to report on global warming. The move follows a series of apologies and censures for failing to challenge climate sceptics during interviews, including Nigel Lawson.
The briefing note, obtained by the website Carbon Brief, was sent on Thursday by Fran Unsworth, the BBC’s director of news and current affairs. It includes a statement of BBC editorial policy that begins: “Climate change has been a difficult subject for the BBC, and we get coverage of it wrong too often.”
It then states: “Manmade climate change exists: If the science proves it we should report it.” In the section warning on false balance it says: “To achieve impartiality, you do not need to include outright deniers of climate change in BBC coverage, in the same way you would not have someone denying that Manchester United won 2-0 last Saturday. The referee has spoken.”
The Guardian revealed in October that the BBC had apologised for an interview with Lord Lawson on the Radio 4 Today programme after admitting it had breached its own editorial guidelines for allowing him to claim that global temperatures have not risen in the past decade. The regulator Ofcom subsequently ruled the BBC had breached broadcasting rules.
The Today programme was also censured by the BBC complaints unit for an interview with Lawson in February 2014 and has been criticised for failing to implement fully the findings of the BBC Trust’s 2011 review into the “accuracy of the BBC’s coverage of science”.
The four-page briefing note sent by Unsworth starts with a blunt statement on the science: “Climate change IS happening.” It also covers the implications of global warming: “There is a general consensus that it could be devastating in many different ways.” It ends with “common misconceptions” used to deny manmade warming, including that “not all scientists think manmade climate change is real” and “climate change has happened before”.
The briefing note does not completely rule out including climate sceptics in BBC coverage: “There are occasions where contrarians and sceptics should be included. These may include, for instance, debating the speed and intensity of what will happen in the future, or what policies government should adopt.”
But it adds: “Journalists need to be aware of the guest’s viewpoint and how to challenge it effectively. As with all topics, we must make clear to the audience which organisation the speaker represents, potentially how that group is funded and whether they are speaking with authority from a scientific perspective.” Lawson’s Global Warming Policy Foundation does not disclose its source of funding.
Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank and a former BBC environment correspondent, said: “The creation of this course is welcome news. The BBC was wrong in my view to scrap the science seminars that it set up in 2011 – very few producers and presenters have a science background.
“The course will be criticised by some – words like ‘stifling the debate’ – but those voices are decreasingly important in the country. I think the real takeaway from this is that the BBC has decided it no longer cares about evidence-free allegations of ‘bias’. It’s to be commended for putting its mojo on display.”
Prof Ed Hawkins, a climate scientist at the University of Reading, said: “This set of BBC guidelines is long overdue. There have been too many occasions when the BBC’s audience has been misled over the realities of climate change.”
Hawkins analysed the briefing note for Carbon Brief saying: “The ‘editorial policy’ could be more explicit about what would constitute false balance in its coverage. In the past, too many inaccurate statements made about climate science have not been effectively challenged by the interviewer.”
In August, 57 prominent environmentalists, including Jonathon Porritt and Caroline Lucas, wrote to the Guardian declaring: “We will no longer debate those who deny that human-caused climate change is real. There are plenty of vital debates to be had around climate chaos and what to do about it; this is simply no longer one of them. We urge broadcasters to move on, as we are doing.”

Big six energy firm SSE said that when it started work three years ago, it had hoped to install 6,000 charging points in London by now, but had fitted just 762 because of delays by local authorities.
The company is the contractor putting in the chargers for the Source London network, run by French firm Bolloré.
Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed electric vehicle infrastructure to help clean up the capital’s dirty air, but his rhetoric has reportedly not filtered down to the local level.
Slow decision-making and bureaucracy in councils, coupled with different approaches to charge points across the capital’s boroughs, are understood to have hamstrung the rollout.
Kevin Welstead, the sector director for electric vehicles at SSE Enterprise, said: “Progress has not been rapid. The issue is that we have to effectively negotiate with each of the 33 individual London boroughs so we can install charge points alongside their parking bays and some are more progressive on the electric vehicle agenda than others.”
The Guardian understands that 130 charging points are in limbo in Southwark, a borough which is otherwise seen as good on electric cars. While the points were given planning approval in 2016, permission has not been given by highways management, meaning they cannot be installed. Planning permission expires next year.
Welstead said ministers and Khan had rightly supported electric vehicles, but added: “Our experience as an infrastructure provider on the ground is that this message has not seeped all the way through.”
One possible reason for holdups could be the financial problems that austerity has imposed. Cuts to central government grants have led local authorities to shed staff, including those on transport teams, and remaining staff are understood to be stretched to capacity.

Another explanation could be that some boroughs are not seeing much demand from constituents, so are not prioritising approvals. There has also reportedly been a growth in very localised opposition, including in conservation areas.
However, there are hotspots of demand for charging points, including Camden, Islington, Kensington &amp; Chelsea, Hammersmith &amp; Fulham and Southwark.
The mayor of London launched an electric vehicle infrastructure taskforce in May, focused on “rapid chargers”, not the slower chargers that comprise most of the Source London network. There are nearly 4,000 charging points in London, according to Zap Map.
London Councils, which represents the city’s 33 boroughs, denied holding back the switch to electric cars.
Councillor Julian Bell, who chairs the group’s transport and environment committee, said: “London boroughs are committed to supporting environmentally friendly transport and are leading the way in delivering an effective network of electric vehicle charging points across the capital.”
He added that boroughs also had “a duty to consider the needs of pedestrians and other road users and to make sure these services are delivered to high standards”.
Southwark council did not deny that 130 chargers were in limbo, but said it had 100-150 lamp-post electric car charging points planned for the next 12 months.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/09/sse-claims-london-councils-are-holding-up-rollout-of-electric-car-charging-points

How dangerous is it to operate an engine in a closed building? So dangerous that it must NEVER be done, even for a short time. The extremely high concentrations of carbon monoxide produced by an engine can raise CO concentrations in a closed building so quickly that a person may collapse before they even realize there is a problem. Carbon monoxide reduces the amount of oxygen to the brain, causing CO intoxication, and lack of reasoning. Studies by the Centers for Disease Control found that CO concentrations reach the Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health (IDLH) concentration of 1,200 parts per million (ppm) in only 7 minutes when a small 5 horsepower gasoline engine is run in a 10,000 cubic foot room.

Removing their clearly false views from the media actually balances out the conversation and allows everyone to focus on the things that do need to be discussed such as how to implement actions and the specifics of what we can expect due to the changes our emissions are causing. Generally, if you want to keep such views represented, they should at the very least be challenged immediately by the media hosts.
In terms of politics, especially unnecessary to the conversation are the think tanks and political “philanthropic” organizations derived from or associated with the US and other fossil fuel industry elements which are also driving political developments abroad. 
Free speech is actually being used in nefarious and cynically ironic ways to allow for such think tanks to spread misinformation and confuse the public unimpeded. 
This is how cynical the US fossil fuel industry and their allies truly are in their highest ranks, they don’t believe in unity (Citizens United has divided the US), democracy (they have manipulated elections around the world and at home) or the equal voting rights of individuals (leveraging the US electoral collage to subvert the democratic majority vote) and they are using pillars of democracy and freedom to manipulate and deceive the public.
For instance, one of the recent actions taken by the current US administration was to obscure funding to these “philanthropic” organizations and think tanks based on a false application of the idea of free speech, the result of which is to allow such organizations that are aggressively politically active both at home and abroad to act without accountability. This opens up a new level of corruption.
It is important to know what we are dealing with, if freedom of speech is affected in a negative way it is as a result of the cynical and destructive actions I pointed out above but I don’t think that removing such bad actors is actually working against free speech.

Friday on the HBO weekly airing of “Real Time,” Bill Maher and actor Jim Carrey addressed Republicans “running” with the term “socialism” when it comes to far-left candidates.Carrey defended socialism, arguing it is not a failure in Canada, where he grew up.“I grew up in Canada, OK, we have socialized medicine,” said Carrey. “And I’m here to tell you that this bullshit line that you get on all of the political shows from people is that it’s a failure — the system is a failure in Canada. It is not a failure, and I never waited for anything in my life. I chose my own doctors. My mother never paid for a prescription — it was fantastic.”He continued, “I just got back from Vancouver, and I keep hearing, ‘Canadians are so nice. Canadians are so nice.’ They can be nice because they have health care — because they have a government that cares about them that doesn’t say, ‘Sink or f***ing swim, pal, or you live in a box.’ There are certain people in our society that need to be taken care of.”Maher replied, “I’ve always said the United States has been quasi-socialist for a hundred years, for crying out loud.”The actor then said Democrats should just embrace socialism.“We have to say yes to socialism — to the word and everything,” he proclaimed to Maher. “We have to stop apologizing.”

BQEND
Consensus comes from the evidence, not the other way around. Wegener did get a very hard time in the early years but from first publication of a thoroughly speculative idea to widespread acceptance - « consensus » - took no more than 50 years. During that time his ideas were refined (coherence), many other lines of evidence were found (consilience) and as a result the overall theory became widely accepted (consensus). This is a very typical pathway: hard work and gathering information improve our understanding of the world around us. Not people saying « it must a conspiracy ! »

It’d be about time | Richard Black,article,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/10/bbc-climate-change-deniers,0,"From time to time the BBC gets itself into an awful mess over climate change. Unnecessarily so, given that it has visited and revisited principles of good coverage, repeatedly arriving at more or less the same conclusions.
Back in 2007, a report for the BBC Trust, then the corporation’s regulator, concluded that the old bipolar world of “the climate change debate” had gone. The working model had to change, as the title put it, From Seesaw to Wagon Wheel : “the weight of evidence no longer justifies equal space being given to the opponents of the consensus. But these dissenters (or even sceptics) will still be heard, as they should.” Four years later, the Trust’s review of accuracy and impartiality in science coverage , commissioned from geneticist Professor Steve Jones, reached very similar conclusions.
Both reports were accepted by BBC managers. Both contain much that is common sense. And then there are the editorial guidelines, which are very clear that the guiding principle is “due impartiality”, rather than equal weight.
So how have we reached a situation in which the BBC has to apologise  for not challenging incorrect statements made by Lord Lawson on the Today programme, where an entire Radio 4 feature, What’s the Point of the Met Office?, turns into a polemic about “dodgy” climate science, and where Radio Cambridgeshire finds it appropriate to stage a traditional seesaw-style debate between “warmist” and “sceptic”?
One answer is that the BBC has failed to promulgate its “big thinking” on editorial matters to producers and presenters, very few of whom have a science background. After the Jones Review it set up seminars on science coverage; but it failed to make them mandatory, and scrapped them after a year. Staff come and staff go; it seems extremely unlikely that Sarah Sands, editor of Today, had read either the Jones Review or From Seesaw to Wagon Wheel when she decided to call Nigel Lawson for “that” interview.
I recently argued for the seminars’ reinstatement and for making them mandatory. Not that I’m claiming credit, but as the CarbonBrief website has reported, the BBC has now done something similar – setting up a new one-hour course on reporting climate change “… covering the latest science, policy, research, and misconceptions to challenge, giving you confidence to cover the topic accurately and knowledgeably”.
The basic briefing document for the course is short, but it’s a good start. “Climate change is happening”; there is a range of possible temperature rises for any given level of carbon emissions; one cold winter does not challenge the overall picture; and so on. Unchallengeable, really.
If the courses are implemented well, they should improve matters still further. I say “still further” because the lapses to which I referred earlier are conspicuous by their rarity. There’s been a lot of climate change coverage this summer, and the vast majority that I’ve seen has been exemplary. But if this initiative can, for example, make sure that Today presenters know that individual extreme weather events are now routinely being linked to climate change, as Nick Robinson appeared not to know when talking about the heatwave recently, that will be a step forward.
Climate science, though, is just part of the picture. The corporation’s coverage of energy could do with an infusion of new thinking on issues linked to climate change. Mercifully the stream of claims that “the lights will go out” as Britain adopts more and more renewable energy appears to have stopped. But which of the BBC’s correspondents knows that energy bills have gone down over the past decade? Not those who last year covered the government-commissioned Helm Review of energy prices, which led to Radio 4 claiming that “bills have doubled over the past decade”. Where is coverage, also, of the existential risk posed to oil companies – and therefore our pension funds – by the tumbling prices of renewable energy and electric cars? This is now standard fare for the FT, Economist, Telegraph, Reuters, Bloomberg … But the BBC has yet to catch on that a transformation of the entire global energy system is a big story.
The other major factor behind the BBC’s occasional troubles on climate change is lobbying. The newspaper commentariat is amply stocked with columnists who routinely lambast the corporation for bias; and the weight of rhetoric has had an impact.
This, I think, is the real takeaway from the CarbonBrief news: the BBC has decided that it no longer cares about groundless criticism. I assume that the first fulmination against this new course will be in print this weekend or early next week, doubtless full of words such as “indoctrination”. The BBC will be accused of “stifling debate”, even though the course material is clear that it is not. Probably the identity of the “shadowy” figures behind this initiative will be sought.
The reality is, though, that climate and energy contrarians are exerting less and less influence on media or politics. As the BBC’s online briefing notes, the government is now taking advice on whether to set a net-zero emissions target in law, not debating whether climate change matters. If BBC bosses have decided that from now on they are going to free output from the occasional grip of the UK’s climate contrarian elite and stand up for evidence – good on them.

However, how can we talk about pollution and not point a very, very critical finger at governments? After all, governments the world over are the biggest polluters, bar none. The US military machine for example burns through as much oil in a day as a country the size of Greece. And that is just one (albeit large) arm of one government. For governments to try to tell the average Joe they need to cut back on things whilst they carry on polluting in the way they do is hypocritical in the extreme.
Why shouldn't investors get a return on their money in the bank? The money is not doing ""nothing"". The more reserves a bank has, the more they can lend out to productive businesses and start-ups. If they are lending, they are earning interest. And in turn, should give savers some of the interest - that is the way it has historically worked. The reason the BoE should not be holding the base rate at zero is because the BoE should not be price fixing anything - let alone something as important as the interest rate. It shouldn't be up to a bunch of central planners to decide. Price fixing is a terrible, terrible idea. We don't want government price fixing the price of bread (for example). We have all seen the bread lines in Soviet Russia when their government tried. The BoE shouldn't be let anywhere near the interest rate. The market should decide what it is, just like it decides most prices in our economy. When you price fix something too low, you get an over supply and when you price fix something too high, you get shortages. The price of money has been set extremely low and lo and behold, we have vast amounts of credit that is only adding to inflation and eating away at the value of our money. The very fact that we have a central bank doing just that means we fundamentally do not have anything close to a free market economy.
Sure, private ownership of the land could solve air pollution. If you have unclean air coming over your property and you can trace it back to its source, you could easily sue the other party.
Private property is completely inherent to free markets. You cannot have a market system without them. Be that property of goods, ideas, art, music, etc or land itself. So it is completely in-line with free markets. I personally think the problem of housing is not a problem of ownership of the land but rather one, again, of government interference in the market of housing and land. It takes so long (in most cases) to get approval for buildings and/or land ""re-zoning"" that most take years to go through. And when they do it becomes more cost efficient for the developer to build housing that appeals to a higher end of the market - so they can more quickly recoup the costs they had in going through the approval process - that a) not enough cheaper housing gets built and b) not enough housing full-stop gets built. So supply cannot keep up with demand. Prices go up (and inflation driven by the central bank helps drives those prices up as well. As does holding an interest rate artificially low so that investors have to look to investments other than saving to actually get a return, driving many into housing - say hello bubble like we had in the run up to 08)
I am not saying there is no role for government in a market. You need a referee so to speak. But they should be there to keep the market ""free"". And what does the free in free market refer to? It means free from force and compulsion. It has to be voluntary transactions. So that means the government needs to stop fraud, extortion, blackmail, theft, murder, etc - stopping the violations of other individuals rights. But other than that, it should not have a role. Anything more is just favouring one side over the other and creating an un-level playing field. Which is why of course most of the big companies LOVE regulation because they have the money to lobby and get a say in the wording and framing of the laws, so they benefit at the expense of the little guy competition.

I think it would be challenging to argue that pollution (as an example negative externality) has been tackled better by the private sector alone than when government regulation is involved. It’s a clear example of a market failure I think.
If savers want a return they should invest in productive endeavours. I don’t see any reason that they should expect interest for doing nothing. In fact I see no reason for the BOE base rate to be anything other than zero. Why should the government pay interest on bank reserves?
Fait money makes more sense than a commodity backed currency which can starve the economy of the money it needs to operate efficiently. This leads to lost production and recessions. Hardly a desirable situation surely?
While private ownership of all land is one solution to a Tragedy of the Commons type problem it certainly doesn’t lead to an efficient economy. There is also the problem of air pollution which wouldn’t be solved by this. 
Also, it’s seems strange for you to suggest this given your (presumed) preference for free markets. Private ownership of land is a great example of a non-free market. In fact, the housing problems in this country are potentially caused by the non-free nature of the land market. If government regulation was used to resolve this (i.e. a land value tax) the resulting distribution of land would be more economically efficient which would boost the economy.
Of course, just because government regulation can improve markets doesn’t mean all regulation does this. Clearly there are many examples of bad laws. However, in a market based economy I believe one of the key roles for government is to use regulation to remove externalities where possible and make markets free where necessary. Obviously, these powers can be abused which is why accountability and transparency are so important in a democracy.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1536694104000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': None, u'effect': u'an efficient economy'}, {u'cause': u'the non - free nature of the land market', u'effect': u'the housing problems in this country'}, {u'cause': u'just government regulation can improve markets', u'effect': u'of course does n\u2019t mean all regulation does this'}], u'author_id': u'17217284', u'in_reply_to': u'120321901', u'id': u'120330811', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Therebelalliance', u'text': u'Good luck in finding a job in a non capitalist country with freedom of press.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1536693304000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'4337042', u'id': u'120330343', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Hellequin123', u'text': u'Haha.

Yes of course negative externalities exist. But they always will, with or without government intervention. And indeed, in most cases government intervention only makes things worse.
Take one small (but critical) example. Many say the way the current economy is going is focused too much on consumerism and using up resources too quickly. However, why is that? Why do so few these days look to the long term and save? Why spend so much right now? Well, the government via the central bank controls the interest rate and what is used as the official money supply.
If savers know they cannot get any return on their money by leaving it in a bank it tends to tip the scale towards spending. That coupled with the fact that because we have fiat based currency, rather than sound money (i.e. a money that is backed by some commodity), that the central bank deliberately aims to inflate over time which lowers its purchasing power in the long run. So not only do savers not earn any interest, leaving it in the bank actually costs them money over time due to the erosion of value. In those circumstances it makes complete, rational sense to spend in the here and now when you money has some value than save for the longer term. These circumstances are both the product of government intervention. If the interest rate was market set it would be a lot higher than it is now and would encourage saving. As would the market decide what we accept as money, meaning less (if any) inflation, again encouraging saving and investing, rather than spending today.
Or take pollution directly. Almost any new energy technology will produce pollution. And it takes time for the technology to become cleaner. But if we had the level of regulation back in the 1800s that we have today, the industrial revolution would never have happened in the first place and we would be stuck living like back then, with all their problems and poverty. However, the market, given time, comes up with the solutions to the pollution because consumers demand it.
One of the biggest ways to solve pollution is to privatise all the land, rivers, etc, so that the owner cares for it and can hold a polluter directly accountable - take them to court, etc. With all the public land, it is all too easy for a polluter to get away with it with no consequence for decades.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1536680049000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'we have fiat based currency rather than sound money', u'effect': u'that that the central bank deliberately aims to inflate over time which lowers its purchasing power in the long run'}, {u'cause': u'the erosion of value', u'effect': u'so not only do savers not earn any interest leaving it in the bank actually costs them money over time'}, {u'cause': u'consumers demand it', u'effect': u'however the market given time comes up with the solutions to the pollution'}], u'author_id': u'13835441', u'in_reply_to': u'120311981', u'id': u'120321901', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Arnold  Grutt', u'text': u'""human beings are simply animals like any others on this earth""

""Profit was the answer to another century’s problems""
BQEND
Profit is still the answer. At its core profit is just a signal that tells a business it is doing the right things, just as losses are a signal that a business is doing the wrong things. The only way to make profit is by giving consumers what they want at a price they are willing to pay. If you cannot do that, you do not make profit but rather losses.
The way I see it, we have two problems that stop the profit and loss signals working the way they should. First up we do not have anything resembling free markets. We have very centralised markets where governments and central banks tell industry (some more: like finance or healthcare, and some less: like technology - interesting isn't it that the more regulated the industry, the more it struggles) what to do and what they can offer and how they can offer it. They set what the interest rate is (and price fixing has been shown time and time again to be bad idea). Its pretty much the ""fascist lite"" approach to the economy - i.e. keep things ostensibly in private hands but tell them how to run their business. This stop companies operating as effectively and efficiently as they otherwise would, causing a lot more waste and more errors.
The second is tied to the first. Because of the government involvement, companies get things like bailouts which completely destroys the whole point of losses and insolvency for messing up (the banks, GM, etc should never have been bailed out in 08 but rather allowed to fail). And also things like government backed insurance schemes which bail out individuals at tax payers expense. Which also destroys our individual responsibility of evaluating the risk we are taking with certain investments. There is no risk if you know the government will give you your money back.
To fix the problem we need to get the problem out of the economy, and that problem is government / central banks. Profit is not the issue.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1536658780000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'they', u'effect': u'a lot more waste and more errors'}], u'author_id': u'13835441', u'id': u'120304943', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'DuneMessiah', u'text': u'It was the state that bailed out the banks.

However, whilst finance capital accounting is divorced from natural capital accounting and carbon accounting, then there will be no meaningful mechanisms by which to ensure that the polluter (or the user) pays for negative environmental impacts whether that be greenhouse gas emissions including co2 and methane, deforestation, air pollution and toxic industrial waste. In other words, ecologically degenerative flows of people, capital, goods and services need to be taxed whether at source or as a value added tax.
However, this will inevitably hit low income families the hardest, therefore any talk of ecological taxes or ecological accountability will need to be accompanied by a means tested basic income in order to augment a just transition. 
During this just transition, ecological taxes can be used to finance the means tested basic income but can also be used to finance jobs and investment in a green new deal which at heart would include creating new forms of regenerative economic activity. This would include work upgrading the energy grid with community renewable energy, improving the energy efficiency of homes, redesignating disused greyspaces and turning them back into greenspaces and naturalspaces within which we can rebuild civic institutions that accommodate local education services, local wellbeing services and local community engagement. As such newly designated greenspaces can become multifunctional hubs of community activity to benefit both local people and local wildlife. Stoke on Trent could be a good demonstrator model of this type of green regeneration. 
Similarly if meat production and its associated supply chains are taxed for the degenerative activities that they are, this can encourage the release of agricultural land for reforestation and growing renewable resources such as hemp for use in localised industries to replace plastic consumption.

That's not because you say something original but because you say what has been said millions of times before and is repeated daily, but you do it very clearly and succintly. But for all the repetition it is not a good argument.
It is true that capitalism has increased the world's productive capacity in a way unimaginable with any previous economic system. The material living standards of 100s of millions have been raised as never before. And liberal democratic political structures developed under capitalism have provided historically unparalleled opportunities for debate and argument (like the one we are engaged in here). 
But despite its undoubted dynamism (Marx described it as a revolutionary mode of production) capitalism is now suffereing from deep problems which are making it a threat to the great majority. (1) As an economic system it has always been unstable and prone the market crashes. Despite claims, over the last 100 years, that these can be overcome, these crashes are becoming ever more threatening. We are still living under the austerity regime imposed after the great crash of 2007/8. (2) The welfare systems created in the 20th century are now being eroded by cuts in public expenditure. This is not because inequality has been reduced. Inequality is increasing. (3) The rise of the finance sector is making parasitic capitalism increaingly dominant. The attraction of profitting without producing is underming the original dynamic of capitalism as SMEs are denied the finance they need. (4) Neo-liberal doctrines are demanding that market mechanisms and doctrines are introduced into every aspect of public life. And we have seen the effects of that on our railways. The police force is now so depleted that we are seeing the growth of private security for those who can afford it. (5) Capitalism is destroying the planet and threatening even its geophysical stabiliy. (6) Freedom , just two points. Inequality is the enemy of freedom. We have a highly monopolised media the ethos of which even dominats the ideology of our public broadcaster. Everone can can all say what they like but some voices will be amplfied by the media and some will not.
Capitalism is now turning on its former achievements. It has become a destructive system which is highly unstable, is increasing inequality and threatening the environment. Can it really be that this system is the last word in human organisation and that we can think of nothing better? I don't think so.
First we need to get the myth of ""free markets"" out of the way. So-called free market are highly regulated markets. The depend on government regulation to create common trading conditions. Furthermore, the post war 'long boom' was achieved in conditions of a high degree of government intervention. And as Mariana Mazzacuto has shown, much of the technical innovation on which we rely has been due to public rather than private initiatives (see her book The Entrepreneurial State). Then think about the NHS as compared with health provision in the US).
So we aleady have in place important elements of an alternative way of doing things and clear evidence (for those ready to look at it) that they work. We need to work with that. Where public provision and organisation can be made more effective than the private altrnatives we should run with that instead of, as at present, dismantling the public sector in the doctrinaire belief that private solutions are always best.

The claims were already made when the laws were changed to accommodate financiers. This just removes them and shrinks the code of laws.
1. Debt is a contract between the lender and the borrower. Any selling on of that debt should carry the agreement of both the lender and borrower at the time of sale. Efficiency and risk shouldn't only be seen from the perspective of the lender but also the borrower who suffer when third party loan sharks come calling who bought the debt for pennies on the pound.
2. Limited liability is a government protection afforded to capital, basically social insurance. It has no existence outside of that. Its parallel is workers asking for limited liability when they strike, protecting their pay, or landowners asking for limited liability if their properties catch fire, protecting their rent. To enforce all these, you need a big state with bureaucracy. Without it, it doesn't exist.
Liberalism calls for a small state and laws to reflect natural economic incentives. The above laws of limited liability do nothing of the sort but can distort the concept of risk. One could even argue they're socialistic.

So far, analyses have focused on two dimensions of the crisis. First, whether enough was subsequently done, in terms of new regulation and technical fixes such as ringfencing the banks, to prevent a repeat meltdown. And second, a focus on the consequences – the global political upheaval that came in its wake, or more precisely, the decade of immiseration that the briefly thrilling, phosphorous destruction unleashed.
Both approaches risk being a distraction. The next crisis most likely won’t come from improperly supervised instruments of speculative finance. The Economist, for example, suggests the risks lie in the level of household borrowing and the euro. And while it is impossible to avoid asking whether the super-rich simply walked away from the wreckage, laughing as they left societies trying to hold themselves together through painful austerity, the answer generates resentment and a lust for revenge. To know that a disproportionate concentration of wealth is destabilising as well as unjust does not give us a meaningful or creative blueprint for the future we want to build.
That post-crash principle should be this: in a century in which the sustainability of the planet is at stake, markets cannot survive without morality.
Ten years ago, “ethical” investing meant not buying shares in arms and alcohol, as if morality were so unfamiliar to financial decision-making that you had to go back to the 19th century and borrow it from the Quakers. The growth of banks with a moral mission – like Triodos (“quality of life, human dignity, sustainability”) – or investments with a social purpose – like Abundance, which finances renewable energy – has been impressive on its own terms, but remained niche, for baby boomers with a conscience. The idea that all market activity should have a purpose other than profit is roughly where it always was on the spectrum, somewhere between Marx and Jesus – one for the rioters, the subversives, the people with beards, unsuited to mainstream discourse.
But there is nothing more pragmatic and less idealistic than to insist on the social purpose of the market; banking cannot survive without it – not as a corporate bolt-on but as its driving and decisive motivation. The derivatives trade cannot weather the consequences of infinite self-interest, because there really will be consequences – extreme global ones. The planet cannot survive an endless cost-benefit analysis in which nature is pitted against profit. Nature will always lose and so will humanity as a result. Whatever the immediate cause of the next crash, if and when it comes its roots will be environmental. The Financial Times talks about “the insidious danger that pension funds deflate, leaving a generation without enough money to retire”. The most likely cause for that devaluation of pensions – leaving aside the generation that cannot afford to save for the future – will be stranded assets, pension funds having invested in fossil fuels that cannot be excavated.
Even under the terms of the Paris climate accord, which most agree is under-ambitious, 80% of known coal reserves, one-third of oil and half of gas will have to be left in the ground if we are to meet our targets on climate change. The writedowns will be staggering.
For a period after the crash, institutions that thought themselves ethical – universities, churches, pension funds with “ethical” in the name – practised divestment, ridding their portfolios of fossil fuels and its attendant industries. The stance never became the norm; funds that would call themselves reputable still have the farm bet on investments whose realisation would mean the end of the habitable world.
The Lehman Brothers debacle may have had a million misjudgments feeding into it, corruption and carelessness commingling, but the toxicity of the subprime mortgage was laid bare by Hurricane Katrina. In New Orleans, about one-third of mortgages affected by Katrina were sub-prime. Whether it’s a refugee crisis or a tsunami, a heatwave or a flood, the effects of climate change refuse to stick to their own category: they throw up political schisms, social discord, radical departures from the old order of stability from which the financial system cannot remain aloof. There is no MBA module with a solution, and no regulatory lever to mitigate this: all financial endeavour has to be reimagined with the future of humanity as its explicit purpose. Profit was the answer to another century’s problems; if we don’t learn this from 2008, the lessons of 2028 will be far harsher.

Last week, the Pacific Islands Forum stated formally that climate change represented the “single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific” – a declaration Australia ultimately signed but had spent much of the forum attempting to undermine.
Worldwide, the number of undernourished people has been rising since 2014, reaching 821 million last year – or one in nine people across the globe – the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation’s State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World report found.
The number of hungry people globally has returned to levels of nearly a decade ago, and nearly one in four (22.2%) children aged under five are stunted through malnutrition.
Low- and middle-income countries were especially acutely affected by more frequent climate extremes and natural disasters. Africa remains the region where malnourishment is most common at 20.4% of the population. But “Oceania” – broadly synonymous with the Pacific region but excluding Australia and New Zealand – is the only region in the world where the rate of undernourishment has increased over the past 12 years, to 7%.
Nutrition in Pacific countries is very sensitive to climate extremes.
Worldwide, five of the 15 countries considered the most vulnerable to natural hazards are Pacific small island developing states. Vanuatu is ranked as the world’s most vulnerable.
Recurring climate shocks such as drought, delayed monsoons, tropical cyclones and floods – and with insufficient recovery time between disasters – have undermined food security across the Pacific, increased dependence on food aid, and weakened the nutrition of those who live there.
“In some Pacific small island developing states (Sids), the recurrence of climate shocks that impact on national/local food production, coupled with insufficient recovery time, undermines food security and nutrition in the longer term,” the FAO report said.
“This is seen in reduced agricultural and fisheries productivity, increased reliance on short-term humanitarian food assistance, gradual erosion of traditional food systems and intensified permanent shifts away from diversified, healthy traditional diets to greater exposure to imported processed foods often high in salt, sugar and fat.”
Fighting the causes of climate change are crucial in the global effort to reduce hunger
In 2015 Vanuatu was devastated by the category 5 Cyclone Pam, which destroyed reefs, fishing boats and food crops. This was followed by a severe El-Niño-induced drought that further exacerbated food insecurity and led to widespread water scarcity.
A teacher on Emae Island, in Vanuatu’s Shepherd Islands, said the cyclone harmed food availability, water security and education for months afterwards.
“After Cyclone Pam, the water that belongs to you and me was not very good,” the teacher said. “I had to stop class sometimes – half days – and then we’d eat all together. Sometimes we tell the children not to come to school tomorrow because we don’t have enough food.”
In Timor-Leste households affected by drought limit the amount of food they eat, by limiting their portions, reducing the number of meals they eat each day, or selling household assets for food.
And in Papua New Guinea, 45% of children are stunted by malnutrition, and more than 15% are wasted, one of the highest rates in the world.
Oxfam Australia’s food, climate and humanitarian spokesman, Dr Simon Bradshaw, said the UN report found climate extremes “left 94.9 million people having to rely on humanitarian aid to feed themselves”.
“A hot world is a hungry world,” he said. “The cost of failing to act on climate change is being measured in devastating food crises, and more and more people going undernourished.”
Bradshaw said Australia’s failure to curb its climate pollution was contributing to increasing global hunger “and inflicting pain and hardship on the world’s most vulnerable communities”.
“Resolving conflict and war, tackling the drivers of inequality and poverty, and fighting the causes of climate change are crucial in the global effort to reduce hunger – and Australia has a role to play in each of these areas.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/12/climate-change-driving-up-malnutrition-rates-in-pacific-un-warns

The two-day Global Climate Action Summit beginning Thursday will also feature diplomats and mayors from around the world. As well, chief executives of Fortune 500 companies and celebrities ranging from actor Harrison Ford to primatologist Jane Goodall all plan to be there.
Local governments and corporations will announce new goals to boost renewable energy and run more sustainably. America’s Pledge – a group led by California Governor Jerry Brown and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg – will unveil how close the US could come to the climate pollution reductions the Obama administration promised the world in Paris in 2015. Trump pulled out of that accord shortly after he became president in 2017.
International climate policy negotiators and environmental advocates will be watching for measurable commitments and for climate-friendly political leaders, especially Brown, to do more than they have in the past, said Jennifer Morgan, the executive director of Greenpeace International.
In a little over a year, the US has seen an uptick in devastating hurricanes, record-breaking wildfires and summer heat waves that are likely to become the new normal.
“The goal posts have changed. What used to be seen as leadership and was good enough then is just not adequate now,” Morgan said. “What was seen as radical should be common sense. The bar has been lifted.”
The world is not on track to prevent catastrophic warming, to keep temperatures from increasing more than 2C (3.6F), Patricia Espinosa, the executive secretary of the United Nations framework convention on climate change, said earlier this month.
The US vowed to cut its own greenhouse gas levels by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025 – but is not on a trajectory to fulfill that promise. At best, the country could make it to 23%, according to an analysis by the economic data firm Rhodium Group. At worst, it might curb emissions only 11%.
Those numbers are based on current policies, depending on how much carbon dioxide forests can absorb and on energy prices and the state of the economy. The Trump administration’s rollbacks, including of plans to limit pollution from coal plants and cars, are equal to forfeiting about 1% of reductions, said John Larsen, a director at Rhodium. The reversals could have a bigger stalling effect over time.
Most US progress is happening in electricity, which makes up less than one-third of the country’s climate pollution. And that progress could halt in 2030 if nuclear plants shut down and are replaced with natural gas power, according to Rhodium.
With the White House absent on climate change, activists say the work of states and cities becomes more critical than ever.
“We’re starting to reach a point where there’s widespread realization that the non-federal actors can take us a good part of the way,” said Andrew Light, a climate negotiator under Obama who is now with the World Resources Institute. But, “they can only take us so far unless they’re able to scale up action.”
Light said the summit could offer an opportunity for international experts and investors to offer help to US climate advocates.
Amir Jina, a post-doctoral scholar at the Climate Impact Lab collaborative group and professor at the University of Chicago, said the last year and a half in the US has been a harbinger for the future of climate change. Hurricanes are likely to become more intense, rapid sea-level rise will exacerbate dangerous storm surge, some regions will see record rainfall, and others will struggle with drought. The world can pay far less now to limit those effects or far more later to adapt to them, Jina said.
As temperatures rise, impacts will become more severe, and they will be uneven across the US, Jina and his colleagues’ research shows.
Climate change on its current path will be a drag on the economy, slowing gross domestic product 4% or 5% annually, Jina said. If the world limited warming to 2C , as the Paris agreement intends, that number would be closer to 0.5% or 1.5%.
“It might seem like a small amount, this is 4% of your income, but because we see this unequal impact, it’s important to think of not what the overall effect is but who is being affected,” Jina said.
In some parts of the US, climate change could decrease GDP 20% to 25% below where it would be without the effects of climate change, Jina warned.
California, on the front lines of climate change with wildfires, mudslides and a warming, rising ocean, has been a leader in the US environmental movement, but activists are pressuring Brown to do more, such as phase out oil and gas drilling.
“The progress that we’ve made in California on renewables is exciting and it’s also nowhere close to enough,” said Miya Yoshitani, executive director at the Asian Pacific Environmental Network. 
At the same time, even if the Paris agreement is successful, many countries will suffer.

If these measures are taken urgently, they could make enough of a contribution to make the UK “net zero” in terms of carbon emissions by 2050. However, a major programme to bring them into effect would be needed as a matter of urgency.
“We will need to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere as well as work on ways to stop emitting so much in the first place,” said Nilay Shah, head of chemical engineering at Imperial College London, and a member of the working group on the report. “The very first thing we need to do is go to a very low number on emissions by 2050. If we work very hard on decarbonising energy and emissions from building and transport and industry, we can bring down emissions to 130m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) by 2050 compared with 450 MtCO2e today.”
That remaining 130m tonnes “is very difficult to get rid of”, said Shah, partly as it comes from activities such as agriculture and aviation, which are hard to decarbonise. This left a gap which could only be filled by removing greenhouse gases from the air.
In a joint report on greenhouse gas removal, the Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering found that increasing the amount of forested land in the UK to 5% of land area could play a major role as trees act as a carbon sink. At the same time, farmers could be encouraged through incentives or subsidies to use their land to store carbon through better farming methods. Restoring natural features such as wetlands and marshes would also store more carbon.
Construction companies should also be given incentives to use wood, which is a natural store of carbon, and cement can be manufactured with waste carbon dioxide to offset the emissions from its production.
However, while these measures together would account for about a quarter of the carbon reductions needed, technology to remove carbon from the air would also be required, the scientists said.
Some of this could be done by capturing carbon emissions at source, such as at power plants. Using bioenergy, such as wood, plants and waste, while capturing the resulting carbon dioxide is technically possible and should be pursued, the scientists urged. But they said other methods, such as direct air capture, would also be needed.
Direct air capture usually involves chemical processes called “scrubbing”, which means using compounds that react with carbon dioxide in the air to form new chemicals that can be safely disposed of, locking in the carbon. While scrubbing is commonly used to clean up other emissions, such as coal-plant emissions containing sulphur, using it to remove carbon from the air is difficult and can be costly.
The report found that economically encouraging the use of direct air capture would require a price to be put on carbon dioxide, probably of as much as $100 a tonne.
Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, called the report “crucially important” for the UK’s low-carbon future. “It shows the UK can take its carbon emissions down to net zero by around mid-century and can do so affordably,” he said. “If anything, it has over-estimated the amount of negative emissions the UK will need, and yet still concludes that we can deliver.”
He pointed ahead to a major report coming from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change next month, which is expected to find that the world must achieve net zero emissions by 2050 to meet the Paris agreement targets. After that report, the UK’s statutory government advisors, the Committee on Climate Change, will issue formal advice on how the UK can meet such a target.
Black said: “This report, showing it is possible [to achieve net zero emissions], could not have come at a more opportune time.”
Direct air capture of carbon dioxide is different from the forms of carbon capture and storage (CCS) attached to power plants, which have been targeted in the past. For most of the past decade, the UK was pursuing carbon capture and storage technologies focused on taking carbon emissions from fossil fuel power plants and storing them under the North Sea, with several companies working on the technology. However, the previous government pulled the plug on those plans and the UK no longer has any pilot projects for CCS from power plants, though other countries have moved ahead with pioneering projects.
Shah said CCS for power plants would also be needed, in addition to direct air capture, if the UK is to continue to use fossil fuels. Such plants could all share the same transport and storage infrastructure, bringing down costs.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/12/urgent-greenhouse-gas-removal-plan-could-see-uk-hit-net-zero-target-report

The climate law could suck in as much imported wood as Europe harvests each year because it will count energy created from the burning of whole trees as “carbon neutral”, according to several academics including a former vice-chair of the UN IPCC.
Jean-Pascal van Ypersele, who is now a climate sciences professor at Université Catholique de Louvain, said the risk of the directive encouraging tree clearances and the destruction of global carbon sinks was now “extremely high”.
“This amounts to sawing off the branch on which humanity sits,” he told the Guardian.
Indonesia and Brazil were among 27 countries which pledged “to increase the use of wood … to generate energy as part of efforts to counter climate change” at the Bonn climate summit last year.
Without additional conservation measures, “the directive in its present form will create a large demand for wood that will contribute to destroying those forests,” van Ypersele said. “It is a catastrophe in the making.”
The EU’s thinking has been that carbon neutrality can be achieved by planting new saplings that eventually compensate for the carbon released by the burning of trees for energy.
But the saplings’ growth can takes decades or centuries. By 2050, replacing fossil fuels with wood will likely result in two- to three times more carbon in the atmosphere per gigajoule of final energy, the paper says.
Nino Aveni, a spokesman for the Bioenergy Europe trade association, argued that new saplings could reabsorb the CO2 emitted by fully grown burned trees within “years to decades”.
“Sustainability criteria are a guarantee that existing forest protection measures are applied to wood used for bioenergy production,” he said. “EU member states have already strong forest policies in place.”
An EU official confirmed that the new analysis was accurate – and said that if anything, it underestimated the scale of the problem.
The directive “really will [spark] a race to the bottom because there is no inherent limit to the potential over-harvesting,” the source said. “There is a high risk that it will involve the possibility of increasing emissions with no possibility of any greenhouse gas savings at all.”
The magnitude of the problem – which eminent academics last year described as “a critical flaw” in EU climate policy – was not understood within the EU, the source claimed.
“Partly that is because of wishful thinking,” the official said. “Partly it is so fundamentally wrong that most people would not believe it could be as wrong as it is.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/12/eu-climate-law-could-cause-catastrophic-deforestation

In 2012, the state now in the path of Hurricane Florence reacted to a prediction by its Coastal Resources Commission that sea levels could rise by 39in over the next century by passing a law that banned policies based on such forecasts.
The legislation drew ridicule, including a mocking segment by comedian Stephen Colbert, who said: “If your science gives you a result you don’t like, pass a law saying the result is illegal. Problem solved.”
North Carolina has a long, low-lying coastline and is considered one of the US areas most vulnerable to rising sea levels.
But dire predictions alarmed coastal developers and their allies, who said they did not believe the rise in sea level would be as bad as the worst models predicted and said such forecasts could unnecessarily hurt property values and drive up insurance costs.
As a result, the state’s official policy, rather than adapting to the worst potential effects of climate change, has been to assume it simply won’t be that bad. Instead of forecasts, it has mandated predictions based on historical data on sea level rise.
“The science panel used one model, the most extreme in the world,” Pat McElraft, the sponsor of the 2012 bill, said at the time, according to Reuters. “They need to use some science that we can all trust when we start making laws in North Carolina that affect property values on the coast.”
The legislation was passed by the Republican-controlled state legislature and allowed to become law by the then governor Bev Perdue, a Democrat who neither signed nor vetoed the bill.
The law required the coastal resources commission to put out another study in 2015, looking at expected sea level rise.
That report looked only 30 years ahead, rather than a century. It found that the rise in sea level during that time was likely to be roughly 6in to 8in, with higher increases possible in parts of the Outer Banks.
Some outside studies have offered more dire warnings. A report last year by the Union of Concerned Scientists said 13 North Carolina communities were likely to be “chronically inundated” with seawater by 2035.
The state’s stance has shifted under the current governor, Roy Cooper, a Democrat who took office last year.
Cooper announced last September that North Carolina would join the US Climate Alliance, a group of states that have pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with the goals of the Paris climate accord, even though Donald Trump pulled the US out of the agreement.
“We remain committed to reducing pollution and protecting our environment,” Cooper said. “So much of North Carolina’s economy relies on protecting our treasured natural resources.”
But Orrin Pilkey, a retired Duke University coastal geologist, wrote in a recent op-ed in the News &amp; Observer that the state has still failed to take the steps that communities in Virginia and New Jersey have taken, to prepare for rising sea levels.
“Instead coastal development flourishes as more beachfront buildings, highways and bridges are built to ease access to our beautiful beaches,” he wrote. “Currently the unspoken plan is to wait until the situation is catastrophic and then respond.”

Aka Niviana, grew up on the northern coast of Greenland; as its ice inexorably thaws, her traditional way of life disappears. And the water that melts off that ice sheet is drowning the home of Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner and everyone else in her home nation, the Marshall Islands of the Pacific. One poet watches her heritage turn to water; the other watches that same water sweep up the beaches of her country and into the houses of her friends. The destruction of one’s homeland is the inevitable destruction of the other’s.
I’ve spent 30 years thinking about climate change – talking with scientists, economists and politicians about emission rates and carbon taxes and treaties. But the hardest idea to get across is also the simplest: we live on a planet, and that planet is breaking. Poets, it turns out, can deliver that message.
But they don’t watch impassively. Both are climate activists, and both have raised their voices in service of their homelands. Jetnil-Kijiner, 30, has been at it for years – she’s performed her work before the United Nations General Assembly and the Vatican. Niviana is newer to activism – just 23, she recited a poem at a recent Copenhagen climate protest, where she met a well-known glaciologist, Jason Box, and he, in turn, organised the complicated logistics of this glacier expedition.
We’ve come with a video crew to the remote fjords of southern Greenland. After two days travelling by boat, we’ve unloaded our gear on the rocks at the foot of the rapidly dwindling glacier, and hauled it up to a base camp nestled on red granite bedrock next to a cascade fed by thundering meltwater. Now, in a cold wind next to a gaping crevasse, the two women are performing the words they’ve spent weeks writing.
Jason Box says there’s no doubt they’re both correct: all told, Greenland has enough water frozen on its rocky mantle to raise the sea by seven metres. After 25 years of field work on the great ice sheet, he understands its significance like few others: right now, there’s no place on earth contributing more to the rise of the oceans. Eventually the even-vaster Antarctic will produce more water, but for now the Arctic is melting much faster (while we were camped on the glacier news reports said that sea ice north of the island – “the oldest, solidest ice in the Arctic” – had melted in this year’s freakish heat).
“We called this ‘Eagle Glacier’ because of its shape when we first came here five years ago,” Box said, “but now the head and the wings of the bird have melted away. I don’t know what we should call it now, but the eagle is dead.”
It’s not, of course, as if global warming is some mysterious, uncontrollable force: it comes from a particular way of life, a way of life which has left some people rich and an increasing number in desperate straits. These poets can’t avoid the politics: their stanzas indict the civilisations which – long before we worried about climate change – blew up Bikini Atoll in the Marshalls and polluted Greenland’s ice sheet with nuclear waste.
Hearing the roll call of giant cities in the poem seems odd at first, on this remote glacier thousands of miles from the nearest traffic jam. But that’s the point. There is no distance any more: the isolation that once protected places like Greenland or Micronesia no longer offers any buffer. The carbon that the rich pour into the air traps heat in the atmosphere we all share. That heat comes north and south, where it melts the world’s great storehouses of ice; in turn the oceans that lap at every continent rise. Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner literally stands with two feet planted on the ice that will submerge her country.
This science is uncontroversial. But science alone can’t make change, because it appeals only to the hemisphere of the brain that values logic and reason. We’re also creatures of emotion, intuition, spark – which is perhaps why we should mount more poetry expeditions, put more musicians on dying reefs, make sure that novelists can feel the licking heat of wildfire.
Alun Hubbard, a Welsh glaciologist who was carrying huge loads of supplies up the glacier to build base camp, remembered his first visits to thawing Greenland. “It’s just gobsmacking looking at the trauma of the landscape. I just couldn’t register the scale of how the icesheet had changed in my head.” But artists can register those thoughts, and turn them into images that potentially unite us.
And that unity is precisely what’s required, because otherwise inertia – and the political power of the fossil fuel companies – seems destined to slow our transition to renewable energy. Slow it enough that the ancient ways of life that gave rise to these young women will warp and then disappear. Slow it enough that everyone everywhere will feel the pain their communities are already feeling. These poets are up on the ice hoping that they can somehow rouse more of the world to action.

NASA, NOAA, and everyone else acknowledged ""the pause""
BQEND
The names ""pause"" and ""hiatus"" are highly inaccurate terms coined by fake sceptics. Unfortunately, and unwisely, climate scientists did use these terms also.
But they always maintained that there was no actual pause in global warming, but rather a slowdown, meaning that the warming would take longer to reach statistical significance against the background noise. They also warned that the slowdown would be temporary. They were completely right.
On the other hand, the pausists unscrupulously conflated a lack of statistically significant warming with ""no warming"", and then maxed out its duration by cherry picking the start and end dates. Both are a blatant abuse of statistics.
BQSTART
But when it became obvious that the temperature wasn't rising, there was an attempt to ""adjust"" the temperatures. What a surprise

Ignorant nonsense. The fraudulent ""pause"" has not been ""adjusted"" away - it is still there in the data  if calculated in the shameless way described above.

You are ducking and weaving.
This whole discussion has been about your claim that negative feedbacks alone are capable of restoring the temperatures to what they were prior to the anthropogenic CO2 increase (ignoring processes that can do this but take thousands of years and hence are irrelevant to us).
You have not presented one iota of evidence to support this claim.
Furthermore, you went on to claim that climate models don't take negative feedbacks into account, and also that there is no proof that they only limit the warming, not eliminate it entirely.
But this is completely wrong. Climate models do incorporate multiple negative feedbacks, based on real research and observations.

There is a long list of non meat common foods that contain 'complete proteins'.
BQEND
If you include eggs and dairy then a vegetarian diet is quite straightforward. Plant-based diets are challenging for including sufficient complete proteins.
Here's an article by a registered dietician:
BQSTART
Animal proteins contain all these essential amino acids. While all plant proteins contain at least some of the essential amino acids, they tend to be lacking in one of them. For example, legumes tend to be lower in an amino acid called methionine while other plant proteins are lower in an amino acid called lysine. It’s therefore important for someone eating a 100pc plant-based diet to ensure they consume a variety of plant proteins throughout the day. 
Therefore it is possible to meet your protein requirements while following a plant-based diet, but it does involve a little bit of thought and planning.
If you were to remove animal proteins from your diet completely, what nutrients might you struggle to eat enough of? Some nutrients are more challenging to absorb into the body when eaten in the plant rather than the animal form. Additionally, some nutrients are found predominantly in animals rather than plants. Therefore a vegan diet isn’t advisable until a plan to meet these requirements is in place.

This deals with timescales of millions of years, and obviously over those timeframes any conclusions are speculative considering the low resolution of data.
For the timeframe of the past tens of thousands of years we have enough resolution to be able to see the fallout from an abrupt global warming or cooling of 1C - it's highly unlikely we would have missed the tail of that even with resolutions as low as several centuries.
BQSTART
https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/abrupt-climate-change/The%20Younger%20Dryas
BQEND
The Younger Dryas doesn't fall into what I am talking about here. I am talking about global changes in forcing and temperature - neither of which apply to the Younger Dryas. In the Southern Hemisphere and some parts of the Northern Hemisphere for instance, there was a slight warming. We should also differentiate between external forcings leading to changes in overall climatic heat content and abrupt, localised reshuffling of heat internally as a reaction to slow external forcings.
There's no evidence that globally the reaction was as abrupt as today, afaik.
BQSTART
Then you can`t admit to any position excepting the one you are employed to pursue :0).
BQEND
Not at all - over million year timescales we may well have had abrupt global warming or cooling akin to today's - however I am unsure of what the physical drivers would be. Obviously an asteroid would have prompted extremely abrupt cooling. Wide-scale burning of coal deposits would have probably released CO2 more slowly than today. Over the last several thousand years we have the resolution and understanding of physics to rule these kinds of abrupt changes out. 
The Younger Dryas is an good counter-example but it was not a global abrupt change, and represented a rapid reshuffling of internal energy rather than a long-term increase or decrease in temperatures and forcing. RealClimate have an excellent primer here:
BQSTART
Unlike changes in global temperature (such as modern day global warming) which can be understood as a result of perturbations to the planetary energy balance, the millennial-scale climate changes during the last glaciation are viewed primarily from the lens of internal dynamics, including ice retreat and re-organizations of ocean circulation. They are not dominated by changes in global mean temperature but rather changes in temperature distribution, explained by changes in oceanic or atmospheric heat transport. In particular, proxies of deepwater formation show large reductions in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) coincident with the start of the YD.

The point here is that CO2 is not a ""thermostat"" for Earth's temperature.
BQEND
CO2: The Thermostat that Controls Earth's Temperature - NASA
BQSTART
CO2 levels and temperature have been ""decoupled"". In fact, they are often inversely related. That is why I posted the article.
BQEND
There is only one paper that makes this claim, and only in the specific arena of million-year timescales. Over thousand-year timescales your paper agrees that CO2 is a control-knob. As a science denier, you ignored this evidence from your own paper. 
Further, the ""Control Knob"" analogy is centred around the forcing from CO2 - if you turn it up it exerts a warming forcing and if you turn it down it exerts a cooling forcing. That does not mean that other factors can also lead to a comparatively warm Earth even with low CO2 levels. 
To put the analogy another way - if I light a fire in my living room and turn down the thermostat, I will still see net warming.
What you are looking for is an instance of CO2 not exerting a warming forcing on the Earth. That kind of evidence is elusive over 500 million years:
BQSTART
A pervasive, tight correlation between CO2 and temperature is found both at coarse (10 my timescales) and fine resolutions up to the temporal limits of the data set (million-year timescales), indicating that CO2,  operating in combination with many other factors such as solar luminosity and paleogeography, has imparted strong control over global temperatures for much of the Phanerozoic.

Edward Lorenz said that if, "" then, there is any error whatever in observing the present state - and in any real system such errors seem inevitable - an acceptable prediction of an instantaneous state in the distant future may well be impossible ... In view of the inevitable inaccuracy and incompleteness of weather observations, precise very-long-range forecasting may seem to be nonexistent."" 
Edward Lorenz was talking about the impossibility of ""very-long-range weather forecasting"". He made no mention of climate. Edward Lorenz was talking about ""acceptable prediction of instantaneous states"". He characterized the weather as an instantaneous state.
Climate is what happens across a number of parameters over a 30 year period. Though it seems like only yesterday that I was 38 years, something that occurs over a 30 year period is not an instantaneous state. The nine year old I was looking after thirty years ago has two children of her own. In chaos theory a distinction is made between weather and climate because climate is not an instantaneous state whereas, for the purposes of chaos theory, weather is. You are wrong to say that ""there is no distinction to be made here between weather and climate with respect to Chaos Theory"".
""Lorenz didn't say that weather was unpredictable for 30 years.....and then it can be predicted in year 31!""
Edward Lorenz didn't say climate which is the sum of the weather over a 30 year period was unpredictable. He talked about weather as an instantaneous state in the distant future being unpredictable.
""If that doesn't make sense"" (and it doesn't, see immediately above) "" then we can go with the IPCC's assessment, which is that predicting the climate (not weather), is ""not possible"".

The atmosphere, the oceans, and the ground are all warming. As a result, ice is melting, seas are rising, storms are getting more severe, and droughts are getting worse. But these things are not happening in isolation. The tricky thing about the climate is that things are connected all across the globe. And those connections are revealing changes that may not be obvious at first glance.
One such change was exposed in a recent paper published in the journal Environmental Research Letters by a team of top scientists from China and Brazil, an instructive video is available here. The scientists focused their study on the Amazon rainforest. There, the year is broken into “wet” and “dry” seasons. The researchers wanted to know how rainfall has changed during the wet seasons over the past few decades.
What they found was astonishing – the rain in this tropical rainforest has increased 180–600 mm (7–24 inches). They learned about the increase in wet-season rainfall by reviewing old weather data – information from rain gauges for example. They also used satellite measurements to complement the rain gauge readings. The trend they found was clear – the rains are increasing.
So, any good scientist wants to know why. Why are the rains increasing? What is the main cause? By using the results of state-of-the-art climate calculations, the authors showed that the temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean are primarily responsible. The Pacific Ocean water temperature plays a smaller role.
This study is really important for a few reasons. First, the Amazon is important for the entire globe’s climate. The rainforest provides about 20% of the Earth’s freshwater. There is a tremendous amount of evaporation from the rainforest into the air. This evaporated water is carried to other parts of the planet where it falls as rain. We call the evaporation/precipitation process a “hydrologic cycle.” This cycle refers to the movement of water throughout the planet; the Amazon is an important engine for the cycle.
But the importance of the Amazon is broader than just water. The growth and decay of wood and plant growth there means the Amazon absorbs and emits large amounts of carbon dioxide. Think of the rainforest like the lungs of the planet. They help the planet breathe.
The Amazon rainforest also helps transfer heat throughout the Earth’s climate. Energy moves from one location to another with help of processes (such as evaporation and condensation) that originate in the Amazon. In these ways, the Amazon connects far-flung parts of the planet together. What happens in one region like the Pacific Ocean affects the climate elsewhere like the Atlantic Ocean. The way the climate interacts between to distant locations is called “teleconnections.” And the Amazon is a great teleconnector for the planet.
Previous researchers who have looked at the Amazon and its changing precipitation have found that the southern part of the rainforest has experienced a long-term increase in rainfall. Researchers have also found changes to the monsoon cycles that affect the rainforest. But with most of these studies looking at the southern Amazon, very little was known about the northern region. What was happening there? Also, most of the early studies looked at changes to rain during the dry season. The authors of this new study wanted to focus on the wet seasons.
The authors used six different methods to look at the data. Three methods were based on actual rainfall measurements. Three additional methods were based on a technique called climate reanalysis – essentially combining measurements and climate calculations. The image below, which is from the paper, shows results for the six methods. The blue regions indicate places where the rainfall is increasing. Areas in orange/red correspond to decreasing rainfall. The results correspond to December through May and the trends are based on 1979–2015.
The general results are the same, regardless of which of the six methods are used. In particular, in the black box (upper left image), the six methods give very similar results. It doesn’t matter whose inputs are used; the rainfall there is increasing. Only one of the methods (MERRA2) results in some portions of the region with a reversed trend.
Next, the authors used their computer calculations to determine what was causing these blue and red patterns. They found that the culprit is the Atlantic Ocean. There has been a very strong warming in the Atlantic, especially off the coast of South America. The warming oceans supercharge the evaporation of ocean water into the atmosphere and change both the amount of water and the amount of energy in the atmosphere. This warming in the Atlantic is responsible for about half of the wet-season precipitation changes in the Amazonian rainforest.
What I liked about this study is that the authors have identified another trend in how we feel climate change. We humans are generally interested in things that affect us. An abstract warming world may not lead us to think about consequences to climate change (other than temperature). But in reality, the whole world is connected. What happens to the temperature in one location can affect other aspects of the climate on the other side of the globe. These teleconnections and their changes resulting from human-caused warming are fascinating.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/sep/12/warming-oceans-are-changing-the-worlds-rainfall

The 30-metre path, made of recycled plastic equivalent to more than 218,000 plastic cups, is expected to be three times as durable as an asphalt alternative.
It also contains sensors to monitor the road’s performance, including its temperature, the number of bikes that pass over it and its ability to cope with the traffic.
The prefabricated sections of cycle path are light and hollow making them easy to transport and 70% quicker to install. Cables and utility pipes are able to be easily fitted inside, and the path is designed to drain off rainwater.
The joint venture between the Dutch engineers KWS, the oil and gas conglomerate Total, and pipe-makers Wavin, was opened this week in Zwolle, in the north-east of the Netherlands. A second path is to be installed in Giethoorn in Overijssel, and Rotterdam is the city most likely to take up the technology.
Its is believed that many of the benefits of the paths will apply to plastic roads.
The path’s inventors, Anne Koudstaal and Simon Jorritsma, said: “This first pilot is a big step towards a sustainable and future-proof road made of recycled plastic waste. When we invented the concept, we didn’t know how to build a plastic road, now we know.”
Asphalt concrete is responsible for 1.5m tonnes of CO2 emissions a year, equivalent to 2% of global road transport emissions.
When first announcing the concept in 2015, Jorritsma said: “You see a bottle; we see a road.”
Earlier this year the EU launched an urgent plan to clean up Europe’s act on plastic waste and ensure that every piece of packaging on the continent is reusable or recyclable by 2030.
Brussels’ strategy, which followed China’s decision to ban imports of foreign recyclable material, was designed to change minds in Europe, potentially tax damaging behaviour, and modernise plastics production and collection by investing €350m (£310m) in research. Each year, 25m tonnes of plastic waste is generated by Europeans, but less than 30% is collected for recycling.
Some doubts have been raised about the plastic path. Harmen Spek, from the anti-plastic lobby group Plastic Soup has warned that small particles of the plastic could find their way into the living environment due to heat, wear and run-off.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/13/a-road-full-of-bottlenecks-dutch-cycle-path-is-made-of-plastic-waste

You seem to be confusing the effect of atmospheric greenhouse gases and CO2.
BQEND
No, I'm not. At all.
BQSTART
70% of the greenhouse effect is from water vapour, not CO2. The total removal of CO2 would not leave an ice planet behind, though it would be significantly colder
BQEND
Sorry, that's just wrong. If the CO2 were to be removed, the temperature would begin to drop. Cooler air can hold less water vapor, so the water would begin to precipitate out. This would further lower the temperature, and the atmosphere could then hold even less water. This continues until there's virtually no water vapor left.
It's been estimated that atmospheric water content would completely collapse within months of the removal of the non-condensing GHGs.
With no CO2 and no water vapor, the planet would be eventually stabilize at a temperature that would be more than 30C colder than it is now. That is more than sufficient to freeze it over from pole to pole.
You will note that the reverse process also occurs: As the atmosphere warms, water content increases and the warming is amplified. This has, in fact, been observed in the current warming trend.

You are correct that water vapour is the dominant greenhouse gas, but the second statement is incorrect.
Atmospheric water vapour levels are determined by temperature. The cooling caused by removal of all CO2 would cause most of the water vapour to rain out, resulting in still greater cooling. In total, the Earth would cool by about 30 degrees C.

Simple engineering really. Tried and tested technology of 26 million petrol and diesel cars versus a handful of electric cars all under 5 years old. I have no idea how much it costs to service a Tesla over a 20 year period. Neither do you. Neither does Tesla. It's all very well to claim they are simple to service because there's a ""handful of moving parts"". As I'm sure you know, the batteries in a Tesla have an expected lifespan of 8 years. Is swapping them out cheaper than my $300 a year serving cost? Nope. Likewise, would you really want to be stick with an out of warranty Tesla that's broken down? Are the parts and labour going to be cheaper than taking a petrol car to your local garage for fixing? Nope.
So, to answer your question; servicing and repairs on my ""dinosaur"" BMW X5 costs me roughly $1000 a year. Over 20 years I make that $20K. A Tesla, if it'll last 20 years, will need two battery replacements in that time at a total of $60K. Hence the reason I drive a petrol BMW not a Tesla. If and when Tesla can build a car that I wouldn't be up all night fretting about the costs of fixing it out of warranty, and when I can pick up a used Tesla for what I paid for my car, and when the Tesla can be fully recharged in the same time it takes to fill my tank, then I'll consider one.

the motor and battery replacement costs are unknown
BQEND
The model S is still less than 8 years old but owners of the Tesla Roadster have had to pay $40,000 to buy new batteries because theirs' were kaput. The Roadster was in production from 2008 to 2012.
After 10 to 8 years you may have to pay half the price of the original cost of the vehicle, that strikes me than being far more expensive than owning a traditional car. 
WRT the model S, some owners have been told that they are not covered by the warranty because they used their cars commercially. In the video that I linked to, some fellow mentions the costs of replacing worn motors. He was using his car as a cab and bemoans the fact that Tesla honour the warranties on cabs working for a company that only uses Teslas, suggesting that Tesla were happy to break their own rules when it provides them with decent publicity.
Musk would have us believe that his cars are significantly cheaper to maintain. A friend of mine recently purchased an ex-demo Tesla model S, his first service cost £700. When I asked him why it was so high, he shrugged- he had no idea. Tesla seem to rather secretive about the work undertaken during the service, it may well be the case that they had to replace lots of components but they seem to want to keep owners in the dark about the fact that this or that fails. 
I seriously recommend that you watch the video that I linked to.

It cost her $150.90.
Wilson, 70, a retired farmer from near Biloela in central Queensland, had planned the trip of a lifetime with her husband, Rod. One impulsive evening in mid-2016 they went online and, sight-unseen, bought a Tesla S75 electric car for the journey.
A few months after Rod died last year, Sylvia announced to her family: “I think I’ll do that trip.
“Most of them were really keen. A couple of them said ‘you’re mad, you’ll never do it’,” Wilson told Guardian Australia.
It took Sylvia 110 days and 20,396km door to door to navigate the Round Australia Electric Vehicle Superhighway – a loop of charging stations. She is the first woman to drive the route and the second person to loop the country in a Tesla.
Her daughters, sisters, friends and a daughter-in law – in total seven different women – flew in and out from various points to keep her company along the way.
“I had to stick to a schedule because they had to book their flights, so there was no mucking around. I was flying blind to a certain extent. I booked all my accommodation, and that had to be tied in to what the car could do,” Wilson said.
My husband would have been tickled at how successful the trip was
Some of the more remote charging stations had never been used until Wilson rolled into town in Bluey, her affectionate name for the Tesla.
In the Kimberley, at Fitzroy Crossing, she arrived late on Friday afternoon and discovered the charging station not working.
“They found the only electrician in town and he came and did something and it worked,” she said.
At the next town over, Halls Creek, the power socket was at a business that was shut. At the local motel she found a 15amp power supply and was able to plug in overnight.
“They call it range anxiety. That’s what everyone talks about. It’s totally valid to have that, to be thinking about the next charge, once you’ve got an [electric vehicle].
“But the reality is that if you can see the lights on, or that the kettle works, then you can charge. Even in the remotest places you can still charge the car. In a way there are more places to charge an EV [electric vehicle] than there are a fossil fuel car.”
Sylvia recalls the night in mid-2016 when her husband Rod sat down beside her at the computer. By 9pm, they’d bought the Tesla.
Three months later, it turned up at their cattle farm, between Biloela and Gladstone, on the back of a truck.
“My husband and I, in the old days, disagreed on a lot of things,” Wilson said. “I was the greenie, he was the brownie. As he got older, I must have won I think. He became very concerned about the mess that we’re making of our little globe.
“He just started to take on board things like buying an electric car. I live off the grid here [with solar power] and charge the car off grid too. I couldn’t do those things without him wanting to do those things, too.
“He never drove it. He had Parkinson’s and he had a few problems because of that. It kind of amazed him that it was electric.
“I think he would have been tickled at how successful the trip was.”
Having the experience of driving around Australia – and fulfilling the dream she and Rod had planned – was only part of Sylvia’s motivation.
“My other purpose was to prove a point,” she said. “These are good cars and you’re not stuck to just going down to the shops.“The concern about the environment was front and centre. These cars are bloody expensive. But once you’ve paid for the car, your running costs are bugger all.”
The same trip would have, conservatively and based on city prices, cost more than $3,000 in petrol in a conventional sedan. Charging the car cost $150.90 in total, partly because people often did not want payment.
“Motel people and others who just let me charge and said ‘don’t worry about paying, off you go’. They treat it like a laptop or a phone.”
Wilson is recognised by 350.org in a report released on Wednesday as one of the “heroes building Australia’s low-carbon economy”. The report recognises investors, business leaders and everyday Australians whose private efforts to reduce carbon emissions are leading the way as the federal government backs away from the Paris agreement targets.The chief execuitve of 350.org Australia, Blair Palese, said people such as Wilson were filling a climate change “leadership void” that had been vacated by politicians.
… we can’t turn away from climate change. The Guardian’s environmental coverage reports the scientific facts, social consequences and political choices that are shaping the fate of our planet. As the world's leaders turn their backs on the environment, we are at a crisis point. Individual consumer choices are important, but we need collective action to achieve the systemic change that will really make a difference. Our pioneering and our fearless reporting on the environment can play a vital role in that. But we need our readers’ support.
More people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than ever before. And unlike many news organisations, we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our journalism accessible to all, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.
The Guardian is editorially independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the powerful and hold them to account. It’s what makes us different to so many others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.
Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. This support enables us to keep working as we do – but we must maintain and build on it for every year to come. Support The Guardian from as little as $1 – and it only takes a minute.

The highest level – the top of the scale for the most powerful, most devastating hurricane or tropical storm capable of destroying entire cities like New Orleans or New York – is a category 5 storm.
Meteorologists and scientists never imagined that there would be a need for a category 6 storm, with winds that exceed 200 miles per hour on a sustained basis, sweeping away everything in its path. Until now, such a storm wasn’t possible, so there was no need for a new category above category 5.
Right now, however, there is anywhere from 5 to 8% more water vapor circulating throughout the atmosphere than there was a generation ago. This, combined with warmer temperatures that are driving water up from the deep ocean in places where hurricanes typically form, has created the potential for superstorms that we haven’t seen before – and aren’t really prepared for.
This combination of warmer oceans and more water in the earth’s atmosphere – whipsawed by sustained periods of drier and wetter conditions in regions of the world that create superstorms – is now starting to create storms with conditions that look precisely what a category 6 hurricane would look like.
No one in America has ever experienced the wrath and fury of a category 6 hurricane, which now genuinely seems possible and realistic. We’ve been lucky. Unofficial category 6 hurricanes have appeared in other parts of the world, and we’re seeing much stronger storms on a regular basis. It’s only a matter of time before one hits the US.
When it does, it will come as quite a shock. The devastation we saw in 2017 in Houston, several Caribbean islands, and Puerto Rico may actually pale in comparison.
Jeff Masters, one of the most respected meteorologists in America, has begun to wonder publicly about the potential for a category 6 hurricane. He launched a lively debate among his colleagues with a provocative post in July of 2016 on the Weather Underground – a thought-provoking piece that prompted the Weather Channel and others to weigh in with their thoughts and theories as well.
“A ‘black swan’ hurricane – a storm so extreme and wholly unprecedented that no one could have expected it – hit the Lesser Antilles Islands in October 1780,” Masters wrote to open the post. “Deservedly called The Great Hurricane of 1780, no Atlantic hurricane in history has matched its death toll of 22,000. So intense were the winds of the Great Hurricane that it peeled the bark off of trees – something only EF5 tornadoes with winds in excess of 200mph have been known to do.”
Masters then made the startling claim that such a “black swan” hurricane was not only possible now but almost certain to occur more than once. He said that such storms should more properly be called “grey swan” hurricanes because the emerging science clearly showed that such “bark-stripping” mega-storms are nearly certain to start appearing.
“Hurricanes even more extreme than the Great Hurricane of 1780 can occur in a warming climate, and can be anticipated by combining physical knowledge with historical data,” wrote Masters, who once flew into the strongest hurricane at the time as one of Noaa’s “Hurricane Hunters” in the 1980s. “Such storms, which have never occurred in the historical record, can be referred to as ‘grey swan’ hurricanes.”
Masters based his bold prediction on research by two of the best hurricane scientists in the world – Kerry Emanuel of MIT and Ning Lin of Princeton – who published the most detailed hurricane model in history in August 2015. Emanuel and Lin’s hurricane model was embedded within six different worldwide climate models routinely run by supercomputers.
“The term ‘black swan’ is a metaphor for a high-consequence event that comes as a surprise. Some high-consequence events that are unobserved and unanticipated may nevertheless be predictable,” they wrote in Nature Climate Change. “Such events may be referred to as ‘grey swans’ (or, sometimes, ‘perfect storms’). Unlike truly unpredicted and unavoidable black swans, which can be dealt with only by fast reaction and recovery, grey swans – although also novel and outside experience – can be better foreseen and systematically prepared for.”
Lin and Emanuel said their research showed that not only were grey swan hurricanes now likely to occur, one such devastating hurricane would almost certainly hit the Persian Gulf region – a place where tropical cyclones have never even been seen in history. They identified a “potentially large risk in the Persian Gulf, where tropical cyclones have never been recorded, and larger-than-expected threats in Cairns, Australia, and Tampa, Florida”.
Emanuel and Lin showed that the risk of such extreme grey swan hurricanes in Tampa, Cairns, and the Persian Gulf increased by up to a factor of 14 over time as Earth’s climate changed.
In the event of such a storm, city officials may have no idea what they truly face. At least one city planning document (from 2010) anticipated that a category 5 hurricane could cause 2,000 deaths and $250bn in damage. But it could be far worse.
“A storm surge of 5 meters is about 17 feet, which would put most of Tampa underwater, even before the sea level rises there,” Emanuel told reporters. “Tampa needs to have a good evacuation plan, and I don’t know if they’re really that aware of the risks they actually face.”
A city like Dubai is even more unprepared, Emanuel said. Dubai, and the rest of the Persian Gulf, has never seen a hurricane in recorded history. Any hurricane, of any magnitude, would be an unprecedented event. But his models say that one is likely to occur there at some point.
“Dubai is a city that’s undergone a really rapid expansion in recent years, and people who have been building it up have been completely unaware that that city might someday have a severe hurricane,” Emanuel said. “Now they may want to think about elevating buildings or houses, or building a seawall to somehow protect them, just in case.”
Following Masters’s provocative post, many of his meteorologist colleagues weighed in. The Weather Channel predicted that a category 6 hurricane, and a change in the scale to accommodate it, may be on its way.
“Jeff Masters got the entire weather community thinking: could there be a Category Six hurricane?” Brian Donegan wrote on the network’s site. “Last year, Hurricane Patricia reached maximum sustained winds of 215mph in the eastern Pacific Ocean. It was the most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere.”
A fellow meteorologist, Paul Huttner, said Patricia makes it all but certain that we’ll see category 6 hurricanes. “Many meteorological observers [were] stunned at how rapidly Patricia blew up from tropical storm to one of the strongest category 5 hurricanes on earth in just 24 hours,” Huttner wrote for Minnesota Public Radio.
Whether we call them category 6 hurricanes – or simply category 5 hurricanes with really fast, violent winds that are up to 60mph above the upper end of the current scale that can appear literally overnight over warm oceans – we need to be ready for these superstorms capable of taking out cities like Dubai or Tampa. They are here, right now. The devastation we saw in Houston, Puerto Rico, and the Caribbean in the fall of 2017 is a clear warning.
We ignore the implications at our peril.

The time has come for Australia to stop growing rice because it is too thirsty a crop, an expert says.
Dr Eric Craswell, from the Australian National University's Fenner School of Environment and Society, said rice used 10 times as much water as some other crops.
Dr Craswell says rice should no longer be planted in the Murray-Darling Basin, and the water be allowed to flow through the river system to help the environment.
""People have said you shouldn't single out particular industries but I think in the case of rice there is an argument,"" he told AAP.
""Instead of growing rice in the very wet years, let that water go down the river to rejuvenate the wetlands.""
Saying most Australian rice was exported, Dr Craswell questioned why the nation was growing rice for overseas markets when water was running so low.

Mr Marsh went to court, seeking more than $80,000 in compensation.

They see these same people claiming that cyclical droughts are simply non-human induced repetitive natural cycles with a predictability based on a regular past, and these same people want bail-outs for these very same declaredly predictable droughts, as if planning for them were not possible. They see farming community electorates repeatedly voting for political parties that demonstrably and over time show no interest in conservation or sustainability even for farming itself, presumably based on the above contradiction.
They see the farming industry tied to the supermarket cartel. They are told, don't criticise the farmers. Who puts food on your table? Well, the answer to that question for 90% of the population, is Coles-Woolworths who, like Walmart, will source food overseas if necessary, or form subsidiaries and rent or buy up massive tracts of land for produce, if necessary. The farmers themselves are not necessary - the food cartel could and would do it itself, if the legal and political mood was right. It is better for Australia if that never happens, but things need to change to prevent such outcomes.
It appears to be a sort of group madness looking from the outside-in that people involved in the primary work of the agriculture industry would be ignorantly rubbishing - or saying nonsense like 'the science isn't settled' regarding - anthropomorphic climate change.

Those two sentences are the opening lines to a new advertisement challenging the federal government’s stance on climate change and the drought in Australia’s eastern states.
The 30-second ad will begin airing on commercial channels this week and will be beamed into politically important suburban areas of Australia’s three largest capital cities during the NRL grand final on 30 September.
The advertisement has been paid for by the Australian Conservation Foundation and features Brown, a sheep and cattle farmer who runs a 45,000 acre property 65km south of Longreach in central west Queensland.
Brown is a fourth-generation grazier whose family property has been affected by drought.
In the clip, she calls for “politicians to stop dancing around the issue and help us to do something about this”.
“We need to stick to the Paris agreement, we need to stop burning coal and we need to commit to more renewable energy,” she says.
The campaign comes after the prime minister, Scott Morrison, described the drought as his highest priority but said the conversation about the connection between drought and climate change should be left “for another day”.
Last week hundreds of farmers and their supporters rallied outside Parliament House in Canberra demanding action on climate change.
Farmers for Climate Action board member and third-generation NSW farmer Peter Holding told the crowd that praying for rain – referencing comments by Morrison earlier this month – “is not going to cut it”.
Brown said she had become increasingly disappointed at Canberra’s unwillingness to discuss the current drought in the context of climate change.
“I think no matter where you stand or what your perspective is, droughts are part of a climate and you can’t separate those two issues,” she said.
“If you’re going to be serious about supporting farmers through drought and adapting to drought-stricken conditions, you need to be talking about climate change.”
She said many farmers were already changing their practices to try to adapt to warmer temperatures.
“It’s not going to work for everyone but there are some interesting management solutions out there,” she said. “These are the kinds of things I’d like to see governments working on as well.”
Kelly O’Shanassy, the chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation, said Australia could no longer put off talking about how climate change is making extreme weather events worse.
“We are launching this TV ad to try prompt the national discussion our prime minister doesn’t seem to want to have,” she said.
“Farmers, along with many others in our community, are on the frontline of climate damage. We must have their backs. Inaction on climate change both here and abroad has real-world implications for the safety and productivity of our country.”
A poll published last week showed the Morrison government is politically vulnerable on climate policy, with a growing number of Australians saying they are concerned about climate change and want action.
The prime minister has declared Australia will not pull out of Paris but also abandoned the national energy guarantee that imposed an emissions reduction target on the electricity sector.
New data published by NDEVR Environmental on Friday shows Australia is on track to miss its Paris targets, and the country’s emissions, excluding land use data, were the highest on record for the third year running.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/16/drought-stricken-farmers-challenge-coalitions-climate-change-stance-in-tv-ad

Which local species of fauna and flora are disappearing from your local area? What is being done to preserve and protect them – and with how much success? Perhaps you work in conservation and would like to tell us about the work you’re doing, or are simply a nature enthusiast who cares about protecting a particular species. In this month’s episode, our panel will be responding to your questions on this subject, so we’d love you to get in touch, wherever you are in the world.
Guardian columnist George Monbiot recently wrote about the demise of many aspects of the natural world, citing a UN report that our use of natural resources has tripled in 40 years. The great expansion of mining, logging, meat production and industrial fishing is cleansing the planet of its wild places and natural wonders. What economists proclaim as progress, ecologists recognise as ruin. “Walking in the countryside or snorkelling in the sea”, he says, “is now as painful to me as an art lover would find visits to a gallery, if on every occasion another old master had been cut from its frame.”
The reaction to this piece and others by Monbiot demonstrates that this is a subject close to our readers’ hearts. But then, it always has been: the Guardian’s century-old column Country Diary, which looks at natural history and the countryside, has been a readers’ favourite since it began.
We have also looked at the uncertain fate of the much-loved puffin in places such as Scotland, Norway and Iceland. And even the impact of Brexit on seabirds and dolphins. We are committed to quality environment coverage, but with each generation, another aspect of our environment is lost, and preserving what came before becomes even more difficult.
In Trump’s America, a commitment to protecting endangered animals has been caught in the crosshairs of a drive by the president to increase industry – a move which many have described as short-term thinking at its worst. In his opinion piece on the topic, Andrew Rosenberg says: “Wolves, bears, sage grouse: these are animals of incredible beauty that enrich our ecological landscape. But other, less charismatic species, like burying beetles and freshwater mussels, are at risk too – all because their presence is inconvenient for some economic activities. Unfortunately, species are not just ‘nice to have’. They are part of living, breathing ecosystems.”
There is a slowly increasing awareness of the impact of human behaviour on the natural world. For some species, it sadly is too late to take action, and for others – endangered or at risk of becoming so – there is a lot of work to be done.

A ReachTel poll of 690 residents across the federal electorate of Hume, which reaches from Boorowa in the southern tablelands of New South Wales to Camden on Sydney’s southern fringe, was commissioned by the Australia Institute. It found the sample was divided over a range of climate and energy questions, but more people supported stronger action on emissions reduction than opposed it.
Asked whether the government’s Paris target of 26% to 28% should be increased “so Australia reduces emissions faster, decreased so Australia does less, or kept the same” – 42.3% said increased, 29.4% said kept the same, and 22.5% said reduced.
Asked whether the now dumped national energy guarantee should include an emissions reduction target, 47.8% said yes, and 39.3% said no.
There was also local opposition to coal, with 63.7% of the sample either supporting or strongly supporting a moratorium on building new coal mines, while 67.4% supported the Morrison government reviewing the Adani coal mine’s environmental approval.
Ben Oquist, the executive director of the Australia Institute, said the poll results suggested voters in rural electorates, “just like the population overall, are not enamoured with coal and they want more action on climate change, not less”.
Taylor confirmed in question time on Tuesday that the Morrison government would not replace the renewable energy target with an alternative policy after it wound down in 2020.
Taylor confirmed there would be no policy to reduce emissions in the electricity sector during an answer to the Greens MP Adam Bandt in question time on Tuesday.
Bandt asked whether the RET could be extended beyond 2020 given there was currently no policy mechanism to replace it, and the lack of settled policy could threaten investment in low-emissions technology.
The energy minister flatly rejected the idea. “The truth of the matter is the renewable energy target is going to wind down from 2020, it reaches its peak in 2020, and we won’t be replacing that with anything.”
Taylor said there was no need to focus on emissions reduction, because emissions in electricity would fall by 26% “without additional intervention” – a declaration that contradicts advice from the Energy Security Board.
The Coalition’s plan to 2030 was to replace the RET with the national energy guarantee, which imposed an emissions reduction target for electricity.
But Malcolm Turnbull abandoned the Neg as one of his last acts in the prime ministership, and the policy has now been junked officially by the cabinet under Scott Morrison’s leadership.
Bandt later declared the Liberals were “openly boasting that they have no renewable energy policy”. He said the RET needed to be extended beyond 2020 “to avoid a valley of death for renewable energy”.
“Over 2018 and 2019, new renewables are going up in Australia at record rates. This is in large part due to the RET, which even the Energy Security Board and Reserve Bank have said is a big driver of future power bill cuts,” Bandt said.
“But the RET runs out in 2020 and now the minister has confirmed that there’s no renewables policy to take its place. If the RET isn’t extended, there’s a real risk that the next government will not be able to implement a new policy in time to avoid an investment drought.”
Labor also jumped on Taylor’s declaration. The shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, branded Taylor the minister “for higher power prices and anti-renewables”.

Forecourt plug-in hybrids will also have to disappear by 2035 at the latest, according to analysis by the German Aerospace Centre (DLR), commissioned by Greenpeace.
Vehicle emissions have barely changed over the last decade and the industry will exhaust its carbon budget within five to 10 years unless there is a radical shift, the DLR scientists say.
“Auto CO2-emissions need to peak as soon as possible,” Prof Horst Friedrich, DLR’s director, told the Guardian. “Looking at the dwindling carbon budget it is crucial to push low-emitting cars into the market, the earlier the better, to renew the fleet.”
The study warns that “stark measures” would be needed to do this with a 66% chance of meeting the 1.5C goal – including a drop in conventional car sales from around 15m this year to 5m in 2022.
Under this scenario, the last vehicle with an internal combustion engine would be sold in 2028 and diesel and petrol powered-cars would be banished from the roads by the mid-2040s.
Behavioural change towards walking, cycling and public transport would also be necessary.
“It would be much easier to keep a 2C target because there is a higher carbon budget and therefore more time to implement the necessary measures,” Friedrich said. “I estimate it could provide us with up to 10 years more time to prepare much better for the fundamental transformations necessary.”
A draft report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change makes clear that 2C of warming would expose around 10 million more people in coastal areas to floods, storm surges and crop damage than 1.5C would. Global sea levels would also rise by an extra 10cm, heatwaves would be longer, extreme weather events stronger, economic growth lower, while crop yields and water availability would substantially decline.
So far, the European commission has proposed a 30% cut in vehicle emissions by 2030, although MEPs are pushing to raise that figure to 45%.
The UK government has announced that sales of all new petrol and diesel vehicles will be banned by 2040, while some countries including Germany, Ireland, India and the Netherlands have set a more ambitious deadline of 2030.
Energy utilities have often led calls for greater ambition and Kristian Ruby, the secretary general of Eurelectric, the power sector trade association, said that the current EU proposal was “not in line with the Paris objectives”.
He told the Guardian: “The timeline of a full phase out by 2030 does sound quite ambitious. Car makers are only ramping up now for around 20 new electric models that will come to market next year. But this needs to happen, and faster than currently seen by the European commission. There is no doubt about that.”
Some analysts also believe that Europe’s car manufacturers have made no real-world improvement in auto CO2 emissions for five years, because of the “gaming” of emissions tests.
A spokesperson for the European Automobile Manufacturers Association said: “It is still hard to predict whether the alternative powertrains will have gained a significantly high market share by 2030. This is dependent on factors that are outside the control of automobile manufacturers, such as the necessary recharging infrastructure being in place as well appropriate incentives.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/20/eu-must-end-new-petrol-and-diesel-car-sales-by-2030-to-meet-climate-targets-report

Here is a quote from a report from HSE (my bold):
BQSTART
CO2 is commonly thought of as posing a threat to life through asphyxiation when it displaces the oxygen in air down to dangerously low levels. For CO2 to reduce the oxygen concentration in air down to a level that is immediately dangerous to life, the CO2 concentration would need to be in the order of 50% v/v. Evidence shows, however, that CO2 does create an immediate threat to life at a concentration of only 15% in air due to the toxicological impact it has on the body when inhaled at this concentration. 
In humans, CO2 is a normal component of blood gases at low concentrations, however, at high exposure inhalation levels it is lethal. In humans one of the most powerful stimuli known to affect the respiration is CO2 and this results in humans being very sensitive to changes in CO2 concentrations. The inhalation of elevated concentrations of CO2 can increase the acidity of the blood triggering adverse effects on the respiratory, cardiovascular and central nervous systems. Depending on the CO2 concentration inhaled and exposure duration, toxicological symptoms in humans range from headaches (in the order of 3% for 1 hour), increased respiratory and heart rate, dizziness, muscle twitching, confusion, unconsciousness, coma and death (in the order of >15% for 1 minute).
At CO2 concentrations in excess of 50% in air whether a person dies due to the toxicological effect of CO2 inhalation or due to oxygen depletion is not clear and arguably immaterial. In both cases death would be the outcome.

But what they are not saying is that so long as wages are suppressed, even if a million jobs are created, most of that extra output only creates far more money that distributes upward to the already-wealthy and the stock-market booms while the income of the working class virtually flat-lines as the cost of living and/or inflation wipe out whatever gains the working class is allowed by the corporations.

Jet streams may start, stop, split into two or more parts, combine into one stream, or flow in various directions including opposite to the direction of the remainder of the jet.
The strongest jet streams are the polar jets, at 9–12 km (30,000–39,000 ft) above sea level, and the higher altitude and somewhat weaker subtropical jets at 10–16 km (33,000–52,000 ft). The Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere each have a polar jet and a subtropical jet.

Well ladies & Gents,USA pollution, coal ash rides the jet stream and pollutes the planet. Trump does not believe in science, so he and the Koch brothers will NOT be putting better scrubbers on our coal power plants to save lives.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Coal ash contains arsenic, lead, mercury, and selenium, as well as aluminum, barium, boron, and chlorine. All can be toxic. Particularly where there is prolonged exposure, these toxins can cause cancer, heart damage, lung disease, respiratory distress, kidney disease, reproductive problems, gastrointestinal illness, birth defects, impaired bone growth in children, and behavioral problems. In short, coal ash toxics have the potential to injure all of the major organ systems in adults (including pregnant women) and children.
Exposure to toxic coal ash can lower birth rates, cause tissue disease, slow development, and even kill plants and animals, leading to changes in wildlife concentrations and disruptions to entire ecosystems. The toxic pollution from coal ash builds up in exposed animals and plants, causing the pollution to make its way up the food chain when they are eaten. Children are more susceptible to the health impacts of coal ash—and according to the EPA----------------------------------------------------------------------------------content.sierraclub.org/coal/disposal-ash-waste

I'm all for it, don't get me wrong- again, if your goal is to improve lifestyles, clean air is important but clean water is much more important- and clean living is the most important.

But regardless of whether this is actually a force we're dealing with or whether it's a side affect that has no real impact on our lives, I do believe that humans are destined to follow the path of all living things not only as individuals but also as a species - born, grow, die. And whether we do it to ourselves or a comet does it for us, I seriously doubt we'll survive as a species. Take a look at the middle east as an example of where we're headed. That's a place where basic resources are a struggle. Yes, they have oil but oil won't last much longer (think longer than a few decades here, that is, long term by human standards). Think human nature and hate, grudges, beliefs so strong people are willing to kill and die for them. The middle east is nothing more than sections of ideology and each one more righteous than the other. People are right now pushing us even further into that hole. Look at brexit. Govs failing around the world like argentina, brazil, just about all of the middle east, russia, greece, italy to name a few. There are people who want to wall everyone else off and suggesting other countries do the same. We mistreat people who want a better life for themselves and will kill off anyone who gets in our way. Our political system is now embedded with hate and plenty of politicians who don't care because, short term, it means victory in their districts.
The world has been an easy place to live - so far. But consider that weather alone will change a lot of what we took for granted. People are now experiencing 500 year storms every year or two. Hmmm.....time to change the scale so we can stop saying that! Great solution. A little more heat and the worlds farming will change - drastically. It's already happening but people are too ingrained in their points of view to see it. Same with our oceans. 
Yet people are still saying the same things without any concern for the level of knowledge necessary to make those assertions. One of my recent favs is a flood survivor stating that our weather can't be changing due to the industrial revolution because back in the 1800's the temps didn't change so how can industrial pollution be a problem? When science becomes to much for the average citizen they simply default to their religious beliefs that their god will solve all problems.

Social media could be a democratizing influence but the commercial emphasis is on ""narrowcasting"" above broadcasting, and to the extent that Internet is architecturally democratizing, corporate media are doing a bang up job of converting it into one they are able to dominate. Tweets are Newspeak for the 21St Century. Look at the Presidident's tweets and compare and contrast with the Lincoln Douglas Debates. TV has been rotting brains and warping our view of reality for decades. Philo T Farnsworth, the person who invented the first practical TV system (we now call ""analog"" as opposed to ""digital"") said he had ""created a monster"" and would not allow his kids to watch it.

Improbable. Greed, fear, apathy and irrational denial have a much longer history that than the industrial age and would seem to more of a bug than a feature in basic human nature. The Bible (which I regard as a human creation, but nevertheless an uncommonly rich one) states that the ""love of money"" is the ""root of all evil"". To my way of thinking sociopathy, the absence of compassion, conscience, or sense of responsibility with regard to others is pretty much evil in a nutshell, but if by ""love"" (which in one sense IS compassion) in it's disembodied usage (such as I love ice cream ) as the thing you care about above all else and would sacrifice other things for, love of money (or power, of which money is a subset) maps onto the concept of sociopathy pretty well, and power is an equal opportunity corrupter.

Is that why we don’t do anything about it? | James Bridle,article,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/24/air-pollution-cognitive-improvement-environment,0,"In Mike Judge’s 2006 comedy, Idiocracy, the participants in an ill-fated cryogenics experiment awake 500 years in the future to discover that due to dysgenic mutation, anti-intellectualism and corporate capitalism the intelligence of the population has fallen to dangerous levels. The president is sponsored by fast-food chain Carl’s Jr., and crops are failing because the fields are irrigated with energy drinks. The film was abandoned by its studio and largely ignored at the box office, but its subsequent cult status might be in danger once again, this time from the overbearing reality of present events.
Researchers from Beijing University and Yale School of Health published research last month showing that people who live in major cities – which is, today, most of us – are not only suffering from increases in respiratory illnesses and other chronic conditions due to air pollution, but are losing our cognitive functions. The study showed that high pollution levels lead to significant drops in test scores in language and arithmetic, with the impact on some participants equivalent to losing several years of education. Other studies have shown that high air pollution is linked to premature birth, low birth weight, mental illness in children and dementia in the elderly.
We’re only just beginning to understand how the air we breathe affects not just our physical environment, but our mental capacity as well. And the air we breathe is changing in the long term, as well as the short. Rising carbon dioxide levels – the main driver of climate change – aren’t just a hazard to the earth and other living creatures, they’re also affecting our thinking. At higher levels, CO2 clouds the mind: it makes us slower and less likely to develop new ideas, it degrades our ability to take in new information, change our minds, or formulate complex thoughts.
Global atmospheric CO2 levels passed 400 parts per million in 2016, and despite global agreements to keep runaway climate change under control, little action has been taken. The very worst-case scenario – AKA business as usual, which is the track we’re on – predicts atmospheric CO2 concentration of 1,000ppm by 2100. At 1,000ppm, human cognitive ability drops by 21%.
This isn’t merely a problem for the future – as if that would make it better. As we come to understand more about the effects of CO2, we have been measuring more of it, and finding that as it increases outside, it increases inside, too. Outdoor CO2 already reaches 500ppm regularly in industrial cities; indoors, in poorly ventilated homes or school workplaces, it can regularly exceed 1,000ppm. A study of bedrooms in Denmark found that overnight concentrations of CO2 exceeded 2,000ppm, with measurable effects on student’s performance the following day.
Schools in California and Texas, when measured in 2012, regularly exceeded 2,000ppm in the daytime. And the kind of “green” insulation used to improve the heat retention of buildings – a climate change mitigation process – also raises the levels of CO2 trapped inside.
Even if we meet the most stringent targets set at the Paris agreements in 2015, 2100 will bring atmospheric CO2 levels of 660ppm – with around a 15% decrease in average brainpower. It’s possibly one of the most tragic ironies of the whole sorry business that climate change is making it harder for us to think, just when we need new and bold ideas to deal with its effects.
Rather than taking action to mitigate this process, we find case and case again of companies actively trying to increase emissions. Volkswagen notoriously spent years creating complex, embedded software to bypass emissions tests, with the result that cars certified for use in the US actually emitted nitrogen oxide at 40 times the legal limit. In Europe, where the same “defeat devices” were found, and where thousands more of the vehicles were sold, it’s been estimated that 1,200 people will die a decade earlier due to VW’s emissions – and many more, as we now know, will have cognitive difficulties.
It’s hard not to see an allegory between Volkswagen’s manipulation of opaque technologies and the ways in which we are being manipulated more broadly by the largely unaccountable systems we engage with every day. Multiple studies have shown that the way in which social media regulates our information intake for profit leaves us more divided, less politically aware, and increasingly prejudiced and violent. YouTube recently suggested I should follow an archive clip of US anchorman Walter Cronkite warning about climate change all the way back in 1980, with a 30-minute conspiracy lecture titled How the Global Warming Scare Began. Mental pollution comes in many forms.
The US Environmental Protection Agency announced recently that it was reconsidering Obama-era rules governing the emission of mercury from coal-fired power plants. Symptoms of mercury poisoning include emotional instability, insomnia, reduced cognitive function and memory loss. It was the use of mercury to stiffen hat brims that caused an epidemic of dementia among milliners in the 18th and 19th centuries, the origin of the phrase “mad as a hatter”. It’s hard to think of a measure better tuned to cancelling the future than raising the amount of mercury in the environment, or an act more in keeping with our times than intentionally increasing the recklessness, forgetfulness and stupidity of the population.
But then those in charge of our affairs currently have their own chemical load to shed. Since the 1980s, one common pollutant we have managed to curtail is lead, mostly by excluding it from paint, plumbing and petrol. As a result there has been a 4.5-point rise in IQ points in those born after 1985. Those who grew up in Europe and North America between 1965 and 1985 – the cohort who are running things right now – were regularly found to be carrying 20 micrograms per decilitre levels of lead in their bloodstream, which can lead to far greater levels of long-term cognitive impairment than those reported in studies of contemporary air pollution. If you want one simple explanation for the wildly differing political attitudes between current generations, and some of the irrational paths we seem hellbent on taking at present, you could do worse than take lead poisoning into account. Brain damage, it seems, is the one thing the baby boomers are willing to pass on to their kids.

I grew up in New Orleans. When you’re brought up there you realize you’re below sea level: you see boats beyond the levee that are actually higher than you on the street.
When Hurricane Katrina hit, we were prepared and realized we had to get out of Dodge. We headed to stay with family in Houston.
I saw the pictures of the hurricane on and I thought: “Oh my gosh, everything I remember about this city has gone.” There was a TV shot of my neighborhood; instead of a boulevard, it was a bayou. I called the kids in and said: “I think we’ve lost everything. We’ve lost our lives there.”
I decided to move on even before I saw my house. Going back to New Orleans just reaffirmed that. The whole city smelled of death, it was rotting. It was horribly depressing. The water was up to the eaves of our house and all we managed to salvage was half a briefcase of items. Everything else, my music, my books, my memorabilia, was gone.
We moved to Houston. I managed to get a job in software development. We didn’t appear to be in harm’s way when Hurricane Harvey hit last year but I’ve never seen a flood of that magnitude before.
Even as the water rose I thought: “This will peak soon.” But it rose, sat stable for a while, continued to rise and when it came into the house I thought: “This is crazy.” There was this intense feeling of denial, thinking about how this couldn’t happen again. There was a lot of shock and that night was hard – all the sewage was backing up, we had to stay on our beds to keep out of the water.
We had friends nearby who got us out the next day in boats. There’s maybe one out of every five houses around here with a for sale sign because of the flooding now. I joke that towns should pay me to not move there in order to avoid being flooded.
We will stay, though – I mean, the chances of being hit by a third storm are pretty slim. Things aren’t looking great for our planet but let’s face it, I’m not living on geologic time.
Chantel Comardelle, relocating with entire community from the Louisiana coast
Isle de Jean Charles is an island on the Louisiana coast that was settled by native American families who were pushed out of the city because they were native. It’s as far as you can go down the bayou, you don’t go there by accident.
We have a very distinct culture. Our tribal family were fishermen, they lived off the land and traded with other communities. It was a close-knit community, everyone watched out for each other. We played stickball, did beadwork.
I was born on the island but had to leave when I was four years old because a hurricane flooded our trailer and I became very sick. The doctor said I couldn’t go back because of the mold so we made the difficult decision to move to Houma.
I noticed the changes when driving down to see family on the island. There used to be land on either side of the road and now it’s just open water. Everyone used to have gardens and now they don’t, the salt water kills everything. On the other side of the levee there was marsh but now it’s all water, it’s all going.
A lot of younger people have moved away as you can’t put every house on 15ft stilts. You couldn’t get the school bus down the flooded road. [The tribe] made the decision to relocate and managed to get a grant from the federal government in 2016 to start that process.
We looked through sites and we now have somewhere about 30 miles away – construction will begin be sometime at the end of next year for 150 lots. It’s very slow. It’s been frustrating and also scary because of the risk of hurricanes.
The plan is to rebuild the community, make it what it was. There are still some people who are not ready to move, especially older people, and you have to be respectful of people’s wishes. My grandma is 92 and she’s never lived anywhere else but the island – for her to move to a new community is a big ask.
We are called climate refugees, but I hate that term. “Refugee” suggests something with no clear plan or action but we have a clear plan and are doing this as a unified tribe. Most people believe we have to move because of climate change and also because the oil companies dug canals that allowed salt water to intrude further. It’s like we’ve hit the fast forward button on the environment.
We will be the first ones to face this in the modern US but we won’t be the last. It’s important for us to get it right so other communities know that they can do it, too.
Gaye Marie Thurmond, moved to safer ground in Houston
I lived in the same house for 40 years with my late husband and children. They’ve grown up and gone now. We were flooded for three years in a row and Hurricane Harvey was absolutely the last straw.
We were never in the flood plain before, never really flooded … and then, bingo. I think it’s because of the overdevelopment in Houston. We are near a gully and when the water backs up we flood because it’s flat here.
I renovated and put the house up for sale after flooding in 2015, but when people heard it had been flooded they weren’t interested.
We got 17 inches of water with Harvey. I think it gave me PTSD, my brain was in a fog. People are still suffering down here because of it.
I stayed with a friend for eight months because I was flat-out homeless. Every room had to be gutted and replaced. I suffered a lot of loss, but others suffered much more.
There was a [government-run] buyout program for flood-prone houses and I’d applied after the 2015 flood. Exactly one week before Harvey, I had the first monetary offer for my home. I didn’t have much time to think about it, we went back and forth, they said they’d pay for my moving costs and I thought: “I’m good, I’m done.”
It was hard to walk away from a home where you raised your children and your husband had died. But I had to get somewhere away from the flood plain. I got somewhere in the north-west of the city, it doesn’t flood there. By the end I would’ve just accepted living in a tipi just to have my own place.
I went back to the old house after they razed it. I bawled like a baby when I heard it had gone but I drove up to see it. It was beautiful. I had six pecan trees, a grapefruit tree – they had left them there next to the grass. It was like a pocket park. Anyone can enjoy that park now.
Dan Kipnis, who is leaving Miami Beach
I’m 68. My father bought a house in Miami Beach back in the day. Back then, it was pretty laid-back.
Now, the development is crazy. I can’t believe they are still developing, they will still be building when they have water lapping at their feet. I’m now spending close to $20,000 a year on insurance because of the floods and the storms.
The house is for sale because I want to get the value out of it before the shit hits the fan. I did list it for $3.2m, but it’s been on the market for two years and is now it’s down to $1.9m.
I’m now spending close to $20,000 a year on insurance because of the floods and the storms
I’m going to move to Palm Beach with my wife, rent an apartment and not give a shit if it floods because it’ll be a rental. I don’t care. I’ve been preaching about this problem for 15 years to try to wake people up. I want to get away from all the craziness, ripping up the streets to raise them, putting in new sewers, water pumps. The traffic is crazy.
I am a boat captain and I first noticed something wasn’t right in about 1974. I saw that the barnacles were getting higher up the bridge pilings. Barnacles have to be in water all the time, and they were getting higher and higher, moving by inches.
I used to catch snapper, groupers, Spanish mackerel, amberjacks. I had 11 people working for me. I don’t fish here any more because there’s so much algae in Biscayne Bay that it’s basically dead.
The other boat captains know that the water covers the dock now and it didn’t before. But most of them voted for [Donald] Trump, they don’t care, they are very conservative people. It’s better to speak to the young people. It’s going to be much worse for them. We are really screwing them over.
Laura Witham Spink, left Virginia Beach
My husband was a navy officer at the base in Norfolk so we we moved to Virginia Beach, not too far away, in 1999. We have four children.
In 2006 we moved to a bigger house in what was a very quiet neighborhood. By 2017 development was popping up everywhere, and I also noticed that there was flooding from heavy rains, just regular storms.
Hurricane Matthew caused our home to be an island – the water came to the top of the car tires. After that the flooding became a nuisance and then a bit scary, we had to find a way around the water to find a way home. It flooded every time it rained. There were two roads into the neighborhood and when they were flooded we would park in the 7-Eleven and walk home. I kept rubber boots in the car.
The city decided to put a four-lane road in front of where we lived and the flooding was only going to get worse, so we thought we should sell or we’d never get out of this place. It is a pretty place but has just been given over to developers.
We made a loss on the house, sold it for $30,000 less than we paid for it. We never met the new buyer, no one ever asked about the flooding. They were from Virginia Beach so I’m surprised that they didn’t didn’t do their homework; I suppose they wanted a bigger house in a good school district.
We waited for the last child to leave high school and we moved. We liked the character of Norfolk and it’s near my husband’s job. Norfolk floods too but they are proactive about it – we did our research.
We have spent six months renovating so we are here for good. I’m not sure insurance will always be available if we went anywhere else on the coast.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/24/climate-refugees-new-orleans-houston-hurricane-katrina-hurricane-harvey

But these perceived interlopers are starkly different from Donald Trump’s imagination.
They are American, mainly white and are fleeing the unlivable heat.
Arizona’s vast sweep of landscapes stretches from the scorched western movie backdrop of the Sonoran desert in the south, past rusty red sandstone outcrops further north in Sedona until you ascend to Flagstaff, a pleasant city carved into the largest expanse of ponderosa pine trees in the world, at an elevation of 7,000ft.
Flagstaff, population 70,000, has long been a destination for people in southern Arizona looking for a cooling respite in summer or a spot of skiing on the nearby San Francisco Peaks in winter.
But rising temperatures, driven by human-induced climate change, mean that many in Flagstaff fret they are now being overrun by those fleeing sweltering cities such as Phoenix and Tucson. A pattern of climate-driven gentrification is taking hold across the US, as those who are able to retreat from floods, storms, heatwaves and wildfires shift to safer areas, bringing soaring property and rental values with them.
“As it gets hotter, we are getting a lot of climate refugees,” said Coral Evans, Flagstaff’s mayor. “We don’t mind people moving to Flagstaff at all. But about 25% of our housing is now second homes. The cost of living is our number one issue.
“We don’t talk much about what climate change means for social justice. But where are low-income people going to live? How can they afford to stay in this city?”
There are usually a tangle of reasons – jobs, love, education – as to why people decide to move, but Flagstaff’s agreeable climate is jostling towards the front. Last summer, Phoenix was so hot that road signs and mailboxes melted. Planes couldn’t take off or land. On a recent July day this year, when Phoenix hit 116F (47C), Flagstaff, a two-hour drive and a world away, was 80F (27C).
Amanda Ormond moved to Phoenix in 1985, first working in bars after leaving college before becoming a clean energy consultant.
Ormond recalls stuffing her children into thick coats when trawling houses for trick or treating at Halloween. By the time the family moved permanently to Flagstaff three years ago, wearing anything warmer than shorts and T-shirts at that time of year was unthinkable. It will get worse – Phoenix, the fastest-warming large city in the US, could spend close to half of its year in over 100F (37C) heat within 30 years.
“If you choose to live in the desert you have to learn how to live in the desert,” Ormond said. “You worry about your car breaking down and so you have tons of food and water in it.
“But the heat used to break around September. Now, it’s October, sometimes November. We literally have six months of above 90F (32C). Mentally, you need a break. You can’t leave your house. It’s fatiguing.”
Ormond still owns her house in Tempe, which adjoins Phoenix. “We had this home and when I look around I think, ‘I just can’t see how this is gonna be a good investment for 20 years with climate change.’”
Phoenicians able to move, or even vacation, in cooler climes such as Flagstaff are usually older and wealthier. Those who still work can often do so remotely. The influx has aroused concerns in Flagstaff, where rents and property values have soared.
“The tenor in the town is ‘Stop building. Build a wall,’” said Jenny Niemann, a climate and energy specialist at the city of Flagstaff. “People joke about that. But I think it’s fair to say the town feels incredibly stressed by the increasing prices, as well as the development.”
While the western US is increasingly baked by heatwaves and choked by smoke from wildfires, the pressing concern in eastern states is that their coasts are being redrawn by sea level rise and pummeled by ever-stronger hurricanes. More than 300,000 homes near US coasts face being chronically flooded within 30 years.
This unfolding scenario is reshaping previous lines of segregation in coastal cities. As investors shift capital to higher ground and shoreline properties become costlier in terms of insurance and repairs, low- to middle-income people are squeezed out from both areas.
A recent study of the greater Miami area shows this process is already under way – properties at high elevations are experiencing rising values, while those situated just 3ft above sea level have declined in value, even when other factors are accounted for. This trend has largely taken hold since 2000.
“It’s a pretty clear signal and there’s evidence it’s happening across the US,” said Jesse Keenan, a climate adaptation expert at Harvard who authored the Miami report. “The very wealthy can afford to throw money away but moderate- to low-income people can’t, so there’s an inequality to living immediately on the coast.”
According to Keenan, climate gentrification is not just a supply problem – real estate developers actively marketing elevated areas as safe investments – but also a demand one – buyers are starting to swarm to higher ground.
“This is happening neighborhood to neighborhood, city to city, state to state,” he said. “It’s such a huge spectrum of geography that we are going to have make moral judgments about what to protect and what to let go. There’s not enough money to protect everyone. We need a complete mobilization, similar to the effort of putting a man on the moon, to adapt our coasts.”
Residents of the Miami districts of Liberty City and Little Haiti, traditionally African American and Hispanic areas, are seeing their neighborhoods transform around them. The districts, which sit a relatively safe 15ft above sea level, are currently having holes punched into them by bulldozers to make way for half a dozen apartment developments.
“We are already seeing low-income homes and businesses being evicted, the new developments are popping up everywhere,” said Valencia Gunder, a Liberty City resident turned activist who grew up hearing warnings about gentrification that are now being realized.
Previously blighted by poverty and crime, Liberty City is now seen as an attractive base for those worried their beachfront properties will soon be swamped. In 2000, no one in Liberty City paid more than $1,000 a month in rent – now it’s roughly one in six. Property prices have also risen sharply.
“People are being forced out to places like Georgia and Alabama, where it’s more affordable,” said Gunder. “It’s becoming so expensive. These developers aren’t making Liberty City better for the people who already live here.”
Even cities with cerebral approaches to climate change are at risk of upheavals that cut deepest in poorer, minority communities. Norfolk, Virginia, has reacted to some of the fastest sea level rises in the world with an ambitious plan that cedes some territory to the tides, while breaking up some housing projects and relocating residents. Local activists worry this will mean low-income, black communities will be displaced as their coastal neighborhoods are gentrified.
“This is a red alarm issue,” said Mustafa Ali, who spent 25 years at the Environmental Protection Agency’s office of environmental justice. “We need to make better decisions around resilience and vulnerable communities need to be brought into that conversation. A whole lot of folks are being left behind.”
In Flagstaff, the city is already straining to keep up. “Town gets crazy on the weekends when it’s 115F [46F] in Phoenix,” said Nicole Antonopoulos, Flagstaff’s head of sustainability. “Are we building our systems in a manner that can support a massive influx? No. Can our existing infrastructure support that? No.”
Flagstaff also faces its own climate change threats – increased wildfires in the surrounding Coconino national forest, the associated risk of flooding rains washing freely down treeless slopes on to the city, pressure on the water supply. Growing numbers of homeless people are traveling to Flagstaff to camp in the woods, heightening local fears over unintended conflagration.
Antonopoulos, who has helped develop a draft climate plan for Flagstaff to confront this new reality, recalls the sky turning black from ash after the nearby Schultz fire, in 2010. “I was walking to work with a bandanna on and literally chunks of burning trees were falling everywhere,” she said. “When we’ve got climate refugees it’s going to put more stress not only on our infrastructure but also our natural resources.”
The hand of climate change is everywhere – from water availability to insurance markets to housing pricing – while rarely being identified as a culprit. As temperatures continue to escalate, prior inequities are likely to be exacerbated, injustices risk deepening.
“Whether it’s happening already is unclear but I think more and more people are going to be moving because of climate change,” said Brian Petersen, a climate change and planning academic at Northern Arizona University.
“The people marginalized already in society will bear the brunt of this. Poor people in Las Vegas or Phoenix who can’t get away from the heat are not going to be leaving to go to beautiful, expensive mountain towns.”
Even those who do make it to Flagstaff and other refuges, such as Oregon or near the Great Lakes, won’t be shielded from the transforming climate. Enough future warming has been locked into the world’s climate system to touch everywhere on Earth.
“At some point, Flagstaff’s going to be in the rear-view mirror,” said Petersen. “We’re going to be going to farther north places or other continents.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/25/climate-gentrification-phoenix-flagstaff-miami-rich-poor

The New Nuclear Watch Institute warned against what it called the “folly of technological tribalism” of pursuing a future powered by renewables and gas-fired power stations, rather than any new nuclear plants.
Excluding nuclear would cause the UK to emit millions of extra tonnes of carbon dioxide and put the country’s carbon targets out of reach, the group concluded in a report due to be published on Thursday.
Tim Yeo, the institute’s chairman, said: “Abandoning nuclear power leads unavoidably to a very big increase in carbon emissions, which will prevent Britain from meeting its legally-binding climate change commitments. It also raises the cost of electricity.”
The claims will be seen as a direct riposte to recent suggestions from the government’s infrastructure advisers, who urged ministers to cool their ambitions for as many as six new nuclear projects and prioritise renewables instead.
The National Infrastructure Commission suggested the UK back only one more nuclear plant after the two reactors being built at Hinkley Point in Somerset.
However, the New Nuclear Watch Institute, which is supported by nuclear industry firms including the South Korean company eyeing a nuclear project in Cumbria, said “technological zealots” were trying to restrict the range of options for cleaning up electricity generation.
The group compared a worst-case scenario – where old nuclear plants are rapidly phased out, Hinkley Point C is cancelled, no nuclear plants are built and offshore windfarms and gas plants fill the gap – with one where nuclear plants account for nearly half of electricity generation by 2030.
The “no nuclear” world would lead to the cost of managing the UK’s energy system being 15% higher and result in an extra 35m tonnes of CO2, around a tenth of today’s annual emissions.
However, the comparison is based on an extreme scenario – few expect Hinkley Point C will be axed, given the billions EDF Energy has already poured into it.
The government has repeatedly made clear it is committed to new nuclear plants but has been grappling with how to help the financing of their huge upfront costs.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/26/abandoning-nuclear-power-plans-would-push-up-carbon-emissions-energy

Di Natale makes the pledge in a landmark speech to be delivered on Monday in Melbourne, kicking off a national speaking tour that anticipates the major policy battles of the next federal election.
In a copy of the speech, seen by Guardian Australia, Di Natale promises more progressive policy on the environment, increasing Newstart and creating a publicly owned bank and energy company.
But while the bulk of the speech distinguishes the Greens’ offering from the two major parties, on climate change Di Natale says he wants to “make it clear – we’ll work with a new government to get climate action back on track”.
Let’s not be diverted by allowing race-baiting and hate to be weaponised to turn neighbours against each other
The comment suggests the Greens are keen to avoid a repeat of Labor’s last term in government, when its opposition to Kevin Rudd’s emission trading scheme led to the minority Gillard government legislating an interim carbon price only to see it repealed by the Abbott government.
With the Morrison government committing to the Paris agreement’s emissions reduction targets but with no mechanism to achieve them, Labor faces a policy test of its own in choosing whether to pursue its 45% renewable energy target through the Turnbull government’s national energy guarantee or through other means.
Di Natale says although the Greens will work with Labor on climate “we know that’s not enough” because the major parties “won’t stand up to their corporate donors at the big end of town”.
“They’ll let the Adani mine go ahead and destroy the Great Barrier Reef and oil companies contaminate our Great Australian Bight,” he says.
Di Natale says the “first priority” is to turf out the Coalition who “don’t deserve to govern”.
He says the decision to replace Malcolm Turnbull with Scott Morrison had brought to power “a man who brutally enforced inhumane policies towards asylum seekers and said to grieving families we aren’t going to let you attend the funerals of your dead children”.
The Greens leader also targets the new prime minister for bringing a lump of coal into parliament and making drought a priority of his government without acknowledging the link to climate change.
Di Natale predicts political discourse at the next election “will be driven by fear and greed”. He warns of “fear in the form of an attack on migrants and multiculturalism, which by any definition has been an outstanding success”.
“Let’s not be diverted by allowing race-baiting and hate to be normalised and weaponised to turn neighbours against each other.”
The comments echo warnings from outgoing race commissioner Tim Soutphommasane that race politics are back in Australia.
Di Natale predicts parties will display “greed in the form of tax bribes that won’t solve the real economic issues Australians face and will leave corporate power untouched”.
He warns the Greens’ political opponents will “keep Newstart and Youth Allowance too low and the price of housing too high”. 
“And they won’t close those offshore detention camps.”
Labor has promised to improve housing affordability through its plans to restrict negative gearing to new homes and reduce the capital gains concessions from 50% to 25%. 
But it has only promised to review the level of Newstart, despite the fact the $38.98 a day payment for a single person hasn’t kept up with national living standards for more than a quarter of a century.
Bill Shorten has pledged not to change the Coalition’s immigration policies including turnbacks of asylum seeker boats and offshore detention for people seeking asylum.
Di Natale reiterates Greens pledges to reform donations, create a federal independent commission against corruption, and a publicly-owned bank and publicly-owned energy company.
He also argues that Australia needs to “change the face of our parliament” to reflect diversity with more “people of colour, people with disabilities, single parents, artists, scientists [and] young people”.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/sep/03/richard-di-natale-i-will-work-with-labor-to-get-action-on-climate-change

""Would the cooler waters entering the Southern Ocean cool the oceans down rather than warming them?""
Until the AMOC was stopped by the fresh glacial melt waters resulting from the 19 kybp the dense cold waters of the North Atlantic sank and flowed at depth to cool along the meridional north/south length of the Atlantic Ocean to cool the Southern Ocean. Once the glacial fresh and less dense meltwater pulse covered the surface of the North Atlantic , this sinking of cold saline North Atlantic waters and their flow at depth to the Southern Ocean stopped. Without its AMOC cooling current the Southern Ocean warmed. 19,000 years ago the oceans were 120 metres lower than today so the warming of the Southern Ocean at some depth caused oxidation of carbon rich oceanic oozes increasing atmospheric CO2 levels and leading to global greenhouse warming.
""Does a CO2 increase of 80 ppm equate to a 4C rise in global temperatures?""
A 200 ppm to 280 ppm rise in CO2 is a 40% rise as is the recent 280 ppm to 400 ppm rise. A doubling of CO2 is estimated over time to lead to a 3 degrees C rise in global climate temperature. The suspect the shortfall is made up by the still higher Northern Hemisphere high latitude summer insolation levels and the very large progressive decline in albedo or reflect reflectance as the continental ice sheets that stretched from Yosemite to New York and from London to Belgrade retreated and permanent sea ice retreated from both in both northern and southern high latitudes (from level with the Falklands).
Shakun et al (2012) ""Global warming preceded by increasing CO2 concentrations during last deglaciation"" Nature 484 pp 49-54, show a temperature increase of 3 not 4 degrees C up to the early Holocene. Note meltwater excursions into the north Atlantic were followed by Northern Hemisphere cooling and some glacier advance while in the southern Hemisphere the Southern Ocean warmed followed by global greenhouse warming.
""during the Ordovician period, the concentration of CO2 in Earth's atmosphere was about eight times higher than today as the glacial period of that time occurred"".
The late Ordovician glaciation sometime betweem 440 and 460 million years ago occurred during a time of weaker solar output. It occurred when the continents were clustered around the South Pole. Estimates of its length vary from 20 to 1 million years in duration. If the latter estimate of CO2 concentration for periods of that length lack temporal resolution and may miss periods of lower atmospheric CO2 produced by weathering of large basaltic provinces.
As there is currently no large basaltic province weathering to reduce CO2 or no major mountain building event such as the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau to produce the same effect, the estimates of the persistence of the current 400 ppm CO2 levels are of the order of 100,000 years.

Deliberately I suspect, and an important one.Labor has given notice they will require that half billion gifted to that little known group of big business people for the Barrier reef, to be returned.I think this means Labor are signalling to progressive voters not to panic and upset the apple cart in North Queensland.The LNP and coal lobby have painted themselves into a corner on electricity policy.I think the voters are ready to accept a big push for renewables.This will bring down prices, reduce emissions and create new industries.Adani is in trouble in India facing significant fraud charges. I doubt the Adani mine will ever go ahead.The real play is with Reinhart and her rail line to the port. Labor will be in government with all the responsibility that entails. But I'm hopeful Labor (with the support of the Greens hopefully) can navigate a way to a termination of domestic coal use, and a way to seperate coking coal mining from thermal coal mining so thermal coal exports reduce without damaging Australia's economic reliance on coal exports and associated employment and balance of trade.
Politically, I think it is unrealistic to think any government can switch off coal overnight (export) without huge disruption. Especially if it led to a return of a pro-coal conservative government which would be a disaster.We've lost five years under the loony right LNP. So the necessary transition process can only start next year.
With the CO2 levels rising as they are this is all very depressing, but a transition like this is the most we can expect.I think Labor and the Greens together, by demonstrating a transition can work, can prepare the electorate for an escalation of decarbonisation.If the pro-coal media let them.Not ideal, but politically it is the most promising way forward with the most likelihood of success.

As a geologist who worked on Pleistocene biodiversity changes, I would be interested to know which geologists in which peer reviewed papers published in proper scientific journals told you that ""previous periods between ice-ages"" (previous interglacials) ""have been so hot that biodiversity on a scale we have now was never possible"" and what they meant by that. Please provide a reference to such papers.
The Eemian Interglacial or nterglacial previous to the last glacial (or what you might call the last ice age) occurred between 130,000 and 115,000 years ago. The prevailing Eemian climate was, on average, 1 to 2 degrees warmer than the average for the Holocene (last 10,000 years) or in other words fairly close to the temperatures we now experience with current anthropogenic global warming. Sea levels reached 6 to 9 metres higher than today's levels. In my country biodiversity was greater during the Eemian than at present. Humans did not arrive here until around 45,000 years after the end of the Eemian. The Eemian was hotter than the current interglacial pre-anthropogenic global warming because Northern Hemisphere high latitude summer insolation was at a higher peak during the interglacial. This higher NHHLSI caused atmospheric CO2 to reach 290 ppm adding some extra global greenhouse warming.
""So, when in past inter-ice age periods was much hotter than then did an ice age still come.""
The Eemian interglacial ended 115,000 yeaers ago and the last ""ice-age"" or glacial period began because NHHLSI dropped from its Eemian peak to a level sufficient to allow glaciers to advance in the north of North America and the north-west of Eurasia despite CO2 at 290 ppm. Our current NHHLSI is showing a much slower drop off from its peak 19,000 years ago such that at the pre-industrial interglacial CO2 level of 280 ppm it would have until 50,000 years from now for it to reach levels low enough for the next glacial to occur.
""We humans weren't around then yet earth has stilo flipped from much hotter climates to ice age.""
Our species has been around 200,000 years and we certainly were around at the time the last Eemian interglacial ended and the last glacial or what you call ""ice age"" 115,000 years ago.

I suspect you are referring to the series of Pleistocene glacial and interglacials between them that occurred over the last 2.6 million years. If that's the case, the current interglacial which began 9,000 years ago following 10,000 years of deglaciation which in turn followed 90,000 to 100,000 years of the lastglacial period, would have been a long interglacial compared to its predecessor.
During the last glacial period atmospheric CO2 was at 190 to 200 ppm. 19,000 years ago a peak in Northern Hemisphere high latitude summer insolation (NHHLSI) caused the continental glacial ice sheets that covered northern North America and northwest Eurasia to start melting. The influx of fresh water into the north Atlantic shut down the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation which brings cool water to the Southern Ocean. The temperature of the Southern Ocean consequently rose oxidizing carbon rich oceanic oozes leading to an increase in atmospheric CO2 which caused global greenhouse warming, more melting of the northern continental ice sheets and more global greenhouse warming over the next 10,000 years during which atmospheric CO2 rose from 200 ppm to 280 ppm causing global climate temperature to rise by 4 degrees C.
Since that peak 19,000 years ago NHHLSI has steadily declined while atmospheric CO2 has remained at a typical interglacial level of 280 ppm until the late 19th century when it began to rise reaching current levels in excess of 400 ppm and causing global greenhouse warming. At its current rate of decline NHHLSI and with CO2 at a typical interglacial level of 280 ppm would have reached a level low enough for a glacial period to commence in 50,000 years time.

A population of a few million human hunter-gatherers was apparently beyond the carrying capacity of the planet as most places where we showed up the megafauna disappeared.
Around 10-12,000 years ago, when large climate oscillations settled down, we developed agriculture which allowed us to double our population many times into the billions.
But agriculture faces big challenges if we don’t change our ways soon (1), as do our fisheries, and if they both decline significantly, forcing us back to being largely hunter-gatherers, history tells us that out of every 1000 people you see maybe one survives.

BQSTART
By analyzing the fish fossils inside, researchers determined that global temperatures were stable for a long time before the asteroid impact, but then, afterwards, temperatures quickly rose and stayed about 5 degrees Celsius warmer for about 100,000 years. 
MacLeod says it's notable that the impact pumped up carbon dioxide over a short time span that, geologically speaking, is comparable to what humans have been doing in burning fossil fuels since the start of the Industrial Revolution.
""The atmosphere was loaded for a very brief interval of time, and the consequences of that change in atmospheric composition lasted for 100,000 years,"" MacLeod says.

CO2 has reached more than 400ppm, probably the highest for 800,000 years.
BQEND
More likely several million years.
CO2 levels are similar to the Pliocene over 3 million years ago.
Modern humans didn't exist - there was no complex global society relying on stability for agriculture.
Global average temperatures then eventually reached 3 or 4 degrees C (5.4-7.2 degrees F) higher than today’s and as much as 10 degrees C (18 degrees F) warmer at the poles.
Sea level ranged between five and 40 metres (16 to 131 feet) higher than today.
Earth systems take time to respond to forcings.
For example, sea level can't suddenly rise on that scale, because it takes time for enough heat to be accumulated to melt enough ice.
It's worth looking at this paper:

Charles Keeling began monitoring carbon dioxide in the clean air at 3,400 metres (11,150ft) on Mauna Loa, far away from vegetation and urban pollution. His first measurements in 1958 showed 315 parts per million (ppm) of CO2 in the atmosphere, and what caught him by surprise was that every year after that the levels of CO2 rose relentlessly in an upward curve, thanks to the carbon pollution pumped into the Earth’s atmosphere.
Now the CO2 has reached more than 400ppm, probably the highest for 800,000 years. It sounds a tiny amount of extra CO2, but it is having a huge impact on the climate by trapping more heat on Earth, driving world temperatures upwards. CO2 in the air is now so plentiful that plants are growing fewer leaf pores to absorb the gas than they did centuries ago, and more CO2 is being absorbed into the world’s seas, making them more acidic.
Keeling’s curve of rising CO2 levels is a shocking picture of how much the world’s atmosphere has changed in 60 years, with no end in sight.

The prime minister used a radio interview on Wednesday afternoon to declare “the business-as-usual model gets us there in a canter” – which contradicts advice from the Energy Security Board that says business as usual will mean the electricity sector will “fall short of the emissions reduction target of 26% below 2005 levels”.
Even if the the ESB projections are wrong, and the electricity sector managed to reduce emissions by 26% with no policy to drive that result, the Paris target applies across the economy, not just to the electricity sector, and the government’s own data shows emissions in other sectors of the economy are rising.
Morrison told 2GB on Wednesday that business as usual “and technology and the amount of renewable technologies that are already in the system and not being subsidised off into the future means these [Paris] targets are hit”.
A summary of modelling undertaken by the ESB and released only a month ago said if no policy was put in place in the electricity sector – which is the business-as-usual case the prime minister refers to – emissions would fall initially, then flatten out and rise towards the end of the decade to 2030 as forecast demand increased, then dip again in 2029-30.
The ESB said if the national energy guarantee wasn’t implemented, the national electricity market would “fall short of the emissions reduction target of 26% below 2005 levels”.
On Wednesday the prime minister initially said that the renewable energy target was driving up power prices “and that’s why we are stripping [subsidies] out of the system”, then said later in the same interview that the biggest driver of higher power prices was gold-plating of the electricity networks.
Asked by his host on 2GB what was ultimately more important, complying with Australia’s international climate obligations, or lowering power prices, Morrison said: “Power prices.” He counselled against being “distracted by ideological debate”.
The ESB has warned that if governments fail to implement the national energy guarantee – the policy Malcolm Turnbull shelved to try and stave off the civil war that ultimately cost him the prime ministership – that will “prolong the current investment uncertainty, and deny customers more affordable energy”.
The Neg appears dead, but the government signalled it was interested in trying to implement one component of the policy, the reliability obligation, with the states and territories.
The commonwealth was due to meet with the states and territories in late September to drive the process forward, but the states have yet to be summoned to a meeting to consider what, if any, progress can be made.
The new energy minister, Angus Taylor, is working up a package to take to cabinet for consideration.
With internal sensitivities still raw after the implosion of the last parliamentary fortnight, Morrison has been trying to send a signal that the immediate focus is price relief, while resisting calls from conservatives to withdraw from the Paris agreement.
In attempt to defuse the push, Morrison has been arguing that meeting the Paris commitments will have no tangible impact on power prices.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/sep/05/scott-morrison-contradicts-energy-advice-saying-paris-targets-can-be-met-at-a-canter

A third and important metric is cumulative emissions which perhaps helps rank countries on the overall level of contribution to climate change throughout history - given that climate change started some time ago. See Table (apologies for layout).
Now the usual suspects on this thread are going to spout off about how Australia is such a low contributor (% basis) on this list and the largest offender is the US, so nuffin to do with us. But why do we ape the US response? Why aren't we pressuring the ""great ally""? AND lets not forget that we 'export' our emissions. IE emissions are counted in the country that burns coal and gas, not the country that exports the stuff. In the absence of an effective price on carbon emissions this is a failing. 
Australias contribution on this list is ~1% but that still puts us at #15, per capita Australians are carbon gluttons and Australia is the largest international dealer of Coal.
By comparison, the poor people in the Pacific whose islands are increasingly inundated are a tiny fraction of a percent.
So NO Felix, Baseline - they do not share equal responsibility for the problem.

Recall too that abbott joined with Canada in rejecting a decision by the CHOGM summit in Colombo in ’13 to push for a Green Capital Fund (part of a collective 2020 goal that would see $100 billion in what is called climate financing) to help vulnerable island states and poor African countries address the effects of rising sea levels, prolonged droughts, or catastrophic weather incidents, caused by climate change. abbott arrogantly deemed it “socialism masquerading as environmentalism” and a mere wealth transfer from rich countries to poor.
Notwithstanding the semi-official images of mateship, ignoring (sometimes even blaming) the victims of disasters is common, to avoid contributing anything (beyond token media-promoted donations) to their support and guard private property rights against any risk of having to even temporarily share anything. The mentality is similar to that driving vilification of the (boat-borne) asylum-seekers, for similar reasons.
Yet crises such as the 2011 and 2013 floods in Eastern Australia, Fukushima, and earthquake in Christchurch have shown how typically complacent and occasionally arrogant white, middle-class, 'aspirationals' can themselves in an instant become homeless, living ten to a house, no water, no power, dinkum Aussie dunny out the back, like any blackfella's camp.

In 1997 John Howard hailed President Clinton’s decision to back away from the “hard line” European position on climate change mitigation. He saw it as a victory for the similar Australian position. 
Nauru’s then President, Kinza Clodumar, accused Howard of heavying littoral states at the 1997 South Pacific Forum in Raratonga to weaken greenhouse commitments. He said climate change was the most important issue facing low-lying islands, which feared flooding from rising sea levels associated with global warming. 
In an emotional speech also in 1997 to the high-level ministerial segment of the Kyoto climate change talks, President Clodumar said inaction would be an unspeakable crime against humanity, bringing untold human and ecological misery. His people had been pushed to the coastal fringe of Nauru, a low-lying South Pacific island, by extensive phosphate mining. Now that fringe, just 2m above sea level. was threatened by the rising seas projected under continued global warming. 
“We are trapped ... In the Pacific alone, four other island countries face destruction unless global warming is arrested. Our island brothers and sisters in the Caribbean. Atlantic and Indian oceans face the same desperate plight. We submit respectfully that the wilful destruction or entire countries and cultures with foreknowledge would represent an unspeakable crime against humanity.

Rather than accepting their homes are doomed and looking to migrate to countries such as Australia and New Zealand, the researchers say they should start planning for a long-term future. ""On the basis of this research we project a markedly different trajectory for Tuvalu's islands over the next century than is commonly envisaged,"" Kench said. ""While we recognise that habitability rests on a number of factors, loss of land is unlikely to be a factor in forcing depopulation of Tuvalu."" The study's authors said island nations needed to find creative solutions to adapt to climate change that take into account their homeland's evolving geography. Suggestions included moving populations onto larger islands and atolls, which have proved the most stable and likely to grow as seas rise. ""Embracing such new adaptation pathways will present considerable national scale challenges to planning, development goals and land tenure systems,"" they said. ""However, as the data on island change shows there is time (decades) to confront these challenges.""

However the forum communique – which focused heavily on climate change and the need for emissions reductions – was endorsed by leaders “with qualification”.
When asked at a press conference if those qualifications came from a country “beginning with A”, Enele Sopoaga, the prime minister of Tuvalu, confirmed that “the name of the qualifier, seeking qualifications [started] with capital A”.
Australia is the only nation in the Pacific to fit this description.It appears Australia also did not support a section of agreement calling on the United States to return to the Paris agreement on climate change.
The communique made it clear that it was only “leaders of forum island countries” – a term that a forum spokesperson confirmed denoted all forum member countries other than Australia and New Zealand – who called on the US to return to the Paris agreement on climate change.
A spokesperson from the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said: “I can confirm that NZ absolutely supports the reference in the communique calling for the US to return to the Paris agreement.”
Guardian Australia has sought comment from the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.Sopoaga said it was essential the US return to the agreement and commit to reducing emissions.“We cannot have comprehensive robust emissions reductions unless the biggest emitter is there in the process, we cannot leave the US out, they are responsible for 25% of global emissions,” he said.
The Boe declaration committed all forum countries to meeting their Paris agreement targets – a question of fierce domestic political debate in Australia.
“Leaders reaffirmed the importance of immediate urgent action to combat climate change and … called on countries, particularly large emitters, to fully implement their … mitigation targets,” the declaration said.
The president of host nation Nauru, Baron Waqa, said despite the fact the declaration included a qualification from Australia “that doesn’t make it any weaker”.
But the Australian government’s apparent ambivalence towards a low-emissions climate policy has disquieted its Pacific neighbours.
Low-lying island Pacific countries including Kiribati are forecast to be among the first on the planet to disappear underwater if rising sea levels are not arrested.Australia’s attempts to resist the strong language in the Boe declaration fits with its past behaviour at international meetings, according to a Pacific climate change representative who has represented his nation at COP summits for the last five years.Speaking to Guardian Australia ahead of the Pacific Islands Forum, Xavier Matsutaro, the national climate change coordinator for Palau, in the north-west Pacific, said Australia was “responsible for making our declarations weaker sometimes in the region”.“So there’s been forums that were formulated so [Australia] won’t be involved in it, they’re not members, so that whatever language that really reflects our views and our circumstances is actually reflected in the declaration,” he said.
He also likened Australia to an ""abusive spouse"", saying Australia provided aid to the region to deal with the effects of global warming but undermining attempts to halt its progress.

Organisers say more than 800 events – from marches to street theatre, acts of civil disobedience to mini festivals – will take place in towns and cities amid growing frustration at the lack of meaningful political action over the emerging climate breakdown.
Nick Bryer from campaign group 350.org which is organising the event said: “Politicians are failing. They are still protecting the interests of the fossil fuel companies over the interests of people, despite mounting evidence of the devastation these companies and this system is causing the planet.”
He said the day of global demonstrations was about people around the world “rising up and demanding a different cause of action, a different future which puts people and a sustainable future before the interests of these huge corporations”.
In the UK there are events organised in cities from London to Wigan, Bradford to Durham.
Jane Thewlis, from Fossil Free West Yorkshire, is organising an event in Bradford.
“We have a brilliant jazz band the Peace Artistes which are well known round here and the focus is divestment and a celebration of what has already been achieved from New York to Ireland.”
Thewlis said the group were campaigning to persuade the five West Yorkshire councils to divest their pension funds from fossil fuels and hoped the event would galvanise support – especially among young people.
“There will be several young people speaking, many of them associated with a group called Hope Rising which is based on a local council estate.”
Thewlis said the same policies that are damaging the lives of poor people in Bradford were driving the destruction of the planet and killing marginalised people around the world.

“These young people are making those links, and that’s why we have specifically got young, working class people of colour to talk on Saturday. We hope that these young people will form their own environmental group following the event and build a sustainable movement.”
One of the biggest protests is expected in Paris where up to 100,000 people are expected. Events in other European cities including Copenhagen, Brussels and Lisbon are also expected to attract tens of thousands of protesters.
The events come ahead of the Global Climate Action Summit that starts in San Fransisco next week and will see politicians and city leaders from around the world gather to discuss the climate crisis.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/07/hundreds-of-thousands-expected-to-join-global-climate-marches-this-weekend

Being in the right wing faction of my political party does not mean I can't provide links to what happened. By 2006 the fleet car I used occasionally at work was a Toyota Corolla. When my 12 year old Renault was destroyed from behind by a large 4WD which didn't brake in time, I bought one for myself. At the time they were the largest selling car in Australia soon to be replaced by the Mazda 3. Nobody was buying aussie made car because no body wanted to buy large top medium sized cars following the volatility in crude oil prices.

I shall check it out.
One of the strong themes in the research I am doing, is about the fact that climate change is the biggest market failure in the history of the world. 
When corporations cost their products, they compile all of the costs to the organisation of producing that product or providing that service. But because in Australia we briefly, but only briefly, forced corporations to cost their harm to the environment, corporations have not included the real costs of their products or services, because they have totally ignored the costs to the environment. 
This is where the market has been a spectacular failure - not my words but the words of Sir Nicholas Stern a very respected UK economist who advises the Tory government. When we had an EIS, for the first and last time, corporations had to actually account for the true costs or producing their product or providing their service, which included the costs to the environment, the harms to human health, the exploitation of workers and the communities they did business in, the rising costs associated with global warming such as infrastructure, crop and stock losses, flood and droughts etc. For the first and last time, this served the very important 'polluter pays' principle. 
But along comes Abbott and he gives corporations permission to poluute for absolutely free once again, and ensures the market continues to fail 'spectacularly' once again.
As a Liberal Party that is happy to try to force coporations to keep coal stations working into their twighlight years and force corporations to make losses on the fossil fuel product they are producing, due to the age of the plant and the inefficiencies such as when it breaks down, yet it is unhappy to actually enforce market rules that are their usual Bible, in the form of the 'polluter pays' principle. What does this Liberal Party stand for?
We have Abbott again today advocating for the removal of subsidies for renewable energy - well I don't mind that, BUT so long as they also cancel the $4B of fossil fuel corporation subsidies they are paying. Lets make it an even playing field and let the market decide - coal or renewables. 
But no, the market Gods in the Liberal Party are only too happy to play with market factors when it suits them, such as giving an unfair advantage to fossil fuels, forcing AGL to keep coal going or sell their Liddell coal plant to another company who will keep coal going, and forcing fossil fuel corporations to reduce their prices and guarantee electricity supply, and threatening them all with a big stick if they don't comply with these unreasonable government demands, but then claim not to be able to interfere in the market when the market fails so terribly.

As for farmers being a tiny majority of voters in rual populations, if they are a majority, I would not call that tiny. A 'majority' is enough to elect whomever they all vote for i.e. Barnaby Joyce and Matt Canavan etc. Additionally, I would like to see what figures you have to enable you to make the call that farmers are the tiny majority of rural communities. Given that rural communities are dependent on the success of farmers in the main, other members of rural communities, such as publicans, retail outlets, restaurants etc, will tend to vote for whomever the farmers vote for. They believe that farmers will know what is in their own best interests - which, plainly, most don't.
As far as me being too revolutionary - nothing I said was revolutionary. It was based entirely on proven facts - in the late 1800's climate change was first identified as occuring to our planet, then back in 1961 the world first knew that climate change was a potentially dangerous issue. By the early 1980's it was well known that burning of fossil fuels was the cause of climate change. It is 60 years down the track and the National Party MP's are still denying climate change and global warming even exists, let alone accepting that burning coal is to blame for most of it. That is not very revolutionary - surely. As someone who is researching it, and has been researching it for 1 1/2 years already, for a post grad Law thesis, I know that climate change awareness has been around for over 100 years - rather than me being revolutionary, don't you think those people who don't believe in it, are ridiculous conservative neanderthals instead?

I apologise in advance for those farmers to whom my post does not apply. Those whose heads are not stuck in their cracked earth that used to be pastures. I sincerely feel for you and I am very much on your side.
Sadly, the reason we currently have no action on climate change is because farmers have persisted in voting for the Nationals who are climate change deniers. From a vote of 2% of the total Australian primary vote, 18 national Party MPs, (10% of MPs) were elected to the House. In comparison, the Greens had a national primary vote of 11% and only managed to get 1 MP, (0.17%), elected to the House. If not all, most of the Nationals MPs are rampant climate change deniers and coal hungry neanderthals. The LNP only got into power thanks to these 18 Nationals seats. Once again, the Nationals and a handful of their Liberal counterparts have forced the LNP to back down on any action on climate change, as tiny as even that action was going to be. Abbott and the Nationals got rid of the Gillard government that was taking excellent action on climate change. Now were are 10 further years down the line, and the Nationals are still at it.
What these farmers with their heads in their drought ravaged land won't accept, is that the Greens, and to a lesser extent Labor, have had farmers backs right throughout. It is only the Greens who have supported farmers' Lock the Gate movements. But NO farmer I know would vote Greens, even if they were the last Party on earth - this is purely for ideological reasons, based mainly on total ignorance and misinformaiton about what the Greens stand for and their actual policies, which few if any of these farmers have ever attempted to familiarise themselves with. They would much prefer to take the word of the alt-right media, that the Greens are bad for farmers.
If these farmers are so good at what they do, then why do they keep voting in people like Barnaby Joyce who has never lifted a finger for his constituents. He sat by when coal mines were approved on prime agricultural land. He helped a couple of rich cotton farmers, who have now been indicted for their $20 million water theft, steal the water that belonged to thousands of farming families down stream of Queensland. He held onto funding that had been approved to assist farmers last time there was a massive drought issue and farm families were going under, so long, that many families had to leave their land as they received no assistance in time. Barnaby votes against any assistance to farmers for climate change mitigation. He refused to assist farmers to move to a chilled meat trade, such that every time there is a live export scandal, all hell breaks lose and live export is banned and farmers suffer as a result. But in amongst all these failures to farmers, he threatened to kill two innocent dogs who posed zero threat to farmers, and bring disgrace, pain and embarrassment to his suffering family because he couldn't even live up to his own self professed standards of morality.
Farmers would rather elect MPs like Matt Canavan who doesn't care about the impact on farmers of more coal being burned in a country, that is already suffering severely from the burning of coal. Matt Canavan won't be happy until every bit of farmland is dug up in the pursuit of coal, and every local rural town is decimated by FIFO workers, and every bit of Australian land and property is covered with a thick coat of coal dust. He doesn't care about farmer's families who will suffer life threatening, and shortening, respiratory disease due to the coal dust influx. He doesn't care that rivers and creeks that farmers rely on, will be poisoned with coal dust and chemical tailings. He doesn't care that food crops will become inedible due to coal mine run off and coal dust. And he doesn't care that the continued burning of coal in Australia will result in more drought, floods, damaging storms, and deaths of innocent Australians. Yet these farmers, representing a mere 2% of Australians, will still saddle all Australians with Canavan's, and his mates', climate change denial for another 6 years, at the next election.
These 2% of farmers have saddled Australia with a government, and with 18 MPs who are criminally negligent, and we are ALL suffering as a result. Even the National Farmers Federation has finally seen the light go on in their collective heads, that climate change is causing major issues for farmers, only about 40 years too late, but at least they are now on side. But these 2% of Australians, farmers with their heads buried in the sand that used to be their grass pastures, will keep putting Australia's future in peril - just how smart are they, really???

It’s simply part of doing business in one of the most variable climates in the world.
The truth is, Australian farmers are good at what they do, and we know when things are changing.
NSW last year was 2 degrees above the baseline average, without an El Niño in sight. This year we’ve already seen 100% of the state drought-declared. The minimal amount of winter crop that has sprouted is sizzling on the stalks or bitten hard by severe -5C frosts. To the north the dams are parched and farmers across the state are close to walking off the land.
It’s not just the farmers, either. In the past five years, my local town, amalgamated against the wishes of the local population, has struggled to keep council staff. We have seen a local bank and a favourite watering hole close. We are about to lose our Landcare facilitator who has been a critical element in natural resource management, sustainable farming and drought support.
We can and must do better.
This is not a “hard-done-by farmer” narrative. We’re tough and we manage our resources carefully, making decisions based upon the best available evidence and always keeping one eye to the future. This is an area with a long history of working with scientists and advisers to be prepared for future agricultural, environmental and economic shocks.
But, the first step to managing for the future is to grapple with reality. And the reality is that our climate is on a devastating trajectory. Much as our politicians like to deny reality, out here – beyond the air-conditioned hallways of parliament – we’re already dealing with increasingly extreme weather as a result of global warming.
So, a message to our elected representatives. Get your heads out of the coalpit and back into the real world. We need meaningful action now; including support for regional communities and funding for Landcare facilitators to be driving up driveways and checking on those whose lives are being destroyed by your failure to take action. We need a good heavy dose of reality injected into Australian politics.
On Monday, my fellow farmers and I will stand outside parliament and rally for our future. A future in which our kids have a chance to farm and our government no longer hides from the truth.
The alternative is simply unthinkable.

He has demonstrated consistently that he is not interested in promoting emissions reductions. He is interested in promoting an anti-renewables agenda.

In my experience, most perceived 'well known' differences between the political left and right don't actually exist.
BQEND
Agreed: the differences frequently seem manufactured and grossly exaggerated, in order to bolster the sense of identity as you suggest. I regret this very much since it seems to me that it would be better to base a political edifice on what the polity have in common, rather than the divisive search for those 'well-known' differences. However, this is one of the major pitfalls of adversarial systems, which I regard as wasteful and counter-productive in most instances.
This fabrication of difference leads inevitably to polarisation and demagoguery, since the former is the objective and the latter is the preferred method of the vested interests promoting division. I am frequently amused by American notions of domestic socialism (although less amused by their rampant terror of it) when, in this European view, the US system has about as much to do with socialism as Blair's Labour party i.e. none.

Activists in the US should be attempting to unify Democrat/Republicans on the issue - if they cannot bring themselves to do so then they are as much an obstacle as the climate change deniers.
BQEND
It's ironic that elsewhere you mention political naivety. To paraphrase - I hope fairly - what you appear to recommend is that people who support climate change science and the societal changes it mandates, should seek unity with people whose ideology specifically makes such an ambition impossible. Both Republicans and Democrats in congress and the senate are political prostitutes, and do largely what their backers pay them to do, not what is right, or what is needed. The obstacle - insurmountable until it's too late e.g. when it is impossible to deny we've broken the environment - is ideological entrenchment and the growing polarisation between the very people you think should be getting together. Another way of putting this is that you recommend people should waste their time - not a very sensible suggestion in my view - rather like thinking that somehow it might be possible to change the mind one of our resident deniers. I personally wrote about climate change for a decade, and in all that time I don't think I can claim a single convert.
BQSTART
My point is that it is not just politically naive, but almost suicidally reckless to leave such a critical issue as AGW to party politics.
BQEND
I agree, except that the real obstacle isn't party politics, but democracy. No country with a short electoral cycle, ignorant and divided electorates (many of whom don't bother to vote - Australia at least gets this right through mandatory voting) and campaign finance laws like Citizens United, can address long-term issues like climate change. This is, of course, just my opinion, but it is supported by some evidence: the country doing the most about climate change is China, a dictatorship that makes long-term plans in the knowledge that no matter how unpopular, they can't be voted out of office.

The study further reveals that people are more likely to support the same climate policy proposal when they think that their own political party supports it — and that both Democrats and Republicans overestimate how much their peers oppose the ideas of the other party.
“Democratic and Republican citizens alike evaluate a carbon tax or cap and trade policy based on who proposed it — above and beyond their thoughts on the details of the policy, or on whether it is consistent with their beliefs about the importance of climate change,” said David Sherman, a UC Santa Barbara professor of psychological and brain sciences and senior author on the paper. “They do this despite stating themselves that policy considerations should be more important than partisanship.""

Does it.
But as to your 'question', the point I'm making is that generating a political divide is counter productive.Furthermore, the Democrats also held office and majorities in Congress.Did that result in a carbon tax or any substantive changes?No.The fact is that the Democratic party can be just as venal and scientifically feckless as the GOP.
There are Republicans in Congress who support a carbon tax - so rather than running around telling Republicans they're crooks/and/or/stupid .. and then acting surprised when they dare to disagree, perhaps it's time to work on that and set up cross party alliances on the issue like any other country.
Activists have a role to play there.
Only America and Australia have this partisan divide in policy - So you have a choice: You either support the partisan split like a first year arts student and live with the resultant political torpor and lack of action .... or you take the subject (the climate) seriously, make alliances and leave Republicans to sort it out with their peers.

The problem is that he doesn’t trust the experts at EPA to do so and wants to erode their authority to regulate carbon pollution.
When discussing Chevron and climate change, we usually focus on the company’s legal liability. However, in Kavanaugh’s context, ‘Chevron deference’ is even more important. The term refers to the fact that courts will generally defer to government agency interpretations of laws as long as Congress hasn’t spoken directly to the issue at hand.
David Doniger, director of the climate and clean air program at the Natural Resources Defense Council noted that Kavanaugh doesn’t believe Chevron deference applies on issues of major importance. In a recent net neutrality case, Kavanaugh argued, “While the Chevron doctrine allows an agency to rely on statutory ambiguity to issue ordinary rules, the major rules doctrine prevents an agency from relying on statutory ambiguity to issue major rules.”
That’s Kavanaugh’s position on climate change. In oral arguments before his DC Circuit Court of Appeals in a 2016 Clean Power Plan case, Kavanaugh said:
This is huge case … it has huge economic and political significance … it’s fundamentally transforming an industry by telling existing units you in essence have to pay a penalty, a huge financial penalty in order to continue to exist, in order to shift from coal plants to solar and wind plants, at the same time the coal mining industry is in essence greatly harmed, as well.
But while regulating carbon pollution would have a major impact on the fossil fuel industry, the same is true of most pollutant regulations. It’s nevertheless EPA’s job to regulate pollutants, and the agency has been doing exactly that since its inception.
In the 2016 oral arguments, Kavanaugh said that the Clean Air Act is “a thin statute, it wasn’t designed with [greenhouse gases and climate change] specifically in mind.” But EPA was created to address various types of pollution, and the Clean Air Act gave it that legal authority. As the Act’s text notes:
the growth in the amount and complexity of air pollution brought about by urbanization, industrial development, and the increasing use of motor vehicles, has resulted in mounting dangers to the public health and welfare
The Clean Air act also defined the term “air pollutant” very broadly to allow EPA the flexibility to regulate any new sources of pollution that the agency might identify in the future:
The term “air pollutant” means any air pollution agent or combination of such agents, including any physical, chemical, biological, radioactive (including source material, special nuclear material, and byproduct material) substance or matter which is emitted into or otherwise enters the ambient air.
And it gave the EPA Administrator the authority to regulate any pollutants that threaten public health and welfare:
For the purpose of establishing national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards, the Administrator shall within 30 days after December 31, 1970, publish, and shall from time to time thereafter revise, a list which includes each air pollutant … emissions of which, in his judgment, cause or contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare
The Clean Air Act even envisioned EPA’s regulatory authority extending to impacts on the climate:
All language referring to effects on welfare includes, but is not limited to, effects on soils, water, crops, vegetation, manmade materials, animals, wildlife, weather, visibility, and climate…
In the landmark 2007 case Massachusetts v. EPA, the Supreme Court affirmed that greenhouse gases qualify as air pollutants, and EPA therefore has authority to regulate them if the agency determines that they may endanger public health or welfare. In its 2009 Endangerment Finding, that was indeed EPA’s conclusion:
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may reasonably be anticipated both to endanger public health and to endanger public welfare .... The major assessments by the U.S. Global Climate Research Program (USGCRP), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and the National Research Council (NRC) serve as the primary scientific basis supporting the Administrator’s endangerment finding.
In a key 2014 case Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, the Supreme Court ruled 7 to 2 that EPA can continue to treat greenhouse gases as pollutants subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act and can apply those regulations to power plants. Justices Scalia, Roberts, and Kennedy joined the majority decision. The good news is that Scalia’s position in this case was modeled after a prior Kavanaugh opinion.
But generally speaking, Kavanaugh doesn’t trust the EPA experts to regulate carbon pollution.
In the 2016 oral arguments before his court, Kavanaugh laid out his case for why Congress, not the EPA should tackle climate change:
Earth is warming, and humans are contributing, and I understand the international collective action problem here, I understand that very well, and I understand the frustration with Congress, I live that, too, everyone understands that. But under our system of separation of powers, and this is why it’s so important that we maintain that, Congress is supposed to make the decision. You might say, you know, this Congress is not going to, they’re not going to do anything, but that’s not how we get to make decisions … for a big question like this Congress can do things like job training programs, and community college assistance, and welfare assistance, and drug programs for the people who are out of work, and that becomes more of a problem, that’s why the separation of powers principle matters, because Congress can look at something like this in a well-rounded approach, and that was the difficulty obviously that happened in the Senate. But for us to do it, for you to do it, all the people who are left behind are just left behind.
Kavanaugh is right that Congress could and should do a better job tackling carbon pollution than EPA. For example, Hillary Clinton developed plans to both tackle climate change and help coal communities adapt. But Republicans in the White House and Congress are owned by the fossil fuel industry, and thus unwilling to advance serious climate legislation.
However, the fact that Congress won’t act as long as Republicans are in charge doesn’t lessen EPA’s authority to regulate carbon pollution. Kavanaugh’s unwillingness to defer to EPA’s legal authority is wrong. The Clean Air Act is very clear that EPA should regulate pollutants that may endanger public health and welfare, and greenhouse gases certainly qualify.
If Kavanaugh is seated on the Supreme Court, he’ll join the other conservative justices in eroding EPA’s ability to regulate carbon pollution. EPA won’t take serious action until there’s a Democrat in the White House anyway; nor will Congress act unless Democrats are in charge of that branch of government. Kavanaugh just represents one more Republican obstruction to climate action.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/sep/10/kavanaughs-views-on-epas-climate-authority-are-dangerous-and-wrong

The sell-off of coal, oil and gas investments is led by the insurance industry, with $3tn of funds. But it also now includes the first nation to divest, Ireland, major cities including New York and key medical organisations. Major oil companies such as Shell have this year cited divestment as a material risk to its business.
Fossil fuel divestment began on US university campuses in 2011 but now spans 37 nations around the world. Supporters of divestment say existing fossil fuel resources are already far greater than can be burned without causing catastrophic climate change and that exploring for and producing more fossil fuels is therefore morally wrong. They also say fossil fuel companies are risky investments as global action on emissions gets tougher.
Some investors argue that remaining as shareholders and persuading fossil fuel companies to change can be more effective. However, another new report finds this approach has not delivered any significant change to date.
The new divestment report, by Arabella Advisors, calculates that investors with $6.2tn in assets under management have committed to divest from fossil fuels, up from $5.2tn in the previous report in 2016.
“I commend the divestment movement for its incredible progress,” said Mary Robinson, former UN high commissioner on human rights and former president of Ireland.
Bill de Blasio, mayor of New York City, and Sadiq Khan, mayor of London, which is in the process of divesting, said in a joint article for the Guardian: “We must use our economic might to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy. Taking this kind of action now could help us make a crucial difference to the people we represent and the future of our planet.
Jeremy Grantham, co-founder of GMO, one of the world’s most influential asset management companies, said the financial case for divestment was compelling. “Investors with long-term horizons should avoid oil stocks on investment grounds. They face a sustained headwind. Ethical arguments for divestments are simply not necessary. They are a pure bonus,” he said.
Another new report, from Genus Capital Management in Canada, said its fossil free fund had outperformed a benchmark of standard stock market indices by almost 2% per year over the last five years. The company’s Fossil Free CanGlobe Equity Fund is a mix of Canadian and global stocks. “At the five-year mark, we can conclusively say: divesting from fossil fuels pays,” said CEO Wayne Wachell.
The Arabella Advisors report noted that the American Medical Association (AMA) and the UK’s Royal College of General Practitioners had both divested. “It is unwise to own fossil fuels companies long-term and the products of these companies are harmful to human health by producing dangerous air pollution and contributing to global climate change,” said Dr Todd Sack at the AMA.
Divestment appears to be concerning oil and gas majors. In Shell’s last annual report it states: “It could have a material adverse effect on the price of our securities and our ability to access equity capital markets.” Furthermore, the World Bank Group has committed to stopping funding oil and gas development and major insurers including Swiss Re have decided to stop underwriting coal projects.
The report on investor engagement on with fossil fuel companies, from shareholder advocacy group As You Sow, found that 160 climate change shareholder resolutions were filed at 24 US oil and gas companies between 2012 and 2018.
However, none of the companies have adopted plans or targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels and most are investing to maintain or expand production. “The oil and gas sector has not stepped up to address the growing risks to their companies, the broader economy, and our planet,” said Andrew Behar, As You Sow CEO.
The call for ethical investment was backed by Pope Francis in June 2018, when he addressed the heads of oil companies. He said “disturbing and a cause for real concern” that carbon emissions were still rising and added: “Even more worrying is the continued search for new fossil fuel reserves, whereas the Paris agreement clearly urged keeping most fossil fuels underground.”
Ellen Dorsey, at the philanthropic Wallace Global Fund, said the pressure to divest would continue. “Today, our movement pledges to increase divested global assets to $10tn by 2020.”
She said investing in clean energy was as important as pulling funds from polluting firms: “Investors should also commit at least 5% of their portfolio to climate solutions to help rapidly scale to 100% renewable energy and universal energy access.”
Robinson backed the clean investment call: “This is what climate justice requires.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/10/fossil-fuel-divestment-funds-rise-to-6tn

While Gichuhi suggested clearly last week that she had been bullied – a suggestion that was validated implicitly by the minister for women, Kelly O’Dwyer, who said government MPs had been intimidated – Morrison told the ABC on Tuesday night the South Australian senator “told me very plainly that she was not bullied by anybody here in Canberra” during the leadership contest.
The prime minister met Gichuhi privately after she signalled she was prepared to name names with the protection of parliamentary privilege. Gichuhi confirmed the conversation earlier on Tuesday, and said Morrison had “taken up the issue”.
Regarding bullying in my political career: Yesterday I had a discussion with Prime Minister Scott Morrison. The Prime Minister has taken up the issue. #auspol
We must live and work in a way that respects and enhances ALL freedoms of ALL Australians. Australia says NO to bullying and intimidation. #auspol
Morrison said politics was a very “torrid” business and his inquiries to date had not yielded evidence of “gender-specific actions” in relation to what some people would characterise as “very intense lobbying which is fairly normal in the political process, albeit not edifying”.
He acknowledged there were some issues relating “to the party divisions and how things are dealt with there” but gave no detail.
The prime minister also said he would not support quotas being adopted in the Liberal party to boost female representation in parliament – an idea that has been floated by the Liberals Sussan Ley and Craig Laundy.
He said that determination was “a matter for the organisational wing of the Liberal party but [quotas are] never something I have supported”.
Even though there is ample evidence that quotas boost the level of female representation both in public and corporate life, Morrison said: “I don’t believe quotas are the way you remove obstacles.”
He said he was focused on removing obstacles to women getting preselected.
“It’s a matter of supporting women throughout the preselection process, to identify, encourage, support and recruit and then to support them through that process, and then when they get into parliament ensure they’re getting the support they need to do the job,” he said.
Morrison was also pressed again to explain why Malcolm Turnbull was no longer the prime minister, given that he was a strong defender of the government’s record, and argued that he didn’t actively seek the top job.
The prime minister has tried to move the questioning on from the leadership implosion and on Tuesday night said the government was focused on the future. He said the government had been preoccupied with managing things but further explanation was now required. “What’s important in politics is that people also understand the why’s behind the what.”
Even though opinion polls suggest Australian voters are disconcerted by yet another leadership coup, and the Coalition would lose any election held today, the prime minister suggested voters were “disappointed” but used to the turbulence.
“I think, sadly, over the last 10 years there have been too many of these changes, on both sides of politics and, I don’t think Australians are as shocked by these things as they used to be,” Morrison said. “They are disappointed.”
He struggled to explain the government’s position on climate and energy policy. Asked what the government’s climate policy was, Morrison replied: “Reducing emissions by 26%.”
Asked to nominate a policy to drive the emissions reduction, Morrison identified the emissions reduction fund, which was not given any additional funding in the last budget. He suggested further measures would be forthcoming but gave no detail.
Morrison declared the government had not changed its emissions reduction policy but the government on Monday took a decision to dump the national energy guarantee, a policy that would have imposed an emissions reduction target for the electricity sector of 26% by 2030.
The prime minister has said since taking the top job that Australia will not dump the Paris climate commitment to reduce emissions across the economy by 26%. But in ditching the Neg the government has removed a concrete policy roadmap to drive the emissions reduction.
The government does not have policies to drive emissions reduction in sectors of the economy where emissions are now rising.
The Energy Security Board has predicted that emissions in the electricity sector will be 24% lower by 2021 courtesy of a big build of renewable energy pulled through by the renewable energy target, which is also contributing to lower wholesale prices.
But the ESB has said electricity will not reach a 26% reduction in the absence of the Neg.
Even if the the ESB projections are wrong, and the electricity sector managed to reduce emissions by 26% with no policy to drive that result, the Paris target Australia has signed up to applies across the economy, not just to the electricity sector, and the government’s own data shows emissions in other sectors of the economy are rising.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/sep/11/morrison-says-he-has-not-been-told-of-any-liberal-party-leadership-bullies

Brown not only signed a bill that calls for 100% of the state’s electricity to come from carbon-free sources by 2045 but also penned an executive order demanding that California completely eliminate net emissions across its economy, including transport and agriculture, by the same year.
The order, which cites “historic droughts, devastating storms, torrential storms, extreme heat … and threats to human health”, requires California pull more greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere than it puts in by 2046, using vegetation and new technologies.
Brown told the Guardian that California was taking the lead globally in confronting an issue that’s an “existential challenge” to the planet and claimed that Trump was the main obstacle to further progress.
“I don’t believe Trump represents the present but he has the power, he has the Republicans hook, line and sinker,” he said. “His unabashed acolytes will follow him over the cliff. Gross ignorance is dangerous. The battle is with Trump – that’s the number one fight. But once he’s out of there, dealing with climate change will still be a fight.”
The Trump administration has sought to dismantle emissions rules for coal-fired power plants and loosen fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks, targeting California’s ability to set stricter vehicle regulations than the rest of the country.
Brown has set a target of 5m electric cars on California’s roads but said “at the rate we’re going they will be made by Chinese companies and that will principally be the fault of Donald Trump. The American auto industry is on the chopping block at at the moment he is chopping it into oblivion.”
The vision of carbon neutrality and the banishment of fossil fuels set out by Brown has taken aback even some environmentalists in a state that is a major oil and gas producer, as well as the nation’s agricultural heavyweight.
California will look to soak up carbon through expanded forests, at a time when enormous wildfires are a growing blight on the state, or inject carbon underground or in algal blooms – a technological challenge that has yet to be proven at scale.
“Places like Sweden and Costa Rica have had those kind of pledges but California is the fifth largest economy in the world,” said Nigel Purvis, who oversaw environmental diplomacy at the state department under the Clinton and George W Bush administrations. “This is historic. It’s a really major step. Jerry Brown has been one of America’s great climate leaders.”
Now entering the twilight of his second spell as governor, Brown has forged a reputation for environmentalism, bringing in one of the first ever tax incentives for rooftop solar during his first period as the state’s chief executive, which ran from 1975 to 1983.
His second stint as governor, which began in 2011, has seen Brown throw himself at the issue of climate change, overseeing a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels during a period of strong economic growth by implementing a carbon-trading scheme that recently expanded in scope to help prevent deforestation overseas.
Latterly, his tenure has brought him into diametric opposition to Trump. Brown has compared the president’s climate policies to falling off the top of the Empire State Building and said California will “launch its own damn satellite” if Trump hobbles Nasa’s climate research.
“He has pushed back the shallow narrative that you can’t grow the economy while cutting carbon pollution,” said Benjamin Houlton, director of the University of California Davis John Muir Institute of the Environment. “He’s shown that’s false. He’s set a model that can transform other countries.”
Brown has been assailed on the right by Republicans, who have claimed his targets are unfeasible and will raise the cost of electricity in the state, as well as some on the left who complain that he has been too willing to appease around oil and gas companies and has failed to phase out drilling in California.
Last week, Brown’s move to stop the Trump administration attempts to allow drilling off California’s coast was dismissed as “pure theater” by May Boeve, executive director of climate campaign group 350.org. “The governor says ‘not here, not now’, but he’s permitted more than 20,000 new oil and gas wells up and down California during his tenure,” she added.
Further concerns have been raised over the stubbornly poor air quality in parts of the state, a problem that’s a particular burden for communities of colour that live near highways and industrial facilities such as oil refineries.
“The critical question now is whether the transition to 100% renewable energy will be a just transition that benefits everyone, especially workers and communities most impacted by pollution and climate change,” said Miya Yoshitani, executive director of the Asian Pacific Environmental Network, which is based in the Bay Area.
Brown himself has echoed the desire for a quickening of pace given the threats California faces – a recent report found the state is set for a major increase in temperatures and sea level, thousands of extra deaths and the loss of two-thirds of its beaches by the end of this century.
This urgency will be spelled out in a major climate summit held in San Francisco this week, as mayors, business leaders and activists from around the world assemble in what will be the largest, and last, gathering on the issue hosted by Brown before he retires to the family ranch.
“Transformation is not for wimps,” he said. “Yes it’s difficult but we are moving at a pace greater than any country. Is it too slow? Yes, but we’re doing everything we can.
“My legacy is restoring my great-grandfather’s ranch. In 10 years there will be a whole new grid, a whole new political class. The whole idea of a legacy is a canard.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/11/jerry-brown-california-governor-climate-change-trump

A study tracking voter sentiment for more than a decade, funded first by the Climate Institute and now by the Australia Institute, finds 73% (up from 66% in 2017) of respondents concerned about climate change, and a clear majority, 68%, believes the government should set domestic targets to comply with our Paris commitments.
An increased 67% want coal-fired power to be phased out within 20 years, up from 61% in 2017.
The findings suggest the Morrison government is politically vulnerable on climate change at the next federal election. The prime minister has declared Australia will not pull out of Paris but also abandoned the national energy guarantee that imposed an emissions reduction target on the electricity sector.
The former prime minister Tony Abbott on Tuesday reignited his push to scrap subsidies for renewable energy, taking on the new energy minister, Angus Taylor, at his first meeting of the government’s backbench energy and environment committee.
Another outspoken conservative, Craig Kelly, also asked how he was meant to respond to questions about the government’s commitment to staying in the Paris climate agreement when it was completely unclear how the Paris commitments would be met.
With a drought crippling swathes of regional Australia, a majority of voters (67%) in the bush believe the government is not doing enough to prepare for or adapt to the impacts of global warming. This compares to 56% of capital city residents.
There has also been a shift in the attitudes of people voting for the National party and for One Nation. While those voters are still more likely than others to think the impact of climate change is being exaggerated, the number of people agreeing with that statement has dropped to 20%, down from 32% in 2017, for Nationals voters, and to 22%, down from 28%, for One Nation voters.
With the Bureau of Meteorology predicting that southern and south-eastern parts of the country could face an early summer heatwave after experiencing the 12th driest winter on record, public concern is escalating about heatwaves and water shortages.
When asked about the specific impacts of climate change, the top three issues Australians expressed concern about were droughts (78%, up four points in a year), the destruction of the Great Barrier Reef (77%, up four points) and bushfires (76%, up five points).
More than half the sample, 53%, think governments are not doing enough to deal with climate change threats – a perception reinforced by a decade of partisan warfare on the issue.
On energy, 55% of the sample blame power companies for high electricity prices, with 52% pointing the finger at privatisation, 41% identifying poor policy making and 29% renewable energy sources.
More than half the sample feels the government should invest in renewable energy generation and storage, with only 7% favouring government investment in coal, oil and gas.
The sample is divided over who should pay the costs of climate action, with 38% saying big polluters, 21% saying taxpayers and 10% saying the people facing climate change impacts.
Ben Oquist, the executive director of the Australia Institute, said: “The public want lower power prices and action on climate change.

Methane is one of the most potent agents of climate change.
As the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) formally released its proposed substitute for a 2016 Obama administration rule that aimed to step up detection and elimination of methane leaks at well sites and other oil and gas facilities, it conceded the move “may … degrade air quality and adversely affect health and welfare”.
The move is part of a broad Trump administration effort to undo former president Barack Obama’s legacy programs to fight climate change by cutting emissions from oil, gas and coal.
The EPA conceded that relaxing the Obama-era rule for methane leaks at oil and gas sites would put another 380,000 tons of methane into the atmosphere by 2025. The amount is roughly equivalent to more than 30m tons of carbon dioxide, another fossil-fuel emission that receives far more attention in efforts to slow climate change.
Relaxing federal oversight will save $75m in regulatory costs annually, the agency said.
Kathleen Sgamma, president of the Western Energy Alliance, a Colorado-based group that represents more than 300 companies, said the proposed changes would make the EPA rule more efficient and workable. The previous rule was “full of red tape”, Sgamma said in an interview. “This rule cleans that up, makes it more practical.”
Oil and gas drillers have “a four decade-long trend to reduce emissions”, and the new EPA rules recognize that reality, Sgamma said, adding that she hopes a Department of the Interior rule to be finalized in coming days will show a similar practical streak.
The pending rule by the Bureau of Land Management applies to fracking sites on public lands.
Environmentalists contend energy companies have already demonstrated they can comply with tougher monitoring and that only poorly operated companies were having trouble with the new requirements.
“Once again, the Trump administration is putting the interests of the worst-operated oil and gas companies ahead of the health and welfare of everyday Americans,” said Matt Watson, an associate vice-president at the Environmental Defense Fund.
On Tuesday, California governor Jerry Browntold a meeting in San Francisco ahead of a climate conference there that Donald Trump’s proposal to increase methane releases is “insane” and “borders on criminality”.
“It perhaps is the most obvious and dangerous and irresponsible action by Mr Trump and that’s saying quite a lot,” Brown said.
The EPA under Obama completed the existing rule in May 2016 and it took effect that August. Competing court challenges from the oil and gas industry and environmental groups, and EPA moves to freeze part of the Obama rule, have mired implementation.
Tuesday’s action opens a 60-day period for public comment ahead of any final decision by the Trump administration.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/11/epa-admits-scrapping-regulations-will-put-more-methane-into-atmosphere

Global push to move away from gas-powered cars,article,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/13/electric-cars-climate-change-summit-zero-emissions,0,"Political and business leaders gathering in San Francisco for a major climate change summit have committed to moving towards what was once a fantastical thought – the demise of the internal combustion engine in cars, trucks and other vehicles.
A group of 26 city, business and regional or state leaders, representing 122 million people around the world, have used the Global Climate Action Summit to call for carmakers to quicken the pace of electric vehicle rollout. Twelve cities, including Santa Monica, Tokyo and Greater Manchester, have pledged to deploy only zero emission buses from 2025.
This follows a move by 19 US cities and counties to increase the number of electric vehicles in their own fleets and promises by businesses such as Ikea, which plans to make its home deliveries emissions-free, to shift away from gasoline-powered cars and trucks.
“This demand added together really gives auto companies the message that they need to signal the endgame for the internal combustion engine,” said Helen Clarkson, chief executive of the Climate Group, which is behind the zero-emission vehicle challenge. “When you see cities making these sort of commitments, it creates a new normal in the market. Transport is a bit behind on the curve of the energy transformation but we are really seeing things move now.”
The electrification of transport is particularly challenging in the US, where transport is now the largest contributor of greenhouse gases, eclipsing energy, and drivers have opted for larger cars amid low fuel prices. The Trump administration is also in the process of weakening fuel efficiency standards that would push carmakers to expanding their electric vehicle fleets.
But mayors at the climate summit - convened by California’s governor, Jerry Brown, who has himself set a target of 5m electric vehicles on the state’s roads – have said they can look to bypass the federal government and help the US catch up to the likes of India, China and the Netherlands, which have all committed to phasing out carbon-polluting cars at some stage.
“The clean transportation revolution is now staring us in the face,” said Eric Garcetti, mayor of Los Angeles. Garcetti was one of 35 mayors of California cities to write to state regulators last month to demand 100% zero-emission buses by 2040. “Cities are where it is at. It’s more important who is in this house [in reference to San Francisco city hall, where he was speaking] than the White House. We need more zero-emissions cars, trash trucks, buses, whatever.”
Nearly 200,000 electric vehicles were sold in the US last year, although relative sales lag behind many other countries, with analysts blaming lack of marketing by large auto firms, cultural attachment to large cars and anxiety over driving range. It is expected that several US cities and states will use the climate summit to pledge an expansion of electric recharge points.
Erik Solheim, the UN’s environment chief, said that half of vehicles bought in his native Norway are now electric or hybrid due to a change to tax incentives and allowing electric vehicles to drive in dedicated bus lanes.
“With political leadership, it can change a lot faster than people think,” he said. “In Norway you see Nissan Leafs everywhere now. Every city and state should look to see what they can do on this.”
Elected officials in the US are not going as far as naming an end date for carbon-emitting vehicles, but advocates for electric vehicles hope even the more modest commitments will provide the momentum to radically change the face of car fleets, thereby helping avoid dangerous climate change and lessen the health impacts of air pollution near roads.
“Transportation for a long time has been the lost stepchild because everyone has focused on electricity,” said Sue Reid, vice-president of climate and energy at Ceres. “But we are now seeing electric vehicles becoming cost competitive right at the point of sale due to improvements in battery technology.
“There is a gap in awareness and education in the US but once that is bridged, things will change. This is the beginning of the end for the internal combustion engine. Soon, it won’t make sense for automakers to be producing cars on different platforms.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/13/electric-cars-climate-change-summit-zero-emissions

Correct, hurricane Florence is weather. But, weather is the result of climate and changing weather patterns have been shown to be the result of climate change.
What is not yet fully clear is the role of man in the process of natural climate change; whether green house gas emissions over the last 150 years have accelerated the change and whether by substantially reducing emissions the change can be slowed down or stopped, certainl they have not helped.

As recently as a decade ago, climate scientists had a motto that “you can’t attribute any single extreme event to global warming.” 
By the time politicians and journalists started repeating that line, however, the science had moved on, so that we now can attribute individual events in a probabilistic sense. For example, if a baseball player on steroids is hitting 20 percent more home runs, we can’t attribute a particular home run to steroids. But we can say steroids made it 20 percent more likely to have occurred. For some of the physical processes discussed here, one can view increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as steroids for the storms.

From 1924 to 1974 (50 year span) - 5 of the top 10 most intense land falling Atlantic hurricanes occurred. 2 of those being the strongest ever recorded. From 1974 to 2018 (46 year span) - 5 of the top 10 most intense land falling Atlantic hurricanes occurred. 2 of those (2005 and 2017) were the weakest out of the top ten. 
Let’s break it down more. From 1924 to 1935 there were 3 out of the top ten most intense storms recorded. 1935 was strongest ever recorded. 1924 was the 5th strongest ever recorded. 1932 was the 8th strongest ever recorded. From 2007 to 2018 there were 3 out of the top ten most intense storms recorded. 2007 was 4th strongest. And the two 2017 storms were 6th and 9th.Remember, the storms’ intensities prior to 1970s were inexact estimates with the most precise only coming once they hit landfall, which is typically lower than when at sea (which is where it’s been recorded since then through dropsondes)
Now, let’s take the overall most intense storms in the Atlantic (whether they hit landfall or not). Since 1924, there has been 20 of them with a pressure of less than 920 hPa. 14 of them have been since 1980, which is not surprising since dropsondes had become the gold standard and allowed us to accurately record the intensity of these monster storms. From 1980 to 2000, 6 of those 14 major storms have occurred with pressures of 899, 919, 888, 918, 916 and 905, respectively. From 2000 to 2018, 8 of those 14 major storms have occurred with pressures of 915, 910, 902, 895, 882, 905, 914 and 908. During the period from 1980-2000, 33.3% of the major storms were below a pressure of 900. From 2000 to 2018, 25% of the major storms were below a pressure of 900. To put the ‘below 900’ in context, there has only been 5 major storms ever recorded below 900 in the Atlantic. 2 of them occurred from 1980-2000 (to get even more specific, both of them occurred in the 80s). I believe that with the information provided, one could easily argue against the claim that storms are becoming more intense. It seems that the intensity of these storms are not any different than they were during previous 20 year spans. Also, the claims that these hurricanes are becoming more destructive is debatable.

It was marked by the strongest hurricane – Irma – ever observed in the open Atlantic, the near total devastation of Puerto Rico by a similarly powerful category 5 monster Maria, and Hurricane Harvey – the worst flooding event in US history. At the time, I commented here and elsewhere about the role climate change had played in amplifying the destructive characteristics of these storms.
Not to be outdone, the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, initially predicted to be quiet – quelled by an incipient El Niño event and cool, early summer ocean waters – has suddenly erupted. If the current disturbance in the western Gulf of Mexico known as “95L” earns the status of tropical storm, the 2018 season will be the second time in recorded history that we’ve seen five tropical storms simultaneously present in the Atlantic basin (the last time was in 1971).
What happened to cause all of this? An early autumn ocean “heat wave” has brought sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic to bathtub-level warmth. Just as summer heat waves on land are greatly increased in frequency and intensity by even modest overall warming, so too are these ocean heat waves becoming more frequent and more extreme as the oceans continue warm. All else being equal, warmer oceans mean more energy to intensify tropical storms and hurricanes.
But when it comes to coastal threat, it hardly matters how many tropical storms there are over the course of the season. A single landfalling hurricane can wreak havoc and destruction. Think Katrina in 2005, Irene in 2011, Sandy in 2012, either Harvey or Maria in 2017 and now Florence in 2018.
In this sense, the sometimes fractious debate about whether we’ll see more or fewer storms in a warmer world is somewhat misplaced. What matters is that there is a consensus we’ll see stronger and worse flood-producing storms – and, in fact, we’re seeing them already. That brings us to Hurricane Florence: a climatologically-amplified triple threat.
First, there is the threat of wind damage. Florence strengthened into a monster category 4 hurricane with 140 mile per hour winds over those very warm western Atlantic waters. Past studies indicate a roughly 7% increase in the peak wind speed of a category 4 storm for each 1C warming of ocean surface temperatures. So the roughly 1.5C warmer-than-normal waters in the subtropical Atlantic where the storm intensified (and keep in mind that “normal” as modernly defined by NOAA as the average during the 1981-2010 period is itself already about 1C warmer than pre-industrial times prior to advent of human-caused greenhouse warming) corresponds to a roughly 11% increase in peak winds. But the destructive potential of a storm goes as the cube of the wind speed. So that 11% increase in wind speed corresponds to a 33% increase in destructive potential. That’s not a subtle effect.
Fortunately those winds decreased substantially as the storm approached landfall. But even as a strong, very slowly moving hurricane pounding structures with near 100mph winds for hours on end, Florence is doing considerable damage as it skirts the long Carolina coastline, taking down trees and powerlines and rendering large areas without electricity.
That brings us to the second, even greater threat: storm surge. Though the storm weakened as it approached the coast, the storm surge was built up over of a period of several days, including the time during which it existed as a category 4 or strong category 3 storm. That means the catastrophic, roughly-10ft storm surge from Cape Hatteras to Myrtle Beach was baked in well in advance of the landfall of the storm.
Don’t forget to add to that the 1ft of sea level rise that has occurred along the south-eastern US coast, mostly due to climate change (there’s a small contribution owing to the geological subsidence of the coast).
The wonderful little coastal North Carolina town of New Bern has been particularly hard hit, with the downtown area flooded by the 10ft storm surge and 200 people requiring rescue. It is seemingly prescient that I gave a lecture in New Bern last year, during last year’s storm season, warning about the coastal threat from climate change, in a church that has now been flooded by Florence.
Last, but not least, we have the threat of inland flooding. Warmer oceans mean more moisture in the atmosphere. It’s one of the simplest relationships in all of meteorology: for each 1C of warming, there is about 7% more moisture in the air. That means those 1.5C-above-normal ocean temperatures have given the storm about 10% more moisture. All other things being equal, that implies about 10% more rainfall.
But that’s not the whole story. What made Harvey a record flooding event last year and makes Florence such a flooding threat now, is the slow-moving nature of the storm. The slower the storm moves, the more rainfall that accumulates in any one location and the more flooding you get. Such was the case with other devastating storms such as Harvey or 2011’s Hurricane Irene that caused historic flooding in my own state of Pennsylvania.
Some headlines have reported that Florence is a warning of what is to come. But in reality, it is a warning of what has already arrived. Far worse is to come if we don’t get serious, in a hurry, about acting on climate change. We must transition away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy even more rapidly, and we must elect politicians who will support such efforts. In the US, there’s an opportunity to do so in less than two months now in the upcoming midterm elections, where we must elect politicians who support enlightened policies on energy and climate, and vote out of office those who don’t.

By erecting barriers of rock and sand, researchers believe they could halt the slide of undersea glaciers as they disintegrate into the deep. It would be a drastic endeavour but could buy some time if climate change takes hold, according to a new paper published on Thursday in the Cryosphere journal, from the European Geosciences Union.
Though the notion may sound far-fetched, the design would be relatively straightforward. “We are imagining very simple structures, simply piles of gravel or sand on the ocean floor,” said Michael Wolovick, a researcher at the department of geosciences at Princeton University in the US who described the plans as “within the order of magnitude of plausible human achievements”.
The structures would not just be aimed at holding back the melting glaciers, but at preventing warmer water from reaching the bases of the glaciers under the sea. New research is now being undertaken by scientists showing how the effects of the warmer water around the world, as the oceans warm, may be the leading cause of underwater melting of the glaciers.
Wolovick and his fellow researchers ran computer models to check on the likely impacts of the structures they believe would be needed, taking as their starting point the Thwaites glacier in Antarctica, which at 80-100km is one of the widest glaciers in the world.
They found that creating a structure of isolated columns or mounds on the sea floor, each about 300 metres high, would require between 0.1 and 1.5 cubic km of aggregate material. This would make such a project similar to the amount of material excavated to form Dubai’s Palm Islands, which took 0.3 cubic km of sand and rock, or the Suez canal, which required the excavation of roughly one cubic km.
Building a structure of this kind would have about a 30% probability of preventing a runaway collapse of the west Antarctic ice sheet, according to the models.
Using more complex designs that would be harder to accomplish in the harsh conditions on the sea bottom in the south polar regions, a small underwater wall could be built, which they calculate would have a 70% chance of succeeding in blocking half the warm water from reaching the ice shelf.
Glaciers melting under rising temperatures at the poles have the potential to discharge vast amounts of fresh water into the oceans, sending sea levels rising faster than they have for millennia. The Thwaites glacier alone, an ice stream the size of Britain and likely to be the biggest single source of future sea level rises, could trigger the melting of enough water to raise global sea levels by three metres.
Many of these glaciers extend far under the sea, and scientists have begun to explore their subsea melting as well as the easier-to-measure reductions in the or visible parts. The undersea research vessel now known as Boaty McBoatface after its much larger relative was named the Sir David Attenborough is to be deployed at the Thwaites glacier for just this purpose.
Building undersea walls could be accomplished by similar vessels but would have to be precisely positioned and strong enough to withstand the immense pressure of the ice.
The authors hope that by creating their experimental models they can foster future research into the engineering needed to bring about such projects, which would take many years or decades to be worked out and implemented.
Geo-engineering solutions such as this one should not deter the world from reducing greenhouse gas emissions, Wolovick said. “The more carbon we emit, the less likely it becomes that the ice sheets will survive in the long term at anything close to their present volume,” he said.
The forthcoming report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is expected to warn afresh of the potential for sea level rises to inundate low-lying areas if warming is not held to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/20/build-walls-on-seafloor-to-stop-glaciers-melting-scientists-say

Gov. Jerry Brown announced plans for the satellite on the last day of a climate change summit hosted by San Francisco, in a final rebuke to President Donald Trump’s denial of man-made warming.
“With science still under attack,” Brown said “we’re going to launch our own satellite, our own damn satellite, to figure out where the pollution is.” Brown said the satellite will help pinpoint the source of planet-warming emissions.
California will team up with Planet Labs, a company run by ex-Nasa scientists. The data collected, including on carbon dioxide emissions and methane leaks from oil and gas operations, could be made public as part of a partnership with the advocacy group Environmental Defense Fund. The new project comes as Trump has proposed slashing Nasa climate research mission budgets. It is one of dozens of commitments of mixed significance unveiled by states, cities and businesses at the event.
Despite the optimism on show at the summit, Kerry said climate efforts must ramp up.
“I am going to tell the truth, and the truth is we are not anywhere near where we need to be with respect to the overall challenge of climate change,” said Kerry, who worked to secure the 2015 global Paris climate agreement under former president Barack Obama.
Kerry blasted Donald Trump for deciding to leave that deal, calling it “one of the single greatest acts of irresponsibility by a president of the United States anywhere at any time.”
Leaders of the countries already suffering most from sea-level rise and ocean acidification echoed Kerry’s concerns, saying that international action is slowing.
“The world has lost, all of us have lost, momentum since Paris in 2015. Although the rate of increase has slowed, we’ve not yet peaked our global emissions. But we must do so by 2020. We really cannot afford to wait any longer,” said Mia Mottley, prime minister of the Caribbean island nation of Barbados.
Mottley’s country is in the direct path of hurricanes that are growing in strength and may narrowly avoid a more direct hit from tropical storm Isaac this week.
The world is set to watch temperatures rise 3C above pre-industrial levels by the time a child born today is old, Mottley said, even if countries adhere to the goals they said.
Frank Bainimarama, prime minister of Fiji, said countries need to speed their work.
“We all know that the levels of ambition in our national plans need to be ramped up because we are not on track to meet the targets of the Paris agreement,” Bainimarama said.
Former US vice-president Al Gore struck a more positive tone.
“We must do it. We can do it. I’m convinced ever more because of the success of this summit here in San Francisco that we will do it,” he said, reminding that the US has not technically left the Paris deal yet and that a new president could re-enter.
The warnings were at odds with the overall atmosphere of the summit.
On the eve of the gathering, California governor Jerry Brown signed a bill that would make the state’s electricity supply carbon-free by 2045. A separate executive order by Brown is more sweeping, committing to net zero emissions across the entire California economy, also by 2045.
Other cities and regions from around the world have followed this with various pledges, with New York City promising $4bn to renewable energy and clean water and cities including Los Angeles, Tokyo, Honolulu, Oslo and Greater Manchester pledging to build energy efficient buildings or deploy fleets of electric buses.
A group of 29 philanthropists committed $4bn over five years to combat climate change, the largest such investment of its kind, while companies such as Ikea, Walmart and Unilever promised to reduce emissions through measures such as electrified trucks for deliveries and action to prevent deforestation in the tropics.
Jonathan Pershing, the State Department’s climate negotiator under Obama, said the summit brings hope to the climate cause.
“The story here is optimistic. The question here is does the optimism translate, and can this message get out globally,” Pershing said. “There is a good broad cross-section of people from around the world, but it’s just a few thousand people, and it’s a problem that’s going to require engagement by millions.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/14/john-kerry-climate-change-california-summit

As for the Hinkley Point nuclear plant in the U.K., which is also being developed by EDF (although its construction has not started yet) [??] and is expected to sell power at $115–120/MWh under a Contract for Difference (CfD) deal, the report stresses that UK National Audit Office (NAO) has already defined it as “risky and expensive project with uncertain strategic and economic benefit.”

Although the Department has not fully reappraised the government’s strategic case, its analysis still shows that new nuclear power should play a role in the UK achieving its 2050 decarbonisation target at least cost. This aligns with the views of most independent energy sector analysts (paragraphs 1.9 to 1.12).❞

I think it's doubtful that nuclear could expand that rapidly, safely. Nuclear requires skilled designers and architects for every project... there isn't a 'turnkey' solution to either building or waste management, which runs project by project.
BQENDWhen it comes to firm capacity (a guaranteed supply) then nuclear takes a similar time as intermittent supplies.
But here's the kicker - for 1GW of solar capacity to match 1GW of nuclear you have to install getting on for 10GW because solar only works at capacity 10% of the time.Even in places like California the cf is circa 20% so an average five times as much.
But even so, here's an example.
The Thames array ( recently the largest off shore array in the world) provides power to 470,000 homes at a cost of £180/MWh It will last 18-25 years. If has a cf of 40.8% (better then average including newer wind farms)It took 9 years to build (an 11 year project overall)
That's not to criticise solar or wind - they are all very useful sources of low carbon energy - but to compare that to (even a delayed) nuclear plant that operates with a cf of 93% that will last 60-80 years the construction time is not as clear cut as many would have us believe..

How do people get much bigger numbers? Well, one area is assuming 100% run-rate 24/7 for the power supply.

Nuclear power is being left behind, industry experts say
some extracts:
BQSTART
The 2018 edition of the Nuclear Industry Status Report (WNISR) reveals that nuclear power capacity grew by only 1% in 2017, while wind and solar saw their share increase by 17% and 35%, respectively. The report also recognizes that solar and wind are now the cheapest grid-connected sources of energy. Investments in new nuclear plants, on the other hand, are only being driven by public support, and by nuclear weapon states.
BQEND
and
BQSTART
The share of nuclear in global power production has dropped significantly, from 17.5% in 1996 to 10.3% in 2017. “It is instructive to note that the construction of new nuclear power plants is mostly driven and backed by states, and not by the private sector,” the report further notes. On top of this, most state proponents of nuclear power programs are nuclear weapon states.
BQEND
and
BQSTART
As for the Hinkley Point nuclear plant in the U.K., which is also being developed by EDF (although its construction has not started yet) and is expected to sell power at $115–120/MWh under a Contract for Difference (CfD) deal, the report stresses that UK National Audit Office (NAO) has already defined it as “risky and expensive project with uncertain strategic and economic benefit.” 
In order to raise funds for the project, EDF announced its intention to sell non-core assets worth $11.4 billion, with the project being finally approved in September 2016. “The constant decline in energy and electricity consumption in the U.K. do not favor the economic case for nuclear new-build,” the report suggests.

But anyway let's take the argument at face value.I suppose the question is and always be- if it is that good why is it not happening?The US in the 50s 60s and 70s went all out for nuclear- it had support of the public and both sides of government, and then it went pear shape in the 70s and 80s and 30% of all the planned reactors were abandoned. and then nothing.The nuclear industry was too slow and too expensive- so it promised to build a simpler, quicker to build and cheaper to build new reactor the Westinghouse AP1000.That start the revival of 4 new reactors and they ended up too slow and too expensive- 2 were abandoned, one is being completed and the 4th....may get completed if it doesn't cost the state ... and the makers went bankrupt in the process.
In the UK in the 50s and 60s and 70s the public liked nuclear, both parties in government liked nuclear- it was state funded but by the 70s the new reactor was too slow and too expensive and further plans were abandoned. and now with nuclear's revival Hinkley is being built slowly- numbers 5 and 6 of a new reactor which whilst based on the 60s nuclear reactor is safer, and better and faster to build- except Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant started in 2005 has still to be commissioned- 13 years on, and the other plants are still delayed and over cost and not just by a little. 3x as much €9 billion not the €3billion.
And the plans to roll out replacement reactors in the UK has now stalled with announcement dates being pushed back as nuclear builders negotiate with government over funding.
Saying nuclear is so good is like saying I could be the next 100m gold medal winner at the olympics if I was only faster, fitter and younger.
So is California's, Germany's and the UK's investment in alternative value for money?Germany's investment is €500 billion up to 2025- what does it buy?It includes the cost of an enhanced grid, something that building lots of nuclear on the coast to the north would also require and it buys future economic investment. The value of that investment is spread out in local communities and smaller business as well as being an effective state injection of cash. It employs 700,000 people in country where a quarter of the economy is industry. And it has promoted innovation in alternative energy [with a €1.5 billion investment each year] and helped to massively lower costs.That €500 billion is over 15 years so around €30 billion a year in a €3 trillion economy and it hasn't harmed the wider economy.

Since Arrhenius believed it would take several millennia for us to increase CO2 by even 50% that projection may well have been correct.
However we increased CO2 by 40% in a little over a century, so we will never get to test Arrhenius' projections of what would happen with an extremely slow release of CO2 and resultant gentle warming.

That in itself was a big deal, but Brown didn’t stop there; he also issued an executive order calling for the entire California economy to become carbon-neutral by 2045. That’s a huge deal.
In order to stay below the Paris climate threshold of 2°C global warming above pre-industrial temperatures, humanity must become carbon-neutral by around 2060 or 2070. If California can meet Brown’s target, it will be providing the rest of the world a blueprint for meeting the Paris target. As the world’s fifth-largest economy, California can provide a powerful roadmap for others to follow.
Brown’s executive order directs the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to work with relevant state agencies to develop a framework for implementation and accounting of progress toward statewide carbon neutrality. While state agencies can figure out a plan to achieve carbon neutrality, the state legislature will have to pass laws to implement that plan.
California has been all-in on tackling climate change, as its carbon cap and trade system and SB 100 illustrate, but Californians will have to keep electing climate realists to state office in order to make the dream of carbon neutrality a reality.
SB 100 tackles the electricity sector, but because California has long been transitioning toward clean energy, electricity now only accounts for 16% of the state’s greenhouse gas emissions. Transportation accounts for the biggest chunk at 41%. Brown has been pushing for a transition to electric cars, signing another executive order earlier this year setting a goal of 5m EVs on the road by 2030, and several bills last week to help expand their use.
While California has the most EVs on the road today (both total and per capita) of any state, they still only account for 5% of new car sales, with 380,000 sold so far. Accelerating that transition toward EVs is crucial for meeting the carbon neutrality goal, and it’s the main reason why California is fighting the Trump administration’s efforts to freeze fuel efficiency standards and take away the state’s ability to set its own.
The industrial sector accounts for another 23% of California’s greenhouse gas emissions. About half of that comes from the petroleum industry – predominantly from drilling for oil and natural gas, as well as oil refining. California is the fourth-largest oil producing state. The Trump administration wants to increase that number and is contemplating opening 1.6 million acres in California held by the Bureau of Land Management to fracking and oil drilling. But a wiser future president could revoke those drilling leases on federal lands, and California could ban drilling and fracking on state lands. That’s a bridge too far for Jerry Brown, and protesters have been criticizing him for it, but it’s easy to imagine a future governor taking this step.
Agriculture and forestry account for another 8% of California’s greenhouse gas emissions. The state is already launching a Healthy Soils Initiative to increase carbon sequestration via farming. For example, one pilot project is monitoring how much carbon will be stored by clover planted between trees at an almond orchard. The University of California at Davis is also conducting experiments to evaluate how changing livestock feed can reduce methane emissions from cattle.
Another 7% comes from the residential sector, most of which is due to burning natural gas for heating and cooking. But stoves, hot water heaters, and heating units can be replaced by electric appliances powered by California’s increasingly carbon-free energy. Last week, Brown also signed a bill directing CARB to study ways of cutting carbon pollution from residential and commercial buildings.
In short, there are a lot of feasible ways that California can reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and approach carbon neutrality. The plan will may also include some degree of carbon offsetting and carbon capture and sequestration to get the state’s emissions down to (or below) zero by 2045. It’s a daunting but achievable goal.
In contrast, the Trump administration has been doing everything in its power to increase carbon pollution for the sake of industry profits. In its latest polluting move, the Trump EPA plans to scrap two regulations aimed at reducing methane pollution from oil and gas wells.
According to EPA’s own analysis, repealing a regulation requiring that oil and gas wells be monitored for methane leaks every six months will add 8.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent to the atmosphere over a six-year period. It will save the oil and gas industry, whose annual profits exceed $100bn, $75m per year. That’s the equivalent carbon pollution of adding more than 300,000 cars on the road in order to give the oil &amp; gas industry a 0.07% revenue boost.
Levels of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, are already rising. The Trump EPA wants to further loosen rules on leaks and releases by the oil and gas industry.https://t.co/O2kfhELrA3 pic.twitter.com/wmXqDyzgjg
It’s hard to imagine a starker contrast. The Trump administration is making America the stupidest country in the world on climate change, while the Democrats running California are creating a roadmap to show the world how to meet the Paris climate target. And the GOP is running away from California and toward Trump.

Taylor confirmed there would be no policy to reduce emissions in the electricity sector during an answer to the Greens MP Adam Bandt in question time on Tuesday.
Bandt asked whether the RET could be extended beyond 2020 given there was currently no policy mechanism to replace it, and the lack of settled policy could threaten investment in low emissions technology.
The energy minister flatly rejected the entreaty. “The truth of the matter is the renewable energy target is going to wind down from 2020, it reaches its peak in 2020, and we won’t be replacing that with anything.”
Taylor indicated there was no need to have a policy because “we know we will reach the 26% emission reduction target without additional intervention”.
In a column for the Australian Financial Review, published on Tuesday, Taylor hedged slightly more, declaring “emissions reductions are the least of our problems, with every prospect we will reach the 26% reduction below 2005 levels ahead of schedule and without interventions”.
Those declarations from the minister contradict advice from the Energy Security Board. In August, the ESB told federal and state energy ministers that if the national energy guarantee wasn’t implemented, the national electricity market would “fall short of the emissions reduction target of 26% below 2005 levels”.
The Coalition’s plan to 2030 was to replace the RET with the national energy guarantee, which imposed an emissions reduction target for electricity.
But Malcolm Turnbull abandoned the Neg as one of his last acts in the prime ministership, and the policy has now been junked officially by the cabinet under Scott Morrison’s leadership.
Taylor says the Morrison government is now focused exclusively on lowering power prices and will pursue regulatory interventions to achieve that end.
But while some government conservatives routinely equate renewables with higher power prices, there is evidence that a big build of renewable capacity contracted through the RET is currently lowering wholesale prices by increasing supply to the market.
Last December, the Australian Energy Market Commission predicted wholesale electricity costs would fall in 2018-19 and 2019-20, with a reduction in the order of 12%, due to approximately 5,300 MW of new committed and expected generation entering the national electricity market – the majority of which is renewable generation (4,900 MW).
The energy minister has also criticised a proposal by the ALP to adopt an emissions reduction target for electricity of 45%. Taylor told parliament on Tuesday: “The result will be we will all pay more for our electricity”.
But new modelling from Frontier Economics undertaken for the Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss) and the Brotherhood of St Laurence, published by Guardian Australia on Tuesday, indicates otherwise. It predicts power prices for households would fall by 2030 under four different scenarios – business as usual and emissions reduction targets of 26%, 45% and 65%.
It says that under the Coalition’s now abandoned 26% target, the average saving to households would be 20.8% while under the 45% scenario, which is Labor’s target, the average saving would be 18.3%.
The Morrison government says Australia will remain a signatory to the Paris climate agreement but it is unclear how compliance with an economy-wide emissions target can be achieved in the absence of a policy roadmap.
Recent polling suggests voters are more worried about climate change than they were 12 months ago. A study tracking voter sentiment for more than a decade, funded first by the Climate Institute and now by the Australia Institute, finds 73% (up from 66% in 2017) of respondents are concerned about climate change, and a clear majority, 68%, believes the government should set domestic targets to comply with our Paris commitments.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/sep/18/coalition-wont-replace-renewables-target-after-it-winds-down-in-2020

Rail only has a certain capacity though, not enough to move enough containers quickly enough, so whether investment in a dedicated three mile rail track, from the port to an area around Switch Island is worth it, I could not answer that, but it would certainly be something to look into.
The busiest port in the UK currently transports about 300,000 containers a year by rail, that would be about 10% of the projected number Liverpool will see by 2025.
The tunnel, in my view, could start within the port and so would be directly for port traffic, no traffic lights, no congestion, no public transport, no external pollution. Pollution would be treated as it is with other tunnels, including the Mersey Tunnels, which took ten years to contact, almost one hundred years ago. 
The tunnel would be about three miles, planning obstacles would surely be overcome quickly and considering the Channel tunnel took six years to construct in 1988 and is six or seven times longer, how quickly could the port tunnel be constructed, how quickly could Peel Holdings solve their problem and air pollution is permanently addressed, with the government preventing costs to the NHS year on year for ever. The port operates successfully, traffic flows, peole can breathe and the government has more money to spend in other departments.

The port, owned by Peel Holdings, has seen a £400 million investment to construct a deep water terminal, which will enable the port to welcome the largest container ships in the world and increase capacity by 500%.
The port now has the problem of transporting millions more containers every year between the port and the motorway. Currently, the hgvs are travelling along a very tight dual carriage way (A5036) fifteen foot from houses on both sides and past a handful of schools and the route is officially one of the most congested in England.
So the people in that area and the port need a solution. The solution, according to Highways England/ The government, is not a tunnel from the port to the motorway, specifically for the millions of hgvs that would use it each year, it is to build an open road through a country park, increasing air pollution at a time when every developed country realises the extent of the problem, even if it is failing to properly address it or address it at all. 
I think it is one thing looking at existing roads and areas which are heavily polluted and wondering how they can be improved, but to actually deliberately create a new one in 2018 should be deemed a criminal act, given all the evidence of the affects of air pollution we are now seeing almost daily, effects which will directly cost the NHS in all sorts of ways, including social care, on an ongoing basis. 
The Mersey Gateway, recently opened, has a £7 each way toll for hgvs. How long would it take for a tunnel from the port to the motorway to pay for itself, without considering the costs to the NHS of an open road from potential accidents to the affects of air pollution.
The worst thing about this is Labour councillors and mp's, in a Labour constituency, voted for the expansion to the port, without access in place to manage the significant increase in traffic it would bring. The Tories can be blamed for providing Highways England with a budget large enough only for an external road, but, unfortunately, the expansion, without environmentally friendly access, would never have happened, if Labour councillors and mps had not given it the green light.

While pollution by greenhouse gases, chiefly CO2, requires international action, some emissions can be tackled much closer to home. Evidence about the health impact of the gases and particles produced by road traffic, industry and open fires has developed rapidly since the 1990s. In cities, many of which have experienced rapid growth in traffic, air quality has become a pressing issue.
Across the EU, legal limits are regularly breached, and the UK, France and Germany are among six countries facing large fines. Until Michael Gove publishes his environment bill there remains uncertainty over the teeth the watchdog will have when it comes to enforcing the rules after Brexit. But it is not clear whether the genie of public anxiety about toxic air can be pushed back into the bottle. This week saw reports about new research into the amount of particulate matter breathed by children at London schools, and pollutants found in mothers’ placentas. Last month it was revealed that Chinese researchers have linked high levels of air pollution to reduced intelligence.
New clean air zones in London and Birmingham, including charges for the most polluting vehicles, start their rollout next year (two other cities, Southampton and Derby, have been ticked off by the government for missing a deadline for proposals). Such schemes represent a milestone in efforts to limit nitrogen oxide pollution from diesel vehicles after the still-unfolding emissions-cheating scandal. This weekend will see the closure of 50 roads for the capital’s first “car-free day”, an initiative campaigners hope will soon be scaled up to match more ambitious schemes in cities including Brussels and Paris.
What happens next depends on public opinion as well as government. Parents are increasingly worried about the health of their children. Rosamund Kissi-Debrah, who believes air pollution killed her daughter Ella, wants to argue the case in a new inquest. On the other side of the argument are those concerned about the impact of charges. In Birmingham, these include businesses supplying parts to the local automotive industry. In London, Westminster city council has opposed schemes it says penalise its residents, and last week inflicted a defeat on the mayor in the high court. No politician is likely to forget the saga of the London congestion zone’s western extension, which lasted only a year before being scrapped.
The situation is complicated because vehicle emissions and air pollution, while closely linked to congestion, are not the same thing. Urban transport is a political question and dirty air is not the only reason many people would like to see traffic reduced. Others include road safety, noise, and the belief that public transport, bicycles and pedestrians should take priority over private cars – even electric ones. On the other side, many people are attached to their cars and see driving as their right and an economic necessity.
Were it not for the obstructive policies pursued by Boris Johnson, London would be further ahead than it is. Birmingham and Manchester are catching up. The obesity crisis as well as air pollution and congestion means the direction of travel – towards healthier and more active lifestyles, and less traffic – should be clear. Per-mile road pricing was looked at by Mr Khan last year and remains under review. Whether by this route or another, cities and their leaders must find a way through.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/18/the-guardian-view-on-clean-air-zones-cities-must-be-bold

From the MIT tropical cyclone expert Kerry Emanuel.
BQSTART
Here I define an index of the potential destructiveness of hurricanes based on the total dissipation of power, integrated over the lifetime of the cyclone, and show that this index has increased markedly since the mid-1970s. This trend is due to both longer storm lifetimes and greater storm intensities. 
I find that the record of net hurricane power dissipation is highly correlated with tropical sea surface temperature, reflecting well-documented climate signals, including multi-decadal oscillations in the North Atlantic and North Pacific, and global warming. 
My results suggest that future warming may lead to an upward trend in tropical cyclone destructive potential, and—taking into account an increasing coastal population—a substantial increase in hurricane-related losses in the twenty-first century.

We will only know in hindsight how much carbon we can emit, and the answer, at over 400ppm atmospheric CO2 now, looks like we'll need negative emissions.
From the world’s largest general scientific association, The American Association for the Advancement of Science:
BQSTART
The range of uncertainty for the warming along the current emissions path is wide enough to encompass massively disruptive consequences to societies and ecosystems: as global temperatures rise, there is a real risk, however small, that one or more critical parts of the Earth’s climate system will experience abrupt, unpredictable and potentially irreversible changes. 
Disturbingly, scientists do not know how much warming is required to trigger such changes to the climate system. (my emphasis)

I used to be a systems analyst in London, so have enjoyed analysing the climate system in detail for all these years, and how mankind is changing things for the worse without really mitigating things to sufficient scale to avoid CAGW. I have a close friend, a post-doctoral PhD in methane research in Germany, so I know a lot about Arctic methane release as well - it's scary. Too close to the conditions and positive feedbacks that precipitated the PETM. I think the 2C ""limit"" is a terrible joke now, just an excuse to continue BAU for as long as they can get away with it. I am promoting a fossil-fuel price ramp everywhere I can these days.

There's a monumental difference between capitalism and nazism etc. You seem to be suggesting all the evil in the world is blamed on capitalism. I'm trying to suggest that evil in the world will exist no matter how many protections are in place. However, far more evil exists in non-capitalistic environments. So it's not a deflection...you brought it up when you said capitalism will lie, cheat, poison people etc.

At the recent acceleration rate of ice sheet mass loss of around 44 Gt/yr2, reported by Eric Rignot last year, (each year an extra 44Gt move into the ocean) we get 78cm of SLR from the ice sheets alone by 2100. Thermal expansion and mountain glaciers add another 20-30cm which brings us up to ~1m.
Here's a graph of post glacial sea level rise, showing both how stable the ice sheets have been for 6000 years and what they can do when they “let go”. During Meltwater Pulse 1A sea level rose 4m per century for four centuries. There were larger ice sheets then, but that rate indicates that the ice sheets can do dramatic things when they retreat.

“Rising climate change concerns have led and could lead to additional legal and/or regulatory measures which could result in project delays or cancellations, a decrease in demand for fossil fuels, potential litigation and additional compliance obligations.”
And :
“Additionally, some groups are pressuring certain investors to divest their investments in fossil fuel companies. If this were to continue, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our securities and our ability to access equity capital markets.”

Fossil energy is brainpowered. 
And hardly any enterprise in the history of humans has had so much money and incitament to understand carbon. From how it forms, is stored in solid liquid and gas states and how it works. 
It is important to remember that a lot of paleoclimate also exist because science has been gifted cores (science do not have resources to core all over the planet). Of course these gifts come with contracts. There are data from these cores that are not for publication of course. Especially everything that has to do with permeability and details of reservoirs. 
I am not letting big fossil off the hook here. 
We should also remember that fossil companies are now pretty much signed up to the IPCC version of reality (albeit dragging their feet because the cash earnt while regulation moves slow is exceptionally good). 
So in terms of science denial - nobody does that outside of media (and BTL) any longer. 
People who do denial these days are either lacking seriousness, basic understanding of science or both. 
Being serious about keeping the planet away from over shooting two degrees is now a rather simple budget. 
We can emit carbon as we do at present for ca 20 years before we simply stop. Nix more nada carbon emissions after 2040. 
If we decarbonize really fast by not wasting it so much, we can extend use and emissions to span the whole century. It is very simply as zero order question - because the budget is finite. 
So the question to fossil companies and their fan-boys is simple. 
Want to do this at peak use for another 20 years before closing the industry down abruptly - or want to decarbonize ASAP all the things that make sense to stretch the time with carbon for the things that at present does not have alternatives? (Specifically ocean transport, aircraft and some industrial sectors (such as steel, aluminum, cement and energy) beyond 2040?
This is what we need to debate. The solution. 
And that include the amount of carbon we can emit.

So what species of animal has been the most affected because of climate change? 
I'm not sure I know the answer to that. You can pick a lot of the really easy glib ones, so polar bears are gonna get hit because they rely so much on sea ice, pikas are gonna get hit because they’re really cold adapted. 
Probably now the biggest worries may be things we don’t even know about. So you think about what we're doing, we have a lot of us and we have a lot of places that there's a thousand miles of cornfield and somewhere in that there's a little bog and in that bog there's somebody who’s hanging on and they may not be very important and they may not be very common but that's what they do. 
And now the climate changed and they need to get a thousand miles somewhere else and how do they get there? And so probably the initial real issues are how it combines with the other things that we're doing.
The climate change we’ve done so far is still pretty small compared to natural variability but we're pushing the system in multiple ways.

Except that it isn't and that's the problem. Whatever metric you like to choose fossil fuels are not going out of business anytime soon unless climate policies are ramped up dramatically. The percentage of fossil fuels in world energy supply has hardly changed in decades. Here's electricity supply (from BP statistical review) but choose primary energy supply or final energy use and the picture will be no better and maybe worse.

Although ultimately climate can will kill a weather forecast, this does not necessarily prevent long term prediction of the climate - the statistics of weather averaged over suitable time and perhaps space scales. The calculation of climate variables (that is long term averages) is much easier than weather forecasting, since weather is ruled by vagaries of stochastic fluctuations, while climate is not.
We can demonstrate this sort of climate response clearly in the Lorenz model, or any more complex climate model. Perturbing the initial conditions gives a completely different trajectory (weather), but this averages out over time, and the statistics of different long-term runs are indistinguishable. However a steady perturbation to the system can generate a significant change to the long-term statistics. This disproves the common but misguided claim that chaotic weather prevents meaningful climate prediction. In fact, all climate models do predict that the change in globally-averaged steady state temperature, at least, is almost exactly proportional to the change in the net radiative forcing, indicating a near-linear response of the climate, at least on the broadest scales. 
 At the centre of chaos theory is the fascinating idea that order and chaos are not always diametrically opposed. Chaotic systems are an intimate mix of the two. From the outside they display unpredictable and chaotic behaviour, but expose the inner workings and you discover a perfectly deterministic set of equations working like clockwork.

All can and will be decarbonized via hydrogen. Loads and loads of pilots already in operation in the EU.
All you have to do is double the cost of nat gas via carbon taxes (happening - with import fees to ward off outsourcing; and China onboard also); double it via the value of domestic production over imports (any energy); or halve the cost of grid energy by cutting out grid fees when involved with hydrogen production.
Plus we have a steadily rising (imported!) natural gas price approaching; it is likely to double in price to around €45/MWh just like it was in 2013-14. Better deal is: fixed cost; no cash export; no exposure to carbon pricing; increasing interdependence with expanding RES production.

Exxon’s private prediction of the future growth of carbon dioxide levels (left axis) and global temperature relative to 1982 (right axis). Elsewhere in its report, Exxon noted that the most widely accepted science at the time indicated that doubling carbon dioxide levels would cause a global warming of 3°C.

BQENDSo someone at Exxon read a scientific paper which used what is now the commonly accepted level of ECS (Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity) 3°C - the temp rise for a doubling of CO₂ - and wrote a precis of it.

Ellsberg, who was advising the US government on its secret nuclear war plans, had discovered a document that contained an official estimate of the death toll in a preemptive “first strike” on China and the Soviet Union: 300 million in those countries, and double that globally.
Ellsberg was troubled that such a plan existed; years later, he tried to leak the details of nuclear annihilation to the public. Although his attempt failed, Ellsberg would become famous instead for leaking what came to be known as the Pentagon Papers – the US government’s secret history of its military intervention in Vietnam.
America’s amoral military planning during the Cold War echoes the hubris exhibited by another cast of characters gambling with the fate of humanity. Recently, secret documents have been unearthed detailing what the energy industry knew about the links between their products and global warming. But, unlike the government’s nuclear plans, what the industry detailed was put into action.
In the 1980s, oil companies like Exxon and Shell carried out internal assessments of the carbon dioxide released by fossil fuels, and forecast the planetary consequences of these emissions. In 1982, for example, Exxon predicted that by about 2060, CO2 levels would reach around 560 parts per million – double the preindustrial level – and that this would push the planet’s average temperatures up by about 2°C over then-current levels (and even more compared to pre-industrial levels).
Later that decade, in 1988, an internal report by Shell projected similar effects but also found that CO2 could double even earlier, by 2030. Privately, these companies did not dispute the links between their products, global warming, and ecological calamity. On the contrary, their research confirmed the connections.
Shell’s assessment foresaw a one-meter sea-level rise, and noted that warming could also fuel disintegration of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, resulting in a worldwide rise in sea level of “five to six meters.” That would be enough to inundate entire low-lying countries.
Shell’s analysts also warned of the “disappearance of specific ecosystems or habitat destruction,” predicted an increase in “runoff, destructive floods, and inundation of low-lying farmland,” and said that “new sources of freshwater would be required” to compensate for changes in precipitation. Global changes in air temperature would also “drastically change the way people live and work.” All told, Shell concluded, “the changes may be the greatest in recorded history.”
For its part, Exxon warned of “potentially catastrophic events that must be considered.” Like Shell’s experts, Exxon’s scientists predicted devastating sea-level rise, and warned that the American Midwest and other parts of the world could become desert-like. Looking on the bright side, the company expressed its confidence that “this problem is not as significant to mankind as a nuclear holocaust or world famine.”
The documents make for frightening reading. And the effect is all the more chilling in view of the oil giants’ refusal to warn the public about the damage that their own researchers predicted. Shell’s report, marked “confidential,” was first disclosed by a Dutch news organization earlier this year. Exxon’s study was not intended for external distribution, either; it was leaked in 2015.
Nor did the companies ever take responsibility for their products. In Shell’s study, the firm argued that the “main burden” of addressing climate change rests not with the energy industry, but with governments and consumers. That argument might have made sense if oil executives, including those from Exxon and Shell, had not later lied about climate change and actively prevented governments from enacting clean-energy policies.
Although the details of global warming were foreign to most people in the 1980s, among the few who had a better idea than most were the companies contributing the most to it. Despite scientific uncertainties, the bottom line was this: oil firms recognized that their products added CO2 to the atmosphere, understood that this would lead to warming, and calculated the likely consequences. And then they chose to accept those risks on our behalf, at our expense, and without our knowledge.
The catastrophic nuclear war plans that Ellsberg saw in the 1960s were a Sword of Damocles that fortunately never fell. But the oil industry’s secret climate change predictions are becoming reality, and not by accident. Fossil-fuel producers willfully drove us toward the grim future they feared by promoting their products, lying about the effects, and aggressively defending their share of the energy market.
As the world warms, the building blocks of our planet – its ice sheets, forests, and atmospheric and ocean currents – are being altered beyond repair. Who has the right to foresee such damage and then choose to fulfill the prophecy? Although war planners and fossil-fuel companies had the arrogance to decide what level of devastation was appropriate for humanity, only Big Oil had the temerity to follow through. That, of course, is one time too many.

However, as we might be running out of time to comment on this article, I'll share something with you.
Professor Russell Coope was the first to discover abrupt climate change events in the geological record of the 'ice age', while doing research for his Ph.D back in the 1950s.
Coope - who was my palaeontology lecturer long ago - made his discovery entirely by accident, while researching fossil beetle assemblages in 'ice age' sedimentary successions.
He ended up spending decades applying this technique to more and more examples of similar sedimentary successions - the process works because a beetle wing-case is usually sufficient to identify a species, and the species have not changed much in a long time.
Any given collection of species taken together indicates a very precise temperature.
His discovery tells us that the Earth's climates are not necessarily stable.
These rapid climate events were confirmed a few decades later by ice cores from the Greenland ice sheet..... the events he discovered had a number of natural causes.
Not long before he died in 2011, he said that people are messing with a trigger that causes climate change, and the consequences are likely to be 'ferocious'.
'Ferocious' is a difficult word to forget.
We are probably not facing very rapid changes, but that doesn't mean the outcome is any less serious.
""The climatic impacts of releasing fossil fuel CO2 to the atmosphere will last longer than Stonehenge.........Longer than time capsules, longer than nuclear waste, far longer than the age of human civilization so far.""

is worth a look.
This is a short-term effect, and there was a similar short-lived phase around the mid-20th century when there was a big expansion of burning of poor quality coal, which produced lots of aerosols such as sulphates - which temporarily produced a phenomenon called 'global dimming'.
This masked the effect of CO2 for a few decades.
As a result, global average temperatures were largely stable from 1940 to 1975.
To date, all 17 years of the 21st century rank among the 18 warmest on record (adding 1998 makes up the full 18.)
The top 5 years (from NOAA) are - 5th, 2010 ....... 4th, 2014 .... 3rd, 2017 ...... 2nd, 2015 .... 1st, 2016.
Climate sensitivity looks at the long-range.
Results of studies of the geological record tend to centre on around 3 for climate sensitivity.
I suggest you look at this -

So doubling CO2 from around 270 ppm (the pre-industrial value) to around 540 ppm would raise average global temperatures by around 2.8 C deg.
That's going to have some significant effects - and remember - it's an average.
For some places the rise will be more (and for some, yes, it will be less)
Around 1800 AD CO2 was at about 280 ppm.
It began to rise fairly slowly as the Industrial Revolution developed.
By 1900, it was at around 300 ppm, about 20 ppm above the level in 1800.
By 1950 CO2 was at about 310 ppm.
Now it's over 400 ppm.
So a doubling from 280 ppm would take it to 560 ppm.
Currently the rise is over 20 ppm per decade, so around 560 ppm later this century is entirely possible if no significant action is taken.

As explained eight posts above there is no evidence that the poles will become inhabitable to humans as the North Pole will remain a sea and the South Pole at 3,000 metres will remain too cold and windy. No other wildlife other than the Arctic Ocean marine animals that already live there will live at the North Pole. There is currently no wildlife at the South Pole and things are likely to stay that way. That the scientific community cannot see the impossible things that you can see does not mean they are blinded but instead means that they are in touch with reality.
""Yes, we lose climate zones inhabited by a few climate specialists, but in return, we get lands inhabitable by all humans and animals alike.""
We haven't lost any deserts though in Australia the arrival of cats and foxes and the end of indigenous Australian fire management has led to the loss of a number of desert climate specialists. The decline in rainfall in the southern desert led to an increase in severity of droughts causing the people who had become climate specialists to move out to edge if the desert settlements and abandon their fire management. In the mid 70s I drove for 700 km across the Nullarbor as it burnt.

Overwhelming scientific proof of what is happening as we speak? Scientific knowledge of the impact of humans on the natural world is based on evidence not on belief. The destruction of vast tracts of the Great Barrier Reef due to global warming is an outcome no one would desire and is therefore the wrong outcome based on the evidence. The drying of the southern Australian deserts and agricultural lands due to global warming is not something people would desire and is therefore the wrong outcome based on the evidence.

In fact in the Southern Hemisphere where I live the ""eco-region zones"" with global warming are moving south. What ever happens to the climate with global warming no ones talking about the climate dying or ""climate death"". As can be seen in Australia the southern deserts are not ceasing to be deserts as rainfall declines over the decades in the south of the continent. The central, western and northern deserts while they have experienced increased rainfall but still remain as deserts probably as a result of the variability of the monsoon and the increased evaporation that results from increased temperature. The Australia deserts were grasslands in the north and steppes in the south. Now the chenopods of the steppes are dry and the Triodia grasslands of the north are burning. If rain comes there'll be fresh green pick. With an El Nino looming we'll have to see if enough rain comes.

The higher evaporation rate in Texas compared to Europe is due to the higher temperature in Texas than in Europe. With global warming regions further from the Equator are experiencing temperatures similar to those experienced in the recent past by regions closer to the equator.

""The entry in Wikipedia drives the point home re the point of view of many researchers that anything humanity does to alter nature is automatically bad.""
As someone who has worked on Pleistocene and Holocene mammals, Cretaceous tetrapods and Permian brachiopods, I assure you it doesn't do that at all, because researchers base there knowledge of what has happened in the evidence of the geological record which shows that the Holocene climate optimum occurred 66 million years after the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs, that it wasn't a case of global warming and that global temperatures were close to those of the present day but because the warming was due to Northern Hemisphere high latitude summer insolation, it was concentrated in the higher latitudes of that hemisphere and occurred during summer.
""Apparently it earned that title"" of Holocene climate optimum "", because the data, information in it on which it was appraised in isolation and judged on its own merits.""
The term Holocene climate optimum was used in response to evidence a warmer climate in the high latitude parts of Europe. As someone who has visited that region in winter I can understand why a warmer climate would be regarded as optimal - but then I do come from the subtropics.  ""On its merits the world during the Holocene climate optimum was a lush, life filled place.""
As the Wikipedia article you referred to explains the Holocene climate optimum warming was restricted to the polar regions and northwest Europe while Southern Europe, The Tropics and the Southern Hemisphere were cooler.
 There is evidence of enhancement of the northern monsoon in northern Australia and a more more humid phase early to mid Holocene of the Sahara. However in the record of activity of the northern monsoon in Australia's Lake Eyre, there is also also evidence of three stages of even greater lushness and greater northern monsoon activity during the last glacial period. The early- to mid-Holocene peak in summer insolation at 20 degrees North due to the 20,000 year cycle in orbital precession caused a time of humid climate in the Sahara.

The Northern Hemisphere high latitude peak in summer insolation that led to deglaciation between 19,000 and 9,000 years ago and in combination with 40% increase in atmospheric CO2 over those 10,000 years the early- to mid-holocene climate optimum, is a product of orbital eccentricty rather than precession. "" It begs the question why a world warmed by our activities that will sport the same worldwide climate is supposed to be such a nightmare.""

the 2017 global temperature remains stubbornly high, well above the trend line (Fig. 1), despite cooler than average temperature in the tropical Pacific Niño 3.4 region (Fig. 5), which usually provides an indication of the tropical Pacific effect on global temperature7. 
Conceivably this continued temperature excursion above the trend line is not a statistical fluke, but rather is associated with climate forcings and/or feedbacks. The growth rate of greenhouse gas climate forcing has accelerated in the past decade.3 There is also concern that polar climate feedbacks may accelerate.8
Therefore, temperature change during even the next few years is of interest, to determine whether a significant excursion above the trend line is underway.

Abstract
BQSTART
I suggest that a 'scientific reticence' is inhibiting the communication of a threat of a potentially large sea level rise. Delay is dangerous because of system inertias that could create a situation with future sea level changes out of our control. I argue for calling together a panel of scientific leaders to hear evidence and issue a prompt plain-written report on current understanding of the sea level change issue.

BQSTART
More or less in agreement with the most recent IPCC report, the most probable “middle” of the distribution runs from about 1.5 oC to about 4.5oC , while there is a roughly 5% probability of temperature increases being less than about 1.8 oC and more than about 4.6 oC. But, given the corresponding distributions of rainfall, storms, sea level rise, etc., the 5% high-end may be so consequential, in terms of outcome, as to be justifiably called catastrophic. It is vitally important that we convey this tail risk as well as the most probable outcomes. 
But there are strong cultural biases running against any discussion of this kind of tail risk, at least in the realm of climate science. The legitimate fear that the public will interpret any discussion whatsoever of tail risk as a deliberate attempt to scare people into action, or to achieve some other ulterior or nefarious goal, is enough to make almost all scientists shy away from any talk of tail risk and stick to the safe high ground of the middle of the probability distribution. The accusation of “alarmism” is quite effective in making scientists skittish in conveying tail risk, and talking about the tail of the distribution is a sure recipe to be so labelled.

They say scientists working on the final draft of the summary are censoring their own warnings and “pulling their punches” to make policy recommendations seem more palatable to countries – such as the US, Saudi Arabia and Australia – that are reluctant to cut fossil-fuel emissions, a key cause of global warming. “Downplaying the worst impacts of climate change has led the scientific authors to omit crucial information from the summary for policymakers,” said one reviewer, Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment.
“However, if governments do not recognise the full scale and urgency of the risks, they may underestimate how critical it is to meet the goal of the Paris agreement on climate change. And that could have very serious knock-on effects in the battle to limit the impact of global warming.”
The Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5C and its summary for policymakers were commissioned by governments following the UN meeting in Paris in 2015, when it was agreed to act to limit increases in global average temperature to less than 2C above pre-industrial levels and to try keep that increase nearer to 1.5C.
The report – to be presented at a meeting in Korea in early October – will make clear that allowing temperatures to rise by 2C will have devastating consequences, including rising sea levels, spreading deserts, loss of natural habitats and species, dwindling ice-caps and increases in the number of devastating storms.
However, it is the report’s summary for policymakers that is causing concern. This is the document politicians will use as a key climate guide when making changes to legislation. Reviewers of earlier drafts say it is being altered to make the dangers of climate change seem less alarming. As a result, they say,, policymakers could seriously underestimate the risks of global warming. Cuts made to the final draft of the summary include:
• Any mention that temperature rises of above 1.5C could lead to increased migrations and conflict;
• All discussion of the danger of the Gulf Stream being disrupted by cold water flowing from the Arctic where more and more sea-ice is melting;
• Warnings about the dangers that 1.5–2C temperature rises could trigger irreversible loss of the Greenland ice sheet and raise sea levels by 1–2 metres over the next two centuries.
Other cuts from the summary include the sentence: “Poverty and disadvantage have increased with recent warming (about 1C) and are expected to increase in many populations as average global temperatures increase from 1C to 1.5C and beyond.” 
The original summary also stated “at 2C warming, there is a potential for significant population displacement concentrated in the tropics”. Again this is not mentioned in the report for policymakers. “The scientists who produce reports like these try to summarise the latest knowledge, but they have a reputation for being conservative about the worst risks of climate change,” Ward said. “This time they have outdone themselves in pulling their punches, however.”
An IPCC spokesman said member governments would work to ensure the summary for policymakers was consistent with the findings in the main report. “They may change the wording of text there to clarify, remove material from the summary for policymakers, or bring material from the main report that was not there at the start of the session. Any text in the summary for policymakers … is based on the assessment in the main report. Even if it is removed from the summary for policymakers, the finding it is based on remains in the main report.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/sep/23/scientists-changing-global-warming-report-please-polluters

Scientists, and some members of the public, are starting to question where in the US will remain comfortable to call home.
The answer, broadly speaking, is north and maybe west. Florida has seen a population boom in recent decades but the southern portion of the state is on course to be submerged by rising seas. The Gulf coast will get supercharged hurricanes, while the south-west and south-east US will be baked by increasingly hostile heat.
“Areas towards the north and away from the ocean and that central corridor where you get tornadoes probably look best,” said Vivek Shandas, an expert on climate change’s impact on cities at Portland State University. Shandas recommends looking to live in a “band roughly above the 42nd parallel” – a line of latitude that divides New York and Pennsylvania and forms the southern borders of Oregon and Idaho.
Places close to a reliable source of water without being flood-prone as the seas rise are attractive, such as areas near the Great Lakes and the Pacific north-west. “Seattle doesn’t break 90F that often so it’ll be nothing like Phoenix in terms of tolerability of heat,” said Shandas. “Places like Portland, Oregon, and Boise, Idaho, will be relatively safeguarded, apart from a bit of wildfire smoke.”
There will be bastions elsewhere. “Cincinnati, for example, is surprisingly good,” said Shandas. “It’s close to the Great Lakes, away from hurricanes, away from the eastern seaboard. It will get more heatwaves, but then again we all will.”
Much of the east coast will look dicey if the seas rise at such a pace that they’ll be 6ft higher by the end of the century, but plenty will rest on local decisions made to shield residents from flooding. New York City, for example, is flanked by rising water and is already stiflingly hot in summer, but a multibillion-dollar strategy to build flood defenses and buy out vulnerable areas should help stave off the worst impacts.
Climate resiliency is a growing focus for many towns and cities that fret about expensive clean-up costs from disasters, shading people from the heat or dealing with an eroding tax base should residents decide to uproot and head somewhere safer.
The scope of these climate considerations is vast, touching on everything from transport links to the availability of flood insurance. Jesse Keenan, a climate adaptation expert at Harvard University, said that he likes Buffalo, New York, and Duluth, Minnesota, as climate refuges as they tick many of the appropriate boxes.
“Their sources of energy production are stable, they have cooler climates and they have access to plenty of fresh water,” Keenan said.
“They also have less vulnerability to forest fires, as compared to somewhere like the Pacific north-west. They also have a legacy of excess infrastructural capacity that allows them to diversify their economy in the future. Land prices are cheap and they have a relatively well-educated and skilled labor force.”
These safe havens are more of a fantasy wishlist for many moderate-to low-income people as property and rental values rise in desirable areas. Others won’t want to leave more vulnerable parts of the US due to more umbilical links, to family and jobs and a sense of home.
“As we saw after Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Maria, communities that are able to move can do so, especially if family and friends do the same,” said Shandas. “Those with less resources are left behind.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/24/climate-change-where-to-move-us-avoid-floods-hurricanes

Thirteen years ago, when she and her husband Steve bought the Missouri property in a foreclosure sale, Hayes vaguely knew that it was in a 100-year floodplain. But the purchase put her children in public schools ranked among the top in the state, and the Meramec river was a whole two miles away. A trickle of a creek that cut behind the house was too small to merit a name. In Sunset Hills, flooding seemed a distant, rare hazard.
Over nearly a decade, the risk revealed itself to be greater than Hayes had known. By 2008, that backyard tributary had roared often enough that the family stacked sandbags permanently next to the beige bungalow to deflect the floodway. Then, on New Year’s Eve in 2015, a storm called Goliath helped  raise the Meramec to a record historic crest of 44ft. Hayes heard a boom as water crashed through their doorway. Muddy water swallowed their basement. It covered the doorframe where she had marked the growth of four children in pencil.
“We would never live there if we could do it again,” Hayes, 45, says.
No laws require Missouri property owners to warn potential buyers about past flooding – even though the National Flood Insurance Program has paid out more than $813m in damage claims in the state, on 33 federal disasters over 40 years.
City ordinance prohibited the Hayes family from modifying their land with berms or levees, and the government refused to buy them out. Last year, after another record flood, the city of Sunset Hills ordered the house demolished.
Hayes refuses to sell her piece of the floodplain to a private buyer. “We don’t want somebody to build a house there and have this happen again,” she says. “It wouldn’t be right.”
Every US state has seen high water in the last five years; flooding is the largest and most frequent disaster in the country. But in 21 states, homeowners are guaranteed little information about flood risk, according to an analysis by the Natural Resources Defense Council and Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law.
“You can get a file on yourself from the FBI,” saysNatural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) attorney Joel Scata. “Why can’t you get the file on your property?”
When it comes to a property owner’s risk from disasters like flood or fire, “there’s a moral responsibility to ensure that anything that is knowable is known,” says Roy Wright, president of the Insurance Institute for Business &amp; Home Safety and the former head of the National Flood Insurance Program.
Still, no one place, public or private, holds all that information, even as losses from natural disasters have risen over the last 40 years.
In the Carolinas, where Hurricane Florence recently dumped nearly 3ft of rain, both states require only that sellers tell buyers of their “actual knowledge” of flood hazards. South Carolina property owners must disclose whether they have flood insurance at the time of sale. In North Carolina, even where past federal aid requires flood insurance, buyers aren’t guaranteed to find out about a property’s risk. If you were supposed to have flood insurance but didn’t, says Scata, “your chances of getting federal aid are pretty slim”. Many homes in both states outside the federally designated 100-year floodplain are still drying out; for them, disclosure requirements and their consequences are murky at best.
Notification efforts for property owners vulnerable to disaster remain uneven across the US, with wide gaps. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says 2017 saw a record $300bn in disaster loss, much of it from fires.
Wildfire risk is growing, in the western US in particular, both because of climate change and because local development codes are stuffing new homes into the seam between urban and wildland areas. Since 1990, the size of such areas has swollen by a third.
No federal systems alert potential property owners where wildfire may strike next, though some states, including California and Colorado, have mapped regional hazards. Retired lawyer John MacKay, 64, says he didn’t dwell on risk when he moved to Nederland, a foothill community west of Boulder.
“It’s the natural beauty, that’s why we moved here,” he says. “I’ll go to a hospice if I want to be absolutely safe.”
Two years ago, he and his wife sold up in Florida. With a buddy, MacKay readied his new house in Colorado, getting it painted and moving in clothes, papers and other possessions. A month later, as he watched from afar in Tampa, the Cold Springs fire destroyed eight homes, including his.
“It was devastating,” he says. “We were crying for a month. I didn’t come back out right away, because what the hell are you going to do?”
MacKay’s first Colorado home was a painful education about the hazards of the backcountry, but he calls it a near miss. When he later bought a second, he was more conscious of its vulnerabilities.
Where fire risk is high, as in Boulder county, local efforts have cropped up to reduce it. A voluntary mitigation program called Wildfire Partners advised MacKay to clear wood mulch away from the sides of his house, and to remove notoriously flammable juniper trees.
“I’m very fire conscious now, as you can imagine,” MacKay says with a laugh. “I was a dumbass, no question about it. But it all worked out, and we’re happier than ever.”
Market forces offer homeowners like MacKay a glimpse of risk. Housing prices are a weak signal for disasters; despite the fires in Santa Rosa, California, for example, the median home price there has continued to climb. But the cost of insurance does tell property owners about fire and flood, if imperfectly.
“The price tag is a cue,” says Amy Bach, executive director of advocacy group United Policyholders. Bach says insurers have more experience adjusting to coastal risk and hurricanes. For homeowners risking wildfire damage, Bach argues the industry is “still adjusting”. (In California, those adjustments have set off complaints about spiking rates and losses in coverage.)
Last year’s disasters reopened questions about local notice requirements. In Houston, some people lived inside a “flood pool”, an area used for emergency inundation, but beyond the boundaries of the floodplain itself. They now argue that the government should have told them about the risk. In August, California’s governor, Jerry Brown, signed a bill requiring insurers to give homeowners a replacement cost estimate for loss in case of disaster.
But informing property owners about disaster risk isn’t the same thing as reducing the risk itself, says Max Moritz, a UC cooperative extension fire scientist at the University of California, Santa Barbara. “Even perfect information isn’t the whole solution. There’s got to be some policies in place to help us where we’re not always going to make the right decision.”
Floodplain experts, consumer groups and environmentalists have pushed for a federal-level disclosure notice, under which a property’s flood history would be made public, but such federal disclosure mandates are extremely rare. Only lead paint disclosures are required by federal law at every property sale. Legislation incorporating disclosure principles in the event of flood has passed the House of Representatives, but remains stalled in the Senate.
Nevertheless, a federal notice requirement for flood risk may sound like the right thing to weary homeowners; 81% of voters polled by the Pew Foundation last year supported one.
Even though such a disclosure rule might harm him, 77-year-old Nate Timm supports the idea too. Late last month, his house in Mazomanie, Wisconsin, flooded badly.
At least 12 homes in his village have been condemned. “It just is traumatic,” he says.
Timm bought his land 47 years ago, without ever seeing a flood map; over time, he became a leader in minimizing his village’s risk of rising waters. After the town flooded three times in 10 years, Mazomanie cleaned out the floodplain, taking out truckloads of trees and debris year after year, mostly with volunteers.
Timm credits that mitigation effort with saving his village from the worst flood risk for 17 years. But he says all that work was no match for climate change, which he blames for 15 inches of rain falling in 24 hours in August.
“I’ve never seen anything like it,” Timm says.
Timm didn’t need insurance when he got a mortgage; now that it’s paid off, a policy is too expensive. With hindsight, he says he might have planned better. “Considering the impact of climate change, maybe I would have built higher. Maybe I would not have built in that spot.”
Warning prospective buyers about past flooding would make sales more fair and regional planning more effective, he insists. “How can you be smart if the information is hidden?” he asks.
But if a federal notice rule took effect, Timm suspects that would sap the value of properties like his, paid off decades ago. For older people like him, retired, middle class, a piece of land is a nest egg, security for retirement. He worries disclosure would trap them in vulnerable properties.
“If you knew that a place is in the floodplain – OK, you wouldn’t buy that place,” Timm says. “That’s fine for somebody who is coming in for the first time.”
This flood has dimmed the future at the property where he spent the last half-century. Timm says he’s thinking of giving up and moving upstate, closer to family. After taking care of his village, Mazomanie, and himself, all these years, Timm feels that, when it comes to the risk of climate change, he’s on his own.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/sep/25/property-on-floodplain-laws-rights-climate-change

It reeks of desperation from the industry and a clampdown on the right to protest. In 2013 I was arrested in Balcombe, West Sussex, for peacefully blockading a fracking site in solidarity with the local community. The charges against me were dropped, but today, for the first time ever, a judge sent three protesters to prison for doing the same thing in Lancashire.
All charges relating to over 350 previous acts of non-violent direct action at Preston New Road since work started in January 2017 have led to fines or community service. But, as Cuadrilla prepares to start fracking within weeks, the police have pursued the most severe charge and sentencing possible.
Where I was charged with obstruction in Balcombe, these men are now serving time under the complicated and archaic charge of public nuisance. And their incarceration is part of a wider clampdown on protest.
This year the UK is “celebrating” the suffragettes and 100 years since women won the right to vote – but the government’s triumphant narrative glosses over the radical and law-breaking tactics these brave campaigners had to pursue in the name of what was right. And ministers are overseeing a growing trend for draconian injunctions and disproportionate charges against people standing up for what they believe in. In Sheffield last year, Green party councillor Alison Teal was arrested for peacefully preventing unnecessary tree-felling in the city.
Next week 15 people will go to court facing terrorism charges for a peaceful protest that grounded a chartered deportation flight. The law they are accused of breaking has never been used against activists before and could see them sentenced to life in prison.
The case of the anti-fracking protesters jailed today goes back to July 2017, when a convoy of lorries delivering drilling equipment to the Preston New Road fracking site was spontaneously brought to a halt by protesters. Four men – including a piano restorer, a teacher and a soil scientist – climbed on top of the cabs of the lorries and between them stayed there for four days.
During the seven-day court case the defendants weren’t once allowed to contextualise their actions. They were told they couldn’t talk about why they were concerned about fracking, or explain that many people in the community welcomed being mildly inconvenienced if it delayed and deterred the much greater threat of fracking and climate change. These men were standing up for all of us against a dangerous government policy – but they were treated as thoughtless criminals.
Now three of them are in prison.
A year after the men were arrested and hours before parliament’s summer break, the government quietly granted permission for fracking to go ahead at the Preston New Road site. That same summer break brought some of the most violent impacts of climate change we have ever seen. A global heatwave brought record-breaking temperatures, raging wildfires from Sweden and Manchester to Greece and California, and heat-related deaths in several countries.
The government’s decision to launch a whole new fossil fuel industry while forest fires burned in the Arctic circle was an unforgivable and reckless act that can only worsen the climate breakdown already impacting millions of people around the world. And while their voices were silenced in court, ministers are silencing the rest of us in our communities.
In defiance of democracy and an attempt to bypass the effective resistance of local people to protect their homes and countryside, the government is now planning to force fracking through without consulting local residents. But these proposed changes and the harsh treatment of protesters tell us something – we are winning the fight against fracking.
Five years after former chancellor George Osborne embarked on his “Dash for Gas”, Cuadrilla hasn’t been able to get the industry off the ground. Its counterpart in Yorkshire, Third Energy, couldn’t muster the financial backing to get consent for fracking, and has since packed up its operation at Kirby Misperton. Now, on top of national opposition and local resistance, MPs from across parliament are joining the campaign against plans to force fracking on communities without their consent.
In the same way I did, the protesters jailed today took action as a last resort – following a call for help from a community overruled by ministers in Westminster. As momentum against fracking grows and the industry limps forward with the help of a government willing to defy its electorate, we owe it to these men behind bars to stand with the local community and stop this industry once and for all.

The problems for Erik Solheim, Norwegian head of the UN Environment Programme (Unep), include the Netherlands becoming the latest nation to withhold millions of dollars in funding until the issues are resolved.
The Guardian can also reveal that Solheim has now recused himself from professional dealings with his wife and a Norwegian company that employed her shortly after it signed a deal with Unep in April.
Pressure is growing on Solheim after he was sharply criticised by a draft internal UN audit over his $488,513 globe-trotting travels that called them “contrary to the ethos of carbon emission reduction”. The audit also said he had “no regard for abiding by the set regulations and rules” and that he claimed unjustified expenses.
The UN staff union in Nairobi, where Unep is headquartered, called some of the draft audit’s findings “mind-blowing”. Solheim said he had already paid back money for instances of oversight and that he had made changes where other rules had been broken.
Solheim wrote to all 125 national ambassadors on the committee that oversees Unep’s work on Tuesday to tell them he was cutting short his New York trip and putting in place measures to increase the accountability of managers and their travel. “We will address issues of trust between management, our staff, member states and/or partners,” he said in a letter seen by the Guardian.
Unep is governed by the UN environment assembly, the world’s highest-level decision-making body on the environment. Its president, Siim Kiisler, Estonia’s environment minister, told the Guardian the next steps to be taken would be decided when the internal audit was completed.
“I need to ensure that member states have full trust that their resources are used for the benefit of the environment,” Kiisler said. “I will read the official report carefully, talk to Mr Solheim and after that form a standpoint.”
He said Solheim’s travels had played an important role in making Unep visible, but added: “It certainly has too look and feel right as well, and of course, follow the rules of the system.”
On Wednesday, a spokesman for the Dutch government told the Guardian: “A planned payment of €8m will be held until Unep provides more clarity, and until it is clear that Unep is taking this matter seriously.”
The job taken by Solheim’s wife, Gry Ulverud, is with the Norwegian company X Four-10/REV Ocean, which aims to build the world’s biggest research ship as well as a “World Ocean Headquarter” near Oslo. On 4 May, the company announced a memorandum of understanding with Unep, although Unep did not issue a press release. On 1 June, Ulverud posted on her Facebook page: “Started New Job at at X Four-10/REV – Manager for Strategy and Partnership”. The page has now been removed.
“In relation to any notion of nepotism, I wish to clarify that my spouse was recruited to REV Ocean through an open, transparent and competitive process,” said Solheim. He said her recruitment was based on 25 years of professional experience “with the Norwegian Refugee Council, as a diplomat, as deputy representative to Unesco from 2014-2016 and over 10 years with the Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research.”
Solheim said he wrote to the UN Ethics Office for advice on the matter of his wife’s appointment on 9 July and again on 11 September, when he told it REV Ocean was giving Unep funding over four years.
Solheim said he received the advice on 14 September and wrote to the UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, to recuse himself on 19 September, the same day the Guardian first contacted him on the matter. Solheim said he and Ulverud would have no “direct bilateral interaction” when acting in their official capacities. He said all matters relating to REV Ocean would now be dealt with by the Unep deputy executive director.
The Guardian has also seen emails relating to an initial refusal to allow Ulverud to attend a Unep meeting on marine plastic litter in May, just before she started at REV Ocean. One senior manager advises Ulverud to ask an official for “assistance”. That official then asks colleagues: “Can we think of a creative way to have Gry join the meeting next week?” Ulverud was subsequently invited.
“The available records do not indicate that Ms Ulverud used any influence to obtain access to the meeting other than being an employee of a private sector entity in partnership with Unep,” said Solheim. Her contract started just after the meeting took place, but a Unep spokesman said: “Her employer requested her to do a number of things before assuming her new functions, including attending the meeting in Nairobi.”

The government quietly published its quarterly emissions figures on Friday afternoon, a public holiday in Victoria and the day of the release of the interim royal commission report into the banking sector.
The figures show that Australia’s policy vacuum on climate continues to drive emissions upward and further away from the country’s Paris targets.
The data show emissions climbed 1.3% in the year to March 2018.
The March quarter for which the data was published recorded a 0.3% increase.
Emissions were up across all sectors except electricity, which fell 4.3% in the year to March, and land use, which the government is continuing to record as a 5.2% carbon sink.
Fugitive emissions in the energy sector rose 13.7% in the year to March.
The Climate Analytics director, Bill Hare, said the numbers showed Australia was still not on track to meet its Paris commitment to reduce emissions by between 26% and 28% by 2030 from its 2005 levels.
“While emissions from the national electricity market continue to decrease due to increasing renewable electricity, Australian emissions as a whole continue to increase,” he said.
“On present trends, with virtually no policies apart from the renewable energy target, which will expire in 2020 and not be replaced, emissions are set to gallop way past the Paris agreement target.”
He said the figures also showed the decline in per capita emissions was beginning to flatten out “at a time when this should be accelerating”.
Matt Drum, the managing director of NDEVR environmental, which tracks emissions and publishes its own quarterly reports months ahead of the government, said the absence of climate policy meant emissions were going up.
“All the figures show emissions are increasing because they’ve got no policy,” he said.
“What I’m really interested in is what policy is Labor going to reveal in the coming weeks?
“The current government have made it very clear they’re not interested in doing anything about emissions.”
The chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation, Kelly O’Shanassy, said it was “embarrassing” that climate pollution was continuing to rise in a wealthy country like Australia.
“This latest pollution scorecard casts extreme doubt over the Morrison government’s claim that Australia will meet our 2030 emissions reduction targets ‘in a canter’ without strong new action.
“This latest result is also flattered by falling emissions from power generation, driven by the construction of solar and wind energy under our national renewable energy target.
“The Morrison government has declared it will not replace this target after 2020, meaning Australian climate pollution is at risk of growing even further.”
The environment minister, Melissa Price, did not respond to questions about the increase in emissions.
She said in a statement that emissions were currently 11.2% below 2005 levels.
The statement said the latest report on Australia’s national greenhouse gas inventory clearly showed the country was on track to beat its 2020 emissions target.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/28/australias-greenhouse-gas-emissions-climb-again-amid-climate-policy-vacuum

The Venta Maersk made the journey as a one-off trial, said Palle Laursen, the chief technical officer of A.P. Moller-Maersk, the world’s biggest shipping group.
The ship, carrying a cargo of frozen fish, arrived in St Petersburg on Friday, after leaving Russia’s Pacific port city of Vladivostok on 22 August.
“The trial allowed us to gain exceptional operational experience,” said Laursen, adding the ship had performed well in the unfamiliar environment.
The Northern Sea route could be a shorter journey for ships travelling from east Asia to Europe than the Northwest Passage over Canada because it will likely be free of ice sooner due to climate change.
Experts say it could reduce the travel distance from east Asia to Europe from the 21,000 kilometres (13,000 miles) it takes to go via the Suez Canal, to 12,800 kilometres (8,000 miles). This would cut transit time by 10 to 15 days.
It’s not the first time a cargo vessel has completed the Russian Arctic route, and Maersk underlined that the journey was “to gain operational experience in a new area and to test vessel systems”.
“Currently, we do not see the Northern Sea route as a viable commercial alternative to existing east-west routes,” Laursen said.
“Today, the passage is only feasible for around three months a year which may change with time. Furthermore, we also must consider that ice-classed vessels are required to make the passage, which means an additional investment.”
During the 37-day journey, Maersk was “in close and regular dialogue” with Russian authorities and ice breaker companies as precautionary measures.
The company said the vessel which made the trip is among the world’s largest ice-class ships specifically designed to operate in cold waters.

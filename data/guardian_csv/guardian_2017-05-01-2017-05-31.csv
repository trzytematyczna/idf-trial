The carbon offset is pretty much a voluntary, individual carbon tax, but only of their electricity bill (and some other things like plane tickets). I just hate it how I see plenty of people saying we should be doing everything we can to limit our emissions and get a carbon tax back in and develop green energy, yet the uptake of carbon offsets - which would go a long way to doing those exact things - is minimal because people are not willing to actaully pay for it at all, or at least if everyone else isn't. And when you point out that Australia is only around 1-1.5% of emissions and that us doing something as a country would have a negligible effect, they say that will still have to do our bit and should be leading the way - while they refuse to pay for carbon offsets.

The efficiency of the wind farms is determined by wind records and is roughly 30%, they perform to expectations. That one is a red herring. SA was importing electricity long before renewables entered the grid and increased overall capacity. They had to import coal for years anyway.
Now, for the hundredth time, in the storm the wind farms tripped (problem fixed in weeks) because the interconnector was cooking. The VIC coal plant could not ramp down to avoid this and two of the three main lines in the grid were already smashed. Gas plants also tripped.
Now, the second blackout occurred almost solely because of ill-timed interconnector works and the heatwave issue was due to multiple gas plant failures (one caught fire) and, of course, the Pelican Point debacle. What's reliable?
Friday through to Sunday, wind generated 80% of SA's power, around Anzac day extended periods produced over 100% of capacity. It's bloody cheap too. 
In NSW during the heatwave, the AEMO issued the warning that load shedding may occur during peak demand. If one more thing went wrong 'system black' would have occurred. Why?

 Trump upset world leaders on the weekend by refusing, at the conclusion of the G7 summit in Italy, to declare his support for the UN’s landmark treaty signed in Paris in 2015.
Despite two days of urging from leaders from Europe, Canada and Japan to pledge his support for the agreement, Trump tweeted on Saturday: “I will make my final decision on the Paris accord next week!”
His position left his counterparts frustrated, with some warning if the US pulled out of the Paris agreement other countries may want to reduce their commitments too.
But when asked about Australia’s commitment in the wake of Trump’s tweet, Frydenberg told Guardian Australia the Turnbull government takes its emissions targets seriously “and we’re going on and trying to meet them”.
“Issues about domestic climate change policy in the United States is a matter for the Trump administration,” Frydenberg said.
He also pointed to a quote from Malcolm Turnbull from November last year, when Turnbull was asked if Australia would remain in the Paris agreement if then president-elect Trump followed through on his threat to cancel the emissions reductions commitments made by Barack Obama in December 2015.
Turnbull had said: “When Australia makes a commitment to a global agreement, we follow through and that is exactly what we are doing.”
Turnbull also described the Paris agreement as “a watershed and a turning point” that would deliver international action on climate change.
“My government is committed to [the Paris agreement]. We have ratified it,” he had said.
In the aftermath of Trump’s election victory, the chairman of the Turnbull government’s backbench committee on the environment and energy, the Liberal MP Craig Kelly, said on Facebook the Paris agreement was now “cactus”.
In March this year, Kelly said he stood by that prediction from November given Trump had already signed an executive order to unravel a number of Obama’s regulatory measures to combat climate change, seen as a prelude to the US withdrawing from the Paris deal.
The Turnbull government ratified the Paris agreement in November.
“If a country sought to withdraw from the agreement it takes four years,” Turnbull said at the time.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/28/australia-will-still-support-paris-climate-deal-if-trump-pulls-out-frydenberg-says

That's if you believe the models have a shred of credibility.
BQENDPersonally? I do not think the models are to be all that trusted to the level of picking the winds in a couple of counties over a decade or so.
I do think they will give a general trend on a ""synoptic scale"" for things like wind over a couple of decades though.
But there in lies a problem. Big big picture, global scale temeprature, models are probably fine. We dont live at the global scale and our risks we need to plan for are at things like winds over a couple of counties, these are the kind of weather events that kill and destroy property. We know the likelihood of events like the 53 North Sea storm now, we build things like the Thames Barrier to meet those threats.We cannot really plan properly for threats that are still unresolved.This is where the people like me who do not preach end of civilisation but significant and risky disruption come in.

BQSTART
If we don’t change our ways we’re expecting something like 3 feet of sea level rise in the next century, and it could be 2 and it could be 4 and it could be 20. 
The chance that we will cross thresholds that commit us to loss of big chunks of West Antarctica and huge sea level rise is real.
So when you start doing “Well you’re not sure,” but there’s a chance of really bad things and the uncertainties are mostly on the bad side, could be a little better or a little worse or a lot worse, but we’ll be breaking things.

Think about risk. Some scientists are saying that we may already be seeing a slowing of deep ocean overturning circulation systems like Antarctic bottom water formation and the Atlantic meriodional overturning circulation (a part of it is called the Gulf Stream which carries warmth to Europe).
NASA's former lead climate scientist, James Hansen, suggested in a paper last year that shutdown of these overturning circulations is more sensitive to freshwater input from the ice sheets than current models indicate.
And that the increased horizontal temperature gradient between high and low latitude regions of the N Atlantic would drive superstorms unlike any today.

But you are looking at gross cost. If we spend money on wind turbines, or PV, or EV's then we reduce spending on FF plants, ICE's and fuel.

As for making the planet a better place we could end world poverty or cure Cancer with part of that money and really make the world a better place.

Which is fair enough but even with a less sensational style, there is a limit to what purpose scientifically a blog can relay as opposed to say an online article such as NASA's earth observatory series.
These are:
1) for giving early results
2) including more detail than was able to be published
3) speculation as to what the causes might be or consequences wiil be
The need for blog to continually add content and the academic drive for advocacy of your own ideas can mean that even when a scientist is blogging that there is still scope to mislead anyone taking it at purely face value. 
What matters most is when they are wrong, is it obvious for an expert to see from what is included in the material, was it an honest mistake (as opposed to bias or fraud) and are underlying figures reliable even if misinterpreted.

When I asked Richard Alley, almost certainly the most respected glaciologist in the United States, whether he would be surprised to see Thwaites collapse in his lifetime, he drew a breath. Alley is 58. ‘‘Up until very recently, I would have said, ‘Yes, I’d be surprised,’ ’’ he told me. ‘‘Right now, I’m not sure. I’m still cautiously optimistic that in my life, Thwaites has got enough stability on the ridge where it now sits that I will die before it does. But I’m not confident about that for my kids. And if someday I have grandkids, I’m not at all confident for them.’’

Even the minimum global warming now expected – just 1.5C – is projected to raise the cost of windstorm destruction by more than a third in parts of the country. If climate change heats the world even further, broken roofs and damaged buildings are likely to increase by over 50% across a swathe of the nation.
The research shows all of the UK is on track to see rises in high winds except the south and south-west, with the greatest impact across the Midlands, Yorkshire and Northern Ireland. This is because the main storms that barrel in off the Atlantic are expected to move their track northwards as the planet warms, a phenomenon linked to the rapid melting being seen in the Arctic.
Flooding is the most high-profile impact of climate change on the UK. But the overall cost of wind storms is actually higher, as a result of a much larger number of smaller incidents, and currently runs at an average of about £1bn a year. Extreme wind storms can occur, though, and in 1990 the Burns’ Day storm resulted in 47 deaths, as well as more than £2bn of insured damage and many millions more in damage to roads, power lines and uninsured properties.
The new work was commissioned by the Association of British Insurers (ABI), which is concerned by the rising impacts of climate change on its customers, and was carried out by the consultancy Air Worldwide and the UK Met Office.
“It is absolutely a concern that we are going to be living in a world where overall there are higher wind storm losses,” said Matt Cullen, the ABI’s head of strategy. “That inevitably transfers through to insurers having to raise premiums and hold more capital. We want to make sure we live in a world where risk is controlled and understandable and we can offer insurance in a reliable and sensible way.”
Homes and buildings have lifespans of many decades and so work done now should make them better able to withstand the buffeting of severe winds, Cullen said. He said there was a concern that, while the risks of climate change are now being included in policies, there was little to ensure the protections needed are actually implemented. 
The research used sophisticated Met Office climate models to examine how wind storms are likely to change in frequency and intensity with different levels of global warming. “We will probably see an overall reduction in the number of storms, but an increase in the frequency of the most intense storms, and of course those are the ones that cause the [most] damage,” said Peter Sousounis, director of meteorology at Air Worldwide.
This data was then used to calculate the changes expected in the cost of damage resulting from the stronger storms and the researchers found significant increases in most parts of the UK. This was not entirely unexpected, said Sousounis.
“We have seen enough results from catastrophe models to really not be surprised. Small changes in wind speed can have a huge impact on losses,” he said. “Losses go up almost exponentially with increasing wind speed.”
Cullen said: “The likelihood of claims resulting from severe storms increasing in the future is something the insurance industry, and society, need to start preparing for now. Planners and builders should be aware of the need for more wind-resistant construction in specific areas of the country if claims are to be kept to a minimum and residents spared the distress and expense of higher levels of wind damage.”
The government’s official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, warned in 2016 that UK is poorly prepared for the inevitable impacts of global warming in coming decades, including floods, deadly annual heatwaves and water shortages. It also warned: “Any increases in maximum wind speeds with climate change experienced during storms would have significant implications for many infrastructure networks,” such as roads and railways and power and communication lines.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/15/uk-faces-sharp-rise-destructive-wind-storms-global-warming

Concepts become scientific theories by the accumulation of evidence that can only be explained in one way.
Any other idea would need to explain at least as much evidence in a different way.
Which would include the huge mass of evidence from the geological record.
A scientific paradigm will only change if a new paradigm is found that explains not just the existing evidence but even more new evidence.

....... coherence - consilience - and - consensus ......
Coherence - a theory that coherently explains the multiple observed lines of empirical evidence across multiple aspects of the climate system.

The UN framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC) has agreed to enhance “openness and transparency” for outside parties and will accept submissions from any stakeholder – which could be any person or group affected by climate change or climate change policy – on how it could do so.
“The result was pretty good – understanding that the world’s largest economic powers were adamantly opposed to anything to do with integrity or conflict of interest at all,” said Jesse Bragg from Corporate Accountability International, which has been running a campaign on the issue.
Since May 2016, Ecuador and Venezuela – on behalf of the Like Minded Group of Developing Countries that represents that majority of the world’s population – had been fighting to have a conflict of interest policy introduced where groups with “observer status” must declare their conflicts.
Organisations that have observer status, and can therefore attend meetings and walk the corridors of the conferences, include industry groups that represent all of the world’s biggest fossil fuel companies such as ExxonMobil, Shell, BP and BHP. Many of them have lobbied against policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
In May 2016 at a UNFCCC meeting in Bonn, the Venezuelan delegate said the Paris agreement was an “instrument between states” and made a “moral request” that lobbyists should have to declare conflicts of interest.
The move was successfully opposed by rich nations, with the US, EU, Norway and Australia leading the battle.
But the issue was raised again in November at COP 22 in Marrakech and continued this month in Bonn where the Australian ambassador for the environment and lead delegate to the UNFCCC, Patrick Suckling, championed the role of fossil fuel companies in helping to craft climate change policy.
“Some of the companies being alluded to as the polluters of policy, they will be, some of them, the providers of the biggest and best solutions,” Suckling said. “And you could look at some of the statements coming out of ExxonMobil and Shell recently to underline that point.”
ExxonMobil famously hid their knowledge about climate change for decades and investigations have revealed they continue to fund efforts to manipulate public discussions of climate change.
On Tuesday, in a closed-door meeting in Bonn, the discussion continued with the US and Australia fighting to remove any language that included the phrase “conflict of interest” or “integrity”. The Guardian understands the US delegate argued that the US and Ecuador had “divergent views” on what integrity meant.
The US, New Zealand, Australia and the EU also opposed Ecuador’s moves to call for a reporting process, where stakeholders could submit their views on developing a conflict of interest policy, or on a way of improving the “integrity” of the UNFCCC’s engagement with non-party stakeholders.
But on Tuesday in Bonn, Ecuador successfully negotiated an agreement that committed the UNFCCC to enhance the “openness, transparency and inclusiveness of the UNFCCC process” and another that called for stakeholders to submit their views on how that could be achieved.
As a result, the discussion will continue in a year’s time, with the input of anyone who submits their views through the UNFCCC website.
The discussions appeared to shake-up the fossil fuel lobby, with some organising side events at the Bonn meeting to defend their role at the UNFCCC.
Stephen Eule, a climate analyst at the US Chamber of Commerce – a group with observer status at the UNFCCC – led one meeting where he spoke of the need to engage the coal industry; described the US commitments under the Paris agreement as “unrealistically ambitious”; and approvingly described Donald Trump’s moves to dismantle Barack Obama’s environmental regulations.
Eule said the Paris agreement was “lopsided and puts the US at a competitive disadvantage”, saying he expects the Trump administration to negotiate “to get a better deal for the US”.
In a piece published on a US Chamber of Commerce website, Eule defended the role the body plays in the the UNFCCC processes, saying it would continue to “look after the interests of our members and speak out on the issues that concern us”.
According to a Corporate Accountability International report, the US Chamber of Commerce has received millions of dollars from ExxonMobil for “public information campaigns” and executives from Peabody Energy, ConocoPhillips, and Sempra Energy sit on its board of directors.
“As longs as your business model depends on extracting and burning fossil fuels, you have no place helping to craft climate policy,” Bragg said. “Your profit incentive is going to keep you from doing the right thing. And, frankly, corporations have a duty to maximise profits – so they would be in violation of their shareholders if they were doing anything but.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/17/fossil-fuel-lobby-to-declare-interests-at-un-talks

The research takes in to account the large waves and storm surges that can tip gradually rising sea levels over the edge of coastal defences. Lower latitudes will be first affected, in a great swath through the tropics from Africa to South America and throughout south-east Asia, with Europe’s Atlantic coast and the west coast of the US not far behind.
The most vulnerable places, including large cities in Brazil and Ivory Coast, and small Pacific islands, are expected to experience the doubling within a decade. 
“It is pretty much inevitable that we are going to see increased frequency of extreme water levels – there is no way around this,” said Sean Vitousek, at the University of Illinois at Chicago, who led the research.
Climate change is causing sea levels to rise at about 4mm per year, as ice caps melt and the oceans warm and expand. This will continue for many years due to the carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere.
The steady rise in sea level is unlikely to cause flooding directly as coastline developments are designed to withstand the larger ebb and flow of the tides. But the rising level gives a higher starting point for the storm surges and big waves that can overwhelm coastal defences.
The research, published in the Scientific Reports journal, is the first to analyse these factors, particularly waves, on a global scale. It found that the most at-risk areas were in the low latitudes, where tidal ranges are smaller meaning sea level rise is proportionally more significant. 
In those locations, just 2.5cm of sea level rise leads to extreme water levels being seen twice as often, while a 5-10cm increase means coastal floods are twice as likely across all the tropics. A rise of 20cm leaves almost every coast with twice the risk.
Projections of sea level rise vary, with the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimating in 2013 an increase between 30cm and 100cm by 2100. But more recent research has suggested the great ice caps are more vulnerable than expected in a warming world and that oceans levels could rise more rapidly to reach 200-300cm by the end of the century. 
The rise of 5-10cm, likely to occur within a couple of decades, would mean major cities including San Francisco in the US, Mumbai in India, Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam and Abidjan in Ivory Coast facing a doubled risk of coastal floods. “The maps of increased flooding potential suggest a dire future,” write the scientists.
“This study shows how even small changes in mean sea level can significantly increase the frequencies with which critical thresholds are exceeded,” said Thomas Wahl, professor of coastal risks at the University of Central Florida, who was not part of the research team. 
“For coastal communities that means they need to adapt in order to prevent flood events from happening much more often,” Wahl said. “In the end, however, it still needs more localised studies in order for coastal managers to make important decisions on the ground.” 
Previous research estimated the damages from coastal flooding could soar to $1tn a year by 2050.
Vitousek said: “We are going to have to [cut carbon dioxide emissions] and engineer the coastlines to stop a lot of these events from happening. We want Greenland and Antarctica to remain as ice for as long as possible.
“One metre of sea level rise is going to be a game-changer for the coastal zone.

Scientists studying banks of moss in Antarctica have found that the quantity of moss, and the rate of plant growth, has shot up in the past 50 years, suggesting the continent may have a verdant future.
“Antarctica is not going to become entirely green, but it will become more green than it currently is,” said Matt Amesbury, co-author of the research from the University of Exeter. 
“This is linking into other processes that are happening on the Antarctic Peninsula at the moment, particularly things like glacier retreat which are freeing up new areas of ice-free land – and the mosses particularly are very effective colonisers of those new areas,” he added. 
In the second half of the 20th century, the Antarctic Peninsula experienced rapid temperature increases, warming by about half a degree per decade. 
Plant life on Antarctica is scarce, existing on only 0.3% of the continent, but moss, well preserved in chilly sediments, offers scientists a way of exploring how plants have responded to such changes. 
Writing in the journal Current Biology, scientists from three British universities and the British Antarctic Survey describe how they gathered data from five vertical columns of sediments, or cores, drilled from three islands just off the Antarctic Peninsula – the northernmost part of Antarctica that reaches out towards south America. 
The team then analysed the cores, examining the top 20cm of each to allow the scientists to look back over 150 years and explore changes over time across a number of factors. These included the amount of moss, its rate of growth, the size of populations of microbes and a ratio of different forms, or isotopes, of carbon in the plants that indicates how favourable conditions were for photosynthesis at a particular point in time. 
The cores reveal that the warming climate of Antarctica in the past 50 years has spurred on biological activity: the rate of moss growth is now four to five times higher than it was pre-1950. 
The results echo findings reported by the team in 2013 based on cores from the southernmost known moss bank, found on Alexander Island to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula.
“Because we have got this wide transect now and all of the [sites examined] are showing the same response, consistently over that 1,000km transect, that makes us much more confident that it is a response to temperature change,” said Amesbury.
Taken together, the team say the results show that moss banks across the region are responding to warming, adding that variations in the measure of favourability for photosynthesis between sites is likely down to local differences in moisture levels. “Temperature change also drives other things, so earlier spring melt, for example, is one, longer growing season is another – all of those things will have more local effects on each individual site,” said Amesbury.
The team also used models to explore what the future might hold for the continent, taking into account recent research that has suggested that the peninsula has cooled, albeit temporarily, in recent years as a result of changes in wind patterns. 
The results suggest that even modest future warming could lead to further, rapid changes in Antarctica’s ecosystems. What’s more, the scientists warn that greening, together with increases in the number of visitors to Antarctica, could make it easier for invasive species to colonise the continent. 
“The likelihood of this happening is very much an uncertainty, but remains a very real possibility, which is understandably concerning,” said Thomas Roland, a co-author of the study also from the University of Exeter. “Should this occur, it would further transform the face of this remote, largely pristine and very iconic region.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/may/18/climate-change-is-turning-antarctica-green-say-reseatchers

Our french organisation TaCa has a unique topic; climate (taca in french phonetic means just do it: so taca reduce your carbon foot print, taca act for the climate, etc..; taca is also for TArif CArbon because a price on carbon is the mandatory signal if we want the consumers to change our way of consuming).Hereunder I try to explain why we consider that there is something very specific about climate change: the central role of the consumer.How willl we slash the UK (same for France) carbon foot print? How will we divide by 4, by 10, the methan emitted by the UK cows when ruminating? By inventing a methan free cow? No, the only real path to the solution is to reduce (slah) the number of cows, which means the quantity of cow products we consume (meat and milky products).Let's try with another well known source of green house gases (ghg). How will we slash the ghg emitted by the UK airplanes? By inventing a kerozene free engine (ask Rolls Royce, they are world wide specialists on the topic). The only solution is to drastically reduce the number of air flights, which means reducing our consumption of air journeys. For nearly all the sources of ghg we can understand that the one who can (and has to)do the job is the consumer. How can we make the consumer change his way of consuming so drastically? This is the central purpose of this study, and others, which we are very much interested in. But one thing we are sure of, is that without a clear price signal in the right direction, this change will not occur. As long as it is more expensive not to pollute than to pollute, then we collectively will go on polluting like nowadays.I will read more precilely the study, and I hope we can get in touch with an author.

Let's establish the facts. By around 1990, the need to address the causes of climate change was well established. Just watch this video from 1992, just before the 1992 Rio Earth Summit. Just how big the 1992 Rio Earth Summit was has faded from memory. It was massive, and much bigger than any of the following climate change or environmental summits.
Environmental matters were much bigger in the early 1990s than they are now with the public, and public climate change denial simply did not exist. People were voting for politicians who promised to address the causes of climate change. People were told big action would be taken. It is not the public's fault that their political leaders took no action after promising to take action, because these politicians were in the pockets of the fossil fuel companies.
In our societies big society wide action has to be taken by our governments.
The idea that it is up to people to change their habits is a lie of the highest order. It is Orwellian in the scale of this lie. If the public started to get the message, and stopped buying cars, stopped spending so much on consumer goods, and started to stop flying, used much less electricity etc, the governments of the world wouldn't just say good, let's seize this moment to reduce carbon emissions. Governments would in fact take immediate action to change public behaviour and to ensure people started buying these things again. The whole pattern of consumption leading to huge carbon emissions is carefully controlled by governments who manipulate the public into this behaviour.
None of this is theory. If public consumer spending starts to slow, which would eventually lead to big drops in carbon emissions, governments immediate react to reverse this trend, to encourage consumers to buy more. This is because these businesses own our politicians. As soon as sales of stuff which drive carbon emissions fall, these companies lobby government, and say to government your revenue will drop, the government intervenes and reverses these trends.
The reason we have a system where governments give what are in effect massive government subsidies to the fossil fuel industry to drive the fossil fuel industry is nothing whatsoever to do with the public. No politician ever ran for office on the platform that they were going to give massive subsidies to the fossil fuel industry. So the public never voted for this system. It was in fact imposed on the public via stealth. Most of the public have no idea how public money is used to subsidize and drive the fossil fuel industry, and other industries that drive climate change.
It is governments that build new airports, who subsidize aviation fuel by putting no or very low duty on it. It is governments which build more and more roads, which encourage people to drive far more. It is governments which have promoted the use of private cars. I know for a fact that in Britain successive governments actually had massive behind the scenes drives to increase private car use and to this aim they discouraged the use of trains, other public transport, cycling etc. Governments did this by cutting our rail network, running down the railways, ending the promotion of cycle tracks which were being built in the 1930s.
In Britain up until the 1970s there were trolley buses in many British towns and cities that were electric and ran on overhead cables. This is the bizarre thing. There were more government policies reducing carbon emissions between the 1930s and 1970s, than there are now.
I sometimes wonder if those who supposedly promote action to address carbon emissions are part of a conspiracy. But not the type of conspiracy climate change deniers imply, but one to actually stop effective action to reduce carbon emissions.
Whilst the aims were different, in the 1970s governments took massive action to reduce carbon emissions. Of course this wasn't their objective, their objective was to reduce consumption of oil because of oil shortages in the 1970s. So governments around the world vastly reduced speed limits on roads, cars had to display fuel consumption figures by cars. People were encouraged to buy far smaller engined cars, to use them less. In Britain laws were introduced making it illegal to heat public buildings beyond certain temperatures, and the government ran a massive ""Save it"" campaign to encourage people to unplug appliances not being used and to switch unused lights off. 
Governments can take action to reduce carbon emissions if they want to. At a time when governments were supposedly taking action to reduce carbon emissions, they removed all the legislation and policies of the 1970s to reduce fuel use, and actively promoted more profligate energy use.', u'recommendation_count': u'3', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1495612687000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'these politicians were in the pockets of the fossil fuel companies', u'effect': u'that their political leaders took no action after promising to take action'}, {u'cause': None, u'effect': u'huge carbon emissions'}, {u'cause': u'which', u'effect': u'big drops in carbon emissions'}, {u'cause': u'these businesses own our politicians', u'effect': u'this is'}, {u'cause': u'oil shortages in the 1970s', u'effect': u'to reduce consumption of oil'}], u'author_id': u'4311896', u'id': u'99134363', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'riveness', u'text': u'Look the OP supports the recent Swiss situation of closing nuclear.

BQENDYea, all these bad slogans have divisive overtones. Good guys and bad guys. ""You're either with us or you're with the terrorists!"". One of George Bush's there.
That's the trouble, when it comes down to it, is that British politicians are smart and deeply aware of the circumstances faced by the country. Of course they are. I mean we like to imagine they're bumbling clowns taking the country for a ride, and there may be some truth in this, but they also put all their time towards understanding the state of the nation and the state of risks, potentials, etc. 
If in their honest estimation, they see huge amounts of risk and very limited potential, then how can they expect to be seen as anything but charlatans? And then it becomes a case of 'vote for the least awful party' which is just terrible, and it makes things worse.
People, especially the young, less intelligent, less educated and the naive, tend to rely on there being at least some people in the country who know what the hell is going on, because if not, then what hope for them?
Right now there are two main movements in British politics, because everything is so chaotic. There are people who see the chaos as a perfect opportunity to build new things and make progress, and people who see chaos as opportunity to reaffirm the value of the existing order.
I guess it's the same all the time really. It's just that the chaos is so strong at the moment, with Brexit, with evolutions of social media technology, and with our ongoing military actions and dodgy allegiances in the Middle East (and 'special relationship' with the increasingly off-the-rails US), so rather than sit comfortably near to the centre, as usual, the UK has been really polarised to far left and far right thinking.

So I guess we should simply throw away the idea of pedagogics. 
For example - to use mean patterns is stupid - because a mean never exist (as the US air-force discovered when they tried to design cocpits based on the mean dimensions of a human being - no single pilot were ""mean""). We can say the same about ""range"". Nobody experience ""range"". All these things are abstractions. 
Some people responds to visuals. Some people like to learn unstructured. Some people understand better when the topic is very structured. Some people learn best when working in groups. Some people learn best sitting alone with a text-book. 
There is always ways to point out that nothing works for all. 
So I guess you mean that we should shut up and stop teaching anything to anyone, before we have figured out the exact method that works best for every single individual? 
Way too easy my friend, to use pedagogic as excuse for not learning. In the end - to bother to learn something is an individual responsibility, not a collective duty.

Having read these ATLs across the years I am familiar with many posters. The regular assumption of expertise re psychology and other such sciences and disciplines combined with the dismissal of such as 'social' science (the country cousin of the more sophisticated 'hard' sciences) is farcical. Studying rocks doesn't make one an expert on social process nor does studying 'classic' biology.
The relationship between the individual and the collective is fundamental. Humans are innately social beings and individuality is an achievement, not a given (even at a biological level eg Buss 1987 The evolution of individuality). How we construct selves and how we build society are facets of a single process.

What is the consensus of what the sun has done over the last few decades - from the perspective of a solar physicist? How has that been framed - and by whom?
BQEND
(Sigh, not quite sure what I did wrong there.)
There was an interesting shift in the astronomical consensus at the IAU a few years back.
In 2015 they issued a revised sun spot history which eliminates the period formerly known as the ""Modern Grand Maximum"".
As this never happened, it can't possibly have been responsible for any of the observed warming over that period.

Corrected Sunspot History Suggests Climate Change since the Industrial Revolution not due to Natural Solar Trends

BQSTART
The Sunspot Number, the longest scientific experiment still ongoing, is a crucial tool used to study the solar dynamo, space weather and climate change. It has now been recalibrated and shows a consistent history of solar activity over the past few centuries. The new record has no significant long-term upward trend in solar activity since 1700, as was previously indicated. This suggests that rising global temperatures since the industrial revolution cannot be attributed to increased solar activity. The analysis, its results and its implications for climate research were made public today at a press briefing at the International Astronomical Union (IAU) XXIX General Assembly, currently taking place in Honolulu, Hawai`i, USA. ... The new correction of the sunspot number, called the Sunspot Number Version 2.0, led by Frédéric Clette (Director of the World Data Centre [WDC]–SILSO), Ed Cliver (National Solar Observatory) and Leif Svalgaard (Stanford University, California, USA), nullifies the claim that there has been a Modern Grand Maximum.

BQEND
I agree - I've been thinking about this, and the deniers who post here are already motivated to spread their denial of science.
They're motivated enough to follow links (or search for), climate change articles on a news outlet that is known for its stance on the subject - supporting the science.
They're motivated to not only read the articles, but to register on to the system and go through the process of confirming their e-mail address.
They are then motivated to spout off repeatedly, in the face of patient rebuttals. 
They are motivated to wilfully ignore the links to the scientific Evidence(TM).
Some, are also sufficiently motivated enough to return and register a second identity having been blocked/deleted by the moderators. 
BQSTART

Indeed.Several of us have already stated this.
We know that the motivated deniers are not going to swayed by any Evidence(TM) at all. Within the last few days one has explicitly rejected 100+ years of scientific Evidence(TM) based on his feelings.
It is the undedicdeds/the casual readers, and even those whoa re inclined to agree with the science that we post for to move them more firmly into the acceptance of scientific Evidence(TM), and then on to what we do next.
And sometimes this does require tongue in cheek derision at the inconsistencies of the motivated deniers' reasoning and arguments.

It will be available at least until 2050 in most nations. 
Jay Leno - a true petrol-head put this nicely: 
His garage of hundreds of cars worth - I have no idea, but a lot, he think of the new cars as the saviour of the petrol-car, not a threat. Similar to how the petrol-car once saved the horse, not killing it. 
For those with the cash to have a car to go racing with, they can happily do their daily commute emission-free and then spin around on the track for an hr during the weekend. 
There are plenty of enthusiasts who care for the old steam-trains after the tech became taken over by more modern alternatives. There are plenty of enthusiasts who take care of the propell Spitfire after the modern jets came around. 
Turnover rate for a national car-park is around 15-20 years. There are still cars around even today without ABS or airbags. But slowly the majority has them - with their life-saving qualities. It will be similar with the el-cars. Very natural - where organic. As it always has been. 
In anyone is old enough - remember the neysayers screaming their lungs out when nations slowly phased on the led in petrol? Car-companies told us it could not be done - that cars would break down much faster, would become more expensive...every change in the same. Who is running around at present thinking in their hearts that life would have been much better if petrol still had led in it? 
This resistance to change is happening to anything. Think about smoking in bars. All bars would bankrupt, we were told. Quality of life would collapse. When looking around some years later - there are pros and cons, I guess. But in general, even enjoying a cigg myself over a pint, in general I find the outcome rather good. If nothing else for not having to wash my entire attire after a few pints. 
This is resistance to change, that seems to accumulate in certain people. For no other reason that something is changing. Back in the days protested about seat-belts in cars. 
So by understanding this it seems clear that those who at any time, with any argument always shout loudly that something is impossible/will reduce quality of life dramatically - they tend to be wrong in hindsight. 
This said - politicians do get it wrong too. As with diesel, as science tried to tell them. As they also do with the incredible stupid test-regime of cars, including any type of ICE, including hybrids where a Porsche Cayenne does 90 mpg or whatever. He - hehehe. 
This is not only stupid - it also anti-social and in fact sponsor the richest in the name of environment while being counterproductive to the aims. So yes - politicians gets stuff wrong. 
Yet - the change will have happened by 2030. Probably also for heavy transport as the different hybrid techs on that scale becomes everyday.

It might have been better entitled ""Inspiring action........is more complex than you might think when the government refuses to do its job.""
Of course people won't act to do something that is difficult and expensive when the government just sits back and does very little. People find it hard to believe that the problem is extremely serious when the government is signalling loud and clear that it isn't. You have a prime minister mouthing off about ""green crap"", and more than half the nation thinks ""well I knew it was all nonsense really. Its just those tree-huggers gone mad again.""
Climate change is a systemic problem. It isn't going to be solved by individuals taking individual actions - however determined and however heroic. The government has all the levers in its hands. It could start with the simplest things, like reducing the VAT on house insulation products to zero, putting VAT on certain foods like red meat, ceasing the ban on on-shore windfarms. Then add in re-instating the zero carbon homes requirement (that the Tories scrapped), and keeping the increasing car tax for cars that emit more CO2 (but also tackling the nitrous oxide problem) rather than scrapping it as they have. None of this is very radical - when considered in the light of the scale of the climate change threat.
And of course, they could be a lot more radical than that. Carbon taxes could be introduced, so that everyone has the carbon impact of their daily living translated for them into pounds and pennies. I guarantee that will focus minds in the way this article is reaching for.
We elect governments to govern. That means having the courage to take decisions that are unpopular. ""Impossible"" they say - we have to follow the will of the people. That really is so much nonsense. Governments take unpopular decisions in the face of stiff opposition quite often. Remember Iraq - that real vote winner? Or the reversal on student tuition fees? Can the current refusal to properly fund the NHS be said to be ""popular""?
I'm afraid the only conclusion I can reach is that the government doesn't really believe climate change is for real - nor do they believe its their responsibility to tackle.

Unbelievably, Labour's initial slogan for this campaign was planned to be ""the Tories are the real extremists"". I mean, this is just so tone-deaf. It reads as a flat out denial of criticism more than anything! ""We're not as bad as they say we are!"" 
A better slogan for Labour would be ""WE BELIEVE IN YOU"", or something to this effect, but in order for it to work, it would need to be established through the course of the campaign exactly what it means when Labour says this. With nothing behind them, these words sound empty. Like, ""okay? Aren't you supposed to be the ones doing the governing? We're not going to do your job for you, you know! What are you expecting us to do? What do you believe in about is exactly?"".
But if it were established clearly and firmly enough over the years exactly what the words meant, in terms of the British education system, in terms of local communities, national industrial strategy, public services and so on, and that in context the word 'believe' would not refer to some airy notion of faith or wishful thinking, but in fact refer to a solid expression of that belief in the form of well thought out policies, funding, reliance on British industry, the provision of free education, etc, then not only would the words instantly chime, but they could find their way into all manner of diverse sentences on different subjects in different contexts, and the word 'you' could be used interchangeably with specific aspects of British society. 
So the effectiveness of the slogan would be largely determined by the quality of the work people put into making it ring true. Then in the best case, when people heard it, it would trigger all the positive feelings and associations that had been built up around the concept over the years. You could call that an 'appeal to emotion' and in a sense it would be, but it would have been built up over the foundation of a steady drip drip drip of appeals to logic, and I think that's probably the best way.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1495283562000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'16593754', u'in_reply_to': u'98937818', u'id': u'98940558', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Malware', u'text': u'Soon, we will be discussing ""how many meters of sea level rise"", and not ""how many degrees of warming"".

Even emotion has a logical element to it, albeit a frayed or even a false one. Any appeal to emotion which is considered lacking in logic risks falling on deaf ears (the Labour campaign is struggling in this regard ie). Appeals to logic which lack in emotion also struggle.
Behind the surface appeal to emotion, there are a complex set of associations and prior established understanding in people, that successful politicians tap into and exploit. They work hard to build those associations in people over time, so that when they speak, the words instantly connect with something deep within us. 
The slogans are usually what people remember of the campaign, not only because they're repeated a lot, but because they literally embody, in the shortest and snappiest way possible, the entire message of the campaign. You could use more appealing words if you wanted, but if they didn't embody the campaign then they would be a rubbish slogan.
Someone was saying the other day that Labour's campaign slogan ""FOR THE MANY, NOT THE FEW"" had needlessly divisive overtones, and there's some truth to this, but it also taps into a deep rooted prior understanding in the British left (not so much the centre left or the centre, but the left and the far left), which has been long and hard established, in the last 10 years in particular, of the basic unfairness of British society.
As a slogan it embodies the Labour campaign. ""Strong and stable leadership"" embodies the Tory campaign because they're really just standing on a ""we may be awful but at least we're not Labour! At least May isn't Corbyn!"" platform. 
Bill Bailey, when asked how he comes up with his jokes, once replied ""I think of a laugh and work backwards. Hmmm...what could possibly provoke that amount of mirth?""
People tend to think in a very linear manner, but geniuses of storytelling (and that's what politics is all about, really - bringing together some sort of story or common thread of development for a country which loosely weaves all the other threads together - or, depending on the extent of authoritarianism, sometimes tightly together) like Tarantino know how to employ non-linear timelines to great effect. If you know what you're doing, you can start at the end and then fill in the blanks along the way.
In the same way, we can see the slogan as the end of the story of a good political campaign. Because it is. The slogan is what people will remember not because they think slogans are some fantastically brilliant thing, but when they hear it, it ties together everything else that the whole campaign was about. It gets repeated as often as it does not because of something magical about the words but because of what they've been built up to represent.
If the campaign was generally a success in it's aims, the slogan will drive it over the finish line.

What would it take to get me to accept the claim of dangerous man made climate change.
BQEND
Which bit don't you accept exactly?
That the climate is changing? - There is abundant physical evidence that it is.
That the change is man made?- The physics behind this is very well established. We know that CO2 is a greenhouse gas. We can account for this property right down to the underlying quantum mechanics of how and why particular molecules absorb and emit at particular frequencies.Because we have increased GHG concentration, the earth is emitting less energy to space than it receives, there is an energy imbalance.Once you have understood that much, then it is a straightforward matter of thermodynamics that the surface must warm.
That the man made change is dangerous?There is little point in discussing this aspect if you do not accept that climate change is man made in the first place.You raise ocean acidification as an example. This is not really climate change anyway. Even if CO2 were not a greenhouse gas, increasing it would still result in ocean acidification.What we call the process is quite irrelevant, it is the consequences which determine whether it is ""dangerous"".

Organisms in that environment are adapted for that particular range of values.

I don't mean stupid as an insult- rather it is a mental state of stupor. 
Populist politics has attracted anything up to 50% of public support recently, and despite facts or rational argument people are attracted to simplistic politics. One of the features is how difficult it is to communicate the bigger picture- facts, experts and reason are all discarded and even getting a debate going is almost impossible. 
People can enter a stupor where no amount of reason can penetrate gut feeling. I don't confine this stupor to poorly educated or uninformed because we see it in very bright people at a personal level. In stressful environments even rational people can suddenly behave stupidly - speaking to a friend when this had gone on they reported that there was a rational voice at the back of their mind but their emotional mind was simply ignoring it.
This 'stupidity' is not restricted to AGW denial or rightwing populism- I speak to people with irrational fears about all sorts of things. And yes, that would include nuclear power.
Clearly reason is pretty futile when faced with the emotional brain [even if the person is educated and informed and open minded]- it is similar to telling a friend who has had their lover walk out that there are plenty of fish in the sea, and that they will get over them.
The challenge is what can be done. Clearly recent politics demonstrates that no amount of experts, fact checking, and data will sway those in a stupor. Like a love lost friend we can stop feeding that stupor- that is we can try and get them out of the cycle constantly dwelling on the subject, and point out why they had best move on [despite the fact they will not listen]. Importantly we have to allow the emotional brain to subside.
When people have positive things in their lives they tend to be more open minded- when our own lives are low stress we have the time to give a damn about others- and our rational mind gets to have a greater say in our decision making.
Deniers of AGW are in a state of obsession - they are often outraged that this 'pseudo science' is going on to the point they write blogs, comments and spend far more time than is healthy on subject [especially one they don't think will effect anyone]. But this emotional denial is symptom - perhaps they focus on it as manifestation of an inner sense of injustice and powerlessness, the fact that no one cares about what they think.
Rationally switching from an energy source that is finite [and notably so in our lifetimes], polluting, conflict generating, and destructive to our climate to a new industrial revolution is a no brainer. The risks [whilst varied] are clear.

That is a fact that has been known for well over 100 years. We also know that there will be significant social and economic costs from the effects. In fact, the effects are already appearing in the form of more extreme weather, rising sea levels, ocean acidification, and so on.
So why haven’t humans done much about the problem? Answering that question may be more challenging than the basic science of a changing climate. Fortunately, a new review just out in Science helps us with this question. Lead author, Dr. Elise Amel, a colleague of mine, completed the review with colleagues Drs. Christie Manning, Britain Scott, and Susan Koger. Rather than focusing solely on the problems with communicating the science of climate change, this work takes a wider view on the hurdles that get in the way of meaningful action. 
The review points out that since the 1970s, extensive efforts to educate people have not lead to significant shifts in behavior. They also acknowledge that using fear or guilt has not been effective in getting people to act. So, what can help? 
Well, first we must understand that it is not just internal forces (emotions, beliefs, attitudes, etc.) that affect human behavior, but external influences as well. External factors, like social networks, societal roles, cultural worldviews, habits, infrastructure, investments, etc, are often severely underestimated in the extent to which they steer behavior. One fault of prior messaging is an almost exclusive focus of the first (internal) set of factors and a near-complete neglect of the latter (externals). The authors write:
Change is hard. Human beings are reticent to change their behavior even under the most compelling of circumstances, and environmental dangers do not tend to arouse the kind of urgency that motivates individuals to act. Mass transformation of unsustainable systems will be even more difficult than shifting individual behaviors, for unlike ants and bees, humans are not well equipped to coordinate behavior for common benefit.
Here is really the center of the problem, the social dilemma wherein it is in the collective’s interest to act in one way but individuals may benefit personally if they act in another way. 
This struggle for humans to manage our impact on climate is made more complex by the unique issue of climate change; it is a long-term problem that has no apparent immediate and personal threats. Simply put, we need to take actions now to avoid problems later on even though we personally may not experience these consequences. 
To counter this disconnect, climate change discussions need to be framed as matters related to current impacts at the local level. It is great that we want to save polar bears, but what really will motivate people are the risks to them right now. Fortunately or unfortunately, depending on your viewpoint, it is becoming easier and easier to make these connections. Examples abound for instance terrible flooding in the central USA, the record drought in California, recent heat waves in central Asia, or in Australia, as just some examples. 
The authors identify a variety of strategies for moving forward with human limitations in mind. Since they acknowledge humans tend not to protect those things they either don’t know or don’t value, ingraining a sense of value in the natural world may be critical. In fact, there is a strong relationship between an individual’s connection to nature and their ecological behavior. In today’s world of growing industrialization and severing of the nature/human connection, the challenge may be to find and create new connection opportunities.
More immediately, the authors encourage efforts to change the social norms surrounding environmentally sound behavior - making it cool again. 
In fact, individuals play a critical role in inspiring collective actions within various spheres of influence (see the above figure), which is the kind of behavior needed to change the enormous systems - food, transportation, retail, etc. - disproportionately impacting the planet. The review highlights how transformational individuals - those who decide to step outside of accepted social norms - can bring about large-scale change in their social networks and within the organizations of which they are a part. While it feels incredibly awkward to do something different than the norm, we are all capable of it. And, it’s easier if we don’t have to do it alone, so supporting others who take a stand is a crucial role we can all play.
I think the summary of the paper does a great job encapsulating the work’s important lessons. The authors write:
Psychological research suggests that humans can move toward a sustainable society by creating conditions that motivate environmentally responsible collective action – conditions that help people surmount cognitive limits, create new situational drivers, foster need fulfillment, and support communities of social change. Individuals whose actions are informed by a deeper understanding of how the planet really works can galvanize collectives to change the larger systems that drive so much of human behavior. To radically alter the way humans think and live; educate the next generation; and design physical, governmental, and cultural systems, humans must experience and better understand their profound interdependence with the planet. 
And this is where the important research is going. Physical scientists have shown without any remaining doubt that humans are causing climate change. There are no reputable scientists that would disagree. So now that the physical science battle has been won, it is time to move on to hearts and minds. We need both individual and collective change. If we are smart, we can not only save the planet but we can develop a rich relationship with the world and our neighbors and save the future of our species.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/may/19/study-inspiring-action-on-climate-change-is-more-complex-than-you-might-think

But the Global Seed Vault, buried in a mountain deep inside the Arctic circle, has been breached after global warming produced extraordinary temperatures over the winter, sending meltwater gushing into the entrance tunnel.
The vault is on the Norwegian island of Spitsbergen and contains almost a million packets of seeds, each a variety of an important food crop. When it was opened in 2008, the deep permafrost through which the vault was sunk was expected to provide “failsafe” protection against “the challenge of natural or man-made disasters”.
But soaring temperatures in the Arctic at the end of the world’s hottest ever recorded year led to melting and heavy rain, when light snow should have been falling. “It was not in our plans to think that the permafrost would not be there and that it would experience extreme weather like that,” said Hege Njaa Aschim, from the Norwegian government, which owns the vault.
“A lot of water went into the start of the tunnel and then it froze to ice, so it was like a glacier when you went in,” she told the Guardian. Fortunately, the meltwater did not reach the vault itself, the ice has been hacked out, and the precious seeds remain safe for now at the required storage temperature of -18C.
But the breach has questioned the ability of the vault to survive as a lifeline for humanity if catastrophe strikes. “It was supposed to [operate] without the help of humans, but now we are watching the seed vault 24 hours a day,” Aschim said. “We must see what we can do to minimise all the risks and make sure the seed bank can take care of itself.”
The vault’s managers are now waiting to see if the extreme heat of this winter was a one-off or will be repeated or even exceeded as climate change heats the planet. The end of 2016 saw average temperatures over 7C above normal on Spitsbergen, pushing the permafrost above melting point.
“The question is whether this is just happening now, or will it escalate?” said Aschim. The Svalbard archipelago, of which Spitsbergen is part, has warmed rapidly in recent decades, according to Ketil Isaksen, from Norway’s Meteorological Institute. 
“The Arctic and especially Svalbard warms up faster than the rest of the world. The climate is changing dramatically and we are all amazed at how quickly it is going,” Isaksen told the Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet.
The vault managers are now taking precautions, including major work to waterproof the 100m-long tunnel into the mountain and digging trenches into the mountainside to channel meltwater and rain away. They have also removed electrical equipment from the tunnel that produced some heat and installed pumps in the vault itself in case of a future flood.
Aschim said there was no option but to find solutions to ensure the enduring safety of the vault: “We have to find solutions. It is a big responsibility and we take it very seriously. We are doing this for the world.”
“This is supposed to last for eternity,” said Åsmund Asdal at the Nordic Genetic Resource Centre, which operates the seed vault.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/19/arctic-stronghold-of-worlds-seeds-flooded-after-permafrost-melts

Here's some hard science for you, not left or right, from The American Association for the Advancement of Science:
""2. We are at risk of pushing our climate system toward abrupt, unpredictable, and potentially irreversible changes with highly damaging impacts.
Earth’s climate is on a path to warm beyond the range of what has been experienced over the past millions of years.
The range of uncertainty for the warming along the current emissions path is wide enough to encompass massively disruptive consequences to societies and ecosystems.
As global temperatures rise, there is a real risk, however small, that one or more critical parts of the Earth’s climate system will experience abrupt, unpredictable, and potentially irreversible changes.
Disturbingly, scientists do not know how much warming is required to trigger such changes to the climate system.""

Expensive? Cost of producing electricity from new coal fired power stations $119 per MWhr, cost from large scale photovoltaic arrays $105 per MWhr, from flexible gas fired turbines $92, from wind farms $74. It is indeed irresponsible of Federal Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg to suggest that aging coal fired power stations be replaced with new coal fired ones when the three alternatives are cheaper.

In 2015 the education department abandoned plans for Lomborg to set up an Australian Consensus Centre, but gave the Copenhagen centre $640,000 to support its Smarter UN Post-2015 Development Goals project. 
The project assessed dozens of development goals and found investment in keeping global temperature rises below 2C would return less than $1 for every $1 spent, which it rated “poor” compared with other possible investments.
The claim was based on a 2014 assessment paper by Isabel Galiana. The finding on the 2C limit was one of the project’s most controversial, and has been cited in the political debate about whether such targets are worthwhile, as concerns are raised that president Donald Trump will lead the United States out of the Paris agreement.
The report said the 2C target was “relatively ineffective or there is large uncertainty in the benefit-cost ratio” because it was “extremely costly due to a lack of low-carbon energy sources”.
But academics have now said Galiana’s assessment underestimated the harm caused if atmospheric carbon dioxide exceeded 450 parts per million, and has been superseded by advances in renewable energy technology and the Paris climate agreement.
And Galiana herself has conceded “the paper does not explicitly undertake a benefit/cost analysis of keeping climate change to two degrees” and that a 2C target might be justified if “tipping points” of accelerated environmental damage were considered.

Climate economist Peter Howard, the economics director at New York University’s Institute for Policy Integrity, said the assessment paper provided “insufficient reasons for abandoning a 2°C limit”.
Howard said the assessment “misinterprets the main papers that it cites in its defence – which actually demonstrate that immediate climate action is critical and that 450ppm is optimal under realistic scenarios”.
One such paper, by Derek Lemoine and Haewon McJeon in 2013, used a break-even point based on economic damage estimates in work by Richard Tol in 2009 that have since been revised upwards in 2015 to “nearly double the value”, according to Howard.
In particular, it “omits various climate impacts including tipping points – [which] implies an underestimation of the benefits of the 450ppm goal”.
Howard said this and other papers cited concluded the 450ppm target was cost-benefit justified.
Lemoine said his paper – relied on by the CCC’s assessment – did not seek to estimate the benefits of reaching a 450ppm target, but rather the “sensitivity to assumptions about these benefits”. 
Overall, Howard said, the 2C limit was “a wise investment when combined with investment in energy R&amp;D and adaptation”.
“Despite much media attention and repeated negotiations within the [United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] framework, if measured by performance, global climate policy has failed,” the Galiana assessment paper said.
The paper argued that meeting the 2C target would require “immediate and globally coordinated action” and warned that “delayed or fragmented action” would increase the cost of meeting the target.
Jessica O’Reilly, an expert in environmental management and governance, said the assessment paper, dated October 2014, was produced before the Paris agreement “and therefore makes incorrect claims that international climate diplomacy has ‘failed’”.
The Paris agreement, struck in December 2015, was the first universal agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions, bringing together nearly 200 countries under a legal agreement that sets ambitious goals to limit temperature rises.
In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature rise to well below 2C, and to strive for 1.5C.
 
O’Reilly noted that the CCC’s assessment paper “opens with an introduction that states climate isn’t one of the millennium development goals”.
“Those goals have now expired, replaced by the UN’s sustainable development goals, one of which, SDG 13, is explicitly about climate change.”
“Since 2010, coal-fired electricity generation growth has increased more rapidly than non-fossil sources combined,” the Galiana assessment paper said.
Assumptions about the availability of low-carbon technology “determine the estimates of the world’s ability to cost-effectively achieve given atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases,” it said.
Kylie Catchpole, an engineering academic with expertise in solar cells at the Australian National University, said the outlook for renewables was “rapidly changing”. 
Her colleague Matthew Stocks said the availability of low-emissions technology was “no longer an issue”.
“More renewable electricity capacity was installed in the last three years than fossil fuels. Renewables are rapidly growing and fossil fuels are slowing,” Stocks said. “This is not the result of major breakthroughs, just continued scale and competition driving down the costs of wind and [photovoltaics] in particular.
“These costs are coming down much more rapidly than anyone has predicted. New-build wind and [photovoltaics] is now cheaper than fossils fuels.”
Catchpole said: “New generation capacity for photovoltaics increased from 50GW in 2015 to 70GW in 2016 (with an extra 50-60GW from wind), while new coal decreased from 71GW in 2015 to 50GW in 2016.”
Catchpole, who said a 2C target was “challenging but achievable”, pointed to dramatic reductions in the cost of photovoltaics, down from US$0.70 a watt in 2014 to about $0.45 in 2016, and of batteries “by about a factor of two over the last five years” – both trends that are expected to continue. 
“Putting all of these trends together, the cost of transitioning to a low emissions electricity system does not have to be high.”

Stocks attributed development of low-emissions technologies to “artificial markets” – such as pricing greenhouse gas emissions or mandating a renewable energy target – and said “research and development alone would not have done this”.
Galiana told Guardian Australia her paper had not explicitly undertaken a “cost-benefit analysis of keeping climate change to two degrees”. “The two degree goal is not particularly useful in developing policy except as an aspirational goal.”
Galiana said achieving the 2C target in the next 50 years “requires an unprecedented reduction in emissions to well below current levels”. “It is true that if we are near a tipping point, and we may be, that even with very high costs of reducing emissions to meet the two degree goal may pass a benefit cost analysis.”
She said that despite rapid growth in low-carbon technologies, “they still represent a small share of global energy use ... And, we have yet to develop enabling technologies that deal with the intermittency of large scale integration of these low-carbon technologies,” she said, a point disputed by Catchpole.
“The current state of technology implies that a steep reduction in emissions is equivalent to a reduction in energy use and consequently a reduction in economic output (ie recession).”
 Galiana proposed “moderate emission reduction policies that ramp up as technologies become available ... Strong support for low-carbon innovation and enabling technologies will be key.” 
A spokesman for the Copenhagen Consensus Centre responded to questions about the Galiana assessment paper exclusively by referring to other academic works.
One paper by Richard Tol for the CCC in 2010 found that keeping temperatures to 2.4C “would generate just $0.02 of climate benefits for each dollar spent,” the spokesman said, though Tol revised damage estimates upwards in 2015 and the 2010 paper predates advances in renewable technologies.
A second peer-reviewed evaluation by Tol surveyed the literature of cost-benefit analyses of greenhouse gas abatement and found that it was “not in our collective best interest to stabilise concentrations unless there happens to a cheap, large-scale, carbon-free energy source”. No response was provided by the CCC to claims that low carbon technologies were now available.
The spokesman said a third peer-reviewed study by William Nordhaus concluded the 2C target was “infeasible” and that even reaching a 2.5C target would require a $184 a tonne carbon tax compare with the estimated social cost of carbon of $31 a tonne.
“This roughly means paying $184 for a benefit worth $31, or a benefit-cost ratio of 0.17. This, once again, confirms that the 2C target has a benefit-cost ratio of much less than one.”
However, the Nordhaus paper measured a “hard” limit, which did not account for the ability to overshoot the target and then reduce emissions to reach the 2C target in the long term.

The challenge comes from a Dutch group of retail investors, who have tabled a resolution for Shell’s annual general meeting on Tuesday, asking the company to establish carbon emission reduction targets.
“A large group of institutional investors will make their dissatisfaction with the company’s position evident by voting for this resolution,” said Mark van Baal of Follow this. The Church of England is among investors supporting the proposal, along with several European pension funds.
“I’m not expecting that it will pass but the resolution is well-worded and we support its intent – it’s something the board should be taking note of,” said Adam Matthews, head of engagement for church commissioners at the C of E.
Shell’s board has asked shareholders to vote against the resolution, which to pass would require 75% to vote in favour. Shell argued that unilaterally setting targets would harm the company and that the emissions from the burning of its oil and gas were largely covered by country’s individual climate plans under the Paris accord.
Independent European proxy advisory group ECGS recommends investors back the climate resolution, but major advisers Glass Lewis and ISS oppose it. The Guardian understands no major institutional investors intend to support it.
A Shell spokesperson said: “We’re pleased the key proxy agencies share the view of Shell’s board of directors that the resolution is not in the best interests of the company, its shareholders or the fight to tackle climate change.
“The only realistic way that Shell could reduce its customers’ emissions would be by reducing the volume of products we sell to them. This would simply drive customers to other suppliers, make no real difference to overall emissions, damage our business and undermine our efforts to play an active role in the energy transition.”
Separately, the UK-based investment group Pensions &amp; Investment Research Consultants (Pirc), which represents around 1% of shareholders, has urged investors to reject both the directors’ pay last year and Shell’s future remuneration policy.
CEO Ben van Beurden’s total pay was £7m in 2016, up 60% from £4.7m in 2015, which Pirc said was excessive at 453% of his salary.
ISS has also raised concerns over the £1.94m payout for a former chief financial officer, Simon Henry, which it said was not in line with practice in the UK. However, overall it backed the remuneration for last year.
Pirc said the future pay policy was not without concerns for shareholders because when directors leave they would receive an automatic payout linked to their annual bonus, but on balance it backs supporting the policy in a binding vote.
Activists are also expected to use the AGM as an opportunity to pose questions about an Italian investigation into an allegedly corrupt oil deal by Shell in Nigeria.
The meeting comes two days before major oil-producing countries meet in Vienna to decide whether to extend production cuts for a further nine months in an effort to shore up the oil price, which is hovering around $50 a barrel.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/21/rebellious-shell-shareholders-to-vote-for-new-climate-change-goals

I use upper case for ATL and lower for btl since it echoes a kinda class distinction.
I've used GEC repeatedly and given the full repeatedly but hey I didn't bother this time, so sue me eh? GEC stands for Global environmental change. GEC includes ocean acidification, resource extraction, pollution, habitat loss, species extinction, it also includes the human social environment and thus information exchanges and flows, population and the movement of people, goods and materials.
Groupthink (Janis, 1972) may occur in small group decision making where members have a history of interaction. Self appointed 'mindguards' may emerge to police appropriate thinking. Like on this and other such threads, eh?

The result of this is voters who continue to believe the fantasy of jobs coming back to the U.S. from Chinese and Mexican factories. And of course Trump, having delivered a couple of thousand jobs to a region that requires at least a million, has moved on to rewriting the health care act to kick millions of poor people off public health assistance. He has also rewritten tax laws to make sure that he, and the billionaires in his cabinet, will become even richer at the expense of average Americans.

The other commonly talked about issue is changes in Albedo. This is more complex though than most people realise because they forget that reflectors / mirrors have to reflect the same frequency in all directions. So no true oneway mirror exists for a material.

From Trenberth Keihl 97
BQSTART
e temperature gradient would alter say between the hotter equator and the cooler poles but unless the Albedo were to change then (1) doesn't alter. 
Both sources of water prior to any mixing to cause convection though had to both be above freezing. This then means that it cannot directly increase surface Albedo.
BQENDt
Neal Driscoll and Gerald Haug for example suggest the freshenng of the Arctic played a role.
This is still an open question and there have been a few other hypothesis, (Peter Weil had one that was pretty well received a few years back)
Bold statements derived from thought experiments are not always the most highly trustable sources.
BQSTART
It would also have an increased GHG effect from the increased temperature in the equatorial regions
BQENDThe tropics are relatively insensitive to changes to greenhouse gasses and the movement of heat, that said this is specific to the North Atlantic Basin and it could either see the waters dip under the low salinity lid to reappear further north or to be diverted to the mid latitudes more Spain than the UK.

Of course he was obstructed by the powerful self serving interests of US fossil fuel producers, their billion dollar denial funds, and the Republican Party snowball tossers that are now embedded in President Trump's ""Alternative truth"" administration. 
 Nevertheless Paris COP21 was a big step forward.
For the first time almost the entire world has accepted that global warming is an urgent and growing threat to the stability of the climate system, the habitable zones, and the global food chains that have enabled large scale modern civilisation to exist.
They have accepted the need for commitment to, and have set country by country emission reducing targets, and have recognised that what has been agreed is far too little for a safe outcome, as we are still on course for highly dangerous warming of +3C in the second half of this century.
Therefore these responsible nations also agreed that the targets must be reviewed within five years to match more closely the requirements that Earth science indicates are needed to prevent catastrophic consequences within the lifetime of today's teenagers.
+2C GMST is a do not cross red line consensus of climate science based upon current assessments of the Transient (100 year) Climate Sensitivity - dangerous Tipping Points are somewhere, but not far, beyond +2C. In other words the further the Earth warms beyond +2C, and the longer the planet operates beyond +2C, the greater the danger of being pushed swiftly on to +3C....+4C....+?
What does this mean for humanity ? Beyond +2C lies catastrophic climate change that we can neither adapt to or mitigate in the time available: global food chains will destabilise and many will fail, in the face of extreme climate events, hot and cold, floods and drought, wild temperature swings, raging forest fires, shifting ocean currents, accelerating sea level rise exacerbated by more frequent storm surges, top soil and coasts will erode faster, habitable zones will migrate faster than many species can keep up with, Widespread savage wars of survival will be inevitable.
The science is clear - beyond +2C the risks to civilisation from unstoppable and uncontrollable further warming are so great it would be very foolish not to do everything possible to avoid experiencing them.
Nor is +2C an assured safe zone. Arctic Sea Ice extent and thickness appears to be close to or may have already passed its' tipping point of no return to 1980 levels. The loss of albedo, the reflectivity of flat sea ice that returns 50 to 90 % of incoming solar radiation directly to space, has given way to absorption of 90% of that incoming energy in the now exposed extra expanse of dark ocean. Today the planet has warmed +1.1C but we have not yet experienced anything like the full consequences, because the Oceans take in some 97% of all the excess energy blocked by greenhouse gasses.
Therefore we must reduce carbon emissions and the sooner we do so, the greater the benefit from avoiding yet more severe consequences.
This graphic shows a summary of the remaining fossil fuel budget expressed as current emissions for not exceeding a specific GMST with a given probability, 33%, 50% or 66%
https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-four-years-left-one-point-five-carbon-budget
There is no way the world can reach zero carbon emissions in 20 years, and 32 years would be extremely difficult. So +1.5 C is impossible - it would require large scale removal of CO2 from the atmosphere. +2C may not be possible even with just a 33% probability of success and deploying large scale Carbon Capture and Storage.

The possibility of an ice-age being triggered through a collapse of the North Atlantic conveyor is not that far-out.
BQEND
Despite some other people's success in painting a false picture above, I do know what I am talking about with respect to the mistakes I referred to with regards the original ice age claims. I have specialised in BOTH the needed fields. 
Even if an ice age were to result from a different cause it would not make their original calculation as presented correct. 
I will try to give a simplified overview of what is a highly technical issue which is hard enough with this interface to begin with.
The first point which is one that I have made many times is that fundamentally, the question of whether the Earth will warm or not is a thermodynamics one.
If you think of a conceptual box and consider the energy which crosses the boundary it can tell you things about the equilibrium. The correct first selection of a thermodynamic boundary is outside of the atmosphere. 
This removes many unknowns such as matter flow and hence conduction and convection and only leaves radiation.
If 
energy in + (change of internal energy) = energy out (eq. 1) 
is not true then the system cannot be static/ stable and while the (change in internal energy) doesn't = 0 then it is not a true equilibrium.
In terms of global warming there are multiple solutions where (1) is true.
If we started from a condition where (1) was true and then increased the GHGs then the energy out is decreased until a new stable condition cannot be reached.
There are some scenarios where new stable conditions can arise other than the normally discussed temperature rise. You can have a dynamic system where the energy imbalance was turned into another form of energy. (ie sometimes you are asked to show that photosynthesis isn't stopping the heat rise)
The other commonly talked about issue is changes in Albedo. This is more complex though than most people realise because they forget that reflectors / mirrors have to reflect the same frequency in all directions. So no true oneway mirror exists for a material.
BQSTART
"" a collapse of the North Atlantic conveyor""
BQEND
Now we have a second more complex thermodynamic model to add in. Here we need to consider the energy arriving at the surface of the Earth. 
Now we can't dismiss the issues of conduction and convection. The condition from (1) though still has to hold at the same time. 
What we are talking about in general terms is an altering of one of the major convection patterns. Convection transports heat from one region to another more rapidly than occurs with conduction alone. 
While stopping the circulation can stop the bringing of warmer waters to colder regions, it would also stop the bringing of colder waters to warmer areas.
The temperature gradient would alter say between the hotter equator and the cooler poles but unless the Albedo were to change then (1) doesn't alter. 
Both sources of water prior to any mixing to cause convection though had to both be above freezing. This then means that it cannot directly increase surface Albedo.
Even though you could make arguments about the relative heat loss increasing sea ice or allowing snow to last longer. You'd also have more heat in the equator. This would increase the energy going into air circulation patterns between the equator and pole.
It would also have an increased GHG effect from the increased temperature in the equatorial regions 
Short-term snow in Europe can be seen to have little impact upon the global mean temperature and even if sea ice were to expand it wouldn#t necessarily without the sea circulations have the same air currents to push colder pole air as far. 
I have realised that the next bit will get very messy as you need to account for acute angle albedo, GHG and the fact that ice reflects up as well as down that it is highly unlikely that with the need ror (1) that you would result in an iceage', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1495492681000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'they forget that reflectors mirrors have', u'effect': u'this is more complex though than most people realise'}, {u'cause': None, u'effect': u'convection'}, {u'cause': u'you', u'effect': u'an iceage'}], u'author_id': u'10230223', u'in_reply_to': u'99045192', u'id': u'99086900', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Bernie Thomas', u'text': u'I hear what you're saying.

So that is why the IPCC is using the ""wrong physics"".
BQEND
You don't seem to know what physics is involved. I never said the IPCC was using the wrong physics. With regards to this thread I said that the people declaring an ice age was immanent were wrong. You realise that the ice age about to occur isn't supported by the IPCC.
I stated that your link to the diagram doesn't have any relevance to the physics that you were discussing. 
Your responses to my post about RCPs in this thread shows some very basic errors.
What you are actually trying to claim is that your ignorance is worth more than other's knowledge.
You haven't shown an awareness of the difference between incomplete science which is otherwise right and the correct answers.
The most famous taught example of how this matters is:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacoma_Narrows_Bridge_(1940)
Whether you know it or not, you are simply pointing to random uses of the word reflection and think that this address any of the points that I was making about reflectivity. 
It doesn't require classified material to know that I am right but since you are lacking the foundations involved, there is little point me pointing to a textbook which you would need to read another textbook first.
Let me just repeat a couple of facts that you can get from any physics forum:
BQSTART
""A genuine 'one way' mirror is impossible to build because it violates the laws of thermodynamics. If you made up a box of 'one-way' mirror material which was oriented so more light flows into the box than flows out, then more and more light would flow into the box and build up there. It takes energy to do such a thing. If genuine 'one-way' mirrors existed, they would serve as energy sources, and you could use one to build a Perpetual Motion machine.""
BQEND
http://www.physlink.com/education/askexperts/ae293.cfm
In fact it would break other laws of physics than simply just 2nd Law of Thermodynamics.
Any object that reflects at a particular frequency will do so in all directions.
Hence, clouds with their reflection upwards (which isn't really well described by a mean value over the surface as if you knew about ray tracing you'd understand) also reflect downwards.
The reflection from the surface outwards, also reflects the energy coming out of the body of the Earth inwards.

The Photoshopped magazine cover circulated around the internet several years ago, but was debunked in 2013. Four years later, McFarland put the fake document in Trump’s hands, and he reportedly “quickly got lathered up about the media’s hypocrisy … Staff chased down the truth and intervened before Trump tweeted or talked publicly about it”.
This particular myth – that most climate scientists in the 1970s were warning of an impending ice age – is wrong on three separate levels. First and most obviously, a majority of climate science research in the 1970s anticipated global warming, not cooling.
Second, there were some climate scientists whose research suggested that we could trigger an ice age – if human sulfur pollution were to quadruple. But that didn’t happen. In addition to blocking sunlight (and hence having a cooling effect), sulfur pollution causes other problems like acid rain. So various governments (including America’s) enacted Clean Air Acts to regulate that pollution (quite like the way we should be responding to carbon pollution’s dangerous impacts). Since then, human sulfur pollution has gone down, while carbon pollution has gone way up. The climate scientists weren’t wrong – the scenario they warned could have triggered an ice age didn’t happen because we took action to prevent it. 
Third, although we’ve established climate scientists weren’t wrong in the 1970s, even if they had been, so what? Science advances, and we understand how the climate works today much better than we did 40 years ago, as illustrated in this funny video by Adam Levy:
To be blunt, this is a really dumb myth, and it says a lot that about the state of America’s government that the president was suckered into believing it.
McFarland, second in command to Michael Flynn before he was ousted by scandal, was a Fox News analyst before Trump hired her. In fact, Fox appears to be where she developed the connections to Trump that led to her appointment in his administration. McFarland hadn’t worked in government since the 1980s, and many observers worried that she was unqualified for this important and influential position. As Media Matters reported:
McFarland, who spouted numerous misleading and bizarre comments during her time at Fox, is so unsuited for her deputy national security adviser position that retired Vice Adm. Robert Harward, an accomplished and decorated Navy vet, refused Trump’s offer to serve as national security adviser because he didn’t want her on his team. McFarland is now slated to be ousted from the National Security Council and nominated as ambassador to Singapore; she has already been “largely sidelined” at the agency
Ironically, Fox News’ Jon Scott interviewed Politico’s Shane Goldmacher about the fake magazine cover story, and noted “The president getting some fake news every once in a while, apparently, from his own staffers.” That fake news of course came from a former Fox News analyst and concerned one of Fox News’ favorite climate myths. In fact, a 2013 study found that Fox News is a major driving force behind climate denial. 
Seven Democrats on the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology wrote Trump a letter expressing concern that he is frequently being fooled by this sort of fake news. The committee members suggested:
If you appoint a qualified [Office of Science and Technology Policy] Director, you will have a reliable source of policy advice for matters related to science and technology, which forms the bedrock of our national security and economic power.
Indeed, most key government science and technology positions in the Trump administration remain unfilled. Recently, most members of one of EPA’s major scientific review boards were either fired or resigned in protest, with one saying “I can’t be a prop to bad science.” Scott Pruitt’s main qualification to lead the EPA was his 14 lawsuits against the agency. Rick Perry didn’t even know what the Department of Energy did when Trump nominated him for the job. Trump’s reported pick for chief scientist at the Department of Agriculture isn’t a scientist, and of course is a climate denier. The hits just don’t stop coming.
Of course, 61% of American voters thought Donald Trump was unqualified to be president (17% of whom voted for him anyway). We’re now seeing the consequences of an executive branch full of unqualified people who have approximately zero regard for science or facts. As Barack Obama put it, “you get the politicians you deserve.” Apparently we deserve political leaders who are utterly clueless about the most important existential threat the world faces today.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/may/22/trumps-fox-news-deputy-national-security-advisor-fooled-him-with-climate-fake-news

I'm actually very familiar with the Feldman et al paper. (Had many a prolonged BTL discussion on it!) Some of the basic problems with is as I see it are:
1. Feldman acknowledges that the spectroscopy data failed to properly differentiate between CO2 and H20) molecules, which register similarly when measured with IR.
2. Feldman never claimed (so far as I know) that his research supported the manmade Climate Change narrative.
3. You'll note that the article you link to is about 2 years old. When the study was first reported on, (2012) it was breathlessly sold as the FIRST empirical evidence of AGW ever produced. (Feldman's lack of that claim notwithstanding) This means that there was no empirical support before 2012. You'd think that such a claim would still be popular and relied on today, but it isn't because of its flaws in data harvesting etc. (As an aside, if that was the admitted first empirical evidence, and it is no longer considered empirical evidence, then, logically, that means there is, admittedly, no empirical evidence.)
There's a host of other issues I have with it, including the longitudinal nature of the data collection without any or enough attention paid to changing local conditions etc.) 
On the positive side, Feldman might help nudge scientific investigation of the Climate Change narrative toward the empirical venue it requires to become useful an to bring hearts and minds closer regarding the Climate Change narrative.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1495735481000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'its flaws in data harvesting etc', u'effect': u""it is n't""}], u'author_id': u'17735608', u'in_reply_to': u'99191315', u'id': u'99198593', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Anthonyhu', u'text': u'BQSTART

As well as this first statement being untrue, it is also statistically and scientifically irrelevant.
Climate is measured over 30+ years, as defined by the IMO back in 1934 (the WMO's predecessor).
This is to avoid the internal variables which result in a chaotic system, as MarkBLR and Mary have tried to push as a reason to discount our ability to model the climate system.
These natural variables are well known about, and are literally textbook knowledge dating back to the 1960's.
They are the noise in the system.
Climate is also not just the atmosphere, but is comprised of:- Atmosphere- Biosphere- Cryosphere- Geosphere- Hydropshere.
Again, this is text book knowledge since the 1960's.
Therefore, even if we had a 30 year hiatus in the atmosphere, we would still need to consider the changes in the other parts of the climate system before we could say the climate as a who, is on hiatus.
Instead, over the last 30 years we have observed warming in all the other parts of the climate system.
For example, movements of flora and fauna, and heating in the oceans, whilst the ice caps and glaciers continue (net) melting.

The fact remains that climate is far too chaotic a system to be made predictable to the level or precision the IPCC and others claim to be able to predict it.
BQEND
Incorrect.The models developed over 30 years ago, and in the interim are doing quite well. Climate is not as chaotic as deniers like to proclaim.
BQSTART
We have no idea how the greenhouse gas effect might (or might not) proceed in the real world at different levels of absorption.
BQEND
Different levels of absorption, surely not the old ""saturated"" argument ?
BQSTART
There is no empirical evidence that CO2 causes warming in the wild,
BQEND
All the Evidence(TM) to date, is that CO2 behaves in exactly the same way in the atmosphere as it does in the science lab.
Deniers would need to demonstrate that CO2 spontaneously adopts different physical characteristics in the atmosphere to support that claim. In other words, basic physics breaks down.
Interestingly, they would also have to demonstrate why IR heat seeking missiles no longer work to the military-industrial complex across the globe and why their test firings (and live action) are sheer luck.
Good luck with that.
BQSTART
And there is evidence, (albeit not empirical) over the past 20 or so years, that increased levels of ambient CO2 do not cause increased warming.
BQEND
Incorrect.Firstly there was not statistical hiatus. This has been shown repeatedly.
Secondly, the period is statistically and scientifically irrelevant to climate trends, as has been explained repeatedly - you need 30+ years to separate the signal (trend) from the noise. (I'll add to this in a minute)
Thirdly, no one has claimed there is a one to one relationship between CO2 and global warming. This has been pointed out time and again.
The final point also makes a mockery of your claim that the climate system is too complex to understand, as I have pointed out before. You claim it is too complex on one hand, and then on the other expect a one to one relationship over a short term period.
This is another example of how the deniers' arguments are Incoherent, not Coherent, and how they lack Consilience of Evidence(TM).
BQSTART
There is also no empirical evidence showing that Man's activities have had any effect on the climate.

The caveats are on the same pages, the ones you haven't read, because you are quoting from denialist blogs.
Had you been quoting directly from the IPCC reports, the caveats for your first claim are in the following sentences after your quotation, which are:-
BQSTART
""The most we can expect to achieve is the prediction of the probability distribution of the system's future possible states by the generation of ensembles of model solutions. This reduces climate change to the discernment of significant differences in the statistics of such ensembles."" 
BQEND
So it is not a chaotic system that cannot be modelled, which is the gist of my response.
Your second quote regards internal variability, a well known source of uncertainty, and is dealt with again in the following paragraphs after your sentence - too doing to post here, but here's a take away comment:-
BQSTART
The complexity of the Earth system means that future climate could follow many different scenarios, yet still be consistent with current understanding and models. As observational records lengthen and models improve, researchers should be able, within the limitations of the range of natural variability, to narrow that range in probable temperature in the next few decades (FAQ 1.1, Figure 1). It is also possible to use information about the current state of the oceans and cryosphere to produce better projections up to a few years ahead.

Of course not, it was in response to your hoping Al Gore might be partly instrumental in closing a coal power-station. I hope he is too, but fraccing will close far more.
Fraccing does not leak gas at all of course - one cannot have leaks in a 10,000+ pst process. CSG on the other hand, is a de-watering, a suction, a low-pressure process. That might leak.
You are wrong about methane on your 100x though, it is 83X over 20 years. But the international standard is 100 years, so about 20x. And even that twenty times is doubtful - it is only that if no water vapour is present. Even in Australia some water vapour might be present, it certainly is in the rest of the world. Basically, one can regard gas well production, in comparison to coal, as non-leaking for methane - it certainly leaks less than mined coal.

The fact remains that climate is far too chaotic a system to be made predictable to the level or precision the IPCC and others claim to be able to predict it. Scientists, even the best of them sometimes love to think they have more control over the natural world than they actually do.
We have no idea how the greenhouse gas effect might (or might not) proceed in the real world at different levels of absorption.
There is no empirical evidence that CO2 causes warming in the wild, so to speak. And there is evidence, (albeit not empirical) over the past 20 or so years, that increased levels of ambient CO2 do not cause increased warming.
There is also no empirical evidence showing that Man's activities have had any effect on the climate.

In the US, I'd expect this to be too cheap for nuclear to compete, and it would hopefully reduce fraccing, and the associated methane leaks too (a bit).
With batts now starting to hit tipping points for viability, and other storage methods getting more attention and investment, we will hopefully be well placed to deal with RE excess as and when it becomes a problem.

Unlike a normal person, who would slink away in shame as the initial accusations are discredited, a victim bully lacks either guilt or shame, honestly believing that s/he has been so egregiously wronged in some cosmic way that anything s/he does or says is justified in the larger scheme of things. So when the initial accusations are dismissed, the victim bully's first move is a sort of double-or-nothing, raising the absurdity and the stakes even more.

Speaking at a press engagement for his new documentary An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power, the former US vice-president and environmental activist said that he was confident Trump would commit to the historic climate change agreement, but that even if he did not, it would still not be enough to reverse the move towards renewable energy in many American cities.
“I don’t know what [Trump’s decision] will be, but I think there’s an excellent chance that he will surprise many by deciding to stay in the Paris agreement,” Gore said. 
“But in the first four months of his presidency, we have already learned that he cannot stop the solutions to the climate crisis. Large states like New York, California and many others are moving faster than the commitments made by President Obama during the Paris agreement. Cities are now deciding to go 100% renewable – most recently Atlanta, Georgia.”
However, Gore expressed concern that a withdrawal by the US from the Paris agreement could encourage other nations to do the same. 
“The Paris agreement has an historic significance of its own,” he said. “And if the largest economy in the world were to withdraw, it would present a risk that some other countries might use that as an excuse. So it’s important that we stay in.”
Trump is expected to make a decision on whether the US will remain in the agreement after he returns from the G7 summit in Italy next week. At a rally in Pennsylvania last month, Trump described the agreement as “one-sided”, prompting concerns that he would move to withdraw from the deal. Several countries, as well as companies such as Apple, BP and Google, have urged the US to maintain its involvement in the deal. 
During the press engagement, Gore encouraged Trump to abandon his campaign promise to bring back jobs in the coal industry, and instead encourage miners to retrain for roles in the solar power industry.
“The prospects of going back to the age of coal are zero,” Gore said. “Donald Trump’s promises to the coal miners cannot be fulfilled as he made them, but he could, if he chose, put them to work in the solar industry.”
He added that solar jobs in the US were growing rapidly and that there were twice as many jobs in solar as in coal already, and that Trump’s populism could backfire on him. 
“It’s not unknown in history for politicians to make promises to go back to a bygone era and then adjust their promises when people realise that it really was never a realistic hope. I don’t know if he’ll do that, but the country is going to do that.”
Gore also discussed the election of Emmanuel Macron as president of France, declaring himself optimistic about Macron’s willingness to make climate change “a top priority”.
“I met with President Macron in the days during the Paris conference and was very impressed with him,” Gore said. “And since his election he has appointed Nicolas Hulot as the head of his environmental transition and made the climate crisis a top priority, and announced new policies. I couldn’t be more impressed with what he’s doing and I’m very optimistic about it.”
Gore was critical of the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, for pushing forward with plans to build further oil pipelines on the Albertan tar sands. 
“Justin Trudeau has been a breath of fresh air, although I will add there are many in the environmental movement in Canada who are expressing some concern about the encouragement of the Tar Sands development in Alberta. I like Justin but I will put a little asterisk on that,” he said.
Gore said that, despite the progress made, the threat of climate change remained “far higher than any challenge humanity has ever confronted”.
“The dangers we face from the climate crisis are now more severe than what the scientists predicted. It has gotten worse. But the primary message of the movie is: we now have the solutions available. We can solve this. And we are beginning to implement these solutions. But the main challenge is to summon sufficient political will to implement these solutions and that’s why this movie has the message: it’s time for action.”
An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power is the follow-up to the 2006 documentary An Inconvenient Truth, which followed Gore’s campaign to educate global citizens about the dangers of climate change. 
The film won two Oscars at the 2007 Academy Awards, for best documentary and best song. An Inconvenient Sequel will be released in US cinemas on 28 July, Australian cinemas on 24 August and UK cinemas on 25 August.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/may/22/al-gore-inconvenient-truth-sequel-trump-environment

Amina Mohammed told the Guardian she was hopeful the US would not renege on the deal signed last year, but that Trump appeared to be avoiding a public declaration after taking such a hard line during his campaign for the White House. 
Trump has previously described climate change as a hoax orchestrated by China. During his battle for the presidency against Hillary Clinton he vowed to “cancel” the historic agreement, which commits countries to ensuring that the average global temperature does not rise 2C above pre-industrial levels. 
Since being elected Trump, who is on a world tour starting with a visit to Saudi Arabia, has delayed announcing his administration’s position, although it is widely believed he will be forced to make a statement at the G7 summit in Italy next weekend.
Mohammed said: “[The US] coming out of the agreement does put the track for the ambition of attaining the target in jeopardy and we have to claw that back and make sure that doesn’t happen.”
Under the Paris agreement’s “members determined contributions” (MDCs), former president Barack Obama pledged to cut US carbon dioxide emissions by 26% by 2025, bringing it down to 28%.
Mohammed, a former environment minister in the Nigerian government, said the White House, while generally sceptical of the detailed terms of the agreement, appeared divided over what steps to take.
She said: “As far as the US administration’s discussions are concerned, on the one hand there is the case of staying in the agreement and determining how they would respond to the MDCs and the commitments of the previous administration. They would rather be at the table than not.
“On the other hand, there is the other side that says even if you stay in the agreement there is no room for manoeuvre. Those two positions are being worked out. We continue to talk to both sides about the imperative to stay and give the opportunity to go through the MDCs and work together with them on that.
“I think he is treading water until he has to say something, probably at the G7 meeting. Maybe he will find a reason why he is not ready then either. What we have seen is there is an understanding in his administration that withdrawing from the agreement is not the best and they would probably be better served to stay in.”
Obama hailed last year’s Paris agreement as a historic “turning point” in the fight against climate change, should countries fully commit to cutting emissions.
However, Trump has already started stripping away many of the pollution rules imposed by Obama’s administration, such as the signature clean power plan, vehicle emissions standards, clean water regulations and curbs on toxic discharge from power plants.
Mohammed said the president needed to be persuaded that while jobs might be lost in the coal industry, they would be regained in renewables if the US stuck to its promises.
She said: “The world has recognised that climate change is very real, the science shows emissions are having a detrimental effect and will be catastrophic unless we try to reduce them below two degrees and certainly 1.5. And so, the US being one of top emitters it is essential to have them in the agreement.
“Globally, the implications are huge for countries that will go under water, coastlines that will lose investment to high-level sea rises. This is very real. I see hope for the US staying in the agreement. I think there is a bigger challenge of us keeping the ambition of the MDCs.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/23/trump-treading-water-over-climate-change-deal-says-deputy-un-chief

The lion’s share of the litigation is in the US, but the number of countries with such cases has tripled since 2014.
UN Environment and Columbia law school, which undertook the research, found a “proliferation” of cases instigated by citizens and environmental groups demanding action on areas such as sea-level rise, coal-fired power plants and oil drilling.
“It’s patently clear we need more concrete action on climate change, including addressing the root causes and helping communities adapt to the consequences,” said Erik Solheim, head of UN Environment. “The science can stand up in a court of law, and governments need to make sure their responses to the problem do too.”
The US has been the staging ground for 654 climate-related cases, almost three times that of the rest of the world combined. Some of these cases have proved pivotal, such as a 2007 case where various states and cities demanded the Environmental Protection Agency regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions.
The supreme court ruled against George W Bush’s administration, leading to the EPA determining that greenhouse gases are a public health threat and opening the way for Barack Obama’s executive action on climate change.
Other cases are continuing, such as the 21 children who are represented in a lawsuit against the federal government, claiming that its failure to sufficiently cut emissions violates their constitutional right to life, liberty and property. The Sierra Club, an environmental group, said the case would “upend climate law as we know it” should it be successful.
Australia, with 80 cases, and the UK, with 49 cases, are the next largest national sources of climate litigation, although the report notes that legal action is starting to emanate from all corners of the world. The issue of “climate refugees”, where people have had to flee their country due to flood or drought, is gaining traction, following a case where a man from Kiribati sought refuge in New Zealand.
In the Netherlands, an environmental group called the Urgenda Foundation joined with several hundred Dutch citizens to sue the government over its decision to lower its greenhouse gas reduction target. The court concluded the case had merit based on the Dutch constitution, the European Convention on Human Rights and the “no harm” principle of international law.
In a separate case, several groups managed to overturn the approval of a third runway at Vienna’s main airport, while in yet another case, a court in Pakistan ruled in favor of Ashgar Leghari, a farmer, over his government’s “delay and lethargy” in implementing its climate change adaption policies.
Not all cases have been as successful. A Peruvian man sued a German energy company over the climate impacts suffered in his homeland, with the case ultimately dismissed. 
“We haven’t seen any major wins filed in actions against fossil fuel companies but there have been successes in lawsuits against governments,” said Michael Burger, executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia. “A lot of this legal action is in the US because America is a litigious society but also because there is such a partisan divide over the fundamental reality of climate change, which doesn’t really exist elsewhere in the world.”
Burger said legal action will prove significant in pushing the countries closer to their agreed target of avoiding global warming of 2C or more compared to the era shortly before the advent of heavy industry. The world is currently on course to breach this limit, causing ever more dangerous climate change, even with the emissions reduction pledges agreed in the Paris climate deal.
“The role of litigation will be different in each country but we will continue to see an increase in climate lawsuits that make explicit reference to the Paris agreement,” he said. “In the US, I don’t think that any court will hold the government to account over Paris as it’s not binding, but other courts in other countries may give it different weight.

Sure, but the industrial revolution started in 1760 which is why the IPCC et al use 1750 as the pre industrial benchmark in assessing AGW
BQEND
Incorrect.ASs pointed out elsewhere on this thread, the IPCC do not define a preindustrial baseline.
As also pointed out, different data sets sue different baselines.For surface temperatures, which are relevant to the ATL article, HadCRUT runs from 1850, but the other 2 main datasets (NASA and NOAA) from 1880 and IPCC chooses an amalgam of all 3.
The reason they don't go back further is because the uncertainty increases. Here's an example:
BQSTART
""The length of the observed record enables uncertainties to be estimated on the interannual and interdecadal timescales, with the longer GCM runs providing inferences about longer timescales. For mean annual observed data on the interannual timescale, the 95% confidence interval for estimates of the global-mean surface temperature since 1951 is ±0.12°C. Prior to 1900, the confidence interval widens to ±0.18°C. Equivalent values on the decadal timescale are smaller: ±0.10°C (1951–95) and ±0.16°C (1851–1900).""
BQEND
For the specific rise in temperature (and it's likely future course, shorter more accurate data is better, which is why the baseline is not 1750 as the data we have back then is sparse, very unevenly distributed towards the northern hemisphere, requires more processing and gives greater uncertainty.

IPCC AR5 does not provide a definition of 'pre-industrial' in analysis of surface temperatures.
But what period is ‘pre-industrial’? Some-what remarkably, this is not defined within the UNFCCC’s many agreements and protocols. Nor is it defined in the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) in the evaluation of when particular temperature levels might be reached because no robust definition of the period exists.
(Hawkins et al 2017, already provided by KingInYellow above.)
http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/10.1175/BAMS-D-16-0007.1
To my knowledge, the only definition of 'pre-industrial' used in the assessment is for emissions:
The atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) have all increased since 1750 due to human activity. In 2011 the concentrations of these greenhouse gases were 391 ppm 11, 1803 ppb, and 324 ppb, and exceeded the pre-industrial levels by about 40%, 150%, and 20%, respectively. {2.2, 5.2, 6.1, 6.2}

Analysis of forcing due to observed or modelled concentration changes between pre-industrial, defined here as 1750, and a chosen later year provides an indication of the importance of different forcing agents to climate change during that period.

One of the biggest concerns with infrastructure is that it's too risky to make significant guesswork about the future. A huge amount of development is based on current projections for levels of vehicle ownership, it also makes assumptions about an inevitable - and smooth - transition towards EV's.
If emergent technology causes road vehicle use/ownership to drop off significantly - as fantastical as the thought might be right now - then a huge amount of that infrastructure development might turn out to be sub-optimal. I really think we need to be looking beyond cars in our thinking, but to do that at present is considered unthinkable. 
There are several countries and states who look as far into the future as 2060 for their transport infrastructure development.
https://www.google.com/search?q=transport+infrastructure+2060
Doubtless many more projects underway in the 20-40 year timescale too.
And all of them surely predicated on the current best guess predictions based around continuation of the status quo. It seems to me more crazy than not, to assume no major disruptive technology will emerge in that time that could challenge the value and dominance of road vehicles for travel, or in the necessity for travel on the frequency and scale we currently embark upon.
At the very least I would expect them to have contingencies built in for how the plan would adapt to a change of that kind, but I wouldn't be at all surprised l if they don't. Society predicated on mass vehicle usage is seen as a dead cert. 
If there was an emergent technology, or new approach to yielding acceptable results in the relevant areas of existence at a lower cost and higher level of enjoyability/convenience, let's call it 'the value link network' for sake of argument, and it were to be developed over a 10 or 15 year timescale (consider developments of computing from 1980 to 1995 or the Internet, or mobile phone technology from 1995 to 2010 for example of what can be achieved in a 15 year period with sufficient impetus and scope for development), that would risk compromising the validity of a great deal of these projects, which dependent on the way they'd developed could represent an extremely massive loss.
In cases of developing nations where many of these projects are taking place, it could end up being an economic hit that they're not capable of sustaining. Poor developing nations in all likelihood are betting the bank on these projects, for their long term economic stability.

A red star is a classic symbol of communism. This being The Guardian, there are a number of legit communists reading and commenting here, and there are also a lot of people who are intensely cynical of/sceptical of communism too. Whether supportive or opposed, there are many of those who generally appreciate a gentle ribbing of the ideology. Few reading will be indifferent or unaware. 
Environmentalism and communism have been increasing linked, with the far left and the left generally being much more conscious of environmental issues than anyone on the right or centre.
The situation with regards climate change has deteriorated in recent years and although there remains a great deal of hope and promising approaches to consider, many who consider the matter seriously are in agreement that radical approaches will be required at this stage, due to forces dragging in the other direction in the USA, and to the somewhat utopian state of approaches favoured by other countries at this time. Although socialist principles are not necessarily a part of this, many countries standing to lose the most from the climate disaster (in South America ie) have toyed with the concept in recent years, notably Bolivia and Ecuador. And er.. Venezuela.

While Hansen et al (1988) mostly discussed net radiative forcing (including CH4 + N2O + CFCs + ...), ""crossed 400 ppm [15 years] early compared with 'reality'"" is specific to CO2 atmospheric abundances, isn't it ?
From the Hansen paper (2nd paragraph of the Introduction + Appendix B) :

However, observations show that CO2 ... is now [ 1984/5 ? ] about 345 ppmv, with current mean annual increments of about 1.5 ppmv ...

I am personally shocked at the 4 degrees extra this century. I can not really understand how the paper reached that number.
BQEND
The paper seems to be very thin, you can now download a pdf which wasn't available when I first looked at the article.
http://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/doi/pdf/10.1680/jfoen.17.00002
Basically, all it says is that climate models are consistent with meaxurements and then picks on RCP8.5 for a value for 2100. 
The rise that they are referring to is 4C about an earlier baseline which is about 0.5C cooler than the 2016 value so still talking ""only"" around 5C pre-industrial.
BQSTART
I do not think humans are that stupid. 
BQEND
That is a statement which is hard to back-up with evidence. At the moment you find people who will lie to you about the colour of the hat that they are wearing on camera.
If you look at the scenarios RCP 8.5 was never looking very plausible but look at some analysis from another month that I gave:
""Look at the three still possible RCPs from the IPCC / CMIP then we get the following final concentrations suggested in 2100
RCP8.5 # 932 ppmv CO2 # 1231 ppm CO2e # 1331 ppm CO2e (GHGs only)RCP6.0 # 669 ppmv CO2 # 728 ppm CO2e # 799 ppm CO2e (GHGs only)RCP4.5 # 538 ppmv CO2 # 581 ppm CO2e # 629 ppm CO2e (GHGs only)
It is also worth noting that the CO2 for the lowest of these scenarios the end of 2016 was 402.2ppm CO2 and 2017 is 404.4ppm CO2. We are currently above 405 ppm CO2 levelised.
http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~mmalte/rcps/
Look at though the first assumption that is being made about the emissions as opposed to the atmospheric changes in CO2. For RCP4.5 from the middle column this time, we can see between 2017-2100 that the CO2 emissions to the atmosphere are given as 2528Gt CO2.
Without any ecosystem / ocean absorption it is 7.81Gt CO2 / ppm ( https://skepticalscience.com/print.php?r=45 )
Which means that this would be 323ppm CO2 being added. For the values given initially this means that they are still assuming over 55% absorption while recently this has been declining and worsens with higher temperature. 2016 was at 29% absorption.
If the 2016 average alleviation continues would then mean that 2017-2100 adds 230ppm CO2. bringing to 635ppm CO2 by 2100 and a CO2e over 700ppm.
So what would this mean with respect to the global temperature according to the literature:
http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v1/n8/fig_tab/nclimate1258_T2.htmlwe can see that RCP6.0 enters the 5C range of rise by ""the end of the 21st Century"", RCP4.5 is still around 3C-3.5C from the above.
But let us look how RCP4.5 is described:
 ""This future is consistent with: * Lower energy intensity * Strong reforestation programmes * Decreasing use of croplands and grasslands due to yield increases and dietary changes * Stringent climate policies * Stable methane emissions * CO2 emissions increase only slightly before decline commences around 2040""
https://www.sei-international.org/mediamanager/documents/A-guide-to-RCPs.pdf
""
We are not looking close to achieving RCP4.5, In fact even with Paris we are still slightly above RCP6.0 at present.
Drop the ecosystem bail-out for this too and it is 870ppm CO2

Sure, but the industrial revolution started in 1760 which is why the IPCC et al use 1750 as the pre industrial benchmark in assessing AGW .
BQEND
Incorrect.
This is disputable both in economic history terms and in climate change terms.
They IPCC do not use it as the pre-industrial baseline. Nor do all the WGs use a pre-indistrial baseline.
The paper I linked to has multiple IPCC former/current lead authors such as, Phil Jones, Peter Thorne and Valierie Delmotte (lead author AR6 WG1) who are still discussing when the industrial period started, and when it is relevant in climate science terms.
This is why scientists use baselines other than 1750 as originally stated, and as identified in subsequent references.

Other agencies may come up with a slightly different number because there are several techniques for calculating a global average, depending on how one accounts for temperatures above the data-sparse oceans and other poorly sampled regions. 
Since there is no universally accepted definition for Earth’s average temperature, several different groups around the world use slightly different methods for tracking the global average over time ...
... The important point is that the trends that emerge from year to year and decade to decade are remarkably similar—more so than the averages themselves. This is why global warming is usually described in terms of anomalies (variations above and below the average for a baseline set of years) rather than in absolute temperature.

BQEND
Too wrong to respond to.
BQENDTo be clear, ""p=true and p=false"" is nonsensical - when you perform a hypothesis test in statistics, a p-value helps you determine the significance of your results.
The p-value is a number between 0 and 1 and interpreted in the following way:
A small p-value (typically ≤ 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, so you reject the null hypothesis.
p cannot be ""true"" or ""false""
A small p-value (typically ≤ 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, so you reject the null hypothesis.
A large p-value (> 0.05) indicates weak evidence against the null hypothesis, so you fail to reject the null hypothesis.
p-values very close to the cutoff (0.05) are considered to be marginal (could go either way). Always report the p-value so your readers can draw their own conclusions.
The p-value is a number between 0 and 1 and interpreted in the following way: A small p-value (typically ≤ 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, so you reject the null hypothesis.So the range 1 is the entirety of the probability range, with p=0.05 the range of of what is statistically possible on ECS is 1.5-4.5℃ with 3℃ the most likely.http://www.dummies.com/education/math/statistics/what-a-p-value-tells-you-about-statistical-data/

We have sufficient trace gas observations (ice cores) going back that far (in fact much, much further).

http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_Chapter02_FINAL.pdf
There is low confidence in changes prior to 1880 owing to the reduced number of estimates, non-standardized measurement techniques, the greater spread among the estimates and particularly the greatly reduced observational sampling.

2) The output of the climate models as presented as a single ensemble is not a probability distribution but the frequency distribution.
Return to this graph again for a second:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Frequency_distribution_of_climate_sensitivity,_based_on_model_simulations_(NASA).png
What is being outputted is the results for the ECS from various computer models but this is NOT randomly obtained observational data. The sampling is skewed. Individual models will include a random component to deal with unknowns. But look at the figure and you'll see a separate mini peak at 10.5C. I am sure that you have sufficient statistics to see right away that this isn't from a random variable.
Limits on the calculation means that there are different concepts and different assumptions included in the models. This over samples a particular set of assumptions which are effectively just multiple models doing the same calculation. This means that unless you can judge what are the best assumptions too that you have no way of making a statistical filter. 
You require multiple known outputs to use something like Bayesian analysis with a neural network for example.
3) The range that the IPCC do select as the smallest error for ECS from CMIP5 is in fact 3C-4C:
Box 12.2: pdf p 83:http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_Chapter12_FINAL.pdf
BQSTART
"" ...The assessment that ECS is very unlikely greater than 6°C is an expert judgment informed by several lines of evidence. First, the comprehensive climate models used in the CMIP5 exercise produce an ECS range of 2.1°C–4.7°C (Table 9.5), very similar to CMIP3. Second, comparisons of perturbed-physics ensembles against the observed climate find that models with ECS values in the range 3°C–4°C show the smallest errors for many fields (Section 9.7.3.3)...""
BQEND
4) but since the ECS is a meaningless construct in terms of the thermodynamic problem being solved and what matters is the ECS + ESS, stating what the ECS is without knowing the ESS to the same resolution is meaningless.
In fact the ECS + ESS is also potentially too low as it still assumes a constant GHG
5) the thing is that ""best estimate"" has a fairly specific meaning and since the proxy data shows 400ppm 2C-3C and 415ppm 3C-4C and 2C at about 300ppm CO2, there is still significant evidence that the 3C for 560ppm CO2 is lower than what would be the best estimate.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1495797811000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'a lack of agreement on values across assessed lines of evidence and studies', u'effect': u'no best estimate for equilibrium climate sensitivity can now be given'}], u'author_id': u'10230223', u'in_reply_to': u'99203772', u'id': u'99228992', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Stephanie  Hawking', u'text': u'Seems to me that, while the Industrial Revolution may have started - however that is defined, it's easy to talk socially about it - in 1750, reliable thermometer readings - whatever that means - started around 1850.

Second human activity is responsible more massively more GHG emissions now; fluctuating in between. Third, climate is a complex system and the weather is chaotic. And isn't it weather that is being measured every day.
You seem to be suspicious about the choice of dates, 1750 or 1850 or whatever. Most of the warming has been in the last 50 years, not the last 250, so I really can't see anything to get excited about.
I suppose it is possible there is another explanation for the warming, other than the greenhouse effect, that some 30,000 publishing scientists and the global community of scientists - the RS, NAS, AAAS, APS, ACS etc etc etc have missed.

A selective quote, from your own link:
BQSTART
For convenience, most researchers choose a “baseline” year before the beginning of world industrialization — usually either 1750 or 1850 — as the zero point, and compute radiative forcing in relation to that base.
BQEND
The exact baseline for when industrialisation started is still subject to discussion, hence the use of 1850 onwards is simply more common as records are more reliable.
AS older records are found and or data sets are homogenised (with more reliability) then yes the baseline can be pushed back.
Providing the baseline is clear, and is for a substantive period, then it makes very little difference to the overall conclusion, just a few changes in the numbers

This might seem petty but we don't have a ""best estimate"".
BQEND
Yes we do have a best estimate. It is around 3 degrees. It is given as a probability function of all we know. 
It stretches down to 1.5 degrees and up to above 6 for equal probability (the long-tailed effect)
What people often miss is that science often mix up pCO2 (as measured at Hawaii) with the subtle CO2e - that is CO2 equivalent forcing. 
The forcing is given as W/m2 in real life (or joule)- not ppm. Pop.science often does not explain that little difference. Science is often doing discredit to readers by operating with CO2e. CO2e is just a way to express the real forcing as equivalent to CO2. 
This is, in my mind, stupid. It force the public to think about 700 ppm measured CO2 and to think about 1000 ppm CO2e forcing that includes everything - including feedbacks. 
That CO2 and CO2e is used interchangeable is making stuff more complex to understand. It is easy when you have it as work - but when you read about it as curious individual it just confuse mattesr. 
It is like newspaper using the size of Wales as a scientific measure of things. 
The pure effect of CO2 without any feedback is around 1 degree per doubling. That is easy. Even the luke-warmers agree with that. 
The effect of doubling CO2 with feedback - that is around 3 degrees (1.5 - 4.5 degrees plus tail). 
The number of CO2 molecules were never the hard scientific question. The question is how that number change everything else.

Good point. Heat waves which are more persistent and intense will make places uninhabitable before average temperatures do. Kind of like storm surge messing up a place before sea level rise alone does.
At 36:45 in this presentation the glaciologist Richard Alley shows a map of the world with red areas where he says that if we don’t change our ways, by the time his students are old the average summer would be hotter than anything yet experienced, with 90 percent confidence.
And that we would lose 40 percent of the ability to work outside in the hot months, with some countries it’ll be closer to 100 percent. (unless you can afford an air-conditioned tractor)

To be 5 degrees above pre-industrial in 2100 makes me think that any infrastructure project more significant than a tent should be instantly cancelled. 
Mean global temperature in 2100 of 5 degrees above base simply means ""invest in a small farm around 60 degrees north - and get yourself a gun to defend it"". 
5 Degrees transient means around 8 degrees equilibrium if emissions stop by magic in 2101. That is basically killing the Amazon rain forest and the primary production in the ocean like fast. It also means around 1000 years of watching sea-level raise with minimum 30 meters probably with 60 meters. It also means that places on the outskirt of the Hadley Cells will go full.time desert in addition to that sea-level land-use change. It also mean that whatever we do we will blow a lot of Co2 and CH4 into the atmosphere for a long time after we stop emitting CO2 ourselves. 
4 degrees extra from now by 2100?
I have a hard time thinking about that. That is 0.5 degree change per decade from now. That is a doubling of forcing emissions to the end of the century. I do not think humans are that stupid. 
4 degrees is the hopeful equilibrium - not transient in passing 2100. 
If 4 degrees is ""most likely"" in 2100 - sell your flat and get yourself a small farm now - and lots og guns to defend it - being well aware that the quality of roads will not be your biggest concern.

Well your googling of sigma has apparently led you to the 68–95–99.7 rule of thumb. thumb. Good.
BQEND
Seriously, you have not even come close to being right in ANY aspect of this problem.
I pointed to the 68% rule to show where your errors were coming from, not to suggest that it had any other relevance to the problem.
Let me outline the ways that you are wrong:
1) the IPCC explicitly state that what you claim doesn't apply.
2) The IPCC give an upper and lower bound with a probability that the answer lies in there as >66%. This absolutely is not the same as 1-SD bound which would have a fixed probability.
3) Even if it were 68.2% and the same probability as a 1-sigma variation each way on a normal distribution. It is impossible for the other probabilities to be true with the 1.5C lower bound. It is impossible that the range is representing the range you make out.
4) There is no probability density function. Only a frequency of occurrence from the models. This is not the same thing.
5) Even if the IPCC / or you want to use this as if it were the probability for each temperature, the graph for AR5 and CMIP 5 is not published so you can't have calculated the SD.
6) We know from the previous report AR4 that the frequency doesn't come close to approximating to a normal distribution but is right skewed which means your value is wrong.
7) You seem not to realise that there are other distributions than a normal distribution. Even if you were to know the range of the 1-SD it doesn't tell you anything. 
8) Again with p-values this doesn't apply to the type of distribution involved.
9) Regardless of the sigma, you disputed a basic probability calculation based on IPCC claimed probability 
It takes a hell of a lot of effort to even work out where your ridiculous figures and claims are coming from because it has no bearing on the calculation that should be done or the real data involved.
BQSTART
It's difficult to tell when I'm dealing with your pride, but in grasping for your objection you may (possibly) have noted that 68 is an approximation - it is a rule of thumb after all.
BQEND
For a normal distribution alone! It is only an approximation as in it is rounding down from the exact calculation for a normal distribution to the nearest whole number. It is not approximate but there is an exact description.

And that introduce an extra layer of numerical analyses going on in the back-ground - that analytically will introduce larger spread of results. 
Remember that models are not made to make ever more accurate predictions. 
Models are made to understand complex dynamics. 
Models are not primarily made to figure out the climate sensitivity of CO2 - but to dig into to understand how and why things do as they do. 
People see the mean of their temperature-response in graphics. The interesting papers are about how the models solve ocean-overturning quantities. How the models express Precipitation-Evaporation balance numbers. Heck - we now have models that run inversely, so that one can back-track water-molecules to source. 
Climate models are tools. One can kick them and abuse them with no danger - just to dig down into their output to figure out what part was most/least sensitive.

As the Earth warms, new stresses are applied to our buildings, bridges, roads, houses, and other structures. Some of the obvious threats to infrastructure are from extreme weather including heat waves, storms, and intense rainfalls. There are some other less obvious threats, and many of the threats vary by location. 
Regardless, the planning for infrastructure relies upon a reasonable estimation of future climate changes. To help quantify such an estimate for the civil engineering community, a recent paper was published by the Institution of Civil Engineering Journal of Forensic Engineering (I was fortunate to be a coauthor). The article was prepared with the collaboration of Dr. Michael Mann from Penn State University and Dr. Lijing Cheng from the Chinese Institute of Atmospheric Physics. 
The paper in question does not uncover new facts. We didn’t discover past warming that wasn’t known. We didn’t create new predictions that were previously uncreated. Rather, we assembled available information to provide a solid basis that can be used for future plans involving infrastructure. 
The first thing we established was the long-term trend in the global temperature. While there are many groups around the world that collect global temperatures, two of the best known groups are NASA and NOAA. As shown in the data below, which I downloaded and graphed for the paper, temperatures have risen by about 1.4°C (approximately 2.5°F) from their low point circa 1900. Since scientists constantly argue against cherry picking; we used an average temperature over the 1880–1930 time period. Relative to that time, temperatures have risen about 1.2°C (1.8°F)
I have long argued and certainly continue to believe, that the surface temperature trend is not the best way to quantify warming. If you really want to measure global warming, you have to look in the oceans where the vast majority of heat is being stored. As I have reported here before, the oceans are telling a similar story – climate change is certainly happening. However, since we are not building infrastructure deep in the oceans, its temperatures are not very relevant for the present discussion. 
What all this proves is that the Earth is warming. But civil engineers want to know what the Earth will be like in a decade, or two decades, or even longer. To predict that, you need other tools. You could make predictions based on the past temperature record of the planet or you could use computer simulations of the climate. But if you are going to use a simulation, you want to have some reassurance that the results are valid. So, the next thing we did in the paper was compare computer simulations of Earth’s surface temperatures with measurements. 
The results are shown below. The figure shows four different data measurement sets and a range of model predictions (grey-shaded region). I’ve highlighted the temperature of 2016 with a red star; it’s slightly above the middle dashed line, which means it’s slightly above the average prediction of the models but certainly within the grey range. As you all know, scientists don’t really care whether one year is hot or another is cold; what we look at is the long-term trend. Clearly, the long-term trends are going up, whether you look at the measurements or the predictions. While it is too early to put the 2017 temperature into the graph, so far, it is almost exactly equal to the 2016 value. If that trend holds for the rest of the year, it will be another case where the models are running slightly too cold.
We also showed in the paper that in other instances, the models are under-predicting change. For example, models are under-predicting changes to ocean heating (and to arctic ice loss). But, in general, they are doing a pretty good job.
So, if we can trust the models, what do they tell us about the future? This is the question most civil engineers are interested in. In the paper, we showed that we expect the Earth to warm by about 4°C more (7°F) over the present temperature by the year 2100. This is near the upper end of the last IPCC reports. In the paper, we conclude that engineers know enough to begin to prepare. While people in the halls of Congress or in homes at holiday time may still argue about whether climate change is happening, scientists and engineers now have enough information to make informed decisions. 
In a certain sense, this latest paper reflects a growing collaboration between climate science and engineering. Climate scientists tell us what is happening to the planet. Engineers are helping us prepare.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/may/25/global-climate-projections-help-civil-engineers-plan

How long can people avoid reality? The people charged with responding to real risks, like the Corps of Engineers and the Pentagon know what's happening and what's likely to come.
Consider that a couple of years ago the Pentagon ""released a report asserting decisively that climate change poses an immediate threat to national security, with increased risks from terrorism, infectious disease, global poverty and food shortages.” (link)
And they are correct. There's strong evidence that regional climate changes in the past led to increased conflict and migration.
We've already seen conflicts and migration linked to drought with the little bit of warming to date in places like Syria and Africa.
Farmers around the Bay of Bengal were driven by drought to fish the Bay and now fisheries there are collapsing and the migration from a population of hundreds of millions is beginning.
People in Madagascar have been reported to be reduced to eating ash and rocks as their crops have failed for several years now due to drought linked to global warming.
When climatic zones and rains cross borders now there will be people with guns on the other side who may not like those being forced to move. I believe India and perhaps one more country are now building walls to contain the population of Bangladesh which resides on the sinking Ganges River Delta. 
And half a billion people live on sinking river deltas while the protective deltas are eroding, sea level rise is accelerating and maximum storm strength may be increasing.', u'recommendation_count': u'14', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1495837981000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'regional climate changes in the past', u'effect': u'increased conflict and migration'}, {u'cause': u'drought linked to global warming', u'effect': u'to be reduced to eating ash and rocks as their crops have failed for several years now'}], u'author_id': u'15131989', u'in_reply_to': u'99260109', u'id': u'99260546', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'mbidding', u'text': u'His business history demonstrates, as you suspect, that he's certainly not a man of his word.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1495869195000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'13528276', u'in_reply_to': u'99201778', u'id': u'99266831', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'IanCPurdie', u'text': u'BQSTART

But no one knows if Donald Trump, reaching the end of an exhausting week-long tour, will take to world summitry. Multilateral fora would not seem his natural habitat: he is hardly likely to be interested in the dense final communiques these meetings tend to produce – and which remain largely unread by anyone but the functionaries who toiled over every ambiguous sub-paragraph. 
There are few specific deals to be made, just frank views to be exchanged and understandings reached. The format is deliberately informal, if not unstructured. And the absence of Russia and China may make Trump question the G7’s continued relevance.
Moreover, the prospect of Trump being totally alone with his six interlocutors will certainly cause palpitations amongst the officials listening to the discussion on headphones in an adjoining room. 
Few can predict the course of his conversation, the span of his concentration or what state secrets he might divulge.
The risk is that – on a range of agenda items – Trump finds himself in the G1. His six colleagues, with varying degrees of emphasis, are likely to want to change his instincts on climate change, protectionism, the treatment of refugees and novel ideas like a web tax on the giant technology companies. Japan will be seeking a tougher strategy on North Korea’s nuclear ambitions.
According to diplomats, the leaders have been exchanging views on how best to engage Trump, or locate the true figures of influence in the White House. 
One diplomat said: “We need to show a degree of humility. In foreign policy terms, the second half of Trump’s 100 days were immeasurably better than the first half, recognisably Republican. The trick is to make sure he does not feel cornered, and if you have an idea, make him feel it is his idea, and in America’s interest. At the same time, we need to get some commitments from him.”
The team around Emmanuel Macron – one of four leaders attending his first G7 – say they will be pressing Trump hard on the argument that the US cannot afford to backtrack on the agreements Barack Obama struck at the UN Paris climate change conference summit. In some ways, it is a replay of the arguments the G7 staged with George W Bush at the start of the decade.
Some western powers are trying to frame the climate change discussion as a national security argument, pointing to the risk of war and terrorism if mass migration explodes out of drought-ridden Africa.
Trump’s aides insist he remains in listening mode on climate change, and no decision will be made for a few weeks. The British, eternal optimists, at least sense he is moving on the issue. Results may have to wait for the G20 summit, to be attended by China in Hamburg in June.
It may be a tougher ask to get Trump to sign up to words extolling the virtues of free trade – standard fare in G7 communiques since its inception in 1975, but anathema to Trump’s protectionist tax-cutting instincts. Time has been set aside for a lengthy debate on Friday evening. Angela Merkel – facing elections this year – cannot be seen to cave to a man who is political kryptonite among her voters.
Trump was joined by his full entourage on his first overseas trip as president. His innermost circle comprises his daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, who is the president's closest foreign policy advisor. Just outside that circle is Hope Hicks, a former spokeswoman who has become a constant presence at Trump's side. Then there are the competing White House barons: chief ideologue Steve Bannon, chief of staff Reince Priebus, and national security adviser HR McMaster. Preibus and Bannon returned to Washington after the tour's first stop, in Saudi Arabia.
Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state – and only cabinet secretary on the tour – and the outgoing acting assistant secretary of state, Stuart Jones, rank next in terms of access and influence. The next ring comprises Gary Cohn, the president's economic advisor; Dina Powell, the deputy national security advisor, who is Egyptian-born and speaks Arabic; Stephen Miller, a nationalist anti-immigration policy advisor; and Sean Spicer, the White House spokesman. Spicer's deputy, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, is also present, as is the spokesman for the national security council, Michael Anton. It is not clear is how many national security council experts have been brought along.
Equally, Italy’s prime minister, Paulo Gentiloni, supported by Merkel, will want to broaden Trump’s perception of fighting terrorism, an issue made more urgent by the Manchester atrocity. Gentiloni wants the US to look at the way in which climate, migration and security are increasingly intertwined.
The seven leaders will be looking out at the Mediterranean – a sea which this year alone has seen over 1,300 migrants drown as they attempt to reach Europe from Libya. About 50,000 have reached Italy, a figure large enough to suggest more than 200,000 migrants will arrive in the country this year. Italy feels strongly that it has been left alone to handle a crisis in which the accidents of geography have handed it an excessive burden.
But Italy is also eager to discuss the root causes of African migration. So the discussion will go wider than Libya’s political stability, coastal patrols, or even closing migration routes to address how to foster economic innovation in Africa.
The vast cuts announced by the White House this week in the US foreign aid budget run counter to this, and an Italian plan for an African food security fund at the summit has been scaled back. Trump will meet five African leaders from Tunisia, Niger, Nigeria, Ethiopia and Kenya.
The presence of Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, will also ensure North Korea’s nuclear ambitions get high billing. If North Korea is only two years away from gaining an intercontinental weapon, as many experienced diplomats believe, this becomes an issue that Trump and most of the other G7 leaders know they will have to address on their watch. The speed of Pyongyang’s progress with missile technology is alarming all sides.
At issue is whether the G7 should seek to engage or instead persuade China to bring the regime of Kim Jong Un to its knees by cutting off oil supplies, risking a dangerous chaos, and mass refugee flows.
Experienced Korean diplomats privately say the chances of the current standoff ending peacefully are limited, as low as 10%, and predict North Korea will have intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of striking Washington within two years. Despairing diplomats hope that Trump’s unpredictability may prove to be an asset in the crisis since his personality will make an anxious North Korea unable to forecast his next move.
That same anxiety, of course, is shared in a different way by the other members of the G7, and the intrigue in the two days ahead may lie in the extent to which Trump manages to reassure or instead deepen concern about the “leader of the free world”.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/25/trump-g7-visit-climate-refugees-japan-north-korea

They are almost unimpeded by land except for the tip of South America and the southern end of New Zealand’s South Island.
These winds play a major role in Earth’s climate, helping to regulate the carbon dioxide exchange between the deep ocean and atmosphere, and influencing rainfall, temperature and sea ice extent in the Southern Hemisphere. Now scientists have uncovered a 17,000-year history of these shifting winds, sitting at the bottom of a New Zealand lake bed.
Last year, Gavin Dunbar and colleagues from Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand drilled deep into the sediments underlying Lake Ohau – a lake that lies to the east of New Zealand’s Southern Alps, and underneath the path of the Roaring Forties. 
In recent decades, growth of the ozone hole has forced the winds to shift southwards, resulting in summer rains decreasing by as much as 40% in southern New Zealand. This is reflected in the lake sediments, which accumulate when heavy rains wash them down the slopes of the nearby mountains.
The scientists extracted 80m of layered sediments, and radiocarbon dated twigs and leaves in the sediment to reveal 17,000 years of climate history. 
Using data they had gathered over the last seven years, Dunbar and his colleagues were able to calibrate the sediment layers and recognise the difference between dry summers (millimetre scale couplets of fine silt) and flood events (centimetre thick silt layers). Their findings are published in Earth &amp; Space Science News. 
Now the scientists are working through the sediments layer by layer, listening to the howling of ancient winds.

No nation, whether it’s large or small, rich or poor, will be immune from the impacts of climate change. We are already experiencing it in America, where some cities are seeing floods on sunny days, where wildfire seasons are longer and more dangerous, where in our arctic state, Alaska, we’re seeing rapidly eroding shorelines, and glaciers receding at a pace unseen in modern times.
Over my eight years in office, we dramatically increased our generation of clean energy, we acted to curtail our use of dirty energy, and we invested in energy efficiency across the board. At the 2015 climate change summit in Paris, we helped lead the world to the first significant global agreement for a low-carbon future.
But here’s the thing: even if every country somehow puts the brakes on emissions, climate change would still have an impact on our world for years to come. Our changing climate is already making it more difficult to produce food, and we’ve already seen shrinking yields and spiking food prices that, in some cases, are leading to political instability. And when most of the world’s poor work in agriculture, the stark imbalances that we’ve worked so hard to close between developed and developing countries will be even tougher to close. The cost will be borne by people in poor nations that are least equipped to handle it. In fact, some of the refugee flows into Europe originate not only from conflict, but also from places where there are food shortages, which will get far worse as climate change continues. So if we don’t take the action necessary to slow and ultimately stop these trends, the migration that has put such a burden on Europe already will just continue to get worse.
Now, the good news is that there are steps we can take that will make a difference: in the United States, we have been able to bring our emissions down even as we grow our economy. The same is true in many parts of Europe. Take food production, for instance. It’s the second leading driver of greenhouse gas emissions, second only to energy production. But we have already identified ways in which we can address this challenge. The path to a sustainable food future will require unleashing the creative power of our best scientists, and engineers and entrepreneurs, backed by public and private investment, to deploy new innovations in climate-smart agriculture. Better seeds, better storage, crops that grow with less water, crops that grow in harsher climates, mobile technologies that put more agricultural data – including satellite imagery and weather forecasting and market prices – into the hands of farmers, so that they know when to plant and where to plant, what to plant and how it will sell.
All these things can help to make sure that food security exists in poor countries, but it can also help us ensure that, in producing the food that we need to feed the billions of people on this planet, we’re not destroying the planet in the process.
A part of this is also going to be wasting less food. We have to create a food culture that encourages a demand for healthier, more sustainable food. In fact, making sure people have healthy food to eat alleviates a lot of the medical cost that we’re seeing increasing in the advanced world, and if we’re able to reduce our healthcare costs, that in turn will allow us to divert those resources into further relieving poverty in many parts of the world. When families get the nourishment they need, we see education outcomes rise, we see healthcare costs fall, and we see economic activity improve; and when, in the United States, the number one disqualifier for military service is obesity, we might even be able to strengthen our security as well.
So the good news is that we’re starting to see a better way to feed a growing planet, combat hunger and malnutrition, put healthy food on the table and save our environment. And none of this is impossible. We can look at the successes we’ve already made: in just the past decade, the number of undernourished people in the world is down by more than 160 million.
I do not believe that any part of the world has to be condemned to perpetual poverty and hunger. And I do not believe that this planet is condemned to ever-rising temperatures. I believe these are problems that were caused by man, and they can be solved by man.
I’m fond of quoting the words of Dr Martin Luther King Jr, who believed that there is such a thing as being too late. When it comes to climate change, the hour is almost upon us. If we act boldly and swiftly, if we set aside our political interests in favour of the air that our young people will breathe, and the food they will eat, and the water they will drink; if we think about them and their hopes and dreams, then we will act, and it won’t be too late. And we can leave behind a world that is worthy of our children, where there’s reduced conflict and greater cooperation – a world marked not by human suffering, but by human progress.
Food has not been the focus of climate change discussions as much as it should have been. Part of the problem is that we haven’t publicised the impact of food production on greenhouse gas emissions. People naturally understand that big smokestacks have pollution in them – they understand air pollution, so they can easily make the connection between energy production and greenhouse gases. Most people aren’t as familiar with the impact of cows and methane. So part of the problem that we need to address is just lack of knowledge in the general public. Keep in mind how long it took to educate people around climate change, and we still have a lot of work to do.
Part of it is that food is a very emotional issue. Because food is so close to us, and it’s part of our families, and it’s part of what we do every single day, people are more resistant to the idea of government or bureaucrats telling us how to eat, what to eat, how to grow it. The truth is that agriculture communities in every country are very strong, politically. Historically, in the United States, the one area where Democrats and Republicans agree is on the agriculture committee, because they usually come from agricultural states, and they are very good at joining across party lines to protect the interest of food producers.
If you combine all those things with the fact that the system is so uneven – there are countries that just need more food, and there are countries where there is a glut of food – it makes for a difficult political dynamic in which to shape rational policy. Now, having said that, this is an area where we are starting to see some progress. In the United States, one of the things that we tried to do is to work with farmers to think about how they could produce the same amounts of food more efficiently, with fewer greenhouse gas emissions. And what I’ve always said is that if you want to make progress in this area, you have to take into account the interests of the producers themselves. Farmers work hard, and especially with small farms, or family farms, they feel that they are always just a step away from losing everything.
Obviously, a large portion of agriculture is dominated by agribusiness, but to the extent that you can show small- and medium-sized farmers ways to do things better that will save them money – or at least doesn’t cost them money – they’re happy to adopt some of these new processes. But if what they see is that you are putting the environmental issues as a priority over their economic interest, then they’ll resist.
That’s true in advanced countries, and it’s also true in poor countries. My father is from Kenya. The first time I visited, I was speaking to some conservationists who were very upset because some of the game parks were being encroached upon by farmers – either the Maasai with their cattle, or subsistence farmers who were slashing and cutting down the ecosystem. And my sister – who’s from Kenya and has a less romantic view about animals and game parks – said: “Well, if all the money from the game parks is going to the tour agencies in Nairobi and not going to the farmers next door, then of course they are not going to care. But if they see some economic interest in helping to conserve this land, they’ll participate.” And that, in fact, has been the case. Where you’ve seen success in conservation, it’s because you’ve brought in the local farmers and you’ve taught them how this is better for them. So that has to be a top priority. If we’re going to be successful, we have to engage producers.
We also have to engage consumers. My good friend Sam Kass cooked for us at the White House, and helped to shape America’s nutrition policy. He worked with my wife to promote healthy eating, and most of the impact he had was not legislation, it was raising awareness with parents about what unhealthy eating was doing to their children, and showing how millions of young children could eat healthier meals. The key is giving people good information. We can make progress in educating the advanced world about the need to reduce, just for dietary reasons, the amount of meat that people consume at any given meal, particularly if it’s wasted. When you have fresh food, you are less likely to waste it, because it doesn’t last as long – you buy it on the day that you are going to eat it and you use it. We’re seeing businesses in the United States trying to come up with efficient, smart ways in which people can have the convenience of fast food, but with the food being healthier, and as a consequence, less is wasted.
If people feel as if they don’t have control over their lives, or that their children don’t have a good future, then they will resist efforts to deal with climate change because right now they’re concerned about feeding their child. It’s a luxury to worry about climate change; you have to have enough to eat before you start worrying about what’s going to happen to the planet 30 years from now. If we do not pay attention to increasing inequality – and the fact that technology and globalisation are accelerating – there will be a backlash.
Technology is making many sectors of the economy far more capital-intensive and far less labour-intensive. We saw it in manufacturing, but it is now moving through large portions of the service and managerial sectors as well. This is going to be a major problem in the advanced world, and over the long term, in the developing world as well. It’s one of the things I worry about most, because work does not just provide income – it also provides people with a sense of dignity and status in their society. I am certain that in many countries in the Middle East, for example, or in south Asia, part of the problem that leads to radicalisation and conflict is having large numbers of unemployed young men who don’t have anything to do – that lack of meaning and purpose will channel itself in unhealthy ways.
The best example of the kinds of issues that we’re going to face comes from driverless cars. Driverless cars are coming. The technologies are here and eventually the regulatory barriers are going to break down. The truth is that we can create a system of driverless cars that are safer, more fuel-efficient, and more convenient. But in the United States alone, there are 3 or 4 million people who make good livings just driving. And where are they going to work, if suddenly trucking and buses no longer need drivers? We have to anticipate those things now.
My guess is that, ultimately, what is going to happen is that everybody is going to have to work a little bit less, and we’re going to have to spread work around more. But that’s going to require a reorganisation of the social compact. That requires that we change our mindset about the link between work, income and the value of people in the teaching profession, or healthcare, or certain things that cannot be done by AI or a robot. And one of my goals as president – one of the goals of every leader of every country right now – was thinking about that time 20 years from now, or 30 years from now, when technology will have eliminated entire sectors of the economy.
How do we prepare for that? How do we start creating, or at least having a conversation in our society about making sure that work and opportunities are spread, and that everybody has the chance to live a good and fulfilling life, rather than having a few people who are working 80 or 90 hours a week, and making enormous incomes, and then a large portion of redundant workers that increasingly have a difficult time supporting families. That’s not a sustainable mechanism for democracy and a healthy society.
The people who know me best would say I have not changed much since I became president. And I’m happy about that. One of the dangers of being in the public eye, being in the spotlight, being in positions of power, is how it will change your soul. There is an expression: you start “believing your own hype” – you start believing that you deserve all the attention. I actually found that I became more humble the longer I was in office. But I also think that I became less fearful. When you are young, you feel like you have something to prove, and sometimes you worry about making mistakes. Once you’ve been president of the United States, then a) you’ve made a mistake every day; b) everybody has seen you fail, and large portions of the country think you’re an idiot – but it’s a liberating feeling when you realise, “OK, I’m still here, I still wake up every day, and I still have the opportunity to do some good”, so that as time went on, I got rid of some of the anxieties that come with youth.
When I was president, wherever I’d go, I would always meet with young people. And it would always give me energy and inspiration to see how much talent and sophistication and optimism and idealism existed among young people in the United States, all across Europe, all across Asia, Africa and the Middle East. The problem is that so often, young people’s voices aren’t heard, and when they want to get involved in issues, they don’t know how, and they don’t have the tools.
So I and others have been talking about how we can create an effective network of global activists – some of whom are in politics, some of whom are in business, some of whom are in journalism or working for NGOs – and provide them with the tools, the training, the networks, the relationships, the funding, so that they can be even more effective. That’s probably what I’m going to be spending most of the next 10 years on. I have a lot of grey hair now. People always ask me, “Oh, Mr President, you know, we need you, we want you to get involved”, and I’m happy to get involved, but the greatest thing I think I can give is to make sure that somebody who is 20 years old, or 21, or 25 – who is ready to make their mark on the world – I can help them, so that they can take it to the next level.
When I was young, I gave my mother a lot of headaches. I wasn’t always the best student, and I wasn’t always the most responsible young person. It wasn’t until I got to college that I began to think about many of the broader issues that the world was facing, but the moment for me in which I started to understand leadership was when I moved to Chicago. I had been inspired by the civil rights movement, and I wanted to be involved in some way in bringing about change. I got a job working with low-income communities, and what I learned was that the mark of a good leader is somebody who is able to empower other people. So often we think of leadership as somebody at the top who is ordering other people around. But it turns out that – for me, at least – what made me understand leadership was when I could see somebody who thought they didn’t have a voice, or that they didn’t have influence or power, and teach them how they could speak up about the things that were affecting their lives.
When we think about issues like food security or climate change, ultimately politicians can help guide policy. But the energy to bring about change is going to come from what people do every day. It’s going to come from parents who are concerned about the kind of impact climate change may have on their children, or from enlightened business people who say: “How can we use less energy in producing the products that we are making?” It’s millions of decisions that are being made individually that end up having as much impact as anything, and that’s certainly true in our democracies.
People have a tendency to blame politicians when things don’t work. But, as I always tell people, you get the politicians you deserve. And if you don’t vote and you don’t participate and you don’t pay attention, then you’ll get policies that don’t reflect your interests.
We have an expression in the United States: “The squeaky wheel gets the oil.” It’s certainly true that politicians and governments respond to people making noise and making demands, and sometimes, if certain groups have not been heard before, they have to get the attention of those in power.
But the biggest mistake sometimes made by activists – when I was an activist, sometimes I made this mistake – is forgetting that once you’ve got the attention of the people in power, then you have to engage them. So you have to do your homework and you have to have facts, and you have to be willing to compromise and not expect that you’re going to get 100% of what you want, because – at least if you’re in a democracy – your demands may clash with the demands of someone else. It’s very important to be willing to put pressure on government but it’s also important to propose concrete solutions, to take what you can get and then try to make more progress after that.
The second thing that is increasingly important is how to shape public opinion. It is very important for people who are interested in issues like climate change or inequality, or whatever it is that you care about, to find effective ways to speak to the public and to change public opinion. Abraham Lincoln used to say: “With public opinion there’s nothing I cannot do, and without public opinion there’s nothing I can get done.” And I’ve learned that first-hand myself.
We need to find ways to speak to young people who are getting all their information off a phone, and will not sit down and read a 50-page report. You may have two minutes to get your message across, or five minutes, and they may be more interested in a video than they are in reading a text. You’ll need to create a strong, truthful, powerful message that leads them to action – that’s something I’m going to be spending a lot of time thinking about.
Young people are more conscious today, they are more innovative, they are more entrepreneurial. Because they are more sceptical of government and politics, it seems as if a lot of people think: “That’s a dirty business, I don’t want to go into it, who wants to be criticised and attacked all the time?” So you’re seeing a lot of people who want to change the world thinking that maybe the best way to do it is by going into business or non-profit organisations.
If I were an entrepreneur today, trying to make money and sell my products or services, I would want to understand this youth market. They want to do the right thing, too. If they find out that what you’re selling isn’t good for the environment, or what you’re selling is not good for people, or if they hear that you do not treat your workers well, and do not pay them a decent wage, and don’t provide decent benefits, that can affect your brand. And so part of what has changed is the nature of the entrepreneurs themselves, who may be more socially conscious, coming into their business. Even if you don’t care about these issues, your customers care. And you’ve got to be paying attention to that.

It's not just the fish, though, that are disappearing. 
Industrial fishing uses big stuff, big machinery. We use nets that are 20 miles long. We use longlines that have one million or two million hooks. 
And we trawl, which means to take something the size of a tractor trailer truck that weighs thousands and thousands of pounds, put it on a big chain, and drag it across the sea floor to stir up the bottom and catch the fish. 
Think of it as being kind of the bulldozing of a city or of a forest, because it clears it away. And the habitat destruction is unbelievable.
 This is a photograph, a typical photograph, of what the continental shelves of the world look like. You can see the rows in the bottom, the way you can see the rows in a field that has just been plowed to plant corn. 
What that was, was a forest of sponges and coral, which is a critical habitat for the development of fish. 
What it is now is mud, and the area of the ocean floor that has been transformed from forest to level mud, to parking lot, is equivalent to the entire area of all the forests that have ever been cut down on all of the earth in the history of humanity. 
We've managed to do that in the last 100 to 150 years.""

The environmental issues that attach to such issues are so selective. Despite the numbers of most fauna in Britain falling off cliffs or disappearing under car wheels nothing stops the march of the bulldozer and the loss of huge amounts of our countryside. Every site prepared for building is crudely smoothed by levelling machines and who knows what is interred in the shifting. 
Then come the houses and their networks of roads, the diverting of water courses and that added aura of clinical depopulation that surrounds settlements. But all that is clever and good. In a noble cause, to be encouraged. Yes, gone are the days when peasants would trap inestimable amounts of wild creatures as a food source especially sea birds in their rocky fastnesses but would only take so much in an effort to provision tomorrow and tomorrow. The only saving grace is that 'they' do not know they are being wiped out and do not know that burden of comprehension that we carry in our anxiety as human beings.
What disruption to the evolution of our wildlife will HS2 cause? We know so little about the movement of creatures and their habitat reliance, the tendency of their movement around food sources. We have not sufficient wild places as it is and defer to the high lands, the moors and the peat bogs, as being examples of wildness while only useful to a small select band of creatures in what is otherwise a barren landscape, Baron Landscape and Count Thedecliningnumbers; Lord Loveus).
It is said that our back gardens are the new wild. I have seen the effect on home owners who have their properties undermined by Badgers and the hysterics caused by the sight of a rodent on the lawn. Gardens are peopled by foreign species of flora in the main that are of no food use to even the humble bee. Gardens are baited traps for the delectation of domestic cats. Gardens are places of people activity anathema to creatures which require solitude and secrecy to perform their reproduction.
The selectivity over what is allowable is but creepy manifesto twaddle in a sphere where the answer is that truth that dare not speak its name. Our lowlands are fully committed and groomed, divested, spartan and homogenised for the desperate life-style fashions of man and the hectic and piecemeal foraging by politicians to accelerate growth in short term policy to flatter their ineptitude in building something cohesive and lasting.

You don't actually say whether any of these factors are direct contributions as to why sea bird numbers are falling. You give a myriad of reasons from Donald Trump to Fishing boats and Ancient tombs full of sea eagle bones. I thought numbers were going down because all the sea birds keep eating loads of plastic and then dying just like the creatures that live beneath the waves but I don't actually see this anywhere in the article. In fact one of the solutions is that you go on a worldwide jolly visiting all sea bird colonies, why can't you just say what exactly is killing the most birds? Of all the tens (or hundreds) of thousands of dead sea birds you've been logging have you bothered to perform an autopsy on any of them? Plastic is the biggest factor and the most widespread killer yet hardly mentioned. Poorly executed article, this is more an arrogant demonstration of knowledge than presentation of a problem and a solution.

After all, we’re to blame | Adam Nicolson",article,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/26/seabirds-numbers-falling-puffins-shearwaters-climate-change,0,"About 70,000 tonnes of seabird are now afloat or on the wing off the shores of the British Isles. This biomass – roughly the same as Salisbury Cathedral – is made up entirely of thinking, fishing, hunting, flirting, fighting, flying, diving and feathered beauty: 8 million breeders, several million more adolescents and, by the end of the summer, armies of chicks. Perhaps 15 million creatures in all.
They are here for sex, and the raising of the next generation. Eggs can’t be laid on the sea; bird embryos breathe air through the shell and would suffocate in water.
Every coastal culture on Earth has evolved a double attitude to seabirds – using and loving them, nurturing and killing them, experimenting with them and selling them, looking at them with awe and making toys, hats and dinner out of them. They were never merely walking or flying larders but, as the archaeologists Marcus Brittain and Nick Overton have called them, “participants in life”, fellow beings, co-actors in the drama and struggle of existence. Stillborn children were buried on the wings of whooper swans in Mesolithic Denmark. At Isbister in Orkney, more than 600 sea eagle bones were mixed in with human remains in a bronze age tomb. In Shetland shepherds used to feed titbits to the bonxies – great skuas – that protected their lambs from sea eagles and ravens. Even now, Hebridean fishermen keep seagulls as pets in their gardens beyond the kitchen door.
For generations, their mystery and power has been in their ability to come and go beyond any horizon. Now, thanks to technology – almost entirely fuelled by the miniaturisation drive of the mobile phone industry – we know what these birds do when beyond that horizon: wandering albatrosses sail five million miles in a lifetime’s voyaging around the Southern Ocean; each puffin holds within its mind a map of the North Atlantic, tracking across it to the same unmarked parts year after year; shearwaters smell their way around their 20,000-mile migrations from northern nest sites to southern fishing grounds in a two-hemisphere life of unbroken summer.
But just as science is coming to understand the seabirds, we are destroying them. By one measure, in the past 60 years they have declined by two thirds, from about 1.5 billion to something like 500 million.
The extension of the graph into the future reaches zero in about 2060. That won’t happen – the seabird phenomenon is too complex, with too many unknowns and local variations. But a disaster is unfolding, and it is one we have brought on ourselves: through overfishing; the massive accidental catching of birds in fishing gear; their deliberate destruction; introducing rats, cats, dogs, pigs, goats, rabbits and cattle to the breeding places of birds that are defenceless because they did not evolve with the introduced species (many Pacific birds literally cannot smell a rat); pollution by oil, metals, plastics and other toxins; the recently discovered fact that plastic that has long been floating in the ocean comes to smell like food, so 90% of all seabirds are now found to have plastic in their stomachs; the destruction of nesting sites by human development; and the multiple effects of climate change and the acidification of the sea.
The details are horrible. Fulmars and other species are being caught by Spanish longliners; they are drowning in gill nets, which hang in the sea and are designed to trap fish by the gills but are just as effective at catching birds; and they are being killed under the heavy cables behind trawlers, where they gather to feed on offal. In European seas, fulmar numbers have declined by 40% over the past 30 years. They are predicted to crash by the same percentage again in the next 50.
It is the same story for the world’s 11 million puffins. They will be 80% down by the second half of this century, and a rare sight anywhere south of the northernmost islands in Scotland. The tufted and horned puffins, of which there are about five million in the Pacific, are also declining. Their cousins, the guillemots and razorbills, are suffering too, with sharp losses in Iceland, one of the headquarters of auk life, with big colonies losing almost half their birds in the three or four years after 2005. There are now some 20 million kittiwakes strung around the northern hemisphere, but in places the population has halved in number since 1983.
What is to be done? All that can be done. We must not preside over the ending of these marvels. Most of the practicalities are obvious: there needs to be a much wider understanding of the state of the world’s seabirds; their breeding places need to be protected from people and their predatory animals; much tighter controls must be imposed on all kinds of fishing vessels so that fewer birds are killed at sea; and, because the death rate of adult birds in winter has more influence on seabird populations than any other single factor, their winter feeding grounds need to be understood, mapped and protected – particularly the great oceanic upwellings off the continents.
Finally, and most intractably, the rate at which we are changing the atmosphere and the ocean, both its temperature and its acidity, needs to be brought under control. Donald Trump’s relighting of the fires under global warming is to be accompanied by the cutting of funds to the US nature agencies. In the UK, groundbreaking censuses of seabirds were made in 1970, 1985 and 2000. There should have been one in 2015, but shamefully it was thought unnecessary and never carried out. The destruction will romp into the future. And unless we change our minds, it will also happen in the dark.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/26/seabirds-numbers-falling-puffins-shearwaters-climate-change

It’s a good question: glance at most publishers’ catalogues and you would never know that humanity was facing the greatest challenge of its existence. Laline Paull’s two novels to date have brought humanity and narrative to the changes already under way on Earth – and unlike most environmentally conscious fiction, they’re intended for a mainstream audience. Her Baileys shortlisted 2014 debut The Bees followed the life of a single lowly bee; its anthropomorphised bee characters smiled and wept and shouted in joy, enchanting critics and readers with their richness and warmth.
Her second novel, The Ice, focuses on human intrigue in the warming Arctic: in its opening pages, a glacier calves to reveal a body, several years dead, and the novel plays out as an inquest into this death. By embedding a mystery in layers of melting Arctic ice, Paull brings narrative tension to a phenomenon readers typically encounter only in environmental or scientific reporting.
The body, we learn early on, is former Greenpeace chief Tom Harding, who had been persuaded to lend his integrity to a scheme dreamt up by his old friend Sean Cawson, a businessman and the novel’s protagonist. The men bonded over a mutual fascination with the Arctic as students in Oxford’s Lost Explorers’ Society, before growing apart as adults. The plan that reunites them is to build in the Arctic “an inspiring venue in which to promote the reconciliation of business and environmental ethics” – precisely the bifurcation that has divided their friendship. With a habit of leaving little to deduction, The Ice continues: “And here they were, the two of them, actually living out that conflict, at this very second.”
As that quote suggests, The Ice tends towards allegory. As characters take the stand at the inquest, they seem to represent various attitudes to conservation, each given an opportunity to have their say. Here’s Sean: “The Arctic is melting … While some people are wringing their hands, treaties fall wildly out of date and business capitalises. So choose denial, or choose – like I did, like my partners and I have actively and responsibly done – to be at the vanguard of those changes and make sure they happen in the most positive way.” Later, a professor of ocean physics, called upon to testify about the changing conditions in the Arctic, asserts that Tom’s death “can itself be attributed … to the reckless endangering of our planet by every industry that ignores the environmental recommendations for how to operate, and to every government that fails to abide by the Paris Agreement.”
All this polemic is rather a lot for the characters to carry, and at times the fiction wears thin. Critics praised The Bees for kindling concern for a threatened species through rich storytelling, without grinding any axes. That novel was an exercise in empathy and imagination. By contrast, The Ice is structured as a blame game, its setup going straight to the heart of responsibility for and appropriate responses to climate change. If the primary concern is to spread an environmental message, this is ideal. If the goal is to write a nuanced piece of character-based fiction, it’s less so.
And if the environmental message is the novel’s primary concern, it’s somewhat weakened by the circumstances of Tom’s death. Ghosh concluded that literary writers have avoided writing about climate change because they deem it too strange for fiction, that they dread inspiring incredulity with extreme and unpredictable events even as such events become the norm. The Ice is built around an extreme event, and it inspires some incredulity – though not, as Ghosh suggests in his piece, incredulity that such an event could happen; rather that it should dovetail so neatly with the tensions between characters. In the context of the novel, it’s actually rather predictable. This forces the destabilised Arctic to make sense on a human level, which is precisely what it will not do.
Nonetheless, the final pages are a triumph. Here, Paull slips into a more nuanced mode, delivering fragmented reports on places and players: we flit between a pub, a plane, a car crash, a shipwreck and news reports. It’s a rousing passage that, in its simultaneity and its resistance to simple causative relationships, brings the novel closer to the complexity and truth of life and of nature.

The deadlock at the end of the G7 summit in Italy left other world leaders frustrated. The German chancellor Angela Merkel said the discussions “had been very difficult and not to say very unsatisfactory.
She added: “Here we have a situation of six against one, meaning there is still no sign of whether the US will remain in the Paris accord or not.”
Instead, six of the seven nations used a communique at the end of the meetings to assert their commitment to implement the Paris plan, leaving Trump to tweet that he will decide next week whether the US will join them in their pledge.
The US president announced his forthcoming decision on Saturday morning, on the final day of his first international trip as president. “I will make my final decision on the Paris accord next week!” he tweeted from Sicily.
During the two-day conclave in Taormina, other leaders repeatedly urged Trump to recognise that as world’s second biggest carbon emitter, the US had to show leadership on climate issues.
Emmanuel Macron, the French president, said he had seen progress on climate change at G7, but revealed he had told Trump he would be making an error and ceding ground to China if he did not stick with the Paris accord.
Macron said: “It is essential for international equilibrium and the reputation of America that it remains engaged with the Paris treaty. The G7 had shown issues such as climate change are not side issues that can be left to others.”
He refused to speculate on the US decision, but he said: “Trump was a good listener, a pragmatic guy and open to debate.”
The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said he was not going to lecture any country, but he added: “You cannot build a strong economic future unless you are protective and mindful of the climate.” 
Others warned the US president that he risks a stampede, as others in the 195-nation agreement use American withdrawal from the treaty to reduce their own commitments.
Trump retained the option of pulling out of the treaty altogether or, more likely, scaling back on the specific commitments made by the Obama administration. Obama pledged to cut domestic greenhouse gas emissions 26%-28 % below 2005 levels by 2025.
Computer simulations suggest earth temperatures could rise by as much 0.2C if the US pulled out of the UN treaty altogether.
Feverish negotiations by G7 officials until 3am on Saturday failed to forge a closer consensus, reviving the era when George W Bush was alone among G7 leaders in expressing scepticism about climate change.
The White House had signalled at the start of Trump’s tour of the Middle East and Europe that the US would not make a decision on climate change until after the summit, but other G7 leaders, such as Merkel and Macron, hoped they could collectively persuade Trump to commit to the principles of the Paris accord.
During the presidential campaign Trump railed against the damage the Paris deal would inflict on traditional US industry. At the summit, his aides said that although his own views were evolving, he would always put the interests of US industry first.
In an assertion of US unilateral power, Trump also forced the Italian prime minister Paulo Gentiloni – the summit host – to shred plans for an ambitious statement stressing the plight of migrants was a global rather than regional responsibility.
Italy had chosen Sicily as the venue for the summit as the symbolic bridge between Europe and Africa. As many as 200,000 migrants are due to reach Italy this year from Libya, and already more than 1,300 have drowned seeking to make the crossing.
During the two-day summit in Taormina, the Libyan capital Tripoli has seen more than 50 deaths in militia infighting, Egypt has twice bombed alleged Islamist training camps in southern Libya, and more than 2,000 refugees have crossed the Mediterranean to the Italian mainland, with scores drowning.
Italy had planned a five-page G7 statement on human mobility, stressing migrants’ rights, their positive contribution to host nations and the threat they faced from traffickers. Instead the final statement highlighted the right of nation states to secure their borders, and set migration targets.
Trump also shot down Italian plans on African food security, days after the White House revealed plans to cut American foreign aid by a third. In 2015 the G7 committed to lift 500 million people out of famine and malnutrition, but instead famines have spread in Africa.
Friederike Röder, director at ONE, the aid charity, said: “In a year of greatly-diminished expectations, the G7 have managed to set a new low. The early promise of this summit was crushed by the Trump administration’s hostile negotiating posture and the evident lack of ambition.”
Trump did concede some ground in the final leader’s statement by signing up to a pledge to oppose protectionism. His aides insist he wants free, fair and reciprocal trade.
In a win for the Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, the statement was expected to repeat a pledge from the Japanese hosted summit in 2016 to respect a rules based multilateral trade system embodied in the WTO.
But Trump still intends to target German trade practices and its surplus, a stance resented by Merkel.
At the end of the summit, Trump chose to give no closing press conference, presumably to avoid questions on whether he knew of his son-in-law Jared Kushner’s reported plans to set up a secret communications channel with Russia.
Trump instead chose to address US forces stationed in Sicily, reprising the themes of his first foreign trip and making no mention of the climate change dispute.
He said simply that he had staged a series of productive meetings with his allies at the G7, but again opened fire on Nato nations for failing to spend enough on defense, claiming contributions were starting to rise in a way they would not but for his election.
Accompanied by his wife, Trump often cut an uneasy, even glowering figure in Sicily. His aides insisted he had not sought to dominate the discussions and had enjoyed the free-flowing conversations, likening them to a family dinner. Economic adviser Gary Cohn said: “He came here to learn. He came here to get smart. His views are evolving which exactly as they should be.”
The two days, along with the mini Nato summit in Brussels on Thursday, were seen as a chance for Trump to define his “America First” slogan, and test its compatibility with multilateral institutions such as the G7. At one point, Trump was seen ostentatiously not wearing translation headphones as Gentiloni led a discussion on African growth.

Trump said in a tweet on Saturday: “I will make my final decision on the Paris Accord next week!” 
The message was published as Trump left Sicily after the G7 summit. Leaders of the other G7 nations – Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Canada and Japan – issued a communique confirming their support for the climate deal, which was reached with contributions from Barack Obama in 2015 and signed the following year.
A report from the Axios news outlet, however, cited “three sources with direct knowledge” as saying Trump had told confidants including the head of the US Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, that he plannned to pull the US out of the deal.
In an interview broadcast on CBS’s Face the Nation, meanwhile, defense secretary James Mattis said the White House had “obviously got a discussion going on about our policy in this regard”.
He added: “And I was sitting in on some of the discussions in Brussels, by the way, where climate change came up, and the president was open, he was curious about why others were in the position they were in … and I’m quite certain the president is wide open on this issue as he takes in the pros and cons of that accord.”
Mattis said that as defense secretary, such negotiations were “not inside my portfolio”, but added: “Obviously we deal with the aspects of a warming climate in the Department of Defense, and to us, that’s just another one of the many factors we deal with which we call the physical environment.”
The White House did not immediately respond to media requests for comment. On Sunday morning, however, the president offered comment of his own, via Twitter, that might have been aimed at the anonymous sources cited in the Axios report.
“It is my opinion that many of the leaks coming out of the White House are fabricated lies made up by the #FakeNews media,” the president wrote. “Whenever you see the words ‘sources say’ in the fake news media, and they don’t mention names it is very possible that those sources don’t exsist [sic] but are made up by fake news writers. #FakeNews is the enemy!”
A source who had been in contact with people involved in the decision told Reuters that meetings were planned with chief executives of energy companies and big corporations and others about the climate agreement, ahead of Trump’s expected announcement. It was unclear whether those meetings would still take place.
In Sicily, Trump, who has called global warming a hoax created by the Chinese and who campaigned on a promise to pull out of the Paris deal, came under concerted pressure from the other leaders to honour the agreement.
“The entire discussion about climate was very difficult, if not to say very dissatisfying,” the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, told reporters. “There are no indications whether the United States will stay in the Paris agreement or not.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/28/donald-trump-paris-climate-deal-g7

Queensland government officials say aerial and in-water surveys taken throughout 2016 had confirmed an escalating impact from north to south.
The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority chairman, Russell Reichelt, said the reef had experienced significant and widespread damage over the past two years.
“The amount of coral that died from bleaching in 2016 is up from our original estimates and ... it’s expected we’ll also see an overall further coral cover decline by the end of 2017,” he said in a statement on Monday. 
Surveys by the Marine Park Authority, Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service, Australian Institute of Marine Science and the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies found the most severe bleaching north of Port Douglas.
There, an estimated 70% of shallow water corals had died, with significant variability between and within reefs.
It is now confirmed that about 29% of shallow water corals died from bleaching during 2016, up from the previous estimate of 22%, with most mortality occurring in the northern parts of the reef.
Bleaching was also found in corals beyond depths divers typically survey, but mortality could not be systematically assessed.
However, there was a strong recovery in the south in the absence of bleaching during the same period.
Officials are predicting further coral loss this year, resulting from the second consecutive year of bleaching and the impacts of tropical Cyclone Debbie.
Over the past few months bleaching occurred in a similar pattern to last year, most severely between Cairns and Townsville.

The Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) on Monday approved an application for the Western Australian water authority to double the capacity of its groundwater replenishment scheme, bringing the amount of recycled water pumped into the Gnangara Mound every year to 28 gigalitres.
The most recent proposal would see the Water Corporation build a 12.8km pipeline from a proposed recycled water plant at Beenyup in the northern suburbs to two different aquifer points, where it will be pumped into Leederville and Yarragadee aquifers.
About 14 gigalitres of wastewater per year would be processed and treated to potable standard at the new Beenyup recycled water facility, before being pumped into the aquifers. The same amount of water will extracted from those aquifers every year to be treated again and used as drinking water.
Murdoch University professor of desalination and water treatment, Wendell Ela, said pumping recycled water into the underground system rather than using it directly once it was treated to a potable standard, reduced “the yuk factor”.
“That’s inevitable and it’s not a bad thing because any time we talk about water we should be interested in the water we are getting and the quality we are getting,” Ela told Guardian Australia.
Ela said the aquifer also provided a “very large, very cheap storage tank,” which allowed the water corporation to replenish groundwater at a steady rate but only withdraw water when necessary. 
“You want it to essentially be a net zero balance,” he said.
The Water Corporation spokeswoman Clare Lugar said the groundwater replenishment scheme was part of a long-term plan to secure water supplies in response to climate change.
Lugar said the proposal ticked two of the organisation’s three strategies for water security, the third being encouraging people to use less water.
“Groundwater replenishment ticks two of these boxes - increases water recycling and developing a new source,” she said. “It is a climate-independent source of water, and the new plant at Beenyup will have the capacity to supply the same amount of water used by 100,000 homes each year.”
The scheme is part of a project to make Perth’s water supply “climate independent” by 2022. Without intervention, Perth is projected to have a supply gap of 70 gigalitres a year over the next 10 years, the EPA report said.
By 2060, one fifth of Perth’s water supply is expected to be replenished groundwater.
Construction on the project begins in July.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/may/29/perth-ramps-up-groundwater-replenishment-scheme-to-drought-proof-city

I'm not sure what the fourth generation means. I do know that the reason that the high level waste was being shipped back and forth to Wales was to have fuel rods recharged by some process.
BQENDNo offence, but I have to question why you so trenchantly oppose something you know so little about.
Is it at all possible that the people who do this for a living have robust processes, huge safety marging, protocols and know what they are doing?
But anyway, that aside, there are many ways of dealing with waste other than burying it, such as MSRs (Molten Salt Reactors) and Waste-Annihilating Molten Salt Reactor (acronym WAMSR) aka as one type of 4th Generation reactor.

Climate change could lead to hundreds of millions of people being at risk of hunger by the middle of this century. This is in addition to the billion or so currently at risk.
Several new studies are just being completed of the potential effects of climate change on global food production potential, and there is a convergence of evidence about the scale and regional distribution of the challenge: Most of the additional climate-change driven hunger will be in the least developed parts of Africa, but significant numbers could also occur in south and south-east Asia. In all regions, the poor, young and elderly are likely to be most affected.

A +2C rise in Global Mean Surface Temperature is likely to have serious consequences for global food security, the stability of many stations, and the breakdown of civilisation through warfare. But even with the implementation of indicated intent to reduce carbon emissions agreed at Paris COP21, we are on course for +3C GMST. 
The carbon budget for +2C MAX is running out fast. That is why COP21 required signatories' carbon emission reduction targets to be strengthened ASAP.

BQENDSo you are saying that like at every single point in human history we have famine.

Are you trying to say we have famines in the Sahara, the Sahael or in the areas south of the Sahel? Are these significant pointers to a ""global famine""

Do you have a definition for what ""global famine"" means?
https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2013/05/blogs/graphic-detail/20130518_gdc846.png
Famine itself is a very emotive topic and one that environmentalists have been very badly burned over before. The whole ""population bomb""\ Paul Ehrlich thing seen many very high profile predictions of ""global famines"" in the past. 
These did not occur. Climate change on the other hand is very very likely to occur and we need to try to contain our comments into those things we know are likely to be true. It is very true we assume that the risks of famine conditions will increase as the climate changes. 
BQSTART
The potential challenges from environmental change to our food systems are substantial. The key potential impacts of climate change on crop production are increasingly well-documented and have been synthesized in the recent AR5 Working Group II report. In brief, in most site-by-crop combinations, yields are reduced with increasing climate changes, but there are some site-by-crop combinations that show increased yield but the frequency of these decreases with progressive climate change (Figure 1). Yield impacts are more negative in tropical vs temperate regions and they vary substantially between crops. Yield variability is likely to increase over the forthcoming decades. Subsequent publications of climate change impacts on crop yield have supported the AR5 analyses, emphasizing the substantial uncertainty in projected crop yield changes and the implications of these on food prices arising through variations in crop, economic, and climate model results.

We risk reduced yeilds, we likely risk increased conditions for local famines. 
But before we risk our credibility by over egging the pudding, people should put a lot of work and research into being able to show that they understand what a ""global famine"" is, what the conditions for one are and that there is well supported evidence that such conditions are likely.

Turnabout is fair play but misleading impressions of someone's arguments is not fair play. You pretend to state my position and mischaracterise it as follows:

BQENDNor have I ever given the impression that I work in, or have an interest in the nuclear sector.
Yet you accused me of it.
You made no criticism of coal, you attacked me for barely mentioning (in passing) nuclear - was that just an attempt by you to derail the conversaation, because certainly it seemed so.
So yes, my response was 'turnaround' as you put it.
Should it only be one directional? - given your emotional reaction it's difficult to accept your claim that you see it as ""fair play"" especially considering your casual dismissal of hard science as ""laughable""  without any effort to support your claim.

Indeed 
That said - Germany has done well since early 90's - because they got a whopper of an increase by uniting east and west. So they have worked hard at phasing out the worst of the old for the more efficient.
This is often called ""low hanging fruits"". UK has also benefited from similar cases of phasing out old coal plants and phasing in gas, but also doing well on especially wind. With a huge potential for both wind and sun to be realised before we even discuss the more difficult technical bits of tidal.
Credit where credit is due.

Do you never doubt your own confidence in nuclear power? It seems the case. You are willing to disregard any arguments (lack of waste management, costs of decommissioning, aging and unsafe reactors) to push your point. You are also able to make untrue statements about Germany and even when I point the error out, you just shift the subject. This all smacks of arguments based on bad faith.

No matter what the question, your answer is often the radiant future of nuclear energy....//....I am not trying to silence you or your perspective but not every single article is about the wonders of nuclear power.
BQENDI briefly mentioned (in one line) the phase out of the German nuclear programme in passing - I cannot help but note you disregarded the construction of five new lignite coal plants and strip mines.
You followed this up with an accusatory question on my motivation for being in favour of low carbon energy as a direct baseload replacement for coal energy.
I answered in full, with supportive data.Whereas you let the resurgence of coal pass without comment.
Whilst regretful, you are clearly at peace with the idea of counterbalancing low carbon renewables with the worst possible balancing mechanism.
So fair is fair - perhaps it's long overdue that you explain your acceptance of lignite coal mining, fugitive emissions from strip mining, huge emissions from coal power generation that is uniquely being used to replace zero carbon nuclear in Germany? 
As you acknowledge, we have discussed this before where you oppose the replacement of coal with society's only current clean low carbon baseload capable supply, whereas I am in favour - explain YOUR motivation, ideally with similarly supported data as I have used.

Even by it's own merits your argument contains a reasoning flaw. I think you're trying to say that talk about limits to economic growth is ridiculous because we can have a computer algorithm generate money.
Even so, you must agree with the fact that limits to economic growth in some areas is necessary, namely the fossil fuel industry. If more and more growth will be decoupled from resourced, as you predict, why not stimulate this growth only?

If they are wrong to oppose those technologies (as is suggested) then their activities and lobbying is a danger to the planet. Yes?

Science does not care what people believe, only what they do, or fail to do.
Some people argue with equal or greater emotion as yours against using MMR vaccines because they similarly distrust the science.Are they right? Of course not.
Why should I not compare their disbelief to the disbelief of people who disagree with professional bodies (RAE, IMEchE, IET ICE etc.) who have positions in favour of nuclear energy, as do the Institute of Physics and the Royal Society the UnitedNations SDSI report on this presented at COP21 in Paris and the United Nations DDPP (Deep Decarbonisation Pathway Project - also IDDRI/SDSI and ClimateWorks) which is backed by 29 of the world's top universities plus the AAAS who all recommend a mix of nuclear and renewables with gas (as a bridge fuel) ultimately with CCS. http://deepdecarbonization.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AU_DDPP_Report_Final.pdf

Experts including Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz and former World Bank chief economist Nicholas Stern said governments needed to move quickly to tackle polluting industries with a tax on carbon dioxide at $40-$80 per tonne by 2020.
A tax of $100 a tonne would be needed by 2030 as one of a series of measures to prevent a rise in global temperatures of 2C.
In a report by the High Level Commission on Carbon Prices, which is backed by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, they suggest poor countries could aim for a lower tax since their economies are more vulnerable.
The aim of a tax on carbon would be essential to meet the targets set by the Cop21 Paris Agreement in 2015, they said.
The call for action will sting European leaders, who have presided over a carbon trading scheme since 2005 that currently charges major polluters just €6 (£5.20) for every tonne of carbon they release into the atmosphere.
The European scheme, which issues firms with carbon credits that can be traded on a central exchange, has come under fire for allowing heavy energy users to avoid investments in new technology to cut their emissions.
Critics accuse officials of issuing too many credits and allowing the price to fall to a level that makes it cheaper for companies to pollute than change their behaviour.
Stiglitz and Stern said prices should rise to $50-$100 by 2030 to give businesses and governments an incentive to lower emissions even when fossil fuels are cheap.
The Trump administration has rejected calls to introduce a carbon tax in the United States, saying it would cost jobs. 
Washington’s refusal to adopt a tax has deterred Brussels from moving to a more substantial charge on emissions, which would have the effect of increasing energy costs, at least in the short term, and imposing higher costs on European manufacturers.
The European Union’s Emissions Trading System (ETS) is the world’s biggest scheme for trading greenhouse gas emissions allowances. It covers 11,000 power stations and industrial plants in 30 countries, whose carbon emissions make up almost 50% of Europe’s total.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/29/sky-high-carbon-tax-needed-to-avoid-catastrophic-global-warming-say-experts

Mistake.
""Carbon Capture and Storage"" I assume to be a fraudulent exercise by the fossil fuel industry.
Typically, with CCS fraud, most of the carbon dioxide which may be captured won't be stored for long before it is sneakily vented to the atmosphere by cowboy operators because there will be a profit in doing so. 
Leaking CO2 will always be cheaper than storing CO2. Storage can't be policed. Indeed the fossil fuel industry has no intention of policing CCS.
The CCS fraud is promoted so as to serve as a slogan and an excuse for ignorant government ministers to repeat, parrot fashion, while continuing to support the business-as-usual fossil fuel industry and dodging valid criticisms of fossil fuel burning causing global warming and environmental damage.

India has cancelled plans to install nearly 14GW of coal generation as solar prices plummet. 
The Director of Energy Finance Studies at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), Tim Buckley, said the shift away from carbon intensive fossil fuel generation is likely to have a significant effect on energy markets across the world.
He said 13.7GW of planned coal power plants have been scrapped this month alone.

This is a government that works with smoke and mirrors and is not serious about addressing the impact of global warming or the environment in a holistic sense – it is not so much what they tell you but rather what they don’t tell you and are hiding from public scrutiny. Almost as complex as the Adani financial arrangements and company structure - the political manoeuvring over funding arrangements and re-direction of investments for the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA).
In August 2016, Josh Frydenberg , as Minister for the Environment and Energy pushed ahead with repeal of ARENA grant funding. The Coalition actually put legislation before the parliament to cut $1billion out of ARENA’s grant funding putting at risk everything the agency had achieved.
PM Malcolm Turnbull had already transferred $1billion from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation into a rebadged Clean Energy Innovation Fund for early stage higher risk investment.
In the end we had legislation passed through the Federal Parliament that resulted in $500m being cut from ARENA, effectively halving its budget in 2017/18 and 20/21 and Turnbull’s flagship Clean Energy Innovation Fund reduced to $200m over 10 years.
We then had Josh Frydenberg having the audacity to claim Federal Government funding at a new virtual power station in SA with support from ARENA and PM Malcolm Turnbull claiming new innovative leadership in addressing an electricity crisis when ARENA first proposed as a funding option the possibility of expanding pumped hydro storage at existing Snowy Hydro. ARENA in 2016 had already allocated an $18m recoupable grant to Winlab and Eurus Energy to build the initial phase of the Kennedy Energy Park – 19MW of solar voltaic, 21.6 MW of wind and 2MW to 4MW battery storage with connection to the energy grid in North QLD. If successful Winlab will go ahead and build a $2billion project dubbed “Big Kennedy” -600MW solar and 600MW of wind, battery storage a pumped hydro combined – 1200MW totalIt is becoming increasingly clear that the Coalition are flogging a ‘dead horse’ with their all out promotion of new coal mines (including Adani) and new super critical thermal coal fired power stations and are desperate to win at all cost– there was always a superior option: the PRIVATELY funded EWLP $55billion Project Iron Boomerang http://www.eastwestlineparks.com.au/ which would deliver economic viability to a circular national electricity grid (NT,SA,VIC,ACT, NSW and QLD) with the support of large scale solar thermal and geothermal development in central Australia and without the need for new coal mines.
Coal fired power stations account for 29.7 percent of energy use globally and are responsible for 44 percent of global carbon emissions. The production of indispensable steel globally accounts for less than 7 percent. Common sense would suggest that if Australia is to seriously play a leading role in reducing net global carbon emissions it needs to concentrate on producing the world’s most competitive first stage slab steel for export and domestic use as an alternative to Adani coal and other new coal mines in Australia – in the process closing down globally 3 percent of highly inefficient and highly polluting ZOMBIE steel production; generating additional tax revenue of$22B ongoing annually; far more diversified job opportunities both in the blue collar and white collar industries; a real boost to national rail infrastructure in the national interest; the generation of major domestic global carbon credits working alongside an ETS that accelerates renewable electricity generation uptake while achieving a net gain in global carbon reductions – this is where any serious attempt at reducing CO2 emissions through carbon capture, storage and UTILISATION should begin.

After telegraphing its intention to overhaul the CEFC’s rules for some months, the government on Tuesday secured party room support for the change.
While the overhaul will be greeted with alarm by environment groups, the energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, said the proposed change was a “demonstration of the government’s commitment to a technology neutral, non-ideological approach to national energy policy”.
“Removing the prohibition will allow the CEFC to support a wider range of low-emissions technologies and thereby reduce emissions at lowest cost,” Frydenberg said on Tuesday.
The government’s move to overhaul the CEFC’s rules comes as industry sources are expecting the looming Finkel review to float a new low-emissions target along the lines John Howard proposed back in 2007. Such a scheme would work in practice as a technology neutral renewable energy target (RET).
The final review of the national electricity market by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, is due to be handed to the Council of Australian Governments on 9 June.
The Turnbull government has boxed itself in by refusing to countenance the scheme the chief scientist, industry and environment groups say would be the best policy option in the national electricity market to reduce emissions at least cost to households and businesses – an emissions intensity trading scheme.
Some elements inside the Coalition are implacably imposed to carbon pricing in any manifestation. A technology neutral RET would give the Turnbull government another policy pathway for emissions reduction.
The CEFC’s investment function is spelled out under its legislation, which says the organisation should invest in the development, commercialisation and use of clean energy technologies.
The CEFC is currently required to invest at least half of its funds in renewable energy technologies, with the remainder left available for low-emission and energy efficiency technologies.
The organisation is currently prohibited from investing in carbon capture and storage and nuclear technologies. Labor has already ruled out supporting any legislative change to the CEFC rules.
In February, Labor’s climate change spokesman, Mark Butler, said the opposition would not be a party to transforming the CEFC into the coal finance corporation.
A key Senate crossbencher, Nick Xenophon, has also expressed concerns about a change that would allow more investment in coal technologies.
Frydenberg told reporters in Canberra on Tuesday carbon capture and storage was “proven technology that should be made to work in Australia.”
He said the amendment being proposed by the government would only apply to carbon capture and storage, not to other forms of coal technology.
But the minister said if anyone proposed a high efficiency, low emission (HELE) coal fired power plant, with carbon capture and storage, “that would absolutely be a project that could be funded.”
“There’s nothing wrong with attaching CCS to a HELE plant of a gas fired generator,” Frydenberg said.
The move to overhaul the CEFC’s rules came as the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, told Tuesday’s party room meeting that government would not adopt emissions trading in its response to the Finkel review.
Industry sources have told Guardian Australia Finkel is more than likely to stick with the implicit endorsement he gave to an emissions intensity trading scheme for the electricity sector in his preliminary report, which was given to state and federal ministers six months ago.
Frydenberg repeated Turnbull’s position on Tuesday, and declined to say whether the government would support a technology neutral RET, if that’s what Finkel recommends next week.
But while stepping around specifics, he said the government was of the view that “something does need to change, and we will consider his recommendations.”
The Greens expressed outrage on Tuesday about the CEFC proposal. “The Liberals are taking money out of renewables and giving it to coal,” said the party’s climate spokesman, Adam Bandt.
“Only the Liberals would think that coal counts as a clean energy source.”
Bandt said even “coal loving Donald Trump” had cut funding for carbon capture and storage.
The Australian Conservation Foundation had a similar view. “Ordering the CEFC to invest in coal technology is like telling the health department to invest in tobacco,” said the ACF chief executive, Kelly O’Shanassy.
“This is a reckless move from a government that is captured by big fossil fuel companies. It doesn’t have any kind of plan for energy and climate policy.”
“There is no such thing as clean coal. This is a massive blow to CEFC, a fantastic initiative that has been helping to create new jobs and tackle carbon pollution.”
But the Minerals Council of Australia welcomed the move. “The Australian coal industry supports the government’s sensible policy which recognises the role of our high quality coal in helping to curb emissions,” said the Greg Evans, the MCA’s executive director, coal.
“If the policy intent is all about reducing emissions we should have a technology neutral approach and that means considering the opportunity coal offers when utilising both high efficiency low emission (HELE) and carbon capture and storage (CCS).”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/may/30/coalition-votes-to-allow-clean-energy-finance-corporation-to-invest-in-carbon-capture

Why does it need a will?
BQEND
Because there is no chemical reason to explain mitosis. If I presume the metabolic process is strictly chemicals doing what chemicals do, then logically the cell should continue to grow forever. However at some point, the cell consciously interrupts the metabolic process and enters into a reproduction process. The process seems entirely too complex not to be orchestrated by decisions. The nuclear membrane dissolves, the centrosomes migrate to opposite sides of the cell in the case of an animal. The whole process seems to be orchestrated by the microtubules, unless I'm wrong about that too.

1. Both 'revolutions' require access to the best land and industrial-scale agriculture with large capital input, thereby forcing out (either financially or by physical force) small producers - check the suicide rate amongst Indian farmers since the widespread introduction of GM crops there.
2. The former relies on crops that are contaminating the original source areas for our main food-producing species: https://www.google.com/?gfe_rd=cr&ei=1Ph9WKSWI8rc8AfWgIa4DQ&gws_rd=cr&fg=1#q=gm+contamination+of+non-gm+maize. The latter relies on the input of massive quantities of pesticides and herbicides and often irrigation schemes, the combination of which has led to the devastation of vast areas of previously-fertile ground. For example, the reason Helmand province became a heroin-producing region was that, in the 1950s/1960s, the land was 'improved' with these techniques until nothing else would grow, the irrigation channels being used by the Taliban as ready-dug infiltration routes.
3. Both 'revolutions' have been plagued with attempts to restrict farmers' independence from agribusiness by making second generation GM/hybrid seeds sterile.

1. it isn't natural
2. it isn't typical
3. it isn't customary (in the words of Hume)
4. and it fits most definitions of a so called miracle
BQSTART
Personally I think I can imagine being religious, but not all the weird details and scripture. That stuff is obvious nonsense, why do you believe that?
BQEND
Everybody has experiences and those experiences are open to interpretation. There is nothing unusual about people writing down their own experiences. In the case of the Bible, it is a collection of writings that occurred over thousands of years and if you are familiar with them, you can see how the Greek philosophers influenced some of the more modern writings. We have to look at the philosophers because logic is a branch of philosophy and science would be no where without logic.
I'm spiritual and to me, being spiritual is a bit different than being religious. I understand things from a Christian background, but I'm not dogmatic to an extent that I would try to argue that the world is 6000 years old or the Jonah got eaten by a fish. However the Messiah came up with some good parables. ""judge not lest ye be judged"" is a belief that many progressives or liberals seem to embrace and yet I would guess that more than half of the progressives consider themselves atheists. In fact many conservatives who wear their Christianity on there sleeves don't believe half of the Messiah's teachings at heart. We all have our our beliefs and they do tend to define us.

What is scientism? from the AAAS. To do with a
Dialogue on Science, Ethics, and Religion.This definition ...
Philosopher Tom Sorell offers a more precise definition: “Scientism is a matter of putting too high a value on natural science in comparison with other branches of learning or culture.” (2) MIT physicist Ian Hutchinson offers a closely related version, but more extreme: “Science, modeled on the natural sciences, is the only source of real knowledge.” (3) The latter two definitions are far more precise and will better help us evaluate scientism’s merit.

I know where my belief starts and my evidence stops. I can't argue my beliefs to a nonbeliever so I don't try. It isn't a question of what I want to argue as much as it is to argue what I can. A bible doesn't prove anything to anybody other than people who presume the Bible is an authority. I can argue my beliefs for hours with a Muslim, Jewish person, Christian or a Jehovah's Witness using a Bible, but I can't argue them with an atheist or pagan with a Bible, so why bother? Religion is something that can't be used to prove other religions are erroneous. However science is something different. Science shouldn't be subjective. One can falsify things to make the science more objective. 
An atheist may claim he doesn't have beliefs, but he is just some nihilist, humanist, or some holder of some other unscientific belief and he won't come out of the closet because he knows deep down inside somewhere that his beliefs can't be proven either. I'm a self proclaimed spiritual person. Some might think of me as a Christian as opposed to a Jehovah's Witness or a protestant as opposed to a Catholic, or a Calvinist as opposed to an Arminian. However I personally gravitate to the truth and therefore find it difficult to participate in any organized religion because when one gets into religion it seems to be more important to adhere to dogmatic beliefs and I don't think that is what spirituality is all about. If I try to impose my dogmatic views on you then all that says about me is that I think my connection to God is better than yours. Spirituality isn't really about doing that.

Look at the evidence and not your beliefs. There is no proof that your experience reflects your reality. It requires a leap of faith to believe that it does. That is just the way it is.

Science is different. One cannot rationally switch off the science. I could assert that the earth is the center of the ""solar"" system and holler til the cows come home about the evidence which suggests that the sun appears to be going around the earth and that is in fact science until we find out otherwise. Then if we indeed find out otherwise then it is no longer science if I continue to believe that way despite evidence to the contrary. It sounds like science because I can see the sun rising in the east and setting in the west on a daily basis. However it isn't science because the preponderance of evidence suggests that it only appears to be that way because the earth is rotating. The science is saying one thing and I continue to believe what seems to be the case, despite the evidence, then my belief is no longer science. Either I am looking at the evidence or I am forcing the evidence to reinforce my belief.
Realism is a belief. There is no other way to describe it. Quantum mechanics doesn't support it. So if you continue to believe in realism and observe quantum mechanical effects, sometimes they don't make sense because there is a problem with your belief.

No, I'm not making that up. Basically, this was Stephens' argument, as the rest was denialist rubbish.
If a ""newspaper of record"" which has just run a campaign that it will be dedicated to the Truth, in an age of fake news, thinks that the science on global warming is this shaky, then we are in a lot of trouble. People simply do not want to listen to us ""alarmists"" and are more than willing to listen to Stephens' rubbish.
BQSTART
Let me put it another way. Claiming total certainty about the science traduces the spirit of science and creates openings for doubt whenever a climate claim proves wrong. Demanding abrupt and expensive changes in public policy raises fair questions about ideological intentions. Censoriously asserting one’s moral superiority and treating skeptics as imbeciles and deplorables wins few converts. 
None of this is to deny climate change or the possible severity of its consequences. But ordinary citizens also have a right to be skeptical of an overweening scientism. They know — as all environmentalists should — that history is littered with the human wreckage of scientific errors married to political power.
BQEND
There was one actual climate change related fact in Stephens' column. He got that wrong, and the newspaper had to run a correction. But the larger issue here is the fact that the NYTimes gave this man one of the most powerful pulpits in the world, from which to spew his nonsense.

Correction: May 1, 2017 An earlier version of this article misstated the area that warmed by 0.85 degrees Celsius as noted in the 2014 Intergovernmental Panel report. It was the globally averaged combined land and ocean surface, not only the Northern Hemisphere.

He ranted about dangerous pollution in the Thames. He debunked the fad of table-turning and blamed the educational system for allowing such nonsense to thrive.
Nearly 200 years later, scientists are still tackling bad thinking and big problems. For Sarah Harper, an Oxford gerontologist who takes the helm proper at the RI on Tuesday, the rise of denialism, fake news and alternative facts, combined with rapid advances in research that raise deep questions for society, mean that a grasp of science, and all its uncertainties, has never seemed more vital.
Harper is only the second woman to be appointed director of the RI in its 218-year history. The first was her Oxford colleague, the neuroscientist Baroness Greenfield, who was made redundant in 2010 after a redevelopment of the Mayfair premises plunged the institution into financial crisis. It was a damaging episode that Harper does not want to dwell on. “Plenty has been written about that,” she said. “I think it’s time for the RI to move on.”
The details of how it will move on are not entirely clear. Harper has begun talks with the institution’s trustees and management team, but wants time to get to know the organisation too. More collaborations with other bodies are on the cards. “I’d hope that by the end of the year, we’ll have a final strategy in place,” she said.
But if the details are uncertain, the direction is not. “Science impacts on people’s lives on a daily basis now. People increasingly need bodies that can provide trusted and open information, and when an issue isn’t black and white, to explain why there’s a debate and guide them through the evidence,” Harper said. “There is a real role for the RI to be a gold standard for scientific evidence.”
That means more than simply stating scientific results. Harper’s vision, in part at least, is for the RI to beef up its provision of information, and have more non-scientists join its debates on the fruits of scientific research. Crucially, she wants to lay bare the scientific process: the complexities of data analysis, and the often ambiguous, even opaque nature of scientific findings.
That will be valuable at all stages of life, she believes. In reproductive medicine, scientific advances have opened a “therapeutic gap”, where doctors can screen babies for disorders in the womb but have no effective treatments to offer. Where does that leave a couple in the first weeks of pregnancy? How should they respond to the uncertainty? “You can’t have a baby nowadays without having to face up to the fact that science can put decisions on to you that you never had to make even 20 or 30 years ago,” she said. 
In Harper’s own field of longevity research, advances in science could raise further dilemmas. Emma Morano, the last person to be born in the 1800s, died this month at the age of 117. Today there are around 14,500 centenarians in the UK alone, but by 2100, than figure is projected to hit one million. “How many will there be if radical scientific interventions to prolong life become the norm?” Harper said. If increases in lifespan outpace those in healthspan, leading more of us to spend our later years sick and disabled, it will raise serious questions about the ethics of the anti-ageing research.
It is not just science that Harper wants the RI to weigh in on. Major issues such as climate change and pollution are more about policy and technology than basic science. Another concern, and one that is likely to grow, is the rise of robots and artificial intelligence in the workplace. Robots are already taking on tasks now done by carers, but are the machines and the care they provide the best option? “We do need a forum where people can discuss, for example, whether we are happy for the market to drive the replacement of human carers by robots. Or whether we as a society feel that there are some jobs that should be retained, at least for the present, by people. There are no right or wrong answers, they are simply questions that should be openly addressed and debated,” she said.
Harper is the first social scientist to become the RI’s director. She studied at Cambridge and Oxford, and worked as a BBC reporter and a producer on Newsnight before returning to academia. Since 2014 she has served on the prime minister’s Council for Science and Technology. Her appointment to the RI from outside the ranks of the chemists and physicists who have often held the post reflects a desire from the institution’s trustees for a different approach. Harper wants the RI to be more inclusive, for science to work with the humanities and arts, the private sector and policy makers, so that the information it provides, and the debates it holds, are delivered in the most rounded context.
“Science is addressing such big global challenges that impact on people’s lives. You’ve got to consider the whole social, ethical, moral and political framing of debates,” she said. “It’s important that the scientist is no longer someone who just sits in a lab. All young scientists should think about public engagement. How will their research impact on the public? Questions that are important to the public should influence the questions they themselves are asking.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/may/01/royal-institutions-new-director-sarah-harper-we-must-show-gold-standard-for-science

Constructing secure compartments with resin inside a grass stem or beetle nest is a neat trick performed by the small-headed resin bee, a tiny insect more familiar with Mediterranean climes, which has now taken up residence in the UK.
We are living in a golden era for species-hunters, if you like your species minuscule and obscure. I recently talked to David Notton, senior curator of Hymenoptera at the Natural History Museum, about the 25 stinging bees and wasps that have arrived in this country since 1978. We usually only hear scary stories about invaders such as the Asian hornet, a lethal predator of honeybees. (When a nest was discovered in Gloucestershire last year, the government quickly moved to exterminate it. We’ll find out this summer if it has succeeded or not.)
But most of these new arrivals are unobtrusive, such as the 5mm-long small-headed resin bee, and positive additions. As Notton points out, bees add to our range of pollinators, enhancing diversity in wild plants and benefiting the crops and fruit upon which we depend.
The European orchard bee was first spotted only a month ago – it is black and bright orange-red, and a pollinator of orchards. What’s not to love? Another new insect is the black bee-fly, an awesome fly with a comic-strip baddie’s scientific name Anthrax anthrax (Greek for “coal”), which recently revealed itself by posing on someone’s bee hotel.
Most obligingly, many new arrivals take up home where we live. Notton discovered the country’s second small-headed resin bee and another newcomer, viper’s bugloss mason bee, at Greenwich peninsula ecology park in London, a brownfield site converted into a nature reserve. Rare invertebrates love brownfield sites, where concrete and poor soil create Mediterranean conditions. These places are also often conveniently located near ports, where many arrivals disembark via a container or a crate.
Some new species bring disease or threaten native fauna or flora but most provide us with a thrilling spectator sport – if we’re looking closely.
Climate change and human globalisation assist most travelling species but many journeys are still mysterious. My favourite newcomer is a slime-covered, basket-shaped fungus which pitched up on a lawn in the Norfolk village of Hethersett this spring. Tony Leech, chairman of the Norfolk and Norwich Naturalists’ Society, initially thought it was the New Zealand basket fungus, previously found in west London – where the spores were presumably accidentally deposited by a human arrival at Heathrow. But the newcomer turns out to be a different species – the Australian basket fungus. How this charismatic-if-potentially-stinky Antipodean reached rural England is anyone’s guess.
David Cameron has acquired a faux-rustic shepherd’s hut, in which he is hoping to write. We can use this news to rant about housing inequities but to be honest I’ve fantasised about scribbling in a garden shack ever since reading Roger Deakin, the Suffolk-based nature writer.
Our former prime minister has a knack for ruining my generation’s objects of desire – the Smiths, Converse, festivals. His latest act of cultural appropriation must mark peak shepherd’s hut. Will huts be like tattoos? Will the next generation survey our mess and wonder, what were they thinking?",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/01/25-new-species-of-stinging-bees-wasps-britain

You spoke of ""people who go cold"" without renewable power because ""the wind doesn't always blow"" but the reality is in southern Australia is that during the cold months of winter, the coldness is largely due to the the cold fronts which come off the Southern Ocean. These cold fronts are accompanied by strong winds which drive wind turbines. Cold clear frosty still nights are very rare and can be covered by hydroelectricity and flexible gas fired turbines.
You also spoke of ""people who go without air conditioning"" without renewable power because ""the sun doesn't shine at night"" but once the sun goes down it's not that hot anymore, so there's no need for air conditioning. It's time to turn off the air conditioner,open the windows and doors, and enjoy that warm summer night.
So renewable energy can stop people getting too hot by providing the power to run air conditioners. In the south, where people need heating to stop themselves getting cold, wind turbines and hydro power do the same job most of the time. On rare still nights during drought times flexible gas fired turbines step in.

Consilience - the predicted and projected changes being confirmed across multiple scientific disciplines observing the multiple aspects of the climate system.
Consensus - agreement amongst scientific researchers from many different academic disciplines that the first two C's are correct, and that no alternate theory can adequately explain this.
AGW is now like plate tectonics, it's an over-arching concept (a paradigm) that frames how science deals with specific phenomena in the behaviour of certain earth systems.
Tens of thousands of pieces of research in geochemistry, palaeontology, oceanography, atmospheric physics, and many more fields of study, have resulted in this overall concept.
Concepts become scientific theories by the accumulation of evidence that can only be explained in one way.
Any other idea would need to explain at least as much evidence in a different way.
Which would include the huge mass of evidence from the geological record.
A scientific paradigm will only change if a new paradigm is found that explains not just the existing evidence but even more new evidence.
That's how paradigm shifts happen in science.
Einstein and Darwin are examples of people who produced paradigm shifts in science.
Others were Dalton's atomic theory, and Mendeleev's periodic table.
A major paradigm shift happened about 50 years ago when geologists drew multiple strands of evidence together to produce the plate tectonic model.
Previous paradigms were dropped, because evidence from earlier geological research, and from this newer research, was interpreted best by plate tectonics.
There is no sign at all of that process happening over AGW, because there is no evidence accumulating that would initiate a paradigm shift.', u'recommendation_count': u'15', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1493793706000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'human activity has like', u'effect': u'global warming'}, {u'cause': u'tens of thousands of pieces of research in geochemistry', u'effect': u'this overall concept'}, {u'cause': u'evidence from earlier geological research from this newer research was interpreted best by plate tectonics', u'effect': u'previous paradigms were dropped'}, {u'cause': u'there is no evidence accumulating that would initiate a paradigm shift', u'effect': u'there is no sign at all of that process happening over agw'}], u'author_id': u'2923581', u'in_reply_to': u'97738002', u'id': u'97754752', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'pinkrobbo', u'text': u'I assume that's meant as a witty quip (giggles), rather than a meaningful point.

Let us not stop to wonder why they think that one can use a non-dimensional index, by definition without a trend, based partly on the straight longitudinal and latitudinal geostrophic wind-fields and sum that up into a cumulative index - before using this as a correction for temperature, that is discrete and implicitly have a trend. 
No, let us instead look at how magical the Cum MEI data are in this study (they are really really magic). 
In figure VI-3 they show the cumulative Solar irradiation anomaly - and compare it with the cumulative MEI. 
Take a look at what the sun is doing. It starts around zero in 1950 - and ends around zero in 2006. 
Take a look now at figure VI-4. 
Suddenly the data from the sun has a trend (the two curves have swapped colours, it is a bit confusing). I kid you not. The sun is now, I am sure to the surprise of the sun itself, starting at zero and ending at five. Cum MEI seems to be the same in the two figures. 
Yes - the step-function based on ENSO has suddenly changed the cumulative Total Solar Irradiation anomaly and imposed a trend on the TSI It is thus ""clear"" that cumulative trends in ENSO has a positive effect on the sun's output. The physics for this is RELATIVELY unclear. But that is what they do before they ""statistically test the two, not any longer very independent data-sets of ENSO and the Sun (and after they had already made degrees of freedom closing in on N=1 by making every measurement after 1900 increasingly dependent on the years measured before it. 
After letting a heavily auto-correlated data-set with no trend borrow slope-values from the ""independent"" heavily auto-correlated data-set, the curves looks more similar. 
Oh - the surprise. 
The physics involved here is quite sensational, cumulative slope of ENSO affect cumulative slope of TSI. 
Then comes the interesting thing. Upward movement of the non-dimensional Cum MEI gives a positive bump to solar activity trend. Similar upward moment of the non-dimensional Cum MEI is giving a negative effect to measured temperature series. 
I have no idea why Cum MEI trends should be added to solar values but must be subtracted from temperature values. Any idea of the rationale behind this is welcomed. 
But, if we follow this logic, this suggests that solar activity is inversely associated with temperature on planet Earth (!)
I am by now more than a little confused. Long before I start wondering how the scaling functions of the non-dimensional MEI is fitted to all the different stuff they fit it to as the ""paper"" moves on. 
A value of cumulative MEI of 3 - how much is that in terms of sea-surface temperature, tropospheric temperature etc? A Cum MEI change of 1 - how many Kelvin is that, and why? 
Why is some temperature ""MEI trend-adjusted"" and other data adjusted for ""changes in MEI
Why is data with 2-steps trend going completely flat after being adjusted with MEI (shown only with a 1-step trend)? The questions are many. Many. 
Any qualified ideas to the magic of why a non-parametric cumulative ENSO-index should have these amazing effects is welcomed.

Burning fossil fuels disrupts the long-term carbon cycle.
The geological record contains evidence of previous events which disrupted the long-term carbon cycle, they appear in the geochemical record as negative carbon isotope excursions.
These ancient fast-warming events are called hyperthermals.
The rate of CO2 output is now faster than the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, which was a hyperthermal event.

There used to be subtropical forests near the poles 50 million years ago, and that doesn’t sound so bad. 
But the fossil record closer to the equator is really poor, and that may be an indication that life was extremely stressed during these warm periods.
If over half the surface area of the planet becomes inhospitable, it will not render Earth uninhabitable, but it will be unrecognizable and existentially challenging for the majority of the people, species and communities on Earth.
BQEND
Another example of a hyperthermal event is the End-Permian event, around 250 million years ago.
Researchers have found fly ash, one of the products of coal combustion, in rocks laid down around the time of this extinction event:
http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v4/n2/abs/ngeo1069.html
A large amount of coal had been burned over a period of tens of thousands of years.
The coal was burned by volcanic eruptions that happened in Siberia, which produced a large area of volcanic rocks called the Siberian Traps.
The burning actually happened underground, with the carbon dioxide and ash mixing with magma.
This produced vast amounts of CO2 which warmed the Earth and changed the chemistry of the oceans:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25859043
Humans, of course, are more efficient..... in a couple of centuries, far more fossil fuels have been burned than happened in thousands of years during the Siberian Traps eruptions.
The End-Permian event caused the extinction of 92% of species.
Biodiversity took 10 million years to recover.

That’s because Pruitt doesn’t want to challenge EPA’s carbon pollution endangerment finding – he thinks it would be a lost cause. A group of contrarian scientists released a white paper trying to pressure him to attack the finding anyway.
Briefly, the endangerment finding stemmed from a 2007 Supreme Court decision in which 12 states sued the EPA, calling on the agency to regulate carbon pollution under the Clean Air Act. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of those states, ordering EPA to determine if greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health and welfare. After considering the scientific evidence, including the latest IPCC report, national climate science assessments, etc., the EPA issued its endangerment finding correctly concluding that carbon pollution clearly endangers public health and welfare via its climate change impacts. As a result, the EPA is legally required to regulate carbon pollution.
The Obama EPA followed that legal requirement by crafting the Clean Power Plan. Early in his presidency, Trump signed an anti-climate executive order calling on EPA to review and revise the Clean Power Plan. In effect, it’s currently on hold. However, that review process takes years, and in 2020 the next president’s EPA could make the carbon pollution regulations even more aggressive. As long as the endangerment finding is in place, there is a legal requirement for the EPA to regulate carbon pollution. 
Fossil fuel-loving deniers thus hate the endangerment finding. The problem is that it’s based on overwhelming scientific evidence. As attorney general of Oklahoma, Pruitt frequently sued the EPA and lost nearly every time, so he knows a losing case when he sees one.
Baseball fan Pruitt lost 6 of 7 lawsuits against the EPA. That would be a mediocre .142 batting average.
The judicial system evaluates all available scientific evidence and listens to scientific experts. That’s why climate deniers keep losing in court, and Pruitt doesn’t want to waste his time on another sure loser. But the endangerment finding is so important, many deniers think trying to take it down is worth a shot.
Enter a white paper published by a number of contrarian scientists, including a few of the less than 3% of climate scientists who reject or minimize human-caused global warming. The white paper tries to make the case that the EPA endangerment finding is wrong. Not surprisingly, aside from being poorly written, the arguments in the white paper are astonishingly bad.
The white paper focuses on what its authors call the “tropical hot spot” (THS), which refers to the fact that as a result of global warming, scientists expect to see a particularly hot area in the lower atmosphere above the Earth’s tropics. As the white paper describes it:
Stated simply, first, the THS is claimed to be a fingerprint or signature of atmospheric and Global Average Surface Temperatures warming caused by increasing GHG/CO2 concentrations.
Nearly a decade ago, current NASA Goddard director Gavin Schmidt provided this figure showing a climate model simulation with that hot spot signature:
But there’s one big problem. In that simulation, the hot spot resulted from a 2% increase in solar activity. As Schmidt said in 2007:
the pattern really has nothing to do with greenhouse gas changes, but is a more fundamental response to warming (however caused). Indeed, there is a clear physical reason why this is the case – the increase in water vapour as surface air temperature rises causes a change in the moist-adiabatic lapse rate (the decrease of temperature with height) such that the surface to mid-tropospheric gradient decreases with increasing temperature (i.e. it warms faster aloft). This is something seen in many observations and over many timescales, and is not something unique to climate models.
So the fundamental claim in the white paper that the hot spot is a fingerprint of human-caused global warming is entirely false, as climate scientists (and my colleagues and I) have been pointing out for a decade. That basic error by itself is enough to toss the denier paper into the recycle bin, but it gets even worse, claiming:
The assumption of the existence of a “Tropical Hot Spot (THS)” is critical to all Three Lines of Evidence in EPA’s GHG/CO2 Endangerment Finding.
I encourage everyone to read the EPA endangerment finding technical support document. The document does discuss some of the many actual fingerprints of human-caused global warming that scientists have observed, but its only mention of the tropical hot spot is to note that it may or may not represent one inconsistency between models and observations:
Fingerprint studies have identified GHG and sulfate aerosol signals in observed surface temperature records, a stratospheric ozone depletion signal in stratospheric temperatures, and the combined effects of these forcing agents in the vertical structure of atmospheric temperature changes (Karl et al., 2006). Karl et al. (2009) state that more recent studies have also found human fingerprints in the patterns of change in Arctic and Antarctic temperatures. However, an important inconsistency may have been identified in the tropics. In the tropics, most observational data sets show more warming at the surface than in the troposphere, while almost all model simulations have larger warming aloft than at the surface (Karl et al., 2006). Karl et al. (2009) state that when uncertainties in models and observations are properly accounted for, newer observational data sets are in agreement with climate model results.
As noted at the end of that quote, the latest research finds evidence that the hot spot is there, but measuring temperature profiles in the atmosphere is a challenge. 
To summarize:
White paper claim #1: The endangerment finding depends on the existence of the hot spot. 
Verdict: False. The document only briefly mentions the hot spot.
White paper claim#2: The hot spot is a key fingerprint of human-caused global warming. 
Verdict: False. According to atmospheric physics, the hot spot should result from global warming, regardless of its cause.
White paper claim #3: The hot spot doesn’t exist. 
Verdict: False. It probably does exist, although it’s difficult to measure.
In short, the best case this group of contrarian scientists could make against the endangerment finding is a physically-incorrect strawman that ignores the latest research, as well as 99.9% of the scientific evidence summarized in the endangerment finding.

Such a temperature spike would have dire consequences for the health of city-dwellers, rob companies and industries of able workers, and put pressure on already strained natural resources such as water.
The projection is based on the worst-case scenario assumption that emissions of greenhouse gases continue to rise throughout the 21st century.
The top quarter of most populated cities, in this scenario, could see temperatures rise 7C or more by century’s end, said a study in the journal Nature Climate Change. 
For some nearly 5C of the total would be attributed to average global warming.
The rest would be due to the so-called “urban heat island” effect, which occurs when parks, dams and lakes, which have a cooling effect, are replaced by concrete and asphalt – making cities warmer than their surrounds, the researchers said.
“The top 5% [of cities by population] could see increases in temperatures of about 8C and larger,” study co-author Francisco Estrada of the Institute for Environmental Studies in the Netherlands said.
Estrada and a team used different projections of average planetary warming, combined with the UHI effect and potential harms, to estimate the future costs of warming on cities.
The median city, right in the middle of the range, stands to lose between 1.4% and 1.7% of GDP per year by 2050 and between 2.3% and 5.6% by 2100, they conclude.
“For the worst-off city, losses could reach up to 10.9% of GDP by 2100,” wrote the team.
UHI “significantly” increased city temperatures and economic losses from global warming, they added.
This meant that local actions to reduce UHI – such as planting more trees or cooling roofs and pavements – could make a big difference in limiting warming and minimising costs.
Cities cover only about 1% of earth’s surface but produce about 80% of gross world product and account for around 78% of energy consumed worldwide, say the researchers.
They produce more than 60% of global carbon dioxide emissions from burning coal, oil and gas for fuel.
The world’s nations agreed in Paris in 2015 to the goal of limiting average global warming to two degrees centigrade over pre-industrial revolution levels by curbing greenhouse gas levels in the Earth’s atmosphere.

You still haven't found anything. It's well known that temperatures fluctuate from year to year. For instance El Niño's and La Nina's exchange heat between the air and ocean. That can explain differences over several years but if something was not changing the energy balance over a longer period the temperature would remain around the same. It's also well known that temperatures change because of changes in forcing such as orbital cycles and solar radiation but that doesn't prove that is happening to any significant amount now. What I'm looking for is a natural explanation for the rise of temperatures since pre industrial times, around IC of warming. What caused it and approximately how much? Saying temperatures have changed in the past or from year to year proves nothing. 
Again temperatures have increased around 1C since pre industrial times. How much of that is natural and what natural forcing affected that change.

The current climate is no longer the optimum but it is still closer than where we are heading.

When GOP and Bush pulled out of Kyoto - it was a blow. 
The whole construct of Paris is very different - it is much more ""bottom up"" driven. When the ""top-dog"" now pulls out - it will mobilise the fundament. When Donald wades into G7 - the toppest of dogs - he even manage to unify G---let us say 5. When Donald push his way to the front of a NATO-image it makes Europe take him seriously - maybe Europe should take defence under a regional, rather than trans-Atlantic system. 
So whereas Kyoto and 2001 call for Article 5 under US GOP-regime was what they were - 2017 is different. 
We can handle Trump trying to make coal great again. Also because we have other big players now. EU is more self-aware. China has changed their tactics - like a lot - they are growing into leadership role being new. India is slowly getting there. Africa as enitiy is slowly gathering momentum. 
Some hopeful nations included in Kyoto has trended towards more bonkers, of course. Brazil is more or less lost at time being. Turkey and Indonesia are both moving in weird directions along with the US. But smaller nations around the big regional hubs are picking up both in SE Asia and southern America. 
The foundation of how Paris got ratified is much more important than what Paris promise. 
This bother some big nations. Such as Indonesia and Russia and Brazil (it is worth to remember that Mexico soon will match Russia on population) and that EU is about 4 times the population of the two latter - with a substantially better economy. 
What I am pointing at here is that during Kyoto it was ""big"" defining and discussing for the ""small"". Paris is upside down. It is a lot of ""smalls"" defining for the ""bigs"". The idea of ""ownership"" of ""paris"" is much stronger. 
So we look at the ""big"" behaving erratic - in this collective. 
I should really have read more about the structure of the two deals. Personally I think it is a very interesting shift in how a global treaty is given ""life and identity"". 
I know for sure that US not signing will not matter. If Australia, Indonesia, Brazil and Russia did not sign - it is irrelevant. This ""ownership"" is a big change happening over the last 20 years since the Kyoto Protocol was signed from pressure ""top-down"". 
This is how I think Paris was important. Not from the targets set (they give us 3+ degrees and disaster ""as is"") - but from it being much more resilient in terms of future. 
Any global deal on anything in the future will be marked by Paris. Kyoto was how deals where made in the past. 
That is the success of Paris. Not the targets - but how it got there. When Donald say ""no Paris"" we will collectively giggle. When Bush said no it was bad.

And the Paris Agreement—the strongest ever signal pointing toward transformational infrastructure investment—is the only way to mobilize the capital necessary to get to that big win.
The common misunderstanding about the Paris accord is its impact on business and investment. Opponents fret about costs and economic change, but achieving the Paris Agreement’s goals will unlock capital investment at a rate no other policy initiative can match.
Here’s why:
Having overseen major building projects in his business career, President Trump has said the cost benefits of energy efficiency are clear to him. Energy efficient infrastructure will not only mobilize capital and add to GDP; it will activate major new property investment opportunities, create a new kind of flexible property market, and revitalize credit and banking.
The global policy arena for climate-smart finance goes by the short-hand “unlocking the trillions.” Imagine tens of trillions of dollars currently not creating any jobs becoming active, moving through a resurgent economy, and funding a sustained expansion of local hiring.
Twenty-two Republican senators recently signed a letter urging withdrawal from Paris Agreement, citing aim to avoid “significant litigation.” The litigation argument may backfire, because their letter appears to recognize the legitimacy of the federal lawsuit brought by young people against the government for insufficient action to address climate change. It is also worth noting that every one of these senators’ states will fare better if the Paris Agreement succeeds.
No one understands the boom-and-bust cycle of extractive industries better than the people whose communities did the extraction, and then saw the industry leave. In Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Wyoming, you can visit isolated coal communities that have had zero GDP within city limits since the coal industry closed up shop and left.
All economies evolve. Economies designed not to—single-function economies—struggle more than others as the world speeds ahead with the adoption of new technologies and business models. Coal communities’ economic problems weren’t created by the Paris Agreement and related policy initiatives, but they can be solved by them.
The power of the Paris Agreement is twofold:
It offers maximum overall benefit with minimum national or local economic risk. It aims to awaken that sleeping investment capital and shift every nation’s economic growth strategy toward the logic of American entrepreneurial innovation.
For extraction-focused communities, the right policy response means the ability to capture investment for other kinds of economic activity. Some may go to new energy-sourcing technologies and entrepreneurship, others may become known as cultural or agricultural hotspots.
A simple fee on carbon fuels, with a 100% dividend to all households, would allow people living in coal communities to use increased month-to-month income to generate entirely new Main Street economies, with new businesses and new jobs, based on local needs, talents, and priorities. A coal industry executive once told me: 
Those carbon dividends are the first economic survival strategy I have ever heard of for the communities I have lived and worked in my entire life.
With China, India, and the EU all moving toward record investments in clean energy and high-efficiency construction, transport and industrial production, withdrawal from the Paris Agreement risks making the US into an economic backwater. Withdrawal would effectively deprive American businesses and communities of the most efficient ways to boost investment, hiring, innovation, and return on investment.
There is no pathway to energy sovereignty that does not go through fulfilling and exceeding our Paris Agreement commitments. The moment is now; the leaders of this new economy are already racing ahead.
If President Trump wants to win on infrastructure, defy expectations, boost the US economy for generations, and stand tall atop the world stage, he should publicly endorse the Paris Agreement and announce a major national effort to rapidly overhaul American infrastructure, while building the carbon-efficient economy of the future. He will find he has more support for that than for anything he has tried so far.

At this critical moment, the Guardian has expanded its environment desk, adding three heavyweight reporters to its continent-spanning, award-winning team to bolster our coverage in the US and around the world.
“The environment barely exists as a political issue in many developed countries, and there are climate change deniers in the White House,” the Guardian’s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, wrote in a recent email to staff announcing the appointments. “There has never been a greater need for serious and innovative environmental journalism.”
In the US, we’ll continue to aggressively cover the Trump administration’s ties to the fossil fuel industry and attacks on science. We’ll tackle issues of environmental justice, and the impact of climate change and pollution on the nation’s most vulnerable communities. Just today we launched Life on the Keystone XL, a three-part series documenting our reporter’s 1,700-mile journey along the proposed pipeline route to meet the people and communities who will be affected should the construction go ahead.
We’ll also explore solutions and opportunities to the climate change crisis, such as innovative technology, renewable energy and green growth.
As part of the new appointments, the Guardian’s Jonathan Watts will take up the role of global environment editor in a few months’ time. Below, he shares his thoughts on why, after 21 years reporting for the Guardian from Tokyo, Beijing and Rio de Janeiro, he believes this is the most important story on the planet right now.

The environment has always been a subject close to my heart and it has become an increasing focus of my work over two decades with the Guardian. That is no doubt because the problems of climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution and over-consumption have become bigger and more apparent.
When I started out as a cub reporter in Japan in the mid-1990s, I learned a lot collaborating with Paul Brown, then the environment correspondent, on articles about the Tokaimura nuclear accident and Kyoto climate protocol. After moving to China in 2003, I increasingly found myself writing about smog, cancer villages, species extinction and carbon emissions. The ramping up of environmental stories was not a deliberate strategy. China’s crisis was so bad that it was impossible to ignore. This made for grim news, but it also made me hopeful that it might be a fulcrum for change. 
After the Olympics in 2008, I switched jobs to become Asia environment correspondent. In this post, I covered the Copenhagen Climate Conference with John Vidal and Suzanne Goldenberg; the Nagoya biodiversity conference; the Fukushima tsunami and nuclear disaster; and the rapid growth of wind and solar power in the deserts of China. For the past five years, I have been the Guardian’s Latin America correspondent, writing on a broader range of subjects but still putting a priority on environment and development, including Amazon deforestation, killings of conservation activists, the role of indigenous communities in forest protection and the disturbing frequency of forest fires, floods and other extreme weather events.
So why am I going back into full-time, specialised environmental reporting? Because it is the most important story of our age. China led me to suspect that global economic growth had run into an ecological wall, which is the underlying source of stress and conflict in the world. When I moved to Latin America, I hoped to find alternative, less destructive paths of development, but there was a part of me that also felt I was running away from my own conclusions. The new post will take me back.
The responsibility is huge. The timing is crucial. The Brexit referendum was a vote against globalisation. Trump is waging war on the environment. To counter these trends, the Guardian has devoted more resources to its environment coverage. I am looking forward to being a part of an expanded team, but we have a tough act to follow. Brown, Vidal, George Monbiot, Damian Carrington and other present and former colleagues have been pioneers in this field with agenda-setting coverage and comment. Trying to maintain that quality, ambition and influence – while looking for new approaches to changing situations – will be a hard but worthwhile task.
As to the task that humanity faces, I think the problem and the solution are environmental. The world’s current concerns – rising nationalism, swelling migration, financial instability, worsening inequality and lack of confidence in governance systems – are to varying degrees caused by insecurity and fear about the future. Underlying that is an awareness (conscious or unconscious) that our current path of capital- and carbon-driven development is wrecking our home planet, running down resources, devastating other species and building up environmental costs that are increasingly difficult to offload on distant countries and coming generations. We have to pay a bill that has been run up over centuries and it feels as if we are broke. But that is misleading. There is still plenty left if we manage it well and share it more fairly.
We need to reconsider what is important, what is worth paying for and how decisions are being made. At a national level, why are we devoting so much public money to subsidise fossil fuels that are destroying the climate? Why are most politics determined by four-, five- or six-year electoral cycles that suit the markets but not the long-term interests of voters? Why do our economic systems make it cheaper to dump plastic in the oceans than recycle? Why do the traditional beliefs of some countries encourage the slaughter of endangered animals or denial of climate science? Why are forests worth less than cropland? Why do we continue to prioritise material growth when it increasingly leads to obesity, cancer, conflict and instability?
The key, I think, is to realise that, contrary to what Bill Clinton’s election strategist once maintained, it’s not “the economy, stupid!” – it is in fact the environment that is shaping everything. Which is to say that we must put our home in order before we can consider anything else. That is tough. Currently, political systems are skewed against the environment and the subject is hidden away in a media ghetto. It is a depressing page on a news website or an unpopular slot on TV channels. Most of us would prefer to pretend it didn’t exist. Yet, for me the environment is not a subject, it is the prism through which everything else must be seen. It is the basis for the economy, for science, for society, for politics. Adam Smith, Albert Einstein, Karl Marx and Mao Zedong never understood this. Nor did the founders of the great religions. They didn’t need to. They did not live in the Anthropocene.
So, how to put the environment front and centre is the big challenge. Following my predecessors, I will continue to visit the frontline of humankind’s impact on the natural world – the oceans, forests, mountains, deserts, poles, science labs, conference halls and affected communities – where I will continue to bear witness and record testimonies of change. But they are just symptoms. I hope I can also work with and encourage my colleagues on other news desks to consider the environment in their coverage of politics, social change, economics, psychology, art, religion and education. Those areas, close to home, perhaps inside our heads, are where we will find the cause and the cure. It’s time to colonise the colonisers.
We are all entering disconcerting new territory. Given demographic, economic and consumerist trends, the next 30 years will be difficult. But there is more than enough new knowledge and technology, as well as old philosophy and religion, to make things much better. It is all about choices and action.

I’m not a great believer in conspiracy theories but, given how hard Canavan and the National Party luminaries are running on this issue, I smell a rat.

So, whilst everyone’s attention is directed towards Adani, is Gina sitting quietly on the sideline waiting for a chance to pounce? Let us not forget that Gina did just that when acquiring the Kidman cattle empire with a Chinese partner. And of course she is very well connected with Barnaby and the National Party and Canavan is the Minister responsible for administering the 5 billion dollar Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (NAIF).
Last weekend Canavan was promoting a coal-fired power station for north Queensland. Putting this madness in perspective one only needs to recall that a month or so back the ex-pollie Clive Palmer indicated that he was applying to the NIAF for funding to build a coal-fired power station using Galilee basin coal. And it just happens that Clive holds two of the coal leases in the Galilee basin through his company Waratah Coal. Further, just last weekend Canavan was also suggesting that a coal-fired power station in North Queensland could save Clive’s Townsville Nickel Refinery. Now, none of this can be just a coincidence.

“This stinks to high heaven,” the resources minister told the ABC in response to the bank’s new policy to limit lending for new thermal coal projects to “existing coal-producing basins”.
“You’ve got a situation where the Newcastle port has been actively campaigning against the development of the Galilee basin because in their view it hurt their interests to have other competing coal basins.
“And you had a situation a few days later with Westpac saying we shouldn’t develop the Galilee for climate change reasons but at the same time not disclosing their financial interest in the Newcastle port.”
Hastings, a fully owned subsidiary of Westpac, manages investments for the Infrastructure Fund (TIF) and other funds. This includes the Newcastle port, which is part owned by TIF, and ships coal for mines in the Hunter Valley. 
Canavan said as the funds manager for “half of the owners of the Newcastle ports” Westpac had a financial interest in the Newcastle port doing well. 
“At the very least you would have thought they would have disclosed those relationships at the same time as they were making direct comments on the development of a competing coal basin,” Canavan said.
The minister also attacked the bank’s chief executive officer, Brian Hartzer, accusing the “bank of New South Wales” (as it was known until 1982) of having no understanding of the Galilee basin, the home of Adani’s planned $16bn coalmine. 
“It’s clear to me at least at the high levels of the bank of NSW they really have no understanding of the Galilee basin and I’m not criticising the fact they don’t but then don’t go and make comments about it when you are not fully informed,” Canavan said. 
As an enthusiastic supporter of the Adani mine, Canavan has led a sustained campaign against Australia’s second largest bank since it released its updated climate change policy which limits lending to existing coal areas and only for coal over a certain quality. 
While Westpac did not mention Adani in its policy, these two conditions effectively ensured the Adani’s Carmichael mine was ruled out. 
Canavan immediately criticised Westpac and urged Queenslanders to boycott the bank, even though he has a Westpac account. Canavan, a Queensland senator, has also supported Adani’s application for a $1bn government loan.
Canavan said Westpac had made no commercial assessment of the Adani project but it was illogical to rule out coal basins in north Queensland, some of which would be higher quality coal than product from the Hunter Valley.
“I’ve got no criticism of institutions seeking to establish good climate change credentials,” he said. “The criticism I have is of the illogicality of Westpac’s position – and now it seems some conflicts they have, they have not properly disclosed.”
Westpac set a limit for coal of a quality of 6,300 kilocalories per kg or above as the threshold for investing in new coalmines. Canavan said even though three mines in the Galilee basin would be above that limit, Wespac would not fund them “just because those are in north Queensland”.
“Now that would be worse for the environment, worse for climate change because you would be denying finance to coal mines of a higher coal energy specification,” he said.
Westpac released its original climate change policy in 2008 and its latest update was released after consultations with Ernst and Young and Climateworks, an independent not-for-profit organisation whose founding partners include Monash University and the Myer Foundation. 
In a statement Westpac said Hastings was a fund manager, not an owner, of the Newcastle port.
It pointed out both TIF and Newcastle ports had their own boards and governance arrangements and TIF also had an interest in a number of airports in north Queensland.
“It is important to note Westpac provides finance facilities to 400 large businesses in north Queensland,” a spokesman said. “This includes four coalmines, five coal ports and three LNG facilities.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/03/resources-minister-steps-up-extraordinary-westpac-attack-over-adani-coalmine

Xenophon told Guardian Australia on Tuesday night the government should, instead of rewriting the rules of its so-called “green” bank, just knuckle down and deliver an emissions intensity trading scheme for Australia’s electricity sector.
Allowing electricity generators to engage in a form of carbon trading, the senator said, would deliver policy certainty, and “deal with the investment drought”.
Before the introduction of government legislation amending the CEFC’s investment rules to federal parliament on Wednesday, Labor is also signalling it won’t support the measure.
The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, responded to the government’s announcement on Tuesday that it would allow the CEFC to invest in carbon capture and storage declaring: “You’ve got to be kidding.”
You've got to be kidding.https://t.co/YGLT3q4cq7
The shadow cabinet is yet to deliberate formally on the government proposal but the shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, issued a statement on Tuesday night saying the proposal was “nothing more than the latest stunt from a government unable to effectively deal with the energy crisis under its watch”.
The Greens are also opposed to the change.
If Xenophon’s concerns hold, the government will not, on current indications, have the numbers to get the proposal through the Senate.
The government has on numerous occasions flatly ruled out introducing an emissions intensity trading scheme for the electricity sector, even though a range of groups champion the policy as an effective mechanism for reducing emissions at the least cost to households and businesses.
The chief scientist, Alan Finkel, is expected to use his looming review of the national electricity market, which will be handed to the Council of Australian Governments next week, to maintain his implicit endorsement of a trading scheme, while proposing other reform options.
After the government confirmed its long-telegraphed intention to overhaul the CEFC’s investment rules on Tuesday, the organisation issued a statement saying amendments to legislation were “a matter for the parliament”.
“As a government agency, the CEFC has always complied with the act, and will continue to do so,” the statement said.
The CEFC said carbon capture and storage could be used in the power sector and “the industrial sector to capture emissions from chemical processes, as well as fugitive emissions”.
“There are some industrial processes for which there are currently very few alternatives to reducing emissions, making CCS an important technology if these sectors are to achieve deep cuts in emissions,” the CEFC’s statement said.
The government’s proposal was welcomed by the mining giant BHP. “Energy markets need to be both fuel- and technology-neutral, and not artificially favour one type of technology over another,” a company spokesman said.
“Policy should focus on providing clear emissions reduction goals and system stability requirements. It would then be up to industry to determine the most effective and least cost means of achieving these goals.
“While we expect further reduction in the cost of generation for new technologies such as solar PV, wind, power storage and CCS, secure and reliable power at the lowest possible cost while remaining consistent with emissions targets is likely to be provided by a mix of technologies.”
Energy Networks Australia also argued a technology-neutral approach was important in energy policy. “Australia’s economy is inherently carbon intense and it needs all viable technology options on the table to achieve deep decarbonisation in line with the Paris aspiration of zero net emissions by the second half of the century,” said the ENA’s chief executive, John Bradley.
“CCS has the potential to support long-term carbon abatement in major industries with significant carbon emissions, like metal manufacturing, fertilisers and advanced manufacturing,” he said.
Bradley said CCS technologies were not “pro-coal”. “They are just one of the potential tools that could help Australia to efficiently achieve carbon abatement at scale, while maintaining energy security and affordability.”
But the Climate Council’s chief executive, Amanda McKenzie, said diverting renewable energy funds to coal projects would be “costly, will increase emissions, and exacerbate climate change”.
“It is truly bizarre to use funds earmarked for clean energy to prop up polluting coal,” McKenzie said.
“The CEFC is a highly professional independent body investing in renewable energy and generating a return for taxpayers.

Speaking in Sydney on Tuesday night, the veteran politician and former Republican party presidential candidate said climate change was undeniably real and that it was incumbent upon world leaders to act now to halt and reverse global warming.
“I think that climate change is real. I think that one of the great tragedies of our lives is the Great Barrier Reef dying [and] the environmental consequences of that,” he said.
The position of the world’s second-largest carbon emitter on the Paris climate change agreement is uncertain and a subject of global speculation. US commitment to reducing emissions or otherwise could have significant ramifications for other countries upholding their promised reductions.
Donald Trump has said he will announce this week whether the US will uphold the Paris carbon reduction commitments it agreed to in 2015, under his predecessor Barack Obama.
McCain said he wanted to see America remain in the Paris accord. “I would like to see us ... either accept the agreements as were made by the Obama administration or suggest modifications which would make it palatable for us and acceptable to us to join.
“If we don’t address this issue, I am very much afraid about what the world is going to look like for our children and grandchildren.”
Climate change caused unprecedented back-to-back mass bleaching events in 2016 and 2017 on the Great Barrier Reef, killing almost half of its coral.
The federal and Queensland’s governments’ two-year-old plan to protect the reef until 2050 is reportedly already redundant because the impacts of climate change are far more severe than predicted.
Recent surveys have found bleaching is significantly worse than predicted, with more than 70% of shallow-water coral north of Port Douglas killed last year.
McCain was in Australia as a guest of the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney. In a wide-ranging speech he conceded that the Trump administration was mired in scandal, but urged America’s allies to stand by the US as it navigated troubled times.
He said America’s reputation had suffered in the early months of Trump’s presidency as scandals over ties to Russia, nepotism, FBI investigations and foundering relations with other world leaders have rocked the administration with crippling consistency.
“We are going through a rough period,” McCain said. “We really are, and for me to tell you that we aren’t, politically, is not fair. But we’ve gone through other troubled times. I can remember Watergate scandal and how it brought down a president. I’m not suggesting that’s going to happen to this president, but we are in a scandal, and every few drops another shoe drops from this centipede, and we’ve got to get through that.”
McCain said observers of the US must look beyond the president.
“Our foreign friends always tend to focus on the person in the White House. But America is far bigger than that. America is our courts of justice. America is our state and local governments. America is our Congress.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/may/30/john-mccain-urges-action-on-great-barrier-reef-and-paris-climate-deal

Many challenge the GISS dataset, as the level of warming from 1880 to 2000 shown by NASA has risen from around 0.5 in 2001 to about 1.2 deg C in 2015, more than doubling the claimed rate of warming.

Hadley was a lawyer and an amateur meteorologist. Climate science was not a discipline then.

a) CO2 is a greenhouse gasb) Humans are emitting CO2 from burning fossil fuelsc) Man is contributing to the warming of the Earth we have seen since around 1850d) Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity is in the range 1.5-4.5 deg C per IPCC AR5
It is also possible not to believe that this phenomenon is dangerous and not to believe things like the Paris Climate Agreement are the right policy responses to any alleged problem.
Indeed, if climate sensitivity is at the low end, spending trillions on mitigation (solar and wind energy) is the wrong response, and it would be better to spend on adaptation measures (e.g. flood defences, irrigation) instead.
Let's start with the Hansen paper of 1988:
https://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/1988/1988_Hansen_ha02700w.pdf 
Figure 3, shows a forecast of a surface temperature rise of c. 1.1 deg C from 1980 to 2016 under scenario A. Scenario A assumed 1.5% per year annual increase in greenhouse gases. 
Plate 4 and section 5.2.3 predicts even faster warming of the troposphere, particularly the tropical troposphere. Indeed, the troposphere warming is cited as an 'useful diagnostic' for the greenhouse effect.
Now to what happened.
1) Greenhouse gas emissions have been even higher than predicted under scenario A (1.5% compound per annum). The global carbon budget shows 1.85% annual increase in CO2 emissions from 1980 to 2015.
http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/16/data.htm 
1980 CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and cement were 5.30Gt and in 2015 they were 9.90Gt.
2) According to Wood For Trees, surface temperatures have risen by about 0.9 deg C (Giss), from 1980 to 2016 (see link below point 3), but have since fallen as the El Nino effect dissipates. Many challenge the GISS dataset, as the level of warming from 1880 to 2000 shown by NASA has risen from around 0.5 in 2001 to about 1.2 deg C in 2015, more than doubling the claimed rate of warming.

2015: https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs_v3/Fig.A.gif 
3) Troposphere temperatures have risen about 0.4 deg C for the same period. That is to say, much less than the Hansen prediction and crucially much less than the surface data.
http://woodfortrees.org/graph/gistemp-dts/from:1979.1/offset:-0.32/mean:12/plot/rss/from:1979.1/mean:12/plot/gistemp-dts/from:1979.1/offset:-0.32/trend/plot/rss/from:1979.1/trend 
At the same time, estimates of Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) to CO2 doubling have fallen to about 1.7 deg C. This is (just) within the IPCC range of 1.5-4.5 deg C, but interestingly quite a bit below the alleged danger limit of 2 deg C.
https://climateaudit.org/2015/04/13/pitfalls-in-climate-sensitivity-estimation-part-2/http://joannenova.com.au/2015/06/shrinking-climate-sensitivity-estimates/ 
There’s even a 2016 paper by Ray Bates that suggests ECS is only 1 deg C, which means there is no forcing over and above the CO2 only impact.

http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015EA000154/epdf 
In conclusion, Hansen's forecast was wrong. He predicted far more warming than has actually occurred. Crucially, the troposphere has warmed much less than the surface, so the prediction about the troposphere being a useful diagnostic for the greenhouse effect has been proven wrong.
Ergo, the greenhouse effect has been over-stated. Moreover, spending trillions to reduce CO2 emissions is probably the wrong solution to global warming. If far more of the warming is natural than we thought, then it would be better to spend on adaptation, since that will also help with CO2 induced warming.', u'recommendation_count': u'3', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1493919309000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'4663018', u'id': u'97877280', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Semorel', u'text': u'This is by far the worst post I have seen on this topic.

The trees they are burning have just drawn down atmospheric CO2 through photosynthesis: there is no net impact on atmospheric CO2. Compare this with burning coal whose carbon has been sequestered for tens of millions of years.

3) The law of unintended consequences applies, so things like the 'dash for diesel' cars has pushed up NOx and particulate emissions, causing thousands of deaths from pulmonary diseases

For forcing by greenhouse gases (GHGs) only, we show that there is a greater than 90 % probability that the expected warming over 1950–2005 is larger than the total amount (not just “most”) of the observed warming. 
This is because, following current best estimates, negative aerosol forcing has substantially offset the GHG-induced warming.

So all the recent warming is related to greenhouse gases from human activity.

I think you are making assumptions about people's motives here. I also don't think you have an accurate view of the history. It didn't become an issue until Al Gore's movie, up until that point, it was science as usual. After that, it because a political issue that was far less concerned about the science.
""As rocky points out, BEST were touted as 'experts' till they concluded that AGW was real and serious, then they stopped being 'experts' somehow! And the anti argument changed from 'our experts are better', to 'all experts are wrong'.""
I am sure that some people did do exactly that. Not everyone did. And like most of the points that the pro-AGW crowd puts forth, this has nothing to do with the science.
""Most of the anti funding has been done secretly, or just campaigning after secretly knowing that AGW is real (such as Exxon).""
If it was secret funding, how do you know about it? You mean secret as in you don't know who funded it. I don't really see that as a problem. Science is science, it doesn't matter who funds it. The theories and experiments can be tested by others.
""The Koch brothers have funded large amounts of 'astro-turfing' campaigns, which are fake grass roots campaigns against RE developments/deployments.""
Besides this having nothing to do with the science, this also very much appears to be an opinion.
""Personally I don't even understand your question, as there shouldn't be pro or anti funding, just science funding.""
This isn't really my question. This is a response to the pro-AGW group claiming that all skeptics are funded by the big nasty oil companies.
""If I go out and spend money on a big sign for my front garden saying ""AGW is real"", and you buy one saying the opposite, it doesn't actually change any of the facts nor science.""
Exactly, so why do the pro-AGW people keep trying to use the funding of scientists to discredit the scientist? I think the answer is that they are not interested in the truth, only in being right.
""Afterall, going back to the video, regardless of our personal answers to 'Do owls exist?' the facts surrounding the existence of owls will remain unchanged.""

Your ""do nothing"" approach is leading to 1000 ppm fast.

For forcing by greenhouse gases (GHGs) only, we show that there is a greater than 90 % probability that the expected warming over 1950–2005 is larger than the total amount (not just “most”) of the observed warming. 
This is because, following current best estimates, negative aerosol forcing has substantially offset the GHG-induced warming.

So all the recent warming is related to greenhouse gases from human activity.

This is what I said.
BQSTART
Also when I say climate change denial, I refer to the whole gamut of denial. From outright deniers, to those who claim to accept the science, but who then prevaricate and procrastinate on taking action to address the causes of climate change.
BQEND
The typification of climate change denial is very simple. At some point in their argument, the climate change denier will claim there is no need to address the causes of climate change i.e. to reduce our fossil fuel burning, and reduce carbon emissions because:
1) Climate change is not real, or a fabrication.
2) Climate change is exaggerated.
3) The causes of climate change are uncertain.
4) That climate change is natural so we can't do anything about it.
5) That climate change will be good for us.
6) That fossil fuel use is essential.
Whatever, it always comes down to not reducing our burning of fossil fuels and reducing carbon emissions in the time frame necessary. It is classical circular argument where climate change deniers start of with their conclusion i.e. that there is no need to reduce carbon emissions, cut back on the burning of fossil fuels, and then they retro-fit whatever nonsense or dishonest argument they are using to fit their conclusion. They do this by cherry picking, multiple logical fallacies, logical leaps i.e. non-sequiturs. However, what no climate change denier will every do is to address the full spectrum of evidence for anthropogenic climate change being caused by the burning of fossil fuels, and CO2 emissions.
Whereas those properly arguing the case based on scientific evidence will acknowledge all the evidence, regardless of whether it fully supports the general point they are making. Predatory climate change deniers try to take advantage of this dishonesty by purely focusing on uncertainties, and the way those honestly arguing the science do not exaggerate like they do.

The renowned astronomer Edmond Halley (1656-1742) now entered the debate and suggested as the main mechanism the diurnal displacement from east to west of the sun’s heating in the tropical belt. The deviation of the trade winds from straight east was due to the meridional flow of dense air toward the latitude of maximal radiative heating9 . In subsequent discussions Robert Hooke (1635-1703) invoked the centrifugal force of the earth’s rotation to explain the equatorward component of the trade winds. By this the debate ended, Halley and Hooke became occupied with other matters and no new ideas came forward for almost half a century.

I'm not sure that's right. Some of them are creationists. If you can believe something like that (especially the 'earth is 6000-years-old' variant), then a bit of climate-change denial is a mere bagatelle.

Since then, it’s been the subject of constant myths, misinformation, and denial. In fact, last year we teamed up with the authors of six other consensus papers, showing that with a variety of different approaches, we all found the expert consensus on human-caused global warming is 90–100%.
Most of the critiques of our paper claim the consensus is somehow below 97%. For example, in a recent congressional hearing, Lamar Smith (R-TX) claimed we had gone wrong by only considering “a small sample of a small sample” of climate studies, and when estimated his preferred way, it’s less than 1%. But in a paper published last year, James Powell argued that the expert consensus actually higher – well over 99%.
We thus had three quite different estimates of the expert consensus on human-caused global warming: less than 1%, 97%, or 99.99%. So which is right?
Yesterday, the Bulletin of Science, Technology &amp; Society published our response to Powell, led by Andy Skuce. To determine who’s right, we turned our sights on the theory of plate tectonics.
In his critique of our study, Powell argued that on scientific theories as settled as human-caused global warming or plate tectonics, scientists don’t bother to state the obvious. In our 97% paper, we examined how many studies endorsed, rejected or minimized, or took no position on human-caused global warming. 
In his study, Powell only looked at papers explicitly rejecting the human cause; he assumed that the rest endorsed the consensus. And, he argued, applying our approach to another settled scientific theory like plate tectonics wouldn’t yield any results, because Powell assumed no scientist would bother to state something so obvious. If our approach weren’t valid for plate tectonics, Powell argued that it wouldn’t be valid for global warming either.
So we tested our approach by looking at 331 papers from the journals Geology and the Journal of the Geological Society, checking whether they endorsed, rejected, or took no position on the theory of plate tectonics. Using our method, we found 29% of the papers’ abstracts included language that implicitly endorsed the theory of plate tectonics, while the rest took no position. In short, of the papers taking a position, we found 100% consensus on plate tectonics in our sample of the peer-reviewed literature. Our method worked.
Using Powell’s method of only looking for explicit rejections of the theory, the consensus on plate tectonics is also 100%. However, in our survey of the climate literature, we found 2–3% of papers that implicitly rejected or minimized human-caused global warming or were uncertain about the causes. By assuming that those papers that don’t explicitly reject the theory endorse it, Powell overestimated the climate consensus.
‘Minimized’ is a key word in the approach of our 97% consensus paper. A common myth, articulated by Lamar Smith and in the video below by Washington State Senator and newly appointed EPA bureaucrat Doug Ericksen, claims that studies that attribute any amount of global warming to human activities are included in the 97%.
In reality, if a paper said humans are responsible for less than half of global warming since 1950, we put it in the category of the less than 3% of papers rejecting or minimizing human-caused global warming. 
The latest IPCC report, which summarizes our best current scientific understanding, said with over 95% confidence that humans are responsible for most of the global warming since 1950, and most likely responsible for all of it. While it’s not safe to assume that a paper that doesn’t explicitly reject this consensus must be endorsing it – as Powell did – it is safe to assume that a paper endorsing human-caused global warming also endorses the IPCC position unless it says otherwise.
Lamar Smith also referenced a common denier argument that consensus should be measured by comparing the number of papers explicitly endorsing the theory to the total number of papers examined. By that measure, 0 out of 331 geology papers endorsed the theory, meaning the consensus is 0% and clearly plate tectonics is a hoax.
Ultimately those are our three options in defining the climate “consensus.” Either every paper that doesn’t explicitly reject human-caused global warming is part of the 99.9% consensus, or 97% of papers taking a position on the cause of global warming are part of the consensus endorsing the theory, or climate science and plate tectonics are both hoaxes.
It’s most accurate to say that 97% of relevant peer-reviewed studies agree that humans are causing global warming, 99.9% of climate papers don’t reject that theory, and those who deny the overwhelming consensus are peddling misinformation.
The title of our paper asked, “Does it matter if the consensus on anthropogenic global warming is 97% or 99.99%?” Either way, the public dramatically underestimates the level of expert consensus. When asked how many climate scientists agree that humans are causing global warming, the average answer is between half and two-thirds – a far cry from the 97% reality. Just 12% of Americans realize the consensus is higher than 90%.
We call this discrepancy the “consensus gap,” and it’s important because the expert consensus is a “gateway belief.” When people are aware of the consensus, they’re more likely to accept the scientific reality of human-caused global warming, and to support policies to tackle the problem. Right now, most people consider climate change a low priority because they think scientists are still divided on what’s causing global warming. 
In reality that question was settled decades ago, but a fossil fuel-funded misinformation campaign combined with false balance in the media have created this misperception of a divided scientific community. Thus it really doesn’t matter if the expert consensus is 97% or 99.99% – the vast majority of Americans don’t even realize it’s above 90%. That’s in large part because so many Republican Party leaders like Lamar Smith – who rely on campaign funding from the fossil fuel industry – put so much effort into sowing doubt about the expert consensus. As Republican strategist Frank Luntz wrote nearly 20 years ago:
Voters believe that there is no consensus about global warming within the scientific community. Should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled, their views about global warming will change accordingly. Therefore, you need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate.
That means the rest of us need to make communicating the 97% consensus as widely as possible a priority to move “the debate” past consensus denial.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/may/03/is-the-climate-consensus-97-999-or-is-plate-tectonics-a-hoax

Increasingly this is a region in the grip of extended droughts and annual heatwaves associated with record-breaking temperatures that scientists say will only get worse with climate change.
Catastrophic electricity system failures are exacerbated by heat-triggered thunderstorms and regional outages resulting from the air-conditioning-related energy demand spikes that are common in India. In July 2012 power failed for 600 million people in northern India in the biggest blackout in history.
It is rather surprising that business continuity planners allow their clients to relocate energy and water-hungry operations to such climate-challenged regions. British Airways’ Indian HQ is located in a tall glass tower with no opening windows in the New Delhi satellite city of Gurgaon. Once the limited backup power supplies are exhausted in such buildings they have to be evacuated.
One simple solution is to design buildings very differently with sensibly sized and shaded opening windows, powered by solar energy. Another is to onshore electricity-hungry operations back to cooler Britain. I expect the business continuity community are re-evaluating their “future-proofing” strategies as I write. Possibly too late in many cases. We made these points in our 2009 book on Adapting Buildings and Cities for Climate Change, but people tend not to take action till the catastrophe happens to them.

• Our modern world is dangerously exposed by this reliance on the internet and new technology. First of all we had the NHS hacking problems, which were entirely foreseeable. Whitehall has made us all rely on IT far too much when it is not reliable. Even massive quantities of tax-gathering are done this way. Now BA is effectively grounded during one of the busiest weekends of the year because of overreliance on modern technology. There are just enough old-time civil servants left alive and in service to turn back the clock and take away our dangerous dependence on modern technology.

The UN secretary general, António Guterres, warned on Tuesday that if Donald Trump withdraws from the Paris climate agreement, there could be negative economic, security and societal consequences for the US.
Guterres issued the warning after calling on world leaders to adhere to the agreement in his first major speech on climate change as secretary general.
His remarks at New York University came as the world waits for Donald Trump to announce whether the country will continue to uphold the Paris deal, which nearly 200 countries signed as a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
In a question-and-answer session after the speech, a student asked how the US can address climate change when its president has threatened to back out of the Paris accord. 
“If someone leaves a void, I guarantee someone will fill it,” said Guterres, who went on to explain what consequences such an exit could have for the US. “Today, the economy and social aspects are linked to the environmental aspects, but they are also linked to the security aspects, they are linked to the risks of conflict.”
He continued: “if you leave a void to others to occupy, you might be creating a problem to your own internal security.”
Guterres said that if the US does withdraw from the agreement, it is important that American cities, states and businesses remain engaged with the goals the deal outlined.
Trump’s threat has concerned leaders around the world, but Guterres, who became secretary-general on 1 January, has said the accord is not dependent on the US government’s participation.
The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, said Tuesday that Trump “wants a fair deal for the American people”, adding that Trump was spending a “great deal of time” considering the agreement.
Trump said on Saturday that he would announce this week whether the US would adhere to the Paris agreement after resisting pressure to announce the plans at the G7 summit. The other G7 countries – Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Canada and Japan – reaffirmed their support for the accord last week.
The landmark agreement was signed in December 2015 and has been ratified by 147 countries, including the US.
To underline the importance of the agreement, and other UN climate goals, Guterres spoke broadly about the threats climate change poses to the world, saying “the world is in a mess” because countries and communities everywhere are facing pressures such as overpopulation, water scarcity and food insecurity.
He warned that “climate change is a multiplier of many other threats” including poverty, displacement and conflict, and that the people hit “first and worst” by climate change are the poor, vulnerable and marginalized.
“It’s absolutely essential that the world implements the Paris agreement and that we fulfill that duty with increased ambition,” he said.
Guterres said addressing climate change was an economic necessity and highlighted the threat climate change posed to national security, noting that more than 24 million people in 118 countries were displaced by natural disasters in 2016, which is three times as many people as were displaced by conflict. 
Guterres, the former Portuguese prime minister, also announced that there would be a UN climate summit in 2019. 
His comments on the US were consistent with statements he has made since replacing Ban Ki-moon as secretary general this year. 
“Even if some national governments backtrack in commitments, the combined impacts of sub-national authorities, businesses and civil society will create an unstoppable momentum,” Guterres said at a climate change meeting at the UN headquarters in New York in March.
Last week, Guterres told the BBC the agreement would “not collapse” if the US backed out. “I think it is very important that the American government stays engaged, but this is not the end of the world,” he said. 
Guterres did not specifically mention Donald Trump in the speech, but said his “door is open to all who wish to discuss the way forward, even those who might hold divergent perspectives”.
He said each month, countries were moving to translate the Paris agreement into national plans. 
“Yes, not everyone will move at the same pace or with equal vigor,” Guterres said. “But if any government doubts the global will and need for this accord, that is reason for all others to unite even stronger and stay the course.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/30/paris-climate-deal-un-us-donald-trump

They go and study the poor, to find ways how to make them richer. That is noble, i do not doubt the good intention, but the approach is wrong. You need to study the rich, to find out how they got rich, and then use these methods to get the poor richer.Obviously the rich got rich by illegal, brutal means, by exploitation, robbery, guns, gun-boats and establishing a little powerful circle that in an oligarchic manner conrols governments. None of that are measures that any politically correct scientist or activist would recommend, but if they one evening have a weak moment and drop their naivity, they would agree - and could easily verify this idea by looking in history books - that this is how it works.The rich are rich because the poor are poor. There is a direct relationship between those two sates of being. So the only way to make the poor richer, is to make the rich poorer.Unfortunately the rich have walls and guards who make sure, the poor do not get to their riches. Be that as individuals in their mansions surrounded by walls, or be that countries who firewall themselves with tariffs, to keep imports from poorer countries out, thus denying them any chance to sell their produce or products, keeping them forever poor.It is a power struggle, not a technical problem. The author might look into that and analyse the situation utilising social theories about power. She will learn a lot then, understand a lot and probably quit development studies, because those are just another way to reinforce the current system.A practical example. Coffee. It only grows in the higher regions of the tropical belt around the equator. It can only grow there. For a kilo of coffee beans in Kenya the farmer gets 12 cents. A kilo of roasted, ground coffee in a supermarket costs 6-10 Euros. Quite a difference. A huge difference. Roasting and grounding and vacuum packing coffee is not high-tech. It could be done regionally in Kenya, Costa Rica or Java. It could be turned into the final product and shipped from there. That would even contribute to getting the CO2 footprint of coffee down since tightly packed roasted coffee taes up much less space and much more could be shipped on one ship that way.There is just one problem. With current tarrifs in place, be that in the EU or US, such proceesed, ready to sell coffee, if imported would cost something like 20-30 Euros per kilo in the shops. Unsellable. Importing the beans is for free. So the jobs and most of the profit for making coffee is made here. Not there. Now, if you manage to change that tariff regime, a lot of jobs in the coffee-growing regions could be created in roasting, grinding, packing, even marketing the coffee and much more money would remain right there. So there is the task. Change that tariff regime and you create tenthousands of jobs and much hgher revenues in the countries who need it. You also contribute to save the world from climate change. And that is just one example. Coffee. Such a simple thing. We could talk about cocoa beans, too. And chocolate. That is even more evil. Invovles childlabour, too.And since this is a British website: Tea is not much better. The women doing the harvest in Sri Lanka on Sir Thomas Lipton's tea esate get $3 per 20KG of tealeaves they collect. How much do you pay for 100gr in the supermarket? Exactely, do the maths. Careful though. You will probably cough and spit the tea against the wall when you realise what is going on. Yebo, somebody is getting really really filthy rich here.

“Well, it’s the study of how to help poor countries become richer,” I would explain of my choice to study international development.
“Oh that’s very good,” my friends and family would invariably reply, my obvious altruism shining through. (Cough.)
And that’s where it would end. The next part of the conversation about macroeconomics and international trade policy is rarely the stuff of great chit chat or dinner conversation outside of our specific professional bubble. 
So what does international development really mean? And why is my organisation now dropping it from our name, changing it to Thousand Currents?
Making people richer by promoting economic growth has been the assumption at the centre of international aid and philanthropy since it began. Early modernist theory taught us that if “traditional” societies could be helped to develop in the same manner as more “developed” countries, there would be prosperity for everyone. 
But this ignored the colonial roots of the sector and the inequities that existed in so-called rich countries. Today, more and more people are recognising that neoliberal models of development belie the ecological realities of the earth’s capacity, as well as basic human rights.
In 1985, when the founders of my organisation came together with like-minded people – those who wanted to build on local wisdom and create an alternative to top-down development – the name International Development Exchange (Idex) seemed right. The organisation strove to ignite cultural exchange and also change how US citizens related to the global south. They were not united around raising GDP, but around improving people’s economic opportunities, working conditions, health, education, and overall wellbeing.
Since I finished graduate school and since Idex began its work over 30 years ago, the international development field has changed. It is now a loaded term, carrying the weight of parachuted-in “expertise” and resources perhaps best described by Ross Coggin’s 1976 poem, The Development Set:
We bring in consultants whose circumlocution
 Raises difficulties for every solution –
 Thus guaranteeing continued good eating
 By showing the need for another meeting.
I was focused on HIV as my career began. The premise was that more information would result in changed behaviour. I was trained to be a technical expert, flying across oceans to share my knowledge with villagers about how to develop a project budget and obtain funding. Wouldn’t well-planned projects deliver just that? I quickly realised that my fancy education did not teach me about crucial contextual knowledge that creates space for dialogue, critical thinking, collective decision-making, mobilising networks, and holding powerful external actors accountable. 
The limitations of thinking of development purely from a western-defined, economic growth-fuelled perspective are hard to ignore. Neoliberal development policies and approaches have resulted in economic, social, and environmental failures. Our global food system is broken, dominated by corporate-driven agricultural policies that push out small-scale farmers. The world’s richest 1% now have more wealth than the rest of the world combined. Unchecked natural resource consumption has led to a climate crisis that threatens our planet and our collective futures.
And that is why last year, after 30 years, Idex decided to change its name.
We wanted a powerful concept from the natural world to express the positive, transformational changes emanating from women, young people, and indigenous leadership in the global south. Though we suffer setbacks – such as the jailing of Stella Nyanzi in Uganda, the death of Sheila Abdus-Salaam in New York City, or the murder of natural resources defenders in Honduras – grassroots organisations and movements on all continents are bucking the “old school” paradigm of development.
What hasn’t changed in 30 years is that the people living and working closest to these problems are the source of the solutions. Currents, like visionary grassroots leaders and locally-led solutions, have force and direction and are part of a moving, interdependent global picture.
Today, Thousand Currents is focused on addressing our shared global challenges, not just the issues faced by a marginalised community or a poor country. That requires new approaches from donors in acknowledgement of this complexity – unrestricted financial support, multi-year timeframes, and new skills and personnel that reflect the world we want to see.
We dropped “international development” from our name, because when small, yet formidable pockets of people power come together, that’s when Thousand Currents sees results.
Old notions of development no longer serve us, and neither do rote bureaucratic responses to our urgent problems. We must move faster, think more creatively, build stronger relationships, and engender more effective collective action.
Currents affect every single person on the planet every single day. And all of us – donors, grassroots activists, UN employees – are currents of change.

While 52% of British people voted to leave the EU, 84% want the ban on hunting foxes to stay, according to the latest Ipsos Mori data. In addition, 88% support the ban on deer-hunting, and 91% back the ban on hunting hares. Support for the ban among people in the countryside is at similar levels.
Ipsos Mori projections indicate that there is a clear majority in favour of the ban in every constituency in England and Wales, including that of all party leaders, and that voters view more favourably those candidates who support the ban by a margin of more than seven to one over those who want it repealed.
We call on all party leaders not only to rule out any repeal, weakening or substitution of the Hunting Act but also to support its strengthening and enforcement.
The Hunting Act is one of the most popular pieces of legislation on the statute book today. We’re asking party leaders to send a clear, unambiguous message at this election that they fully intend to preserve Britain’s great natural heritage, and ensure that cruelty to animals in the name of “sport” remains firmly in the past.Eduardo Goncalves Chief executive, League Against Cruel Sports, Jeremy Cooper Chief executive, RSPCA, Anne Brummer CEO, Save Me Trust, Philip Mansbridge Director, IFAW-UK, Bill Oddie President, League Against Cruel Sports, Dr Brian May Founder, Save Me Trust, Chris Packham, Sir Ranulph Fiennes, Peter Egan
• If there is one issue that should be at the heart of this election, it is climate change. When we next choose a government (in 2022), it’s likely that global temperature will have risen 1.5C. That’s the level that nations (including the UK) pledged at Paris in 2015 should not be breached to avoid dangerous climate change.
At current rates of burning coal, gas and oil, we are on track to put enough carbon in the atmosphere in the next five years to push us past that temperature increase.
But it’s not inevitable. Rapidly increasing our efforts to reduce emissions – from homes, businesses and transport – and installing more renewable energy give us a fighting chance. To build support, politicians must spell out the consequences of not taking the decisive action urgently required on climate change and introduce policies that will drive that action.
Greens have long campaigned for warmer and more efficient homes, renewable energy, public transport, and better provision for cycling – measures that reduce emissions and are cheaper for society in the long term.
I urge voters to find out where the other parties’ candidates stand on climate change and press them to commit to increased action. Because, whatever government we have and however hard or soft Brexit is, the challenge of climate change will still be with us.Robert PalgraveHereford Green party
• There are three reasons the government is reluctant to publish its clean air plan (Report, 28 April). First, it will demonstrate that Defra has prioritised the interests of car manufacturers over the public good for the past five years. Second, the proposals are likely to be deficient and will be heavily criticised pre-election. Third, it will highlight the dangers of Brexit: for without the EU air quality directive, there are no legally binding standards to protect the public from the harmful effects of air pollution.Dr Robin Russell-Jones(Former chair, Campaign for Lead-Free Air), Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire
• Deborah Orr has made the connection between NO2 emissions and hay fever: “The presence of NO2 also triggers allergic reactions to pollen” (Children can’t play if they can’t breathe, 29 April). Increased instances of hay fever, asthma and respiratory problems (especially in urban areas) are an unintended consequence of tree planting programmes, which are done for all the right reasons. But local authority planners and urban designers are not considering allergy and asthma when selecting tree species.
For example: the male catkins of birch may be a delight to see, but they emit copious, almost invisible, airborne pollen, which is a particularly potent trigger of hay fever, asthma and several common food allergies (pollen-food syndrome). The beautiful bark, relatively low purchase and maintenance cost and foliage that is pretty efficient at capturing carbon are positive features, but there are plenty of non-allergenic alternatives that could do the same job of mopping up carbon and releasing oxygen for the benefit of all.
The cost of ignoring allergens is poor respiratory health, days absent from school or work, and individuals suffering due to persistent over-exposure to noxious fumes and particulates and increasingly high pollen counts.
When there are alternatives, the idea of “simply not letting the kids play outside when air pollution is particularly bad” doesn’t really work. Children, when they go to and from school, collect pollen in their airways, hair and clothing, which they then bring home. Neither school nor home is a pollen-free sanctuary. The necessary policies include selecting the right trees and plants for highways and public spaces, alongside actions to cut the NO2 and particulate pollution that is primarily driven by diesel.Jackie HeraldLondon
• Bart Elmore is right that “Coca-Cola should have known better” (Report, 2 May). In 2016, along a two-mile stretch of a minor road in my home parish, volunteers cleared up 850 recyclable drinks containers, of which 25% were Coca-Cola-branded items. During January-April 2017, the same stretch of road has yielded 334 recyclable drinks containers (a 15% increase), of which 26% were Coca-Cola brands.

Ah, another null hypothesis argument.
Sorry, AGW is falsifiable at every step off the way.
For example:- CO2 is demonstrably a GHG, and this experiment can be carried out in any secondary school lab, and was established back in the 1850's. So plenty of scope for falsifying this claim.
- The build up off CO2 in the atmosphere is from anthropogenic origins. Again falsifiable by tracking the sources of the CO2. Oh wait, its been traced back via isotope anaylsis to the burning of fossil fuels.
- The result is Global Warming. Again falsifiable by either showing warming is NOT happening, is not Global, or that the results of AGW are overwhelmed by natural causes/events. Once again the research shows, it is a global phenomenon, the basic data in all aspects of the climate system shows warming over relevant scientific and statistical periods, and its not from natural drivers.
At each stage, it should be possible to show that all these premises are wrong, and that the null hypothesis applies.
After decades of research all normal scientists have reached the same conclusion via Consilience of Evidence(TM) that AGW is happening. 
At no point during the last century have the deniers demonstrated the null hypothesis applies to any of these premises.

""suddenly decide to enter the oceans"" - it didn't.
The oceans have always absorbed over 90% of the energy imbalance.
This is not news to science, it is obvious from basic thermodynamics.
It only requires a very small change in the rate of ocean warming to cause a large change in the rate of atmospheric warming, because the oceans have a much higher heat capacity than the atmosphere.

My question was what exact moment did climate 'scientists' decide to take into account ocean temperature in their public assessment of global for the first time ?
BQEND
It was text book knowledge back in the 1960's that the climate system comprised of more than the atmosphere, and included the following:- atmosphere- biosphere- cryosphere- geosphere- hydrosphere.
BQSTART
Was it when they realised air temperatures hadn't increased in more than 15 years ?
BQEND
Incorrect.Nice try at insinuation.
Firstly, there hasn't been a pause in the rate of increase in atmospheric warming.
Secondly, 15 years is neither statistically or scientifically long enough to determine meaningful climate trend.

No there was not a pause or hiatus in climatic terms.
Firstly, science moves on, so past papers may no longer be relevant in the light of revised data, information or knowledge.
Secondly, the analysis was of a short term event in a single aspect of the climate system.
As is text book knowledge, climate is measured over 30+ years, and the climate system consists of more than just the atmosphere.
Any change over a shorter period in only one component of the climate system is due to internal variables, also a text book piece of knowledge. 
Studying the internal variables is of scientific merit, as they may in some cases impact the long term climate trends, give us a better insight in to the climate system as a whole, and enable us to better understand the variation from the long term trends which in turn would allow us to incorporate them in to the GCMs and overall scientific understanding.
Thirdly, in the light of revised statistics, the slowdown, hiatus pause or whatever, was not statistically significant, and there fore a statistically irrelevant outcome for a scientifically irrelevant period of a single component of the atmosphere, is not worth the headline of a pause.

When you suspect a warming Earth caused by a massive energy imbalance in turn caused by the changed composition of heat trapping gasses in our atmosphere, and this warming is not measured in the then present ways of measuring, a logical thing to do would be to look where that heat could have gone.

Oh really? Why not actually look at the evidence? You don't say when you imagine the 'pause' started, but the above article mentioned ""after 1997"" and most folk mention 1998, so let us use that. Then, if we find the trend from the beginning (1979) of the satellite lower troposphere temperature series to 1998, and compare it with the trend from 1979 to the present, then we should expect the latter to be lower than the former. Agreed? After all, if you were transported back to 1998 and asked what would happen to the overall trend if there was a pause in warming, that is what you would predict.

The concept of AGW is a scientific paradigm, like plate tectonics or evolution.
The concept that global warming is being caused by human activity has - like other scientific paradigms - :
....... coherence - consilience - and - consensus ......
Coherence - a theory that coherently explains the multiple observed lines of empirical evidence across multiple aspects of the climate system.
Consilience - the predicted and projected changes being confirmed across multiple scientific disciplines observing the multiple aspects of the climate system.
Consensus - agreement amongst scientific researchers from many different academic disciplines that the first two C's are correct, and that no alternate theory can adequately explain this.
AGW is now very like plate tectonics, it's an over-arching concept (a paradigm) that frames how science deals with specific phenomena in the behaviour of certain earth systems.
Tens of thousands of pieces of research in geochemistry, palaeontology, oceanography, atmospheric physics, and many more fields of study, have resulted in this overall concept.
Concepts become scientific theories by the accumulation of evidence that can only be explained in one way.

Then to use it you simply want to input the x-value ( time in years for this conversation if you want to use months put it in as a decimal) and the y value temperature anomaly.
It is easiest to format this by copying the GISS link

into a basic text editor then copying from here into a spreadsheet.

Add in 1996-2016 and we get 0.0183C / yr

If the hypothesis implies a prediction which is refuted by an experiment that is definite proof the hypothesis is false
BQEND
I think you are thoroughly confused about what the climate models are doing and how they work, and obfuscating with pseudo-science references to hypotheses.
There is no scientific hypothesis that the average surface temperature will hit a given level at any particular point in time as predicted by a model. There is therefore no prediction that can be falsifiable here, so your trite dismissal of the models as 'defective' or 'deficient' is based on a false understanding.
The climate models are built on many hundreds of individual scientific hypotheses with varying degrees of certainty, built on top of dozens of rock-solid theories of physics, chemistry and thermodynamics. They are run on huge computers with known limits and compromises in their programming and with datasets that are charitably described as 'incomplete'. As such they have always had margins of error and wide statistical uncertainty on their outcomes.
As we continue to gather information and confirm or falsify the individual hypotheses within the models we can improve the models, and reduce the statistical uncertainty a little, but it can never be eliminated.
To give you a simple analogy. I have a camping stove and I wish to invite some friends over for some tea. I'm not sure how long it will take to boil the water because I'm on an exposed site and the wind is gusting at variable speed. I have no idea what the exact ambient temperature is, the water I fetched from the river is simply 'cold' and the heat output of my stove varies a lot with ambient temperature, but I have no way of measuring it.
Now I know for certain that my stove will boil the water in 10 minutes +/- 30 seconds at home, at 20 degC ambient, in still air with tap water at 10 degC, because that's based on rock-solid physics, chemistry, thermodynamics and experience. Butane + oxygen = heat + CO2 + H2O after all, and the thermal losses in the system are pretty consistent in such an environment.
To answer the ""how quickly will tea be ready"" question, I've built a simple model in my head with some variables in. The hypotheses in my model include:
1. wind gusts will reduce my stove output2. cold river water will take longer to boil than my tap water3. low ambient temperatures will reduce my stove output
I stick my finger in the water, hold it up in the wind and stick a jumper on because it's f**king cold and shout to my friends it will take about 20 minutes for tea to arrive, but it could be a couple of minutes either side of that.
In the end it's ready in 17 minutes, because the wind dropped and I found a way to shield the stove a bit. So a bit quicker than even the quickest of my estimates, but still a lot slower than at home.
Did my failure to predict accurately the arrival of the tea negate any of my hypotheses about the effects of the environment? Did it nullify any of the theories that burning butane below a pan of water would heat it up?
Of course it didn't.

The slower rise in temperatures from 1998 to 2012 has repeatedly been cited by climate sceptics as a sign that the climate is less sensitive to greenhouse gases than previously thought – or even that global warming has stopped. The latest study rejects this view, suggesting that there was ultimately no meaningful deviation between what climate models predicted and what was observed.
Iselin Medhaug, who led the work at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, said: “In the beginning there seemed to be some sort of discrepancy and some people concluded we can’t use these models for anything. That isn’t true.”
The analysis also aims to reconcile a series of seemingly contradictory findings on whether the so-called pause even took place. At times this has created the perception that scientists disagree on the basics of what the data show – let alone what is projected to happen in the future.
The new paper, which takes a retrospective look at data and model predictions covering the early 2000s, suggests that this has been largely a false controversy caused by competing research groups applying different criteria for what a “pause” constitutes – how much levelling off and for how long – to a variety of datasets.
“They’ve used different definitions and different time periods,” said Medhaug. “It sounds very controversial, but when you compare like with like it’s not as controversial as it might seem.”
None of the air surface temperature datasets shows a negative trend lasting more than five years, for instance, but the Met Office’s HadCRUT4 dataset, which combines air and sea surface temperatures, shows a negative trend for the 12 years following 2001. All the major datasets show 15-year periods starting after 1997 where warming was, at the very least, slower than the previous 60 years. 
The paper, published in Nature, said that this short-term slowdown could be mostly accounted for by known climate phenomena.
These include the higher than average wind-speeds over the Pacific Ocean during the hiatus, which meant that although heat was still being deposited into the world’s largest ocean, this was not reflected in measurements taken at the surface.
“The heat is still there, it’s just stuck underneath,” said Medhaug.
Weaker solar radiation during the period may also have played a role and the cooling effect of small volcanic eruptions – which were particularly frequent during the early 2000s – had also been underestimated.
Prof Piers Forster, a climate scientist at the University of Leeds, described the paper as a “great comprehensive summary”, but said the question of whether long-term projections had changed remained open. “There is other work that shows the cool east Pacific that occurred during the hiatus reduced the climate sensitivity and this might affect longer-term trends,” he said.
Unusually for a scientific paper, the authors delve into the social and political drivers of a controversy that continues to linger, despite 2015 and 2016 being the two warmest years on record. 
“In a time coinciding with high-level political negotiations on preventing climate change, sceptical media and politicians were using the apparent lack of warming to downplay the importance of climate change,” the paper states. “But a few years of additional data are unlikely to overturn the vast body of evidence that supports anthropogenic climate change.”
Forster argues that scientists may also have set themselves up for a fall. “In the early 2000s some scientists were talking about accelerating global warming and either for simplicity, or forgetting to, we did not mention that share prices can go down as well as up,” he said. He added that he was worried by the fanfare around the release of annual global temperature figures by the Met Office and others, which may have shifted attention onto the short-term trend.
Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State University, said that the latest paper would contain few “bombshells” for those working in the field. 
“Models and observations are consistent in terms of long-term warming, and that this warming – and recent extreme warmth – can only be explained by anthropogenic activity, namely the burning of fossil fuels,” he said. “The fact that there is substantial internal variability that can mask this warming on decadal and multi-decadal timescales is also something established by us in previous work.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/may/03/global-warming-hiatus-doesnt-change-long-term-climate-predictions-study

BQEND
You seem to be clueless about the meaning of a scientific consensus.
It has nothing to do with democracy of any sort, and everything to do with one position amassing an overwhelming amount of evidence and logic in its favor, so much so that no proposed alternative comes close to explaining as much as well.
There is a mathematical consensus that there there is no largest prime number. That is not because of democracy but because we have a proof.

You also seem to be convinced that the science relies heavily on computer models. On the contrary, the science of climate change relies primarily on the coming together of multiple lines of evidence from different sources (and the fact that no other explanation is remotely consistent with all of the evidence). This excellent video does a great job of pulling together most of the evidence in a concise way:

Well the NYT has had to issue a correction to the only reference Stephens made to temperature data. The quote he made from Andy Revkin was a quote mine because Revkin went on to say that those minimising the risk of climate change were the most dishonest and when Revkin was asked what he thought about being quoted by Stephens he said...

BQSTART
When I asked Revkin how it felt to be cited in Stephens’ piece, he told me to look at a 2004 study on uncertainty that includes this quote:  Uncertainty is the reason for acting in the near term, and that uncertainty cannot be used as a justification for doing nothing. Stephens does not seem to understand this. He also fails to point out what is being passed off as fact or who is doing it.

One also wishes that the Guardian would take to heart the Times' rigorous separation of reporting and comment. 
In Stephens, it has hired someone to write opinion pieces. He is doing that. His opinions on many matters will not be the same as many of the readers. That's life. We do not all agree.
His view of the state of climate science is not that of the largely ignorant Guardian columnists on that subject. Is this 'denying science'? No, its taking a different view from you of what the field has proven, what is doubtful, what it has failed to prove.
One can only suggest the writer get some books and read them. The useful books will be on the history and philosophy of science.
I would suggest also reading 'Sapiens', which makes what will seem to the author the astonishing point that the thing that has motivated modern science and its discoveries is the eager confession of ignorance, not the assertion of certainty.
It is a sense of ignorance that propels science forwards. I know, this seems paradoxical and incomprehensible. Its because you don't understand.

Here’s a little of what he’s written there: “….neither scientists nor the public could be sure in the 1970s whether the world was warming or cooling.”There we have it.

I dispute that. You also confuse the issue of global cooling/warming with that of northern hemispheric cooling/warming. To be clear, the cooling referred to was mainly confined to the northern hemisphere. And here's what Reid Bryson- to whom I’ve already referred- had to say in a 1976 interview, in response to a question about the rapid Arctic cooling that has recently been discovered: ""......Actually the amounts of both particulate matter and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are increasing. It's just that the cooling effect caused by the first is increasing faster than the warming effect caused by the second. And, as a result, the Arctic has gotten colder.""Bryson had been referred to as a ""prophet of climatic doom"".http://www.motherearthnews.com/nature-and-environment/reid-bryson-zmaz76mazrawBryson again: “A completely wild card got shuffled into the deck back about 1930 or so, when the Industrial Revolution became a worldwide phenomenon and we began spewing both man-created particulate matter and man-created carbon dioxide into the air at an increased rate. This new source of atmospheric pollutants really started to influence the earth's climate significantly around 1945.""Get it? Particulates cool, CO2 warms. Both are produced by industrialization. The ""doom mongers"" considered that the effects of particulates, including volcanoes, would outweigh the effects of rising CO2 and cause cooling. In the event, they were wrong: particulates did not rise at the expected rate (indeed, they seem to have fallen in recent decades, as a result of clean-air legislation and a relative lack of volcanic activity).', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1493950747000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'global cooling meme that has insinuated itself into climate denial thinking', u'effect': u'that ice ages were on the way as the case may be).you claim global cooling'}, {u'cause': u'the second', u'effect': u'the warming effect'}, {u'cause': u'the first', u'effect': u'the cooling effect'}, {u'cause': None, u'effect': u'cooling'}], u'author_id': u'16662762', u'in_reply_to': u'97837393', u'id': u'97897393', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'pinkrobbo', u'text': u'""Fraud""?Whatever the eventual scientific findings about the connections between pesticides and bees decline ,are you saying that environmentalists are 'defrauding', i.e. Knowingly and deliberately spreading falsehoods about the causes- and therefore enabling the bee decline to continue?

But, let's step back a bit, to my original point.
10 years ago, in this very paper, we had a prediction about the end of skiing in Scotland. Has that come true? Is there still skiing in Scotland? Was that forecast accurate?
Do you think that forecast was based on the science of climate change, or on something else?
What Stephens is warning about is the failure of some climate change activists to seperate the science from the non-scientific claims. It is exactly these extreme claims, unsupported by the actual science and research, that cause the most damage to acceptance of human driven climate change. And, until these same activists can establish where scientifically based probabilities end, and extremist belief-based hysteria begins, the public will not be able to differentiate between the two.

But on climate, facts are facts | Jane Martinson",article,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/03/new-york-times-diverse-opinions-climate-change,0,"Right after the election of Donald Trump, a man widely considered a fake and a fool by many of its writers, the New York Times issued an extraordinary statement promising to “strive always to understand and reflect all political perspectives”.
In April, amid criticism that the Times, along with others in the mainstream media, had ignored the concerns of the American masses, the paper appointed a conservative columnist known for controversial views on climate change, race and gender. Welcoming Bret Stephens, the opinion page editor said that Times’ subscribers “want their views to be challenged.” 
Following the publication of Stephens’ inaugural column last week, it is the Times itself that is being challenged, as well as its reputation for fact-checking and balance. 
The column, which compared the certainty of those predicting global warming to those predicting a Clinton presidency, prompted more than 1,000 direct complaints, more on social media, and several cancelled subscriptions. Several leading scientists also published an open letter that accused Stephens of peddling “alternative facts”. 
The substance of the complaints – that Stephens misstated the level of global warming and sought to make a political point out of scientific fact – is of huge significance in the debate over climate change. 
But in linking the issue to politics, as the Times has through the pronouncements of its internal ombudsman and public editor on Wednesday, the paper has waded into the biggest issue facing the media. Facts, truth and opinion, always at the heart of journalism, are now the cause of an existential crisis over why it exists. 
In her column responding to the complaints, the New York Times’ public editor, Liz Spayd, recognised the depth of passion aroused by the column. “No subject since the election has come close to producing this kind of anger toward the Times,” she wrote. 
In a difficult position, Spayd stoked this anger by suggesting that the complaints were a matter of politics, not science. “The goal wasn’t to resolve the finer points of atmospheric physics, but to get an answer to a simple question: ‘Do you actually want a diversity of views on the Opinion pages?’” she wrote.
Stephens’ provocative choice of “a subject of urgent concern to the left”, wrote Spayd, did little to assuage the concerns of scientists who believe that rising CO2 levels are not a matter of political affiliation. 
Even before this column, Prof Stefan Rahmstorf, of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impacts Research in Germany, wrote: “The Times has denounced the critics of its decision as ‘left-leaning’. This is an insult to me and was the final straw to cancel my subscription. There is no left-leaning or right-leaning climate science, just as there is no Republican or Democrat theory of gravity.”
Leading scientists who launched a campaign urging the paper not to “publish climate science misinformation” reiterated the point that opinion needed to be based on fact. “There are opinions and there are facts. Stephens is entitled to share his opinions, but not ‘alternative facts’ … Facts are still facts, no matter where in the paper they appear.”
The appointment of Stephens, a Pulitzer prize-winning columnist, was laudable in some ways. Few would argue against a democratic, journalistic rationale for newspapers to offer a broad spectrum of views to challenge its readers. The desire to do so often lands news executives in trouble – witness this paper’s own publication of the thoughts of Osama bin Laden in 2004 – but this challenge is exacerbated by the current climate of falling revenues. 
Despite the adage that all publicity is good publicity, the reaction to Stephens’ first column should worry Times executives. As Spayd herself has written: “The Times has proclaimed a public commitment to reflecting a broader range of perspectives in its pages. What its mostly liberal or left-leaning base of readers thinks about that strategy obviously matters. They represent the business model, after all.”
Let’s leave aside for one moment the impact on diversity of appointing “yet another white male” to the paper’s editorial roster, a point forcefully made online. James Bennet, the relatively new editorial page editor, has struggled, like his predecessors, to broaden the opinion base of a paper with a mostly liberal roster of columnists. This need to diversify from any hint of echo-chamber opinionating became more extreme in the post-Trump era, an age of polarised views.
In an email, Spayd recognised the difficult line between fact and opinion. “There is no requirement to be neutral on the Opinion pages,” she wrote. “You’re paid to have positions. The point that some readers make is that everyone needs to work off the same set of facts.”
Few newspapers reliant on advertising and subscribers want to be the representative of such a small elite that there are too few willing to pay for them. Despite this, publishing something that questions science-based facts must surely cross a red line, no matter how beautifully written. 
Go too far down the line of controversy – not just publishing an op-ed by Marine Le Pen, but views that deny scientific consensus – and anything can be published in the name of neutrality. Even “alternative facts” – otherwise known as lies.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/03/new-york-times-diverse-opinions-climate-change

Yes, the Earth's climate has changed many times over the course of millions of years as part of natural environmental processes. 
But the scary thing is that this particular warming phase, over the last 50 to 150 years, has occurred much faster than ANY OTHER TIME in history.
Climate change skeptics often argue that CO2 emissions from human activity alone could not influence the Earth's climate to such an extent. They point to the fact that CO2 emissions also come from other sources such as volcanoes, and that high levels are naturally controlled by plants and the permafrost cycle.
( Humans are Dumping 135 TIMES MORE CO2 & gasses into OUR atmosphere than ALL of the Volcanoes on Earth....COMBINED....Each & Every Year ! )
The problem is that our greenhouse gas emissions disrupt the existing balance,whereby the planet is unable to absorb and release the CO2 as it normally would. This problem is made even worse due to increased deforestation.
An increase in carbon emissions caused by burning fossil fuels has caused an imbalance in the Earth's atmosphere
The IPCC considerers it ""highly probable"" that human influence has been the primary cause of global warming certainly, since the mid-20th century.Since 1750, the concentration of CO2 has increased by 40 percent, and methane by 150 percent.
Although skeptics also often try and highlight the 3 percent of scientists who are not certain that human activity is driving climate change, these researchers are frequently from conservative think tanks such as the Cato Institute, which is funded by companies such as Volkswagen and other groups that rely on the CONTINUED USE of fossil fuels.

""A: The short answer is, maybe. It is not possible to calculate the global average temperature anomaly with perfect accuracy because the underlying data contain measurement errors and because the measurements do not cover the whole globe. However, it is possible to quantify the accuracy with which we can measure the global temperature and that forms an important part of the creation of the HadCRUT4 data set. The accuracy with which we can measure the global average temperature of 2010 is around one tenth of a degree Celsius. The difference between the median estimates for 1998 and 2010 is around one hundredth of a degree, which is much less than the accuracy with which either value can be calculated. This means that we can't know for certain - based on this information alone - which was warmer. However, the difference between 2010 and 1989 is around four tenths of a degree, so we can say with a good deal of confidence that 2010 was warmer than 1989, or indeed any year prior to 1996.Q: How does this data set differ from HadCRUT3?

While the satellite and surface instruments measure fundamentally different quantities, all data series clearly show a consistent warming signal. The trend in the satellite data is 0.11C per decade since 1979, compared to 0.16C per decade in the surface record. One reason for this is El Niño – a Pacific weather phenomenon occurring once every five to seven years, which tends to give a boost to global temperature. El Niño’s signal is much more pronounced in the troposphere than at the Earth’s surface, giving rise to higher peaks and lower troughs.

Tropospheric anomalies are smaller, and tropospheric trends are smaller.

We are effectively warming the surface and cooling the stratosphere. The troposphere sits between the two.
There is another interesting feature visible here, the peaks and troughs in the satellite data are noticeably larger than those in the surface data.
Because the tropospheric trend is smaller, and the tropospheric data is inherently more noisy, it takes longer for the trend to become statistically significant than in surface data.

It wouldn't be quick, but would be a long slow inevitable change.
The glaciation of Antarctica began around 34 million years ago, when CO2 reduced from around 1000 ppm to around 600 ppm.
The reduction is linked to increased weathering of the newly-rising Himalayas.
Antarctic glacial inception began at around 750 ppm, and spread more widely as the CO2 level continued to fall.
So - eventually - if CO2 rises back to those levels (around 800 ppm) allowing for the fact that it takes a lot of (latent) heat to melt ice at zero C to water at zero C - this would create conditions where Antarctica would become ice-free again.

There used to be subtropical forests near the poles 50 million years ago, and that doesn’t sound so bad. 
But the fossil record closer to the equator is really poor, and that may be an indication that life was extremely stressed during these warm periods.
If over half the surface area of the planet becomes inhospitable, it will not render Earth uninhabitable, but it will be unrecognizable and existentially challenging for the majority of the people, species and communities on Earth.

Researchers have found fly ash, one of the products of coal combustion, in rocks laid down around the time of this extinction event:
http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v4/n2/abs/ngeo1069.html
A large amount of coal had been burned over a period of tens of thousands of years.
The coal was burned by volcanic eruptions that happened in Siberia, which produced a large area of volcanic rocks called the Siberian Traps.
The burning actually happened underground, with the carbon dioxide and ash mixing with magma.
This produced vast amounts of CO2 which warmed the Earth and changed the chemistry of the oceans:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25859043
Humans, of course, are more efficient..... in a couple of centuries, far more fossil fuels have been burned than happened in thousands of years during the Siberian Traps eruptions.
The End-Permian event caused the extinction of 92% of species.

But there was a time a few years ago when you couldn’t open your news feed without being told global warming had stopped by some conservative columnist, climate science denier or one of those people who spend their waking hours writing comments on stories like this. 
The issue at hand was one of the multiple measurements used by scientists to monitor the state of the planet – the globally averaged temperature.
Depending on which particular set of data you looked at, and how you calculated trends, there was an argument that temperature rises had slowed over a period of about 15 years.
When deniers and contrarians talked about this “slowdown” the implication was that somehow, the laws of physics had suddenly changed and loading the atmosphere with CO2 might not be a problem any more. 
As I argued three years ago, this global warming pause was never really a thing. 
Despite all the other indicators of global warming showing business as usual – sea-level rise, temperature extremes, glacier melt, species movements, ocean heating, permafrost melt – the unhealthy fixation on one aspect, the average temperature of the globe, stuck firm. 
But scientists reacted to the public commentary in the only way they know how. They started to study this “pause” to find out what might be going on. They published scores and scores of papers in academic journals. 
This, in turn, fed a narrative that in the public eye that the fundamentals of human-caused climate change were in doubt when, in fact, none of the credible studies found this to be the case. 
Some argued the pause did not exist at all, others looked at the role of the oceans, the trade winds, greenhouse gases, volcanic eruptions or even the way ship thermometers recorded the water temperatures (and then how scientists accounted for the different methods). 
But many scientists agreed too that the wobble in the temperature was well within the bounds of what’s called “decadal variability” – the natural ups and downs in the climate system that are superimposed on top of the warming caused by burning fossil fuels. 
As the contrarian talking point went, the existence of different studies coming to different conclusions was proof enough that policy makers should wait rather than act. 
In one paper that appeared in the journal Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, three researchers argued that the scientific community had unwittingly been distracted by the claims of global warming contrarians.
Now a new study in the leading journal Nature has tried to reconcile the differences between the various pause studies and make suggestions about what went wrong. 
There was not a clear and agreed definition of what a pause was and if it was consequential. Scientists didn’t always communicate nuances clearly.
“In a time coinciding with high-level political negotiations on preventing climate change,” write the authors from Switzerland’s Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science, “sceptical media and politicians were using the apparent lack of warming to downplay the importance of climate change. It is easy to paint a controversial picture, but as often the devil is in the detail.” 
Just to be clear, this is was never about whether or not the threat from global warming caused by burning fossil fuels was in doubt for a while a few years ago. It wasn’t. 
Indeed, the Nature paper concludes that out of all the studies, the community is “more confident than ever” that human activity is now dominating the warming of the planet. 
But I’ve asked several leading climate scientists for their take. 
Dr James Risbey, a senior research scientist at CSIRO who has co-written an accompanying commentary in Nature, told me: “It never hurts to go back and see how we did.”
But he said: “A short-term trend was too blunt an instrument to speak directly to our confidence in climate change anyway, but its overall relevance is that it helped us to explain the bumps along the way.” 
The main lesson … is to be highly sceptical of narratives pushed by so-called climate sceptics
The Penn State University climate scientist Prof Michael Mann (he of the hockey stick graph) expected the Nature paper would gain attention because of the high profile of the journal and that it was talking about the “faux pause”.
But in an email he wrote there were no real “bombshell” findings in the Nature paper. 
“The work of many groups, including our own, has shown that [climate] models and observations are consistent in terms of long-term warming, and that this warming – and recent extreme warmth – can only be explained by human activity, namely the burning of fossil fuels,” he said
Prof Stefan Rahmstorf, of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said: “I think the main lesson to be learnt from this discussion, by scientists, the media and the public alike, is to be highly sceptical of narratives pushed by so-called climate sceptics.” 
Rahmstorf was a co-author on a paper in the journal Environmental Research Letters in April which found neither the claimed “pause” nor the recent spikes in global temperature were outside the bounds of how the climate should be expected to react when it is loaded with extra greenhouse gases.
He added: “Global temperature is a noisy data set due to natural short-term variability, and the debate was all about the noise and not about any meaningful change in the global warming signal. Let me add that understanding the precise nature of this short-term variability is of course a very interesting science question, and work done on the so-called ‘hiatus’ has certainly improved our understanding of that a lot.
“Incidentally, when in the journal Science in 2007 we pointed to the exceptionally large warming trend of the preceding 16 years, which was at the upper end of the [climate] model range, nobody cared, because there is no powerful lobby trying to exaggerate global warming. 
“And of course in our paper we named natural intrinsic variability as the most likely reason. But when a trend at the lower end of the model range occurs it suddenly became a big issue of public debate, because that was pushed by the fossil fuel climate sceptics’ lobby. There is an interesting double standard there.” 
Prof Matt England, of the University of New South Wales Climate Change Research Centre, is another scientist to have carried out research in response to the “hiatus” and found that a change in the strength of trade winds was also a factor in holding temperatures down. 
“Yes, the post-2000 slowdown was totally real,” he said. “Just like the acceleration in surface warming between 1980 and 2000 was totally real. It’s called decadal variability, and it’s superimposed on the long-term warming trends. Studying the physical mechanisms giving rise to decadal variability is an important component of the work we do, and will continue regardless of definitions of surface warming slowdowns and accelerations.”
So what to make of it all? 
The short version is that global warming didn’t stop, scientists knew global temperatures would wobble around and climate scientists aren’t always the best communicators.
But also, to paraphrase Stefan Rahmstorf, climate sceptics are not really sceptics at all.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2017/may/04/global-warming-scientists-learn-lessons-from-the-pause-that-never-was

http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/H/bo19211770.htmlPart 3, chapters 6–8, focuses on the environment. Mass immigration has increased America’s population by tens of millions of people in recent decades and is set to add hundreds of millions more over the twenty-first century. According to Census Bureau data our population now stands at 320 million people, the third-largest in the world, and at current immigration rates could balloon to over 700 million by 2100. This section examines the environmental problems caused by a rapidly growing population, including urban sprawl, overcrowding, habitat loss, species extinctions, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. I chronicle the environmental community’s historic retreat from population issues over the past four decades, including the Sierra Club’s failed attempts to adopt a consensus policy on immigration, and conclude that this retreat has been a great mistake. Creating an ecologically sustainable society is not just window dressing; it is necessary to pass on a decent future to our descendants and do our part to solve dangerous global environmental problems.

And how will we achieve this if we try to reach Goal #8 of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals?- sustain (!) economic growth, should be at least 7 % GDP per annum in the least developed countries- focus on high-value added and labour-intensive sectors- more enterprises- more efficient use of resources- full employment for all men and women, including young people and the disabled- more loans and insurance
Is it just me or is this just the default neoliberal attitude we've already been operating under for a decade or two? Isn't continuing this kind of economic strategy guaranteed to lead to more pollution, urbanisation, overcrowding and overconsumption, not less? Apart from the drive for more efficiency, there is nothing whatsoever in those goals that deals with the economic aspect of any of the issues raised by Mr. Annan in the piece ATL.

It's easy to think that, but I imagine you live in an area with a high density of population as I do. In the UK, Scotland and Wales are underpopulated.

America and Australia are vast with massive untapped resources.What you mean, if I may put words in your mouth, is too many greedy people.
BQEND
It depends how you define 'greedy'. If you're using it as a synonym for 'western standard of living' then I disagree - I firmly believe that everyone on earth should have a western standard of living. However, such a standard requires a lot of resources per human being. Large 'empty' areas aren't a sign we've got room to expand, especially with an increasing concentration of urban dwellers.

Exhaust from diesel engines brings a complex mixture of soot and gases to roadways, cities, farms, and other places. Health concerns about diesel exhaust relate not only to cancer, but also to other health problems such as lung and heart diseases.

Today the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) – part of the World Health Organisation – announced that it had reclassified diesel exhaust as a ‘definite carcinogen’ – putting it in its highest category (Category 1). 
In other words, IARC’s expert panel assessed all the available scientific evidence and decided that exposure to diesel exhaust fumes can, and does, cause cancer in humans – specifically lung cancer (although there’s weak evidence they’re also linked to bladder cancer).

Exhaust fumes from diesel engines do cause cancer, a panel of experts working for the World Health Organization says. 
It concluded that the exhausts were definitely a cause of lung cancer and may also cause tumours in the bladder.
It based the findings on research in high-risk workers such as miners, railway workers and truck drivers.

Do diesel fumes really kill thousands of Britons each year? And how can we possibly know for sure? In the wake of the Volkswagen scandal some reassuring voices have suggested that the claim is alarmist. Unfortunately, the evidence for the fuel’s deadly effects is powerful. 
Diesel exhausts emit two main pollutants: particulates and nitrogen dioxide (N02), and account for almost half the N02 and about 70 per cent of the particulates in London air.

Fly over Africa at night and you will see mile after mile of fires burning red in the dark as scrub is removed to make way for human beings. Satellite images of nocturnal Europe or America show vast areas lit up like an enormous fairground. From Shanghai to Sydney, from Moscow to Mexico City, the skylines of our major cities are no longer fixed and familiar. Where we cannot build into the sky, we construct vast chequerboards of smogbound, low-rise dwellings that stretch from one horizon to the other.
Our cities expand in every direction as we fight to house a population that is growing at the rate of 200,000 each day. That adds up to a headcount the size of Germany every year. To feed this growing number requires ever more land to farm: each year, more than 150,000 square kilometres of natural forest are lost to agricultural or urban development. 
Forests cover a third of our planet’s land surface. They produce life-giving oxygen and, by absorbing carbon dioxide, also mitigate the otherwise catastrophic effects of climate change. Not only do they provide a habitat for many of the world’s most endangered animals, around 1.6 billion people rely on them for food, fresh water, clothing, traditional medicine and shelter. Yet they are under threat from rampant deforestation in its many forms: fires, clearing for agriculture, unsustainable logging, ranching and development.
We speak reverentially of the savage beauty and teeming biodiversity of the world’s great wildernesses, from the tropical rainforests of Amazonia and central Africa, to our wetlands and deserts, and on to Patagonia and the frozen wastes of Antarctica. We are increasingly aware of the threats to such spaces and have encouraged sustainable conservation and ecotourism. But still the threats remain.
The greatest unexplored space on our planet lies beneath the oceans. Yet rising CO2 levels in the atmosphere are causing acidification, which disrupts food chains and marine habitats. Huge floating masses of plastic dumped in the oceans turn into hazardous waste that endangers not only marine life but also, indirectly, human populations – and the planet itself. Overfishing, illegal and damaging trawling practices and past whaling have emptied the oceans before we have even properly understood what riches they contain. And the great spaces of the oceans are the lungs of the planet. 
The very air we breathe is filling up with toxins. For years, gases have burned through the ozone layer, exposing us to ultraviolet rays and affecting climate change. Airborne diseases – such as Zika, swine flu and bird flu – have multiplied and threatened to become global pandemics. 
Great clouds of smog hover above our cities and airborne diseases multiply. Inhalation of toxic gases is said to reduce average lifespans by one to two years. Various estimates suggest that air pollution accounts for between half and two-thirds of all premature deaths in Asia, while anywhere between 10 and 20% of all worldwide deaths are attributable to the same cause. 
Typhoons, hurricanes and cyclones are harbingers of disaster, yet the winds are also, for some, an important source of energy. The debate about the effectiveness of wind farms rages on. Protesters claim they are ineffective and even dangerous eyesores, while pro-campaigners trumpet the positive impact of these wind farms. 
Space itself – famously the final frontier – has not been colonised but has, instead, become a dumping ground to such an extent that scientists are now calling on nations to reduce the quantity of orbital junk they produce or risk inhibiting future space activity. And yet, as overpopulation and decreasing landmass become a conundrum for future generations, will outer space provide an inhabitable environment? Space exploration and research are continuing, with Nasa proposing to station a team of astronauts on the moon for a prolonged stay. There is even talk of space stations on Mars. 
Twelve photographers were shortlisted for this year’s Prix Pictet award, on the theme of space. Each has made outstanding images that address the theme of space with originality and narrative power. Some, like Mandy Barker, create brilliant artificial worlds in which the plastic particles that are choking our oceans are presented as if they were plankton suspended in water drops. Scientific research has found that plankton ingest tiny plastic particles, mistaking them for food. Since they are at the base of the food chain, they are themselves a crucial source of nourishment for larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately humankind is of deep concern.
The shortlisted artists follow radically different paths but often arrive at parallel conclusions. Richard Mosse and Sergey Ponomarev focus on the refugee and migration crisis now facing Europe. Mosse’s searing monochrome images of refugee camps and staging sites reduce individual refugees to an inhuman mass, while Ponomarev’s photographs show despairing human beings with nothing left to lose. They have somehow found the strength to undertake a perilous sea journey, in the promise of a better life, in the hope that a safe space awaits them. They exist in limbo, excluded from modern societies. 
Michael Wolf and Benny Lam explore those who have, at some personal cost, woven themselves into the social fabric of our cities. Lam focuses on the cramped living conditions of Hong Kong’s poorest citizens, for whom a single 40-square-foot room (the size of a toilet or balcony) is home. 
Wolf ’s Japanese commuters are among the 3.64 million people who use Tokyo’s Shinjuku Station every day. Wolf pictures their faces rammed against the glass panes of a subway train. Clearly, this is no way to live. Yet these lives abide. And perhaps in this ability to carry on in adversity lies hope for us all. Hope that, despite the catastrophic damage that we have visited upon the natural world and upon the lives of our most vulnerable fellow citizens, it is not too late for us to reverse the damage. 
The artists shortlisted have shone a light on the issues. We ignore them at our peril.

The mountain ringlet is our only montane butterfly, meaning that you have to climb a mountain – or at least 400 metres up a Lake District fell – to see it.
Some mountain ringlet caterpillars may live for two years so slowly do they grow, chewing grass in the most capricious British conditions, while the butterfly itself only survives for a few days in June and July.
The mountain ringlet can endure wet and cold but is struggling as the climate warms. It’s disappeared from almost 40% of its locations since the 1970s and has moved 150m higher in recent decades. Scientists believe this is probably because temperature rises affect critical periods of its lifecycle.
Now there’s a new crowdfunding campaign for a joint study led by RSPB scientist Dr Steven Ewing to investigate how mountainsides can be better managed to help the mountain ringlet adapt to global warming.
As fickle as hilltop weather, this butterfly is probably the hardest in Britain to find, but Ewing has already observed 80 egg-laying females, measuring the composition and structure of the nearby grass species to learn more about what makes a mountainside hospitable for mountain ringlets.
By learning more about this secretive species, we may be able to tailor upland sheep grazing to its needs – and counteract some negative effects of climate change. For instance, one way to help mountain ringlets survive climate change might be to create cooler microclimates by allowing longer grass in some locations.
It’s laborious, heroic, fascinating science, and hopefully Ewing’s project will get the support it deserves.

It is much cheaper to stop burning fossil fuels.
BQENDIs it?
The UK is re-booting its nuclear industry at an enormous cost and installing a great deal of equally or even more expensive renewables all balanced with gas.
The UK has a carbon levy and as a consequence, we are the first country to come off coal and will be completely off within the next 4-5 years.
Germany does not, has electricity that costs twice as much as we do and since deciding to come off nuclear it has opened five new lignite coal power stations and strip mines - and despite all their renewables, are committed to coal until 2045-50 (they say) and of course they still produce significantly more CO₂ than we do.
Then we have to decarbonise our transport.

BQENDIndeed, a carbon tax is seen as an essential step.
The reason the UK is coming off coal is because unlike the rest of Europe (notably Germany) we put a carbon levy in place to close down coal stations at the same time that Germany is opening new ones (five new lignite coal plants since they decided to close their nuclear power plants) - the green movement even hailed this as a success.

Lastly, for renewables to really take off all over the world we need large amounts of storage, and all forms of storage, so if we combined a gas generation plant, with bio-gas production, then used the CO2 emissions to boost the efficiency of P2G (power to gas) storage to produce more methane (from the P2G hydrogen), then that would help.

From Zebra Fact Check 
Anywaaaay, whoever might have said such a thing would be way out of date. All over the world, birthrates have been plummeting. Bangladesh, for example, now has much the same average number of births per woman as most of the rest of the world, 2 and a bit. However, the average age of a woman at the birth of her first child in Bangladesh is 18! 
The biggest issues now are1) reducing wars and other conflicts. The highest birth rates in the world are in countries at war, normally within their own borders - like Congo and Afghanistan. 2) educating and employing girls and women. This is the best way to increase the average age at which women have their first child. And that is the only way forward to reducing total populations regardless of the number of children per woman when life expectancy increases everywhere. We need to reduce the number of generations of a family alive at the one time as much, or more, than we need to reduce the number of children in each generation. (As a mental exercise, think about the number of descendants of a woman at 50 years old and at 80 years old in a society where women, on average, have their first child at age 20. Then compare with the number of descendants of a similar 50 yrs old, 80 yrs old woman when the average age at first birth is 30. Then multiply that by the numbers for a city, a province or a country.)', u'recommendation_count': u'2', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1493963972000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'15155906', u'in_reply_to': u'97895012', u'id': u'97902551', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'BrooklynNonHipster', u'text': u'Billions of trees have already died in North America from bark beetles, sudden oak death and the emerald ash borer.

Planting trees, especially in large scale monocultures is unlikely to be of significant help and even when successful is likely on a temporary sequestration as large scale wild fires become increasingly more common.

I'd agree about the monoculture issue*, however, agroforestry is an important element of the way forward. It increases soil fertility, retains both carbon and water, reduces soil erosion and significantly improves microclimates allowing the associated crops to grow and produce more successfully. 
Of course, it needs to be backed up by restoration of watershed function where hilltops and mountainsides have been scoured clear of trees. The World Agroforestry Centre has lots of projects around the world and lots of videos of individual programs like this one. 
* Anyone who recommends Australian eucalypts anywhere outside Australia should have their heads read. They destroy the understorey and general ecosystem functions and allow/promote erosion of the exposed soil by wind and water. There are plenty of Australian trees better suited, like the grevillea robusta (silky oak) which is now being used effectively in a lot of African projects.

But some, like Eelco Rohling, professor of ocean and climate change at the Australian National University’s research school of earth sciences, now argue that this target cannot be achieved unless ways to remove huge amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere are found, and emissions are slashed.
This is where negative emissions technologies come in. The term covers everything from reforestation projects to seeding the stratosphere with sulphates or fertilising the ocean with iron fillings. 
It’s controversial – not least because of the chequered history of geoengineering-type projects, but also because of concerns it will grant governments and industry a licence to continue with business as usual. But many argue we no longer have a choice.
“Most things are not applied yet on larger scales but we have a pretty good feeling of things that will work and we can quantify roughly how much carbon we should be able to remove from the atmosphere with them,” says Rohling. 
The scale of the task is staggering, says Dr Pep Canadell, from the global carbon project at CSIRO. 
“The models are basically asking for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere which will be equivalent of one-quarter of all carbon emissions at present,” he says.
This amounts to about 10 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere and disposed of each year.
The least controversial method of doing this is deceptively simple: plant more trees. “We have lost a lot of density of carbon in the landscapes because of deforestation and degradation. We have depleted carbon in the soils in all the problem areas of the world,” Canadell says. “What are the opportunities to bring some of this carbon back?”
Again, the scale of reforestation efforts needed to make a dent in atmospheric carbon dioxide is substantial. 
“We would need as many as three Indias worth of land globally – and good quality land, not marginal land,” Canadell says. Reforestation also needs enough water, and needs to be done in such a way that it enriches the soil and ecosystems, not deplete them.
The fact that so many soils are carbon-depleted by intensive agriculture offers a way to tackle two environment challenges at the same time. Biochar is a form of charcoal produced by heating plant material in the absence of oxygen. Agricultural waste, which would otherwise be a major source of greenhouse gas emissions if burnt, could instead be turned into a biochar – a process that produces more energy than it consumes – and the biochar could then be used to enrich agricultural soils with carbon. Research suggests that biochars not only boost crop yields, but could lock away carbon for several thousand years. 
Another approach designed to lock away carbon while also helping depleted soils is enhanced weathering. 
Olivine refers to a group of silicate minerals that react with carbon dioxide to form other compounds. Enhanced weathering aims to amplify this chemical interaction by mining huge quantities of olivine – which is widespread and relatively abundant – and pulverising it to maximise its exposure to the air, then spreading it over areas such as agricultural fields to add carbon to the soils. 
Rohling believes enhanced weathering is very promising, but it does have some significant downsides. 
“It’s not one of the most expensive approaches but it does require large-scale mining, which we do for everything else anyway,” he says. The mining would also consume significant amounts of energy, which reduces the efficiency of the process by up to one-third.
The oceans are of particular interest for negative emissions because of their enormous capacity for carbon dioxide. One proposal is to fertilise the oceans with powdered iron or olivine. This boost in important nutrients leads to an increase in phytoplankton which, when it dies, decomposes and sinks to the seafloor, taking the carbon with it.
This phenomenon occurred naturally during recent ice ages, Rohling says, when the Southern Ocean was fertilised with dust from South America and Australia. But any project that attempted to alter the biochemistry and ecology of the oceans would very quickly run foul of international conventions, and rightly so. 
“The law of the sea would forbid you from dumping things that will affect the environmental chemistry or ecology, and that’s exactly what you want to do,” he says.
As atmospheric carbon dioxide rises above 400 parts per million (ppm) for the first time in human history, there’s even talk of direct capture of carbon dioxide, using huge versions of the atmospheric scrubbers that remove carbon dioxide from the air on board spacecraft.
Canadell’s strongest bet is on carbon capture and storage, but instead of sucking it out of the air, he wants to see every facility that produces carbon dioxide equipped with technology to capture it at the release point.
“Anything that can be attached to any plants that are emitting carbon, either it’s a full power plant, a bioenergy burning biomass to produce electricity or carbon capture storage that is associated to industrial processes which release carbon,” he says. The captured carbon can then be disposed of deep underground in abandoned oil and gas wells, saline aquifers, or in the kind of geology that locks it away chemically.
While not strictly a negative emissions technology, he argues that as long as we continue to emit carbon dioxide, we cannot hope to remain below two degrees of warming unless we find a way to capture it. 
Whatever the choice of negative emissions technology, Rohling says we are running out of time to study and implement them responsibly. He’s worried that at the first big global climate change disaster, governments will respond with a knee-jerk embracing of whatever negative emissions technologies they can, regardless of whether scientists have adequately explored the consequences.
“We need to start preparing so we know what we’re talking about when we need it,” he says. ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/may/05/negative-emissions-tech-can-more-trees-carbon-capture-or-biochar-solve-our-co2-problem

A 2015 report on health and climate change from the world's leading medical journal 'the Lancet' made it clear that adaptation has limits; health systems will not be able to adapt to a 4º warmer world. Preventing worsening climate change is the only option.
Public climate debates leave out almost entirely a third part of the debate, namely, a very substantial number of very competent scientists who think that the officially-accepted scientific position is much too optimistic. A group of scientists at MIT came out with a report c2014 describing the most comprehensive modelling of the climate that had ever been done. Their virtually unreported conclusion was that the international commission was far too optimistic. Their projections had a median probability of surface warming of 5.2°C by 2100, with a 90% probability of 3.5-7.4°. Median projected increase in the 2003 study was just 2.4°. 
In such a situation adaptation will be impossible, and contemporary civilisation will cease to exist as will all but a small proportion of the world’s inhabitants. We'll never be able to overcome the consequences. Yet that's not part of the debate. But then the mass murderers and war criminals who launched the invasion of Iraq in 2003 weren’t interested in the consequences, either – but though we’ve suffered plenty since, that isn’t part of any debate, either.', u'recommendation_count': u'3', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1494041389000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'12554246', u'id': u'97982420', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'RedPillCeryx', u'text': u'Yes, you're right.

But most of the people who are still relying on oil don't have the same options that I have, eg no young family to feed and clothe, not having to work at least part-time to make ends meet etc, etc.
So I join you in lambasting those who do have enough money to reduce their oil consumption. You may have seen Kevin Anderson in action, but in case you haven't, here he is last month:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIODRrnHQxg
But I can't agree with you that the oil companies should be let off the hook; any more than Thomas Hardie's should be let off the hook for all the damage that asbestos has done to people and the environment; or the tobacco corporations, or the banks for pushing credit levels so high in order to keep their shareholders happy.
Nup, those corporations should be more accountable than ordinary people should - and so are governments that continue to subsidise them because they provide jobs. That's where the change needs to come - and it is coming in quite a few countries, eg see here:

There used to be subtropical forests near the poles 50 million years ago, and that doesn’t sound so bad. 
But the fossil record closer to the equator is really poor, and that may be an indication that life was extremely stressed during these warm periods.
If over half the surface area of the planet becomes inhospitable, it will not render Earth uninhabitable, but it will be unrecognizable and existentially challenging for the majority of the people, species and communities on Earth.

the agreed baseline is given in time but not with a direct estimate of what this is.
Pre-industrial when talked about in terms of climate promises means c.1750:http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_AnnexIII_FINAL.pdf
No ambiguity or alternative offered.
The proxy record shows this to be 0.4-0.7C lower than the 1951-1980 baseline which is the coolest of the instrumental temperature records see figures S1 http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/pd/climate/teachingclimate/surftemps2000yrs.pdf
even in 1860 the level was 0.3-0.4C lower figure 11:https://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/far/wg_I/ipcc_far_wg_I_spm.pdf
With the consecutive 12 month anomaly of over 1C above the 1951-1980 benchmark the 1.5C was almost certainly breeched from the political promise. 
https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/GLB.Ts+dSST.txt
So why do you think that the planet will cool between now and 2100?
Also not that the land only anomaly has been more than 1.5C above the 1951-1980 baseline with no ambiguity as to assessing what the 1750 baseline would be.

How much do you wnnt to bet?If you remove political propaganda for a moment and look at the numbers. 
The most optimistic CO2 scenario of the 4 quoted by the IPCC which isn't already physically impossible is RCP 4.5:
RCP6.0 # 669 ppmv CO2 # 728 ppm CO2e # 799 ppm CO2e (GHGs only)RCP4.5 # 538 ppmv CO2 # 581 ppm CO2e # 629 ppm CO2e (GHGs only)
http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~mmalte/rcps/
We are already behind RCP4.5 in terms of latest global emissions and the RCP assumes a continued 55% CO2 absorption by the oceans and atmosphere. If this is changed to the latest figures from 2015 & 2016 this is only 30% of reported emissions. 
So becomes 630ppm CO2 by 2100
RCP4.5 makes the following assumptions to achieve its goal:But let us look at the description of RCP4.5 :
 
BQSTART
""This future is consistent with:  * Lower energy intensity  * Strong reforestation programmes  * Decreasing use of croplands and grasslands due to yield increases and dietary changes  * Stringent climate policies  * Stable methane emissions  * CO2 emissions increase only slightly before decline commences around 2040""

Full technical description of the scenario are here:

The geologists give the following about where we are almost at now:
 
BQSTART
""Recent estimates suggest CO2 levels reached as much as 415 parts per million (ppm) during the Pliocene. With that came global average temperatures that eventually reached 3 or 4 degrees C (5.4-7.2 degrees F) higher than today’s and as much as 10 degrees C (18 degrees F) warmer at the poles. Sea level ranged between five and 40 meters (16 to 131 feet) higher than today.""

And even ignoring the long-term feedbacks called ESS we are left with the ECS and for 560ppm this is most commonly coming out as 3C-4C in climate models in CMIP5 according to the IPCC AR5. And they didn't predict such a strong increase in temperature as seen in 3 consecutive record breaking years in their judgements as to what was more likely.
The tail-end risk for ECS of 560pom is well over 6C and note the minipeak at 10Chttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Frequency_distribution_of_climate_sensitivity,_based_on_model_simulations_(NASA).png
4C is more an honest assessment of political pledges and international agreement.

Its chairman, Peter Coates, made the comments at an AGM in Adelaide on Thursday, telling shareholders it was “sensible” and “consistent with good value”. 
Earlier this week, the Australian National University, which previously divested from Santos citing a commitment to its renewables research, appeared to have reinvested in the company. 
There has been a shareholder push for a resolution that Santos disclose its climate risk assessments and scenario analyses.
Asked whether the analyses were conducted on a 2C pathway, Coates replied that the company had adopted a 4C pathway.
“It’s in comparison to the [International Energy Agency] business-as-usual forecast on carbon emissions,” Coates said.
“There’s been no nationally determined commitment to the 2C scenario, and even the 4C scenario is not funded. So I think what we’re doing is very sensible, and consistent with good value.”
Will Steffen, councillor with the Climate Council, and an emeritus professor at ANU, said Coates’s revelation was “absolutely appalling”.
“[A 4C pathway] really is a worst-case scenario,” he told Guardian Australia. “This is not some minor climatic blip we need to deal with. It’s a completely different climate system.”
Steffen said the difference between the ice age and the Holocene age, which Earth has been in for about 12,000 years, was 4C. “You’d be locking in tens of metres of sea-level rise, and you can forget about the world cities,” he said.
In 2015 Shell was accused of pursuing a business strategy based on 4C warming, which experts have said would lead to catastrophic climate change, including a devastating impact on world food production and the finance market. 
The Paris climate agreement, which came into effect late last year, sets a target of carbon emissions that would mean a global temperatures rise of no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels.
There have already been warnings from UN agencies that current government pledges to cut emissions would only hold it to 3C – well beyond what climate scientists consider the limit of safety.
Daniel Gocher, an analyst for Market Forces who attended the Santos meeting and pushed for the resolution, said Santos had breached the trust of its investors.
“Two degrees means they’re serious about climate change. That’s what governments around the world agreed to in Paris. Four degrees means business as usual and that means they’re not taking it seriously.”
Gocher said Santos had effectively displayed climate denialism, and “a breathtaking failure to come to grips with a world in transition”.
At the meeting Coates also said there was no gas shortage, but there was a “policy shortage”, and he accused the federal government of not showing commitment and support for the development of an ongoing supply to the east coast, the ABC reported.
 The Australian National University has apparently bought back into Santos after controversially divesting its shares in 2014, Guardian Australia can reveal.
In October 2014 ANU divested from about $16m worth of shares in seven fossil fuel companies. The vice chancellor, Ian Young, said at the time the ANU was a major environment and alternative energy researcher and had to “be able to say that we’re confident that the sort of companies that we’re investing in are consistent with the broad themes that drive this university”.
The university was blasted by Coalition MPs and ministers, and in the media. Eighteen months later it also faced criticism from its own staff and students for not divesting the remaining estimated $45m it still had in the resource sector.
However according to ANU disclosures, it appears the university has since bought back into at least four of the seven companies.
A report on its 2016 investments, which totalled more than $326m, listed dozens of companies including Santos, Sandfire, Oil Search, and Newcrest Mining - all previously divested under its socially responsible investment policy, adopted in July 2013.
“As a result of that policy, we don’t invest in companies whose primary business is coal, gambling, tobacco or pornography, and we have taken steps to reduce the carbon intensity of our portfolio,” an ANU spokesman told Guardian Australia.
In October 2015 the university appointed an external portfolio manager. ANU’s website said it made no decision itself about stock selection, but had placed conditions on the manager’s decisions, including that investments:
“These conditions were imposed on the external manager to decrease the university’s investment exposure to CO2-intensive industries without increasing the university’s exposure to volatility in the equities market,” it said.
“If this balance was not managed, it might adversely impact the university’s financial stability, including its ability to meet obligations to pay superannuation liabilities.”
The spokesman said an April meeting of the ANU council decided to make the report public in the interest of transparency.
Matt Rogers of Fossil Free ANU welcomed the “step forward in disclosure” with the list’s publication, but criticised the reinvestment. “It fails to acknowledge the political dimensions of the issue and fails to hold fossil fuel companies accountable for their climate change obstructionism and blatant disregard for environment,” he said.
Gocher said ANU’s move was “strange”. “If they were going to get back into a fossil fuel company, Santos wouldn’t be it,” he said.
Tom Swann, a researcher at the Australia Institute, said there was some progress shown by ANU’s report, including the investment disclosure itself, a commitment to proxy voting which could lead to pressure on the university to vote for companies to avoid resource projects like Adani, and a big investment in a Victorian windfarm.
“I do think they’ve gone further than previously - but it is still concerning that they reinvested and didn’t tell anyone,” he told Guardian Australia. “I think there will be backlash. People on the ANU campus and the thousands that came out in support of them when they were being bullied will feel a bit betrayed by this.”
Swann said there was a “broader lesson” about ethical investing for universities.

In mathematics, catastrophe theory is a branch of bifurcation theory in the study of dynamical systems; it is also a particular special case of more general singularity theory in geometry. Bifurcation theory studies and classifies phenomena characterized by sudden shifts in behavior arising from small changes in circumstances, analysing how the qualitative nature of equation solutions depends on the parameters that appear in the equation. This may lead to sudden and dramatic changes, for example the unpredictable timing and magnitude of a landslide.

Most common explanations of global warming assert a singularity. Why don't you like this? It's not from some philosophical prejudice; there is nothing wrong with continuous functions.

The elevated carbon emissions to the atmosphere from burning of fossil fuels, since around 1870 has blocked an ever larger portion of absorbed incoming solar energy, in land and oceans, from being radiated back to space. That is the Earth Radiation Budget is not balanced and the Earth must therefore warm in order to emit more infrared energy until sufficient reaches the top of the atmosphere to return to space. It is the atmospheric gasses which contain carbon, principally CO2, that are opaque to infrared at some wavelengths. 
The amount of warming required to return the Earth to balance is proportional to both the level of CO2 and the cumulative time spent elevated. Science expresses this as the amount of warming expected from the cumulative atmospheric carbon relative to pre industrial times.
This in turn sets a total atmospheric carbon budget for a given temperature rise. The situation is complicated because there are many large natural carbon feedbacks, some fast and some slow, some negative, and some positive. As the planet warms there are some many large carbon reservoirs that may be released to the atmosphere at a temperature Tipping Point - these very large positive feedbacks will then swiftly push the temperature higher, potentially triggering more Tipping Points.
So what is the safe climate operating point for a Global Mean Surface Temperature compatible with maintaining global food chains and the stable habitable zones necessary for large scale civilisation ? 
As with all climate science there are known error bars and probabilities for the range of answers, but the only known safe operating point is associated with CO2 at around 350 ppm - that is back to 1990 levels with GMST less than +1C.
+2C GMST is a do not cross red line consensus of climate science based upon current assessments of the Transient (100 year) Climate Sensitivity - dangerous Tipping Points are somewhere, but not far, beyond +2C. In other words the further the Earth warms beyond +2C, and the longer the planet operates beyond +2C, the greater the danger of being pushed swiftly on to +3C....+4C....+? 
What does this mean for humanity ? Beyond +2C lies catastrophic climate change that we can neither adapt to or mitigate in the time available: global food chains will destabilise and many will fail, in the face of extreme climate events, hot and cold, floods and drought, wild temperature swings, raging forest fires, shifting ocean currents, accelerating sea level rise exacerbated by more frequent storm surges, top soil and coasts will erode faster, habitable zones will migrate faster than many species can keep up with, Widespread savage wars of survival will be inevitable. 
The science is clear - beyond +2C the risks to civilisation from unstoppable and uncontrollable further warming are so great it would be very foolish not to do everything possible to avoid experiencing them.
Nor is +2C an assured safe zone. Arctic Sea Ice extent and thickness appears to be close to or may have already passed its' tipping point of no return to 1980 levels. The loss of albedo, the reflectivity of flat sea ice that returns 50 to 90 % of incoming solar radiation directly to space, has given way to absorption of 90% of that incoming energy in the now exposed extra expanse of dark ocean. Today the planet has warmed +1.1C but we have not yet experienced anything like the full consequences, because the Oceans take in some 97% of all the excess energy blocked by greenhouse gasses. 
Therefore we must reduce carbon emissions and the sooner we do so, the greater the benefit from avoiding yet more severe consequences.

There is no way the world can reach zero carbon emissions in 20 years, and 32 years would be extremely difficult. So +1.5 C is impossible - it would require large scale removal of CO2 from the atmosphere. +2C may not be possible even with just a 33% probability of success and deploying large scale Carbon Capture and Storage.

I suggest that a better way of doing things, besides weeding out the sociopaths...which is a very necessary precondition...would be to remove some of the power of politicians by changing the budget process slightly to allow taxpayers to allocate their own taxes.
Let the Congress set a proposed budget, but then let the taxpayers decide where they want their money to go. Allow taxpayers to allocate their tax bill in incremental step amounts based on the size of their bill, and require that at least six different departments, agencies, programs, etc. they will allocate their funds to. Any odd amounts go into the general fund.
In that manner, we get more citizen participation in government, more people paying attention, a very clear indication of the priorities of the nation, and less power in politicians hands.
There is no way to have a nation without a government, that's a no-brainer. So the question really is how do we distribute power? Currently, too much power lies in too few hands because too much wealth is in too few hands. Like it or not, wealth = power, and real wealth derives not from hard work or intellectual brilliance, but from ruthlessness and control of government policies.
By removing the ability to allocate income taxes wholesale, we return the power to the owners of the tax monies and diminish the power of the politicians and the 1%.
The most common argument against this is that the common taxpayer is too ignorant to be allowed to do this on the one hand or too apathetic and lazy to bother on the other.

We know sociopaths are real, we know they comprise 4-6% of society, we know they desire power over others above all else, we know they lack the ability to feel empathy, guilt, regret, compassion, and are willing to ruthlessly use those emotions to manipulate others, we know how to identify them. [bold emphasis mine]
BQEND
The problem is not that sociopaths are drawn to government, the problem is that government by its very nature has the power over others that attracts sociopaths.
As long as it has this power over others, we will have sociopaths ruling us, for the simple reason that only sociopaths would desire such power.
By advocating attempts to ""screen out"" sociopaths, you treat the symptom, not the cause. Your treatment will only result in smarter and more deceptive sociopaths ascending the throne.
For at least the last ten millennia, perhaps far longer, the human political paradigm has consisted of a minority group - the political class - ruling and living off the rest.
The true interests of the political class are easily identified: to maintain or increase its power over the populace to ensure that the gravy train keeps on rolling.
The idea that governments have any other purpose, and do anything that does not further these ends, is utterly fictitous. History, when stripped of government propaganda, clearly shows this to be true.
The current Climate Change Industry is a case in point. It is a $1.5 trillion dollar government program that never fails to advocate for more goverment power and funding to fight ""climate change"".
This despite the fact that governments in general are the greatest polluters, and that the US government in particular is the largest polluter of them all.
The idea that governments will Save the Planet™ is simply preposterous.

The State's criminality is nothing new and nothing to be wondered at. It began when the first predatory group of men who clustered together and formed the State, and it will continue as long as the State exists in the world, because the State is fundamentally an anti-social institution, fundamentally criminal. The idea that the State originated to serve any kind of social purpose is completely unhistorical. It originated in conquest and confiscation – that is to say, in crime. It originated for the purpose of maintaining the division of society into an owning-and-exploiting class and a propertyless dependent class – that is, for a criminal purpose. 
No State known to history originated in any other manner, or for any other purpose. Like all predatory or parasitic institutions, its first instinct is that of self-preservation. All its enterprises are directed first towards preserving its own life, and, second, towards increasing its own power and enlarging the scope of its own activity. For the sake of this it will, and regularly does, commit any crime which circumstances make expedient.

How certain are we? Science does not deal in Truth, but facts, as the old saying goes. We theorize; we never know. The argument of ""Does anthropomorphic carbon release drive global warming?"" is foolish. How certain are we that AGW is true, and how do we estimate our certainty? For we will never act on 100% certainty, or forbear from things at 0% certainty. We do not have the luxury. HOW CERTAIN ARE WE? is one of the cardinal questions.
How much and how fast? If we decide the following is answered by ""Sufficiently certain to compel humans to change behavior,"" how much change and how fast? If a 50% reduction in CO2 emissions over 30 years is necessary, and 40% reduction is achieved and is futile, what good have we done, other than die in sanctimony? If a 10% reduction in CO2 emissions over 30 years is necessary, and 40% is achieved with much suffering and death, how does our harm to others counterbalance the greater good? I've never heard this question asked or answered.
Who suffers? If the goal is ""we change, no matter what,"" than the weakest half of our global population will bear disproportionate effect. That is human nature; if we surpass this tendency we have taken a great step up in evolution. The most certain way to reduce CO2 release is a worldwide dictatorship over carbon dioxide use, with absolute power. The obvious solution is to give or recognize the power that the United States alone will decide worldwide CO2 use to meet the targets. An AGW dictator, in fact, would make the final determination. If that is the only solution, is AGW worth achieving? Ideally, it would be a harmonious discussion over sharing resources, but our species is not good at that. The corollary is that if we create huge ""carbon sinks"" which are net-negative in carbon emission, we might stand the best chance of stopping AGW. We don't know - we're guessing. The comic-horrific suggestion of the CO2 Eden Project - the depopulation of human species from South America, reversing a 15,000 year change in a several billion-year ecosystem - might ""save the planet,"" sorry former South Americans, we'll hold you deep in our hearts.
No matter how strenuously we argue Question #1 about the evidence for AGW, we are left with the remaining question - or just shrug our shoulders and accept the inevitable or ridiculous, depending on one's biases.
These are admittedly ugly questions, and neither the Denier tribe nor the Certains wish to move on past the harshly superstitious argument of whether it is the Moon Beast, or the Night Slayer, that eats the moon during lunar eclipses.

The economic of this are shockingly simple - the lower a commodity price becomes, the greater the proportion of the unit install/O&M costs are comprised of labour - a cost which constrains any further falls.

Yes, we do. The abyss is not today or tomorrow. The abyss is a slow journey to an unimaginable bottom over the following centuries caused by the actions we take right now. While we cause other species to become extinct, the question becomes will we become extinct too. I doubt a written appeal to the laws of nature will be so easily won as a bribe within our halls of power from which so much of our troubles ultimately spawn.
There are so many reasons why ordinary people ignore this subject. It is too awful. It is too easy to not know. It is too easy to conform with misjudging peers. It simply is not important to the here and now. It is too hard to comprehend. But in all honesty, all of that simply boils down to the fact that it is simply too easy to not care when the results of what we do now are felt only by generations that have not yet been born and that we will not meet nor have to look in the eye and explain why we caused our own catastrophe or our own extinction.

The question that matters is why we continue to allow the most ignorant, belligerent, and greedy among us-- a distinct minority-- to imperil everyone else.
BQEND
Why?
Because we allow sociopaths into the political system.
Look at the political class of any country and you'll find it is heavily stocked with sociopaths.
We know sociopaths are real, we know they comprise 4-6% of society, we know they desire power over others above all else, we know they lack the ability to feel empathy, guilt, regret, compassion, and are willing to ruthlessly use those emotions to manipulate others, we know how to identify them.
If we want to save the world, we need to start screening politicians and screen out sociopaths from positions that allow them to endanger all the rest of us.
You don't allow an arsonist to be in charge of the fire department, nor do we allow those with analogous physical disabilities to apply for jobs their disability disqualifies them for. No blind person has the right to demand they be given a job as a school bus driver, the color-blind can't demand jobs as color-matchers, the paraplegic can't sue to be football players.
On one level, sociopathy can be viewed as an emotional deficit disorder that cripples the ability to consider the needs of others as superior to your own, a critical need in governance. On the other hand, it isn't a disorder at all, but rather the efficient mental toolkit of a born predator.
We need neither in the highest offices in the land.
We desperately need to acknowledge the dangers of allowing sociopaths to run countries, and take immediate steps to begin weeding them out. screening laws passed on local levels can begin the process.
This will, of course, trigger lawsuits, as sociopaths demand the ""right"" to be themselves, regardless of how many they hurt in the process. It will be an interesting court drama.

As the UK receives only 700-900kWh of solar energy per m2 per year, this would indicate that it takes around 7 years for PV panels in the UK to pay back their energy cost. However, this study is based on PV modules produced before 2004. The volume of PV modules produced globally increases year after year, and increasing volumes lead to greater energy efficiency in production. 
A more recent study by researchers from the Netherlands and the USA (Fthenakis, Kim and Alsema, 2008), which analyses PV module production processes based on data from 2004-2006. They find that it takes 250kWh of electricity to produce 1m2 of crystalline silicon PV panel. Under typical UK conditions, 1m2 of PV panel will produce around 100kWh electricity per year, so it will take around 2.5 years to ""pay back"" the energy cost of the panel.

Essentially the warmer it gets, the much greater the likelihood i.e. probability of serious runaway warming caused by various feedback mechanisms. Yes 1C is probably the approximate threshold of where there is the possibility of positive feedback loops being induced which will amplify warming and cause further warming. Nevertheless the probability starts off low, and then gets much greater the more warming there is and the more fossil fuels we burn.

BQENDSo you disagree with the IPCC who say:
BQSTART
 ""a 'runaway greenhouse effect'—analogous to Venus—appears to have virtually no chance of being induced by anthropogenic activities.""  http://www.ipcc.ch/meetings/session31/inf3.pdf 
They go on to say: "" our focus will be on those eventsthat the literature suggests have a non-negligible chance of being induced by anthropogenic activities. For example, stability of thermohaline circulation or the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) or the Greenland ice sheet, the mobilization of biospheric CO2 stocks, changes in the Asian summer monsoons, loss of mountain glaciers, coral reefs and ENSO all appear to be of global or regional significance, respectively, and thus these are some of the natural bounds, which if exceeded, would lead to major potentially irreversible impacts. It is very likely that the irreversibility and scale of such changes would be considered “unacceptable” by virtually all policy-makers and would thus qualify as “dangerous” change. It would be important for the IPCC to perform a comprehensive identification of suchpotential thresholds or irreversibilities at various spatial and temporal scales, which would help in setting the boundaries for high-impact change in the climate system. More examples of different key elements of the climate system and critical thresholds can be found in (Dessai et al., 2003; Mimura, 2003). ""

When scientists use models to show the range of what may happen in the future they cherry pick which parameters to use and which measurements thereof to use.

They have also systematically sabotaged the nascent solar industry in the UK through draconian cuts to subsidies.
BQENDYes, another good example - Domestic solar pv is (cf 10.2% in the UK) is great for countries where demand matches the sunshine - but not here in the UK where it cannot even recoup the energy of its manufacture and with a carbon footprint four times that of wind.
Utility level solar is more useful, but even that dries up in the winder months.The cost of solar dropped >80%, subsidy was cut 62%.... yet huge numbers of solar companies went out of business.
That isn't a sustainable sector and even at a quarter of the current price, no amount of solar pv would enable us to close a single coal power station.
this is why the experts were against it.
As the late Professor David Mackay said
BQSTART
“There is this appalling delusion that people have that we can take this thing that is currently producing 1% of our electricity and we can just scale it up and if there is a slight issue of it not adding up, then we can just do energy efficiency,” he said. “Humanity really does needs to pay attention to arithmetic and the laws of physics – we need a plan that adds up.” ....//.....   civil servants in Decc had assessed solar and found the numbers did not add up for the UK: “The only reason solar got on the table was democracy. The MPs wanted to have a solar feed-in-tariff. So in spite of the civil servants advising ministers, ‘no, we shouldn’t subsidise solar’, we ended up having this policy. There was very successful lobbying by the solar lobbyists as well. So now there’s this widespread belief that solar is a wonderful thing, even though … Britain is one of the darkest countries in the world.”

""the UK government have effectively banned on shore wind developments, which are currently the most cost effective renewable""
BQENDGood example.
Onshore wind does indeed look fantastic and popular with the majority of the population behind it and the government is evil to ""ban"" it - but the truth is that it it isn't banned, only the subsidy is banned - this is because it only has a capacity factor of 24% at £85-89/MWh of subsidy (net of wholesale cost) and the places where it would work most effectively have a tendency to be some areas where it would be unwelcome, let alone the strings of power lines running to them.
Instead, the government concentrated on nuclear for £89.50/MWh but a cf of effectively 100% that works all the time with none of the seldom mentioned yet costly externals/storage/gas required by low capacity factor supplies.

The change has come upon us with disorienting speed. It is the kind of shift that typically takes two or three or four generations to sink in.
Our best scientists tell us insistently that a calamity is unfolding, that the life-support systems of the Earth are being damaged in ways that threaten our survival. Yet in the face of these facts we carry on as usual. 
Most citizens ignore or downplay the warnings; many of our intellectuals indulge in wishful thinking; and some influential voices declare that nothing at all is happening, that the scientists are deceiving us. Yet the evidence tells us that so powerful have humans become that we have entered this new and dangerous geological epoch, which is defined by the fact that the human imprint on the global environment has now become so large and active that it rivals some of the great forces of nature in its impact on the functioning of the Earth system.
This bizarre situation, in which we have become potent enough to change the course of the Earth yet seem unable to regulate ourselves, contradicts every modern belief about the kind of creature the human being is. So for some it is absurd to suggest that humankind could break out of the boundaries of history and inscribe itself as a geological force in deep time. Humans are too puny to change the climate, they insist, so it is outlandish to suggest we could change the geological time scale. Others assign the Earth and its evolution to the divine realm, so that it is not merely impertinence to suggest that humans can overrule the almighty, but blasphemy.
Our best scientists tell us insistently that a calamity is unfolding ... yet we carry on as usual.
Many intellectuals in the social sciences and humanities do not concede that Earth scientists have anything to say that could impinge on their understanding of the world, because the “world” consists only of humans engaging with humans, with nature no more than a passive backdrop to draw on as we please. 
The “humans-only” orientation of the social sciences and humanities is reinforced by our total absorption in representations of reality derived from media, encouraging us to view the ecological crisis as a spectacle that takes place outside the bubble of our existence.
It is true that grasping the scale of what is happening requires not only breaking the bubble but also making the cognitive leap to “Earth system thinking” – that is, conceiving of the Earth as a single, complex, dynamic system. It is one thing to accept that human influence has spread across the landscape, the oceans and the atmosphere, but quite another to make the jump to understanding that human activities are disrupting the functioning of the Earth as a complex, dynamic, ever-evolving totality comprised of myriad interlocking processes. 
But consider this astounding fact: with knowledge of the cycles that govern Earth’s rotation, including its tilt and wobble, paleo-climatologists are able to predict with reasonable certainty that the next ice age is due in 50,000 years’ time. Yet because carbon dioxide persists in the atmosphere for millennia, global warming from human activity in the 20th and 21st centuries is expected to suppress that ice age and quite possibly the following one, expected in 130,000 years. 
If human activity occurring over a century or two can irreversibly transform the global climate for tens of thousands of years, we are prompted to rethink history and social analysis as a purely intra-human affair.
How should we understand the disquieting fact that a mass of scientific evidence about the Anthropocene, an unfolding event of colossal proportions, has been insufficient to induce a reasoned and fitting response? 
For many, the accumulation of facts about ecological disruption seems to have a narcotising effect, all too apparent in popular attitudes to the crisis of the Earth system, and especially among opinion-makers and political leaders. A few have opened themselves to the full meaning of the Anthropocene, crossing a threshold by way of a gradual but ever-more disturbing process of evidence assimilation or, in some cases, after a realisation that breaks over them suddenly and with great force in response to an event or piece of information in itself quite small.
Beyond the science, the few alert to the plight of the Earth sense that something unfathomably great is taking place, conscious that we face a struggle between ruin and the possibility of some kind of salvation.
So today the greatest tragedy is the absence of a sense of the tragedy. The indifference of most to the Earth system’s disturbance may be attributed to a failure of reason or psychological weaknesses; but these seem inadequate to explain why we find ourselves on the edge of the abyss. 
How can we understand the miserable failure of contemporary thinking to come to grips with what now confronts us? A few years after the second atomic bomb was dropped, Kazuo Ishiguro wrote a novel about the people of Nagasaki, a novel in which the bomb is never mentioned yet whose shadow falls over everyone. The Anthropocene’s shadow too falls over all of us. 
Bookshops are regularly replenished with tomes about world futures ... as if climate scientists do not exist.
Yet the bookshops are regularly replenished with tomes about world futures from our leading intellectuals of left and right in which the ecological crisis is barely mentioned. They write about the rise of China, clashing civilizations and machines that take over the world, composed and put forward as if climate scientists do not exist. They prognosticate about a future from which the dominant facts have been expunged, futurologists trapped in an obsolete past. It is the great silence. 
I heard of a dinner party during which one of Europe’s most eminent psychoanalysts held forth ardently on every topic but fell mute when climate change was raised. He had nothing to say. For most of the intelligentsia, it is as if the projections of Earth scientists are so preposterous they can safely be ignored. 
Perhaps the intellectual surrender is so complete because the forces we hoped would make the world a more civilised place – personal freedoms, democracy, material advance, technological power – are in truth paving the way to its destruction. The powers we most trusted have betrayed us; that which we believed would save us now threatens to devour us. 
For some, the tension is resolved by rejecting the evidence, which is to say, by discarding the Enlightenment. For others, the response is to denigrate calls to heed the danger as a loss of faith in humanity, as if anguish for the Earth were a romantic illusion or superstitious regression.

This knowledge helps us predict what the future will look like. But, what most people are interested in is, “how will it affect me?” 
Some impacts we are pretty clear about, like the impacts related to sea level rise, increased storms and heavy precipitation, and increased drought and heat waves – particularly the impacts these events have on the economy. But climate change will affect us personally as well (by personally, I mean our physical person). 
In fact, climate change is already affecting personal human health around the world. This subject was the focus of a summary report just published by the Medical Society Consortium. What I really liked about this report is that it breaks down some of the key impacts by region. Unfortunately, the report is limited in scope to the USA. However, the general conclusions and trends can be illuminating for people outside the USA as well. 
What was also welcome is that this report was prepared by physicians (not climate scientists) of major medical societies and the conclusions are based on the best available and current information of both the climate and health fields.
So what did they find? Perhaps most importantly they find that climate change is already affecting our health. This isn’t a future problem for the next generation. It is a problem that is present and growing. They also report that some populations are more susceptible to climate change effects. Among the most vulnerable groups are children, student athletes, pregnant women, elderly, people with chronic health conditions, and the impoverished. A third key takeaway is that the problems will get much worse as climate change continues.
The study reports that if you live on the West Coast, wildfires, extreme temperatures, poorer air quality, extreme weather events, and agricultural risks are occurring. On the East Coast, you can add vector-borne diseases as a risk area. The central USA region is also similarly being affected.
As you dig deeper into the report, you learn about how these various climate-related features are affecting health. Each factor is dealt with by three questions: 1) What is happening? 2) How does it harm our health? 3) Who is being harmed?
For instance, with respect to extreme weather, the report correctly notes that the frequency and severity of some weather events such as heavy downpours, floods, droughts, and major storms are increasing. This harms our health because these events can cause direct injury and death as well as displacement. Extreme weather can also harm vital infrastructure like communication systems, homes, and reduce the availability of clean water and food. Finally, extreme weather can lead to acute outbreaks of infectious disease while at the same time reducing access to health care.
Air pollution is another example area. Climate change is affecting air quality in many ways, including increasing chemical reactions in surface air (air we breathe), increasing pollen, and leading to more forest fires. Lower air quality obviously affects people with breathing problems (such as asthma and allergies). It can prolong the pollen seasons and worsen allergy symptoms. Less obvious effects like increased humidity and more heavy rainfalls can exacerbate air-quality problems indoors through mold growth for instance. 
One issue I was not aware of was the threat of climate change to nutrition. Increases in carbon dioxide actually result in a lowered nutritional value of grown food such as wheat, rice, barley, and potatoes. This occurs because plants produce less protein and more sugars/starches in a carbon rich atmosphere. Plants also are less effective at taking in essential soil minerals. This is all in addition to the threats to our food system by droughts and extreme weather. We’ve certainly seen very severe droughts in the USA (2011 in Oklahoma and Texas, 2012 in Midwest USA, and 2012–2016 in California) that have caused severe problems in the agricultural industries.
This report was written in an easy-to-understand manner. It is accessible and authoritative. It also gets to the issue people are most concerned about – the impact of climate change in their lives.

The world’s appetite for meat is rising fast as incomes grow but the resulting greenhouse gas emissions, already 12% of the total, are also soaring and taming global warming will be impossible unless the trend is reversed. Rising demand is also leading to more of the world’s natural areas being converted to farmland, a key factor in the mass extinction of species currently unfolding.
Globally, twice as much land is used to raise cattle, pigs and other animals than is used to grow crops. Furthermore, a third of those crops harvested are fed back to livestock. The new research is the first systematic comparison of the environmental impact of various sources of food, and found that imitation meat and insects are vastly more efficient than raising livestock.
The work, published in the journal Global Food Security, found that if half of traditional animal products were replaced by imitation meat or insects the land required to produce the world’s food would be slashed by a third. However, the researcher found that another alternative – lab-grown meat – did not show such big advantages. 
Peter Alexander, at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland and who led the new research, acknowledges that eating insects is a challenging idea in western nations. But more than 2,000 species of insects are eaten by people across 119 nations today, including crickets and mealworm larvae. 
“It is very widespread, especially in Asia, and not seen as unusual in those cultures,” said Alexander. “We are not trying to mandate or even suggest some policy that you eat insects every day [but] our work indicates the potential benefits that are there.” The researchers also note that foods can become acceptable that were once shunned, as the tomato was in Europe for two centuries and as lobster was in the US.
Imitation meat, such as tofu and textured vegetable protein, has in the past been limited in its appeal. But the area is now seeing significant innovation, with products such as the Impossible burger promising the same taste as real meat. 
Alexander said it is crucial to tackle the world’s growing appetite for meat. “The developing world is eating more meat as they can afford to do so. That really is a concerning trend if it continues,” he said. “If everybody eats meat like an American does currently, then it’s going to be very difficult to sustain. With current production practices, more than the entire area of the planet would be required.”
The ideal solution is a global convergence on modest meat consumption, he said: “The west needs to eat less meat – though not none, I am not in favour of global vegetarianism – while allowing other countries with relatively low meat consumption to increase theirs.”
High levels of meat consumption are also known to damage people’s health, by contributing to obesity, heart disease and cancer, and a recent study showed that climate taxes on meat and milk would save 500,000 lives a year as well as cutting carbon emissions. 
“Even doing everything we can to reduce the emissions associated with meat production, rising demand means livestock emissions would take us beyond the global objective of 2C,” said Rob Bailey, research director for energy, environment and resources at Chatham House. “Therefore dietary change is a precondition for avoiding catastrophic climate change.”
Bailey said assessing the land requirements of different strategies was important: “Competition for land will increase in the future, so we have to find ways to feed a growing population without expanding agriculture further into forests.”
He said simply eating less meat, rather than substitutes, cuts environmental impacts the most. “We shouldn’t forget that the average British person eats two to three times more meat than is good for them, so this makes sense from both an environmental and a health perspective.” But he acknowledged this may not be easy and said the production of lab-grown meat was likely to become more efficient in future.
Government and campaign groups have had little appetite for tackling the overconsumption of meat, but Alexander said awareness of the issue is growing rapidly, though action is slow. “We are moving slowly in the right direction,” he said. “There is some cause for optimism but equally some cause for pessimism. It depends what side of the bed I get out of.” ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/05/eat-insects-and-fake-meat-to-cut-impact-of-livestock-on-the-planet-study

Maybe. That's only right if the centre of mass is 100m high. If the bottom of the reservoir is 100m high and the surface is 232m high then for a cubic reservoir the centre of mass would be 166m high and so h = 166.

A British electricity company published a plan to build a pumped-storage hydro-scheme in Scotland which was planned to have 30GWh of energy storage capacity.
SSE - COIRE GLAS HYDRO SCHEME
BQSTART
Coire Glas 600MW pumped storage scheme, near Loch Lochy, gained consent in December 2013 and would more than double the total volume of current pumped storage capacity in the UK. The scheme is capable of delivering 30GWh of electricity to the system, meaning that, at maximum capacity, the water in the upper reservoir could provide up to 450MW of power to the grid for nearly three days.

I can help to quantify the need for pumped storage.
Modelling of wind and pumped-storage power
""I used estimated relative costs of wind turbines versus pumped-storage hydro to arrive at a optimal minimum cost balance –
• store energy capacity = 1.5 days x peak demand power
• annual maximum wind power = 7 x peak demand power ""
Assuming this pair of equations as our guide, we can calculate how much pumped storage for a given amount of annual maximum wind power.
Suppose the annual maximum wind power is 7 GW (makes the arithmetic easy).
Rearranging the 2nd equation.
peak demand power = 1/7 x annual maximum wind power
= 1/7 x 7 GW = 1 GW (only)
This means that although there will be plenty of times the wind turbines generate much more than 1 GW, we can only really boast that the wind turbines can for sure supply on demand, at any time, night or day, any day of the week, any day of the year,a guaranteed1 GW.
If the demand is likely to be more than that - say 6 GW in total, then we'd better have some other way of generating the other 5 GW in case and not rely on just those 7 GW annual maximum wind power wind turbines!
The required pumped-storage to pair with this example 7 GW of annual maximum wind power guaranteeing 1 GW peak demand power would be calculated from the first equation
store energy capacity = 1.5 days x peak demand power
= 1.5 days x 1 GW = 1.5 GW-days = 36 GWh
So that means that what would be required are pumped-storage hydro schemes which generate 1 GW or 1,000 MW and have energy storage of 36 GWh or 36,000MWh.

Well so long as Norway is willing to co-invest in additional interconnectors, we should too. Norway won't invest in 10s of GW of interconnectors unless it intends to supply power through those interconnectors.
However, we should have a detailed plan prepared for if and when Norway say ""enough"", no more interconnectors! That's the eventuality which the Strathdearn Pumped-Storage Hydro Scheme proposal is intended to simulate invest in. We need to invest in fleshing the already published Strathdearn outline concept into detailed shovel-ready blue-prints.

Unfortunately when the wind in not blowing in the UK it's not unlikely that it won't be blowing in Northern Europe either.

A UK that is more reliant on the variable nature of wind and solar power would make such interconnectivity with other countries even more important, he said.
BQEND
Interconnectors from Britain to Norway's hydro power or France's nuclear power make a lot of sense because these links can supply power on demand when our intermittent generators cannot.
Norway can use our surplus wind power by quickly reducing their hydroelectric generation, though France cannot so quickly ramp their nuclear power down in response to our wind blowing strongly.
So the interconnectors to Norway, though longer, would seem to be the most useful and the best investment for Britain and from other countries too.
Not so the VikingLink connector between Britain and Denmark because we can't be sure that Denmark's wind will be blowing strongly when our wind isn't and vice versa.
The VikingLink website assures us -
BQSTART
Wind generation outputs between the UK and Denmark show low correlation and periods of high production are unlikely to occur at the same time in both countries.
BQEND
Really? Well where's the link to the research study which has shown this alleged ""low correlation""? That would be a critical piece of evidence, upon which the feasibility of VikingLink depends which really needs to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.
It matters because when Britain's and Denmark's wind turbines are together becalmed, both suffering shortage of power, VikingLink will be useless.
Likewise, when Britain's and Denmark's wind turbines are together enjoying a surplus of power, VikingLink once again will be useless.
I don't doubt that there will be times that VikingLink would be useful but wouldn't both countries, Britain and Denmark be wiser to re-invest the capital intended for VikingLink in additional interconnectors to Norway?
Particularly when Norway is so close to Denmark, I'd have to question Denmark's interest in VikingLink at this time.
In future, VikingLink may make a lot more sense if and when Britain has committed to building much more pumped-storage hydroelectric schemes, most likely in Scotland, which are very useful for storing surplus wind and solar or other renewable energy and generating power when wind turbines are becalmed.
However, Britain hasn't significantly increased its pumped-storage capacity yet and neither have we committed to building any new large capacity energy storage schemes like the Strathdearn PSH scheme, despite my repeated advice to do so.
STRATHDEARN PUMPED-STORAGE HYDRO SCHEME (180 GW / 6,800 GWh)World’s biggest-ever pumped-storage hydro-scheme, for Scotland?
So whereas interconnectors to Norway are a no-brainer for both the UK and Denmark, I would advise keeping the Viking Longboats in harbour for now.

And the other thing is that we'll be a global trading superpower, reinventing global trade like some kind of Empire 2.
Except there are no plans to grow anything we make to make it better, just sell the stuff we sell to the EU elsewhere. And both our exports and imports will attract tariffs where they didn't before. Making stuff we import more expensive, especially with the falling £, and exports less competitive, although in some things the lower £ might compensate, so no overall benefit there.
Plus not being part of a myriad of agreements, standards, and paying the cost for our own replacements.
And that seems to be it. It's all very well pulling together, but on what and to where?
There are no other benefits other than a load of tosh. Net contribution is £8.5bn through government books, but the National Audit Office says the EU pays another £3bn direct to companies and institutes for research and technology projects, so actual net is £105.7m/week to get all the benefits and avoid all these problems.
Davis has admitted immigration won't change for years because we need the workers ""until the British are ready"", whatever that means. 
And taking back control, which we had anyway, apparently means changing the EU for the WTO, that even slower lethargic body of 164 nations.
So no other ""benefits"" to Brexit, and on the score, UK is going to lose quite heavily. More if we are on the brink of another global recession as finance commentators expect soon (kinda time for the next one, Brexit may even be the trigger for this one).

The loudest warnings came from MPs, peers, engineers and the industry itself over the impact that blocks to trade or freedom of movement would have on the nuclear and oil sectors.
However, the UK’s departure from the union also risks damaging urgent efforts to make the continent’s energy systems greener and more efficient, an adviser to the head of the United Nations has told the Observer.
Rachel Kyte, special representative on sustainable energy to UN secretary general António Guterres, said anything that hampered the global switch to lower carbon power would be regrettable.
“Brexit is at best a distraction, at worst a disruption of the need to continue to drive energy productivity across the UK and Europe – of having a much less energy-intensive economy and getting more productivity from each unit of energy, of having a cleaner energy system, of having much less use of carbon-intensive fuels,” said Kyte.
The former World Bank executive highlighted the increasing amount of renewable energy generation in the UK, which had led to what she branded “breakthroughs”, such as the country’s grid recently going a whole day without coal power.
As Europe gets an increasing amount of power from wind, solar and hydro, Kyte said it was vital that Brexit did not harm the growing number of interconnector cables being built.
“We are seeing the beginnings of a highly interconnected European market and there are benefits to the UK of being part of that, so one hopes that interconnectedness will not be affected,” she said.
From the power that keeps Britain’s homes lit to the crude that keeps its cars running, here is how Brexit could affect the energy sector:
At least eight cables are being laid under the sea or through the Channel Tunnel to trade power between the UK, Ireland, France, Belgium, Denmark and Norway, tripling the existing number of UK interconnectors. Billions of pounds are committed to the projects under way, and ones even further afield have been mooted, such as a cable to bring Iceland’s volcanic power to the UK.
The government hopes these interconnectors will continue to operate post-Brexit, and wants more beyond those planned already.
“The ambitions are to go higher,” business secretary Greg Clark recently told MPs, citing a UK-France connector approved in February as a sign that leaving the EU was not affecting investor confidence. A UK that is more reliant on the variable nature of wind and solar power would make such interconnectivity with other countries even more important, he said.
Key to the future prospects for interconnectors will be whether the UK continues as a member of the EU internal energy market, in a similar fashion to Norway. Alternatives include tracking the EU regime without any formal arrangement, or striking a series of bilateral arrangements similar to those Switzerland has made with the bloc.
Being outside the EU market would be worse, according to experts. Silke Goldberg, a lawyer at Herbert Smith Freehills, said: “While the UK government is supportive of interconnectors, there are some concerns among investors that the economic case for new interconnectors in the Channel may be affected if the UK is not part of the internal energy market and electricity imports are subject to trade tariffs.”
Those building the cables, which are made from vast amounts of copper, appear undeterred. “As long as there is a need on both sides to do trade, there is not really a worst case I can see, as the interest is on both sides,” said Auke Lont, head of the Norwegian state grid operator Statnett, which is building the world’s longest undersea cable between the Norway and the UK.
The North Sea Link interconnector is expected to mostly be used for exporting hydro power from Norway to the UK when complete in 2020, after Brexit, but will also export surplus wind power from Britain in the other direction. “The moral of the story is there is enough economic interest on both sides that it will easily withstand the fact that the UK now leaves the EU,” Lont said.
The nuclear industry potentially stands to lose the most from leaving the EU. Buried in the small print of Theresa May’s Brexit bill in January was the news that Britain would quit a vital atomic power treaty: Euratom, which underpins the transport of nuclear fuel and other materials across Europe.
Last week saw a flurry of warnings from the industry, MPs and peers over the consequences of that decision. The nuclear trade body raised the prospect of disruption across the industry if alternatives are not in place within two years, urging ministers to avoid a “cliff edge”. Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said the difficulty was not the technicalities of putting in place new cooperation agreements with nuclear states or new inspection regimes for nuclear material, but the time window imposed by the article 50 process.
“It’s an extremely pressing timeframe,” he told the Observer. “We’ve already lost three months by the time the general election is factored in.”
Britain quitting the treaty has also raised doubts over the future of its involvement in research and development on nuclear fusion, a cleaner form of atomic power. The Joint European Torus (JET), a fusion research project at Culham in Oxfordshire, receives £50m a year from Euratom. But the current contract runs out in 2018, halfway through Brexit talks.
One way for the UK’s nuclear industry to get back on the front foot after leaving would be to focus on a new generation of mini-reactors, according to a leading engineering body.
“Pushing ahead on the demonstration and commercialisation of small modular reactors would be a key way for the UK to once again become a world leader in the field,” said Jenifer Baxter, head of energy and environment at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. But delays to a government competition to develop such reactors do not bode well.
The government has given no hints on whether it will retain membership of the EU’s flagship climate change regime, the Emissions Trading System. The carbon market currently costs industries such as oil, cement, and steel just under €5 per tonne of carbon they emit. The oil and gas industry are among the sectors seeking clarity on whether the UK will stay or go.
Some experts think the market’s links to EU institutions may mean an exit is inevitable. “The government has not announced plans to leave the ETS, although disputes are handled by the European court of justice, which may be a red line,” said the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank.
When Nick Hurd, the climate minister, was recently asked if the UK had an alternative lined up to the ETS, he said: “We’re analysing it, as you’d expect us to do.” An obvious time to leave would be before the current phase of the scheme ends in 2019.
On green energy, Clark maintains no decision has been taken on whether the UK will stick to the EU’s renewable energy directive after leaving the union. But government sources have said that after Brexit the UK will probably scrap the EU target to get 15% of all energy from renewable sources by 2020. That would seem likely if the Tories win the general election.
The UK has lobbied Europe in recent years in favour of carbon-cutting targets and against ones for renewables, to leave ministers free to pursue their preference to largely use new nuclear to meet climate goals, rather than wind or solar.
The big post-EU concern for the UK’s ailing oil and gas industry is the prospect of new tariffs being imposed.
Industry body Oil &amp; Gas UK warned last week that a hard Brexit, falling back on World Trade Organisation rules, would see trading costs almost double from £600m a year to £1.1bn because of changing tariff rates. At best, trading costs might go down £100m if the UK can strike more favourable deals outside the UK.
In a letter to Theresa May, the industry also stressed the international nature of its workforce, and called on the government to prioritise “frictionless access to markets and labour” during Brexit talks.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/06/brexit-energy-taking-back-control-losing-power

Something to think about as one reads the science on global warming, the warming that keeps surprising scientists with how fast impacts are hitting.
From Scientific American regarding the IPCC.
BQSTART
Across two decades and thousands of pages of reports, the world's most authoritative voice on climate science has consistently understated the rate and intensity of climate change and the danger those impacts represent, say a growing number of studies on the topic. . . . 
The IPCC’s overly conservative reading of the science, they say, means governments and the public could be blindsided by the rapid onset of the flooding, extreme storms, drought, and other impacts associated with catastrophic global warming. (my emphasis)
BQEND
From an article titled Tail Risk vs Alarmism, by Dr. Kerry Emanuel, the Cecil and Ida Green professor of atmospheric science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he has been on the faculty since 1981.
BQSTART
The accusation of “alarmism” is quite effective in making scientists skittish in conveying tail risk, and talking about the tail of the distribution is a sure recipe to be so labelled.
BQEND
And from an article in the NY Times titled The Secrets in Greenland's Ice Sheet, where the journalist is speaking with the NASA glaciologist Eric Rignot:
BQSTART
When I mentioned that some climate scientists had told me in confidence over the years that they held more pessimistic views than they felt comfortable expressing in public, Rignot shrugged with a smile and said, ‘‘They are chicken.’’

Amusing Ourselves to Death: Huxley vs Orwell:
http://highexistence.com/amusing-ourselves-to-death-huxley-vs-orwell/
Huxley was far closer to what has happened than Orwell. The last battle will be Orwellian because of our now circumstance, Trump isn't prepared to spend a cent on climate change mitigation, but is spending heavily on the military, why do you think that is?
The last battle will be on Orwellian terms, but the war was most definitely won by Huxley's vision.

Add American War to that...
""American War will give you chills. Set in in 2075, Omar El Akkad's debut presents a fractured and frightening America, where the sun burns hot and the country has turned into war zones and refugee camps. Over the course of two decades, Akkad traces the fate of the Chestnut family, who flee their home in the south and spend the better part of their lives in a sprawling, impoverished encampment. This is where Sarat, a young, brave, tomboy, comes of age: “Perhaps the longing for safety was itself just another kind of violence—a violence of cowardice, silence, submission. What was safety, anyway, but the sound of a bomb falling on someone else’s home?” Albert Gaines, a radicalized Southerner, takes Sarat under his wing, equipping her with the fervor and tactics needed to win the war. Akkad piercingly describes the ravaged towns, the gel packets of fruit rations, the torturous effects of growing up in war. Written with precise care for the fictional truth—news articles, press releases, and oral histories emerge throughout – the book sounds a warning blast.

What if we didn’t have enough water? What if the world was running out of food? What if that was coupled with a catastrophic global financial crisis? What would Australia look like? And how would its citizens cope?
Debut novelist Sally Abbott, 57, didn’t start with the dystopian scenario, although her novel is certainly dystopian; she began with her characters. 
For her protagonist, Clare, the best years of her marriage – and her life – seem to be behind her. At night she walks, with no particular destination in mind, around the town in which she lives with her mute husband, subsisting on ever-diminishing government-issued food parcels. After she returns home from her walks, she fills diary after diary with meaningless notes.
But even in these straitened circumstances, Clare has a lot to lose. There’s been an economic collapse and the government is in the process of shutting down “non-viable” country towns, forcing people to leave their homes and move to the city. The waiting list for a depressing box-like apartment on the city fringe is years and years. Even those with almost nothing feel like there is still further yet to fall.
The story of Closing Down “grew very slowly”, Abbott tells Guardian Australia. “I began it around five years ago and I didn’t really write it in a structured, linear way. It was the main characters – the main people that I played around with in the beginning – they were very real for me and vivid.”
At the time, Abbott was a student of the Faber Academy under the tutelage of the writer Sophie Cunningham. She and other would-be novelists met once a week to develop their work in progress. By the time the course finished, Abbott had about 35,000 words of a manuscript.
Abbott won the $10,000 inaugural Richell prize for emerging writers in 2015 for her partly completed manuscript. Named for the late Hachette publisher Matt Richell, the prize invites unsigned authors to submit the first three chapters of a manuscript plus a synopsis. Abbott came across the prize on Twitter and had enough of a manuscript to enter. Her work was chosen over 969 other submissions, and she was later offered a publishing contract, giving her almost seven months to hand in the finished manuscript.
Much of the work features a strong sense of place. Before moving into public relations, Abbott, who now lives in Castlemaine in central Victoria, worked as a journalist in regional areas. While Abbott says she deliberately set the novel “in a non-place”, she nevertheless “did a lot of driving through the Wimmera and the Grampians, and there are all these little towns that, unless you go off the highway, you don’t even know they are there”.
Abbott had read an academic paper that questioned the viability of many of Australia’s tiny towns, and the seeds of the book were sown.
Dystopian fiction is having something of a moment, with Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel The Handmaid’s Tale being adapted for television and Orwell’s 1984 reappearing in the bestseller lists nearly 70 years after it was published.
Climate fiction, or “cli-fi”, a sub-genre in which Closing Down might sit, also reflects our very real anxieties about climate change and the resulting economic and social catastrophes.
In the near future of Abbott’s novel, in an echo of Cormac McCarthy, many of those that are displaced by the regional town closures take to the road, walking along the shoulder and camping out.
Abbott also imagined food shortages caused by extreme weather events, and, perhaps controversially, invokes the spectre of foreign ownership, imagining that Australia has sold most of its rural and regional areas to the Chinese government, which farms it for its own population.
“I was reading about longer-term impacts about climate change, drought, storms and famine,” says Abbott. “And there were also stories about artificial foods and meat made out of chemicals. I wondered how sustainable into the future it was for people around the world to keep eating the way we are eating.”
“I know there are bleak parts of the book but I also hoped to some extent that there was a note of optimism. It’s important that as the world gets more difficult for people – that kindness to strangers is as important as it ever has been.”

As Bassireland has kindly told you, it's people not states who produce CO2 emissions. There's no point in comparing the CO2 emissions of Nauru with those of Australia or those of Australia with those of China, as these are countries of vastly different sizes. Hence per capita emissions makes more sense in comparing countries.
If what matters is how much CO2 is produced, then per capita CO2 emissions do matter, because how much emissions are produced is the product of the per capita emissions and the total population or number of capita. So as half of the equation to calculate emissions produced, per capita emissions do matter.
""countries that don't have huge populations obviously are going to look like huge polluters if you apply per capita"" emissions.
Armenia population 3 million, per capita emissions 1.8 tons; Azerbaijan population 9.6 million, per capita emissions 3.8 tons; Berlize population 359,000, per capita emissions 1.5 tons; Benin population 10.1 million, per capita emissions 0.6 tons; Bhutan population 775,000, per capita emissions 1.2 tons; Bolivia population 10.1 million, per capita emissions 1.9 tons; Nauru population 10,000, per capita emissions 4.3 tons; U S population 320 million,per capita emissions 16.4 tons; Australia population 24 million, per capita emissions 16.3 tons; China population 1,400 million, per capita emissions 7.6 tons. 
If you're applying per capita emissions, do countries such as Armenia, Azeribaijan, Berlize, Benin, Bhutan, Bolivia and Nauru, that don't have huge populations, look like huge polluters? No they don't. So why were you sprouting such arrant rubbish that is not the reality of things?
It's actually a bit insulting that you try to use such misleading rubbish divorced from reality in this discussions. To ignore history is repeat the mistakes of the past. As you are the one who wants to talk about the CO2 emissions of countries rather than per capita emissions, it's incumbent upon you to be honest and tell us which country you live in. Every country has a history, and mot every country cleared it's forests at the same time. Let's talk about right now and right then. Talking about what happens in the past does not get you bogged down, but instead enables you to understand the present and the future, which produces a more informed and productive discussion.
China population 1,400 million produces 27% of the world's CO2 emissions. America, Canada, Australia, Saudi Arabia, and Russia, population 556 million produce 27% of the worlds emissions. The other 5,444 people in the world produce the other 46%. Per capita C02 emissions are an important part of the equations. I spent today looking after my almost 7 year old grandson. His best friend at school has a Chinese father.

No, that is not obvious at all. People, not states, consume fuels and that consumption emits greenhouse gases. Using your logic of course the US and indeed the rest of the world might like to reduce your emissions to the level of Ireland: as a solution it suits me, and it would achieve the necessary reductions. Definitely encourage Scottish independence: as an independent state they'd have no reduction per capita whereas as part of the uk they'd need to reduce emissions by 90%.

Agreed. But we're trying to measure the absolute presence of CO2 in the air (not the system or cycle) at a particular time.

Nature bats last.
Burning fossil fuels disrupts the long-term carbon cycle.
The geological record contains evidence of previous events which disrupted the long-term carbon cycle; they appear in the geochemical record as negative carbon isotope excursions.
These ancient fast-warming events are called hyperthermals.
An example of a hyperthermal event is the End-Permian event, around 250 million years ago.
Researchers have found fly ash, one of the products of coal combustion, in rocks laid down around the time of this extinction event:
http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v4/n2/abs/ngeo1069.html
A large amount of coal had been burned over a period of tens of thousands of years.
The coal was burned by volcanic eruptions that happened in Siberia, which produced a large area of volcanic rocks called the Siberian Traps.
The burning actually happened underground, with the carbon dioxide and ash mixing with magma.
This produced vast amounts of CO2 which warmed the Earth and changed the chemistry of the oceans:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25859043
Humans, of course, are more efficient..... in a couple of centuries, far more fossil fuels have been burned than happened in thousands of years during the Siberian Traps eruptions.
The End-Permian event caused the extinction of 92% of species.
Biodiversity took 10 million years to recover.
Here's an additional article on the End-Permian:

What an amazing plot it would need to be, this climate change conspiracy.
It would need to involve many tens of thousands of scientists, in dozens of countries, in physics, geology, and many other fields of science, over the last 160 years.
But they have been exposed by a few brave bloggers and fossil fuel billionaires.....
Meanwhile, a real conspiracy, the Watergate cover-up, involved fewer than 100 people, but it unravelled in around 2 years.
160 years? Oh yes......

But upon pumping carbon dioxide into another receiver, also exposed to sunlight, Mrs. Foote wrote the mercury in the thermometer leaped, with the one “containing the carbon dioxide becoming much hotter, “more so than the others.” She added on being removed from sunlight the temperature took many times as long in cooling as the other gases did.

The elevated carbon emissions to the atmosphere from burning of fossil fuels, since around 1870 has blocked an ever larger portion of absorbed incoming solar energy, in land and oceans, from being radiated back to space. That is the Earth Radiation Budget is not balanced and the Earth must therefore warm in order to emit more infrared energy until sufficient reaches the top of the atmosphere to return to space. It is the atmospheric gasses which contain carbon, principally CO2, that are opaque to infrared at some wavelengths. 
The amount of warming required to return the Earth to balance is proportional to both the level of CO2 and the cumulative time spent elevated. Science expresses this as the amount of warming expected from the cumulative atmospheric carbon relative to pre industrial times.
This in turn sets a total atmospheric carbon budget for a given temperature rise. The situation is complicated because there are many large natural carbon feedbacks, some fast and some slow, some negative, and some positive. As the planet warms there are some many large carbon reservoirs that may be released to the atmosphere at a temperature Tipping Point - these very large positive feedbacks will then swiftly push the temperature higher, potentially triggering more Tipping Points.
So what is the safe climate operating point for a Global Mean Surface Temperature compatible with maintaining global food chains and the stable habitable zones necessary for large scale civilisation ? 
As with all climate science there are known error bars and probabilities for the range of answers, but the only known safe operating point is associated with CO2 at around 350 ppm - that is back to 1990 levels with GMST less than +1C.
+2C GMST is a do not cross red line consensus of climate science based upon current assessments of the Transient (100 year) Climate Sensitivity - dangerous Tipping Points are somewhere, but not far, beyond +2C. In other words the further the Earth warms beyond +2C, and the longer the planet operates beyond +2C, the greater the danger of being pushed swiftly on to +3C....+4C....+? 
What does this mean for humanity ? Beyond +2C lies catastrophic climate change that we can neither adapt to or mitigate in the time available: global food chains will destabilise and many will fail, in the face of extreme climate events, hot and cold, floods and drought, wild temperature swings, raging forest fires, shifting ocean currents, accelerating sea level rise exacerbated by more frequent storm surges, top soil and coasts will erode faster, habitable zones will migrate faster than many species can keep up with, Widespread savage wars of survival will be inevitable. 
The science is clear - beyond +2C the risks to civilisation from unstoppable and uncontrollable further warming are so great it would be very foolish not to do everything possible to avoid experiencing them.
Nor is +2C an assured safe zone. Arctic Sea Ice extent and thickness appears to be close to or may have already passed its' tipping point of no return to 1980 levels. The loss of albedo, the reflectivity of flat sea ice that returns 50 to 90 % of incoming solar radiation directly to space, has given way to absorption of 90% of that incoming energy in the now exposed extra expanse of dark ocean. Today the planet has warmed +1.1C but we have not yet experienced anything like the full consequences, because the Oceans take in some 97% of all the excess energy blocked by greenhouse gasses. 
Therefore we must reduce carbon emissions and the sooner we do so, the greater the benefit from avoiding yet more severe consequences. 
This graphic shows a summary of the remaining fossil fuel budget expressed as current emissions for not exceeding a specific GMST with a given probability, 33%, 50% or 66%
https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-four-years-left-one-point-five-carbon-budget
There is no way the world can reach zero carbon emissions in 20 years, and 32 years would be extremely difficult. So +1.5 C is impossible - it would require large scale removal of CO2 from the atmosphere. +2C may not be possible even with just a 33% probability of success and deploying large scale Carbon Capture and Storage.
The only way to buy more decades for a global industrial green energy revolution of power generation, transport, manufacturing and agriculture to achieve near zero emissions, is to cut global emissions right now and and keep cutting as fast as possible.

In a strongly worded letter, the heads of Oxfam, the RSPB, Greenpeace, WWF, Christian Aid, Cafod and other groups have called on the prime minister to “pick up the phone” to the US president to warn him of the consequences of leaving the Paris accord, something Trump pledged to do within 100 days of coming to power, a timeline that passed last week.
The UK played a leading role in the complex negotiations that resulted in nearly 200 nations making the unprecedented commitment to tackle global climate change, signed in Paris in December 2015.
The agreement is seen as crucial for the success of efforts to limit the global temperature rise to below 2C above pre-industrial levels by 2100. But reports in the US suggest that support for leaving the climate treaty is gaining ground among Trump’s key advisers as the president – who has said climate change is a Chinese hoax – prepares to deliver his decision, which is expected this week.
The reported shift in opinion among White House aides comes despite strong calls from leading businesses and scientists for the US to remain in the climate accord. Last week, major US companies including Google, Microsoft and Walmart wrote to Trump stating the economic and business case for the US continuing to be a party to the agreement.
May herself recently came under pressure from cross-party MPs and leading scientists who urged her to use her influence to persuade the US president to acknowledge and act on climate change.
A recent ComRes survey showed almost two-thirds of British adults (64%) accept that climate change is happening, and that it is primarily due to human activity.
The joint letter warns May that Trump “may be about to undermine a vital global agreement on which the health, security, and prosperity of hundreds of millions of people depend”.
It continues: “This climate agreement was an extraordinary feat of international diplomacy, and the UK played a crucial role in securing it. This is now the best chance humanity has to avert full-blown climate change, and may well be the last. A strong majority of people in the UK believe climate change is happening. They will be looking to you as the prime minister to champion science, moral responsibility and international cooperation.”
In recent days European ministers and EU officials have been lobbying senior White House staff after hearing Trump was leaning heavily towards leaving the accord.
The UN environment chief, Erik Solheim, has also warned the US that it will “shoot itself in the foot” if it quits the Paris deal because China, India and Europe will snap up the best power sector jobs in future.
“There is no doubt where the future is and that is what all the private sector companies have understood,” Solheim told Reuters. “The future is green. Obviously if you are not a party to the Paris agreement, you will lose out. And the main losers will be the people of the United States itself because all the interesting, fascinating new green jobs would go to China and to the other parts of the world that are investing heavily in this.”

The Guardian has spoken to a number of officials from key countries before Trump makes a decision on the Paris agreement this month. Trump’s announcement might come as early as this week.
“Trump’s actions on the climate are worrying,” said Izabella Teixeira, the former Brazilian environment minister. “Although it is still too early to be sure what his strategy is for the US, the signs so far of backsliding are a concern to anyone who was involved in the long process that lead up to the Paris agreement,” said the veteran negotiator, who was credited with a key role in securing the international deal in 2015.
“We certainly could not have imagined this political picture when we signed the agreement in Paris,” said Teixeira. “It is a concern because we saw a similar situation when George W Bush came to power and backed away from the Kyoto protocol”.
The US president has started peeling away many of the pollution rules imposed by Barack Obama’s administration, such as the signature Clean Power Plan, new vehicle emissions standards, clean water regulations, and curbs on toxic discharge from power plants.
Keystone XL and Dakota Access, two major and controversial oil pipelines, have been approved. Last week, the president ordered reviews of protected areas on land and water with the goal of opening them up to further oil and gas drilling. Trump said he was “unleashing American energy and clearing the way for thousands and thousands of high-paying American energy jobs.”
The administration is now mulling whether the US should stay in the Paris climate agreement, a landmark deal struck by nearly 200 nations to lower greenhouse gas emissions that was ratified last year. Trump has previously promised to “cancel” the deal, but his advisers are reportedly split over whether quitting the compact would be worth the resulting diplomatic fallout.
Last week a senior UN official warned the US would suffer economically if it chooses to pull out of Paris, citing the clean energy jobs that will be created as countries decarbonize their electricity sources. “There is no doubt where the future is and that is what all the private sector companies have understood,” Erik Solheim, UN environment chief, told Reuters. “The future is green. Obviously if you are not a party to the Paris agreement, you will lose out. And the main losers of course will be the people of the United States itself because all the interesting, fascinating new green jobs would go to China and to the other parts of the world that are investing heavily in this.”
 Pacific island nations particularly vulnerable to the rising seas, heatwaves and droughts wrought by increasing global temperatures are particularly alarmed at the sharp reversal in climate policy by the US, the world’s second largest emitter of greenhouse gases.
 Frank Bainimarama, the prime minister of Fiji, has written to Trump to urge him to stay within the Paris agreement. Bainimarama will officially head the UN climate change talks taking place in Bonn, Germany in November. “Climate change is not a hoax. it is frighteningly real,” Bainimarama told a conference in Melbourne. “Billions of people are losing the ability to feed themselves. Don’t let the whole side down by leaving, just when we have a game plan.”
Hilda Heine, the president of the Marshall Islands, a scattered group of low-lying coral islands, said she was “extremely disappointed to see the United States seeking to roll back its efforts to reduce emissions”. She added: “My country’s survival depends on every country delivering on the promises they made in Paris. Our own commitment to it will never waiver.”
Given America’s huge emissions and diplomatic clout, its domestic climate policies are being closely watched by other governments. They have noted Trump’s intention to cut the Environmental Protection Agency’s budget by nearly a third – even though Congress had other ideas – and the climate change denial of many in the administration, including the president himself.
“I’m very worried by what is happening in the US regarding climate change. It was an extraordinarily strong shock to hear that Trump has signed a decree to revise the clean power plan,” said Ramón Méndez, former head of Uruguay’s climate policy who was among those who hammered out the Paris agreement in 2015. “Of all of Trump’s policies, this is the one with the worst consequences for the world.”
Without the US – which is responsible for almost a fifth of all emissions on the planet – Méndez told the Guardian it would be extremely difficult to reach the goal of keeping temperature rises below 1.5C. It would also set a bad example. “If an important country like the US, which has the second biggest emissions after China, doesn’t abide by the Paris agreement, then the Paris agreement is broken. It will make it harder for other countries to maintain their ambitions,” he said.
Mendez said it was “terrifying” that Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the EPA, has denied that carbon dioxide was a primary driver of global warming. Pruitt’s denial contradicts the EPA’s own scientists, although the future visibility of such evidence is in question as the agency is currently “updating language” on climate change and regulations on its website.
Should the US completely vacate the international effort to combat global warming, many observers consider it an opportunity for China to use the climate forum to assert itself more forcefully. But Zhang Haibin, a Peking University expert in climate negotiations, said Beijing was taking a “wait-and-see attitude” towards Trump’s climate policies.
The academic said that Xie Zhenhua, China’s chief climate change negotiator, had indicated to him that the Chinese government believed Washington had “not yet formed a clear global policy on climate change”.
Zhang said he saw only a 40% chance that Trump would follow through on threats to abandon the Paris agreement. “I think the greater likelihood is that Trump will end up not pulling out of the pact but instead adopting a passive approach towards it [and] meeting none of its commitments. I call it a ‘semi-withdrawal,” he said.
However, Zhang warned that even that kind of reversal would deal a heavy blow to international efforts to tackle climate change. He predicted that Trump’s lack of interest in the issue would create “a vacuum of a global leadership” that would make it harder to reduce global emissions and finance mechanisms such as the Green Climate Fund.
Many activists have called on China, the world’s largest emitter, to step up as the global climate champion. Chinese president Xi Jinping appeared to seize that mantle just days before Trump’s inauguration, using a speech in Geneva to urge the US not to derail the Paris agreement and warn: “There is only one earth in the universe and we mankind have only one homeland.”
However, Zhang rejected the idea that his country was pushing to become the world’s climate leader. “I think there are two key words to describe China’s leadership role in combating climate change: one is ‘stabilizer’ and the other is ‘coordinator’,” he said.
“China should be a climate stabilizer because Trump is someone who is quite uncertain. China should stabilize the existing international order and its norms. And China has the ability to connect and integrate all involved parties in order to build a united global front to combat climate change.”
Environmentalists hope to slow Trump’s ambitions by using legal action to entangle attempts to scrap the Clean Power Plan and rewrite other pollution standards. But those who helped negotiate the previous US position on climate change fear momentum will be lost at a crucial juncture in the effort to avoid dangerous warming.
“The Trump people can slow-walk things, and a delay of three of five years is significant because with climate change we can’t sit and twiddle our thumbs for too much longer,” said Nathan Hultman, who worked on climate policy at the White House during Obama’s presidency.
“Paris is a robust agreement but other countries looking at us and saying ‘why should we do anything then?’ is a risk. We are seeing some shift in leadership but many countries are hoping this a short withdrawal. This problem isn’t going away.”
Hultman, who has attended international climate talks for more than 20 years as a negotiator or observer, said Trump’s administration is “far more unpredictable” than that of Bush, which withdrew the US from the Kyoto climate agreement.
“Unlike the George W Bush administration, there’s now no clear core ideology or advising strategy as to how decisions are made,” he said. “There was some pragmatism under Bush. So far Trump has been a bull in a china shop.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/07/trump-climate-change-officials-worried

Shezad Dawood on his oceanic epic Leviathan,article,http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/may/07/shezad-dawood-leviathan-venice-climate-change-migrants,0,"The giant squid, democracy, mental health, migration – big beasts, one and all. And each plays a role in Leviathan, a cycle of 10 films by artist Shezad Dawood that traces links from human activity to marine ecology and back again. The fates of crayfish, phytoplankton and spots on the sun are intertwined with that of the desperate souls crossing the Mediterranean in ill-suited vessels, heading for countries swinging away from liberal democracy.
Leviathan is, as its name suggests, ambitious verging on the unwieldy: Dawood jokes that he and his wife refer to the project simply as LV around the home, to stop him freaking out. As well as the films – to be shot and released over the next three years – there’s a novel, paintings, sculptures and a series of talks and symposia featuring scientists and researchers who have contributed. The first two episodes, as well as a suite of paintings on cloth and a lustrous resin sculpture, will all be shown in Venice alongside this year’s biennale.
Ironically, the project commenced with a severe attack of writer’s block. Commissioned to pen an essay on democracy for an art publication in 2013, Dawood’s writing didn’t exactly go to plan. “About two years later,” he says, “I had reams of notes that read like somebody with severe multiple personality disorder.” He finally confessed to the editor that, instead of a coherently argued piece, all he had to offer were thousands of unprintable jottings that “contradicted each other over and over again. I almost shift from Marxist to fascist from one paragraph to the next.” The editor suggested that, rather than trying to reconcile the split, Dawood approach the subject as a work of fiction – and Leviathan was spawned.
Based in east London, and with a body of work encompassing everything from painting to virtual reality, Dawood is not an artist who pursues one thought single-mindedly for long. Writing his multiple-personality novel on democracy, he started thinking “almost in parallel, about a connection between the top of the sea and the bottom”. It was 2015 and the news was full of stories of perilous migration across the Mediterranean. Dawood’s interest in environmental matters drew him to find links to changes taking place within the water itself.
“I started going out and meeting with oceanographers, political scientists, migrant rights activists and neurologists. I started asking very smart people whether there was a connection between mass migration and marine conservation. I was shocked by how much they jumped on it.”
Among drowned migrants belongings, Dawood found small plastic bags – not of drugs, but earth from their homelands
At the Institute of Marine Sciences in Venice, an engineer explained to Dawood that the route from north Africa to the Italian island of Lampedusa went right over a hump on the ocean floor that had become a kind of faultline for climate change. Waters warming on one side were creating an imbalance: “The displacement of that water creates the squalls, currents and riptides that make that crossing so dangerous, so there’s a direct relationship between climate change in the Med and how dangerous those crossings are.”
Dawood also learned that the same environmental factors were causing a parallel migration in the sea itself, with non-native species, such as the heavy-metal-munching Louisiana crayfish, taking over the territory of its European counterpart, which changed the ecosystem and had an economic impact on the fisheries. One marine biologist told Dawood that as a left-leaning progressive, his sympathies were with the human migrants – but that his working days were spent trying “to prevent alien and invasive species coming across that hump”.
At the University of Milan, he met researchers who gathered the human remains, and the belongings, of migrants who had died when their ships capsized off Lampedusa: “The idea is to build up a kind of archive to help relatives find closure.” Going through photographs of their findings, Dawood found images of small plastic bags that he assumed to contain drugs, but which turned out to be earth, brought from their homelands.
For a keen reader of Thomas Hobbes’s Leviathan, the great 17th-century work of political philosophy, it wasn’t a big leap from democracy to creatures of the deep (Leviathan being the name of a sea monster in the Bible). But if all this sounds like an indigestibly doom-laden mash-up of Panorama and David Attenborough, think again. Described by a fellow artist as “grindhouse Derek Jarman”, Dawood’s film output bears evidence to his interest in genre and B-movies. He favours the terms “punkish” and “freaky” when describing his work.
Episode one, narrated by a character called Ben, is filled with manic onomatopoeia and Tourette’s-style tics. The story, such as one can grasp it, rattles between visits to the giant squid in its specimen tank in London’s Natural History Museum and memories of a global disaster featuring sunspots, phytoplankton blooms and mass suicide. Dawood recalls one spicy passage, about monkey-men masturbating to internet porn, causing a frisson when the piece played to prospective funders. “Monkey on monkey, multiple monkey penetration, with and without plastic penetrative aids, monkey on goat…”
The novel will be released chapter by chapter online, echoing both the political pamphleteering of Hobbes’s era, and the serialisation of Victorian novels. Dawood takes a more contemporary point of reference for the film cycle, referring to it (only half jokingly) as a “box set”. Anyone wanting to binge-watch will have to wait until 2020, though, when the cycle is slated for completion.
With shooting locations that trace the migration route from North Africa in reverse, Dawood is on the hunt for spectacular sites that bring historical resonance to the work. The lighthouse and fortifications of the Plymouth breakwater, for example, make it into episode two, exuding post-apocalyptic squalor. “It’s not that hard to find the end of the world,” says Dawood cheerfully, “if you’re looking for it.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/may/07/shezad-dawood-leviathan-venice-climate-change-migrants

Urban sovereignty is and will be a total catastrophe for ordinary working people.
It is already happening and the results are obvious. In our country wealth and talent flock to London leaving the regions stripped of wealth and talent. The Metropolitans then lobby for greater powers and then use the additional powers to secure greater and greater advantages for the City, until you arrive at the UK in 2017.
A country where almost everyone who wants any sort of success needs to be in London. No talent or wealth left in the regions. Property prices and rents in the City go stratospheric creating some huge winners whilst everyone late to the party loses. And then comes the whining. The whining about how everyone left outside the City is small minded and racist. How any sort of attempt to redistribute wealth to the regions (or even just maintain a level playing field) through business rates being kept up to date, revised school funding, or much needed property taxes - is an attack on the City. Bla bla bla until we have the ludicrous outsome where ""Left Wingers"" like Davd Lammy start to lobby for independent City States. City states that would obviously become low tax, global capitalist havens (even more than they are already) - whilst ordinary people up and down the country are left with an asset stripped nation. But that OK coz they are all horrid Brexiters innit?
So no - before you thick-heads sitting reading the Guardian on you ipad airs in your Islington cafes start to get an ideas - lets be really really clear:

Faffing around with 10% reduction in emissions here, 40% there isn't going to cut it I'm afraid. 
I have to laugh at the idea that electric cars are the answer to pollution. I mean, ha ha ha, you just charge it up from the electricity tree in the garden. Everyone knows that's where electricity comes from, and not coal powered stations, oil powered stations, gas powered stations, nuclear stations. Obviously. 
But what about renewables? Sure, just dig up enough rare earth magnets to make the turbines using child labour and pollute somewhere else. Right? Then ship them all over the world. A wind turbine produces zero emissions right? Let's just pretend the construction of it doesn't. What's their lifespan? 10 years? Then they all need replacing again... Brilliant. Electric cars, totally pollution free. Never mind the facts. 
So let's keep making babies, more mouths to feed, more agriculture needed to feed those mouths.
And there is the rub, the crux of the matter. Agriculture is THE SINGLE BIGGEST contributor to greenhouse gasses, and that's before we get onto deforestation and desertification of the land.
Ah well, carry on pissing about with nonsense policies that refuse to deal with the main issue there are simply too many of us and we need to cull at least 50% at a minimum to be sustainable.
Nature will do this for us.

My experience in opposing Fracking has shown me that the oil industry will never curtail it exploitation of the planet as they are supported by the money men (bankers) and so politicians. Now for example even the word 'Fracking' is no longer being used - the Frackers have done a Windscale/Selafield change of name - now they call it Shale Gas/Oil extraction and the technology has go even worse. They now propose acidization with HF to dissolve the Kimmeridge shales in the UK for example - but of course this is not fracking!. (reason they frackers now say they will not be fracking is actually what they were told by the protesters at the very start - the oil bearing shales are far too fractured already - they ignored the expert geologists that told them this and have found out the hard way that they were wrong. They will still need 30,000 wells in the South of England alone.
Just consider the consequences - they will need to ship in huge quantities of highly toxic acid (One drop of HF on you hand and it drops off - but you don't feel it!) Furthermore the precision of shale destruction is far less than with conventional fracking (which was already bad enough). They still propose to drill right through potable water reservoirs. Inevitable leading to the destruction of drinking water at some time in the future (possibly long after they have gone away). This is all being supported by The Environment Agency, like the EPA both organisations now seem dedicated to the destruction of the environment not its preservation for future generations.
It is often widely forgotten/ignored that oil shales contain large quantities of toxic radioactive elements - like Radon gas (which decays into Polonium etc half life-3.8 days). No provision for waste reprocessing is included in any of the Fracker's plans - again a regulatory issue. (Perhaps why the frackers funded brexit as the EU were insisting on the UK meeting its obligations - Radon Gas from the South of England's fracking works will in all probability blow across the channel.) Radon is a very serious issue that should concern the Environment Agency but they ignore it - yet another way in which they abuse their name. Presently they are even refusing to insist on base level monitoring so that it will be impossible to identify the radioactive toxicity from the Frackers. (look it up!)
The upshot is that until the oil/banking industry is stopped and made to pay for and clean up the mess it creates up front they is no hope of ameliorating climate change.

Other issues make headlines: terrorism kills; inequality affects everyday life for billions around the globe. But climate is paramount, because in sustainability human survival itself is at stake. Why then have the nations governing the planet been so hopelessly ineffective in addressing the grave environmental crisis?
Is it because the consequences of carbon emissions seem hypothetical, or too far off? Politicians pay few costs for doing nothing, and receive little credit for acting aggressively. In the US, a nation that contributes one-fifth of all global greenhouse emissions (China is responsible for another fifth), Donald Trump has promised to reopen coal mines and free up oil drilling.
The problem isn’t the science. The merchants of doubt who claim there is a climate science that is open to scientific debate are not scientific adversaries at all. They are political adversaries, mostly bought and paid for. It is in the realm of politics that the struggle for sustainability must be fought and won.
Politics is hardly at its best right now, and that is perhaps the greatest challenge facing us. The weakness of politics undermines democracy – the faith behind politics. But democracy is crucial because climate change is also about justice: how to distribute the costs of decarbonisation and the transition to renewable energy fairly among rich and poor, developed and developing, large and small, north and south.
This politics can’t be found in increasingly dysfunctional nation states. The good news about the attempt to address climate change through government action is that it’s happening. The bad news is that it’s happening far too slowly. For every new hydroelectric plant built in the global north, some enormous lake dries up in the global south – Poopó, Bolivia’s second largest, has literally vanished over the last few years.
The US state of California is a leader in green public policies, but farmers there also grow pecans in semi-desert conditions where each nut harvested uses up to 300 gallons of water. For every urban fracking ban enacted, there is a move to block it in the courts. Coal is shut down, but fracked natural gas is accepted as a “transition” fuel – however pernicious its effect on decarbonisation.
The best-case scenario for what is likely to be done through nation-based environmental programmes hardly dents the worst-case scenario for the catastrophic consequences of all that is not being done.
However, there is an ample menu of sustainable options available to cities wishing to address climate change aggressively – and they can amplify their impact by coordinating their policies. The list includes divestment of public funds from carbon energy companies; investment to encourage renewable energy and green infrastructure; municipal carbon taxes; fracking and drilling bans; new waste incineration technologies; regulation of the use of plastic bottles and bags; policies to improve public transport and reduce car use; and recycling.
Oslo has been in the forefront of sustainable urban development. With Norway’s energy needs almost completely met by hydroelectric power, and its lion’s share of North Sea oil and gas going almost entirely to exports, almost all of the income goes to Norway’s massive sovereign wealth fund. Oslo has thus had the luxury of pursuing a zero-emission campaign, and appears likely to achieve that goal by 2025.
The city is applying the goal with particular efficiency to transportation, and electric vehicle charging stations are plentiful. The plan is to make Oslo the most electric vehicle-friendly city in the world – one in four new cars sold in Norway are electric – and a champion of green housing and architecture: its new opera house is set in a neighbourhood that gleams with green infrastructure.
Asia also has exemplary green-leaning cities, including Hong Kong and Seoul. The greater Seoul region has a population of almost 25 million, and in 2015 it was ranked the continent’s most sustainable city. Seoul has made a massive investment in electric-powered buses. It already has the world’s third largest subway system, but its carbon fuel bus fleet of 120,000 vehicles has been a massive source of pollution. Current plans are to convert half this fleet to electric by 2020, which would be the world’s most ambitious achievement of this kind.
Such approaches can be undertaken to great effect one city at a time, but they are also mutually reinforcing: networks of collaborating cities can amplify their global impact. They can also make it more difficult for courts or governments to oppose environmental initiatives, standing firm on common approaches to sustainability and decarbonisation.
The challenge facing cities and citizens is to summon the necessary political will to do the things we know how to do – but have not done – and then to do them democratically. That will not be easy because democracy is in trouble, because moneyed interests and global oligarchies are corrupting government. But the fate of the campaign against climate change and other existential threats depends on democratic politics within and among cities.
Cities are the coolest political institutions on Earth. The odds are two to one or better that you live in a town or city, and not just for economic reasons. Spend a few days in Singapore or Cape Town or Nashville. Witness Oslo’s Tesla taxicabs, or Seoul’s rehabilitated centre-city river or Medellín’s public cable-car system. Keen to confront global warming, but not yet fully empowered to do so, cities must not only accept their responsibility for assuring a sustainable world but assert their right to do so.
There are two formidable obstacles blocking a larger role for cities: a paucity of resources and the absence of autonomy and jurisdiction. The European Union favours regions over cities, and works more on agricultural subsidies than affordable urban housing. In the United States, the structure of congressional representation means a suburban and rural minority rules over the urban majority.
If cities are to get the power they need, they will have to demand the right of self-governance – as I argued in my book If Mayors Ruled the World. The Global Parliament of Mayors, an international grouping of city mayors and the “global city rights movement”, held its inaugural session in The Hague last year.
Because urban citizens are the planet’s majority, their natural rights are endowed with democratic urgency. They carry the noble name of “citizen”, associated with the word “city”. But the aim is not to set urban against rural: it is to restore a more judicious balance between them. Today it is cities that look forward, speaking to global common goods, while fearful nations look back.
The world is getting too hot. Science makes it clear that sustainability is both necessary and possible. Politics shows it is achievable. Cities are poised to make it happen.

The policy paper, Pacific Possible, suggests as one climate change adaptation measure, open access migration from Tuvalu and Kiribati – for work and permanent settlement – to Australia and New Zealand.
Tuvalu (population 11,000) and Kiribati (107,000) are low-lying archipelago nations in the Pacific acutely vulnerable to climate change, in particular to rising sea levels that have already begun inundating land and homes across the islands.
The World Bank paper argues a structured migration program instituted now would prevent a more harried, forced migration in future generations.
“The worsening impacts of climate change have provided a new moral imperative for providing open access,” the report says.
It forecasts, with open migration, about 1,300 i-Kiribati and Tuvaluans would migrate to Australia and New Zealand annually, about 0.6% of those countries’ combined annual permanent migration programs.
“The two governments would prefer a slow outward flow resulting from voluntary migration and do not wish their peoples to be treated as ‘refugees’ fleeing a hopeless economic and environmental situation.”
Seventeen people from the Pacific – including 11 from Tuvalu and five from Kiribati – have already made refugee claims in New Zealand, citing climate change as part of their basis of claim. None have been successful (four have yet to be determined and 13 have been rejected) because the refugees convention does not recognise climate change as grounds for protection.
Report author Prof Stephen Howes from the Australian National University said unrestricted access across national borders was unusual but it did occur, with some Pacific nations, such as the Federated States of Micronesia, granted open access to the US, effectively borderless travel between Australia and New Zealand, and free movement within the EU.
“But there has to be something very special, very important to allow that free movement. It seems to us that climate change might provide such unusual circumstances as to give rise to open access.”
He stressed the migration to Australia and New Zealand was not “about emptying out those countries” but with making them sustainable, economically and environmentally.
Howes said it was important to have a pathway to permanent migration for Pacific Islanders coming to Australia and New Zealand so they could form diasporas that could assist later generations of migrants.
“If you don’t have that avenue for permanent migration, you won’t establish a diaspora, and the most successful migrant communities we’ve seen, for instance, the Indian community in Australia, thrive because of the personal and community links an established diaspora provides.”
Open access migration for all Pacific Islanders has been proposed by a number of Australian thinktanks as a more effective mechanism than aid for lifting struggling Pacific states out of poverty.
A December 2016 report by the Lowy Institute’s Leon Berkelmans and Jonathan Pryke argued that allowing just 1% of the Pacific’s population – an average intake of fewer than 3,000 people – to work permanently in Australia would deliver a “transformational impact” and be of greater benefit to the people of the Pacific by 2040 than all of Australia’s current aid to the region.
Based on conservative assumptions, an uncapped migration model could increase the income of some Pacific Island countries – for the entire population, not just emigrants – by 300 to 400% over the next 25 years.
“We are conscious that this focus is a different way of thinking about development but conventional thinking is clearly not working in the Pacific.”
In March the Menzies Research Centre said Australia had been slow to realise the potential of the Pacific and suggested Australia create two dedicated visa categories for Pacific Island workers – a skilled visa and a labour exchange visa for unskilled work in a variety of seasonal industries.
“The time is now ripe for Australia to reconsider how it engages with the Pacific workforce,” the Menzies report says. “Forecasts for labour demands suggest that the domestic labour supply will not be sufficient to meet demand in sectors like aged and community care, agriculture and tourism and hospitality. They are sectors with jobs that workers from the Pacific are potentially well-suited to fill.”
Launching the Menzies Research Centre report, the foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, said Australia had a substantial aid program in the region, focused on infrastructure, health, education, security and defence.
“But foreign aid alone will not deliver economically sustainable and independent nations,” she said. “That’s why we’re focusing on seeking to build the economies of our Pacific Island neighbours.
Bishop said Pacific labour migration to Australia was “a win-win”.
“Australia has some of our labour force shortages met but those from the Pacific gain skills, gain an opportunity, gain access to Australian qualifications, see Australian business practices and of course send home remittances.”
The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, told the Pacific Islands Forum in September that Australia was looking to make a “step-change” in its relationship with the Pacific.
Australia’s relations with the region are expected to be a key element of the government’s forthcoming migration white paper. Australia has run a seasonal workers program since 2012 – which has attracted some criticism over worker exploitation – and, since last year, a Pacific microstates-northern Australia worker pilot, which provides multi-year visas for up to 250 workers from Kiribati, Tuvalu and Nauru.
Bishop’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said climate change migration was not a priority.
“Australia believes that the best response to climate change impacts, where feasible, is effective adaptation and well-supported internal relocation rather than resettlement.”
The New Zealand government said its immediate climate change focus was on effective and comprehensive global mitigation to reduce emissions, and for the implementation of effective adaptation measures that reduce the vulnerability of countries and communities.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/08/australia-and-nz-should-allow-open-migration-for-pacific-islanders-threatened-by-climate-says-report

Thus it was to be a truely national US approach. With one unified carbon efficiency standard for each state, efforts to increase renewable energy, improve energy efficiency and expand the use of cleaner fossil fuels were to be combined into one national policy objective.
Then in late March this year Trump signed the Energy Independence Executive Order, directing agencies responsible for regulating domestic energy production to submit plans to the White House, to identify, and propose measures to revise or rescind, regulatory barriers that impede progress towards energy independence.

The assistant minister for social services and multicultural affairs, Zed Seselja, one of the government’s up-and-coming conservative figures, told Sky News on Monday that “as it stands” the Turnbull government was committed to Paris agreement, but if the US quit the pact, that would change the nature of the agreement.
He added Canberra was currently “doing more than our share, in my opinion”.
Seselja said Australia was committed to the Paris agreement and had put forward targets. “They are strong measures: 26-28% [in greenhouse gas reductions]. So we are doing more than our share, in my opinion,” he said Monday.
Asked about what would happen if Trump followed through with his campaign threat to pull out, Seselja said: “When it comes to the US’s position that is a matter for the new US administration.”
The Coalition frontbencher said if America withdrew, that would change the nature of the agreement. “Obviously you wouldn’t want to speculate, but if they were to pull out obviously that would change the nature of that agreement.
“But as it stands, the Australian government is committed to the Paris agreement.”
Trump is believed to be close to making a decision about whether to stay the course on the Paris agreement or pull out. The president has previously promised to “cancel” the deal, but reports suggest his advisers are split over whether quitting the compact would be worth the resulting diplomatic fallout.
The president has already signed a new executive order to unravel a number of Barack Obama’s regulatory measures to combat climate change, including eliminating the clean power plan, which sets limits on the amount of greenhouse gases that power plants emit.
Seselja’s comments on Monday follow an earlier public warning from the chair of the Turnbull government’s backbench committee on environment and energy, fellow conservative, Craig Kelly.
Kelly said Australia would need to review its participation in the Paris agreement on climate change if Trump pulled out.
Asked a month ago whether a majority of his Coalition colleagues would be in favour of quitting the Paris deal in the event Trump pulled out, Kelly told Guardian Australia “it would be a close run thing”.
If Trump withdraws, it would embolden conservative MPs to reopen a deeply contentious issue within Coalition ranks.
The Turnbull government has been attempting to hold the line on the Paris deal, arguing once Australia makes a commitment to a global deal, it follows through.
The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, told reporters last November, on the day the Australian government ratified the Paris accord, that Australia would stay the course.
He indicated it would take the US four years to withdraw from the agreement after ratification in the event Washington resolved to quit.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/08/liberal-mp-says-australias-part-in-paris-climate-pact-would-change-if-us-quit

The anti-vaxxers operate with a very specific set of dogwhistle talking points. They follow the form
BQSTART
“I’m not ‘antivaccine.’ I’m pro-safe vaccine and don’t trust the FDA and big pharma.”
BQEND
They all start with the ""I’m not antivaccine"" line, but the there are ""real questions"" and ""legitimate concerns"", followed by vague musings about conspiracies involving ""vested interests"", and then a fog for innuendo, fear, uncertainty and doubt. They deal in doubt.
The US Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein churns out that entire set of anti-vaxxer dogwhistle talking points, and manages to throw in a Monsanto conspiracy for good measure.
That's a position the US Green Party is presumably content with. She's been their presidential candidate twice now. As I said at the start, the anti-vaccine problem is rather deeply embedded in the Green movement.
That's also your idea of a pro-vaccine position - you've been supporting Jill Stein, and denying she's an anti-vaxxer, all the way through the sub-thread.

""If"" is a conjunction. And the way in which I used it in my post was to introduce a conditional clause. A conditional clause is a type of subordinate clause, most commonly introduced by the conjunction ""if"" or ""unless."" And like most subordinate clauses introduced by a conjunction, the conditional clause can either go before the main clause, or after it. But the conditional clause is not an assertion, and should not be mistaken as one. It is more like a hypothetical state.
Did you ever see the movie ""The Wizard of Oz""? The character of the scarecrow sings the following lyrics illustrating the use of a conditional clause introduced by the conjunction ""if."" Note how the scarecrow is not asserting that he had a brain, in fact just the opposite. The scarecrow sings what his life would be like IF he had a brain. Also note how he has placed the conditional clause after the main clause.

You see, he's not saying he has a brain. Adding the word ""if"" before a clause changes what might have been an assertion into a conditional state. I hope this is making sense to you.

As a result, this is what made the movie work because even the “official” version of reality, the spiritual omniscient version, the version that should have seen and known all, in the end, could not be relied upon to be the real reality. In the end, the viewer is still left not knowing for sure what really happened. So if you would like to discuss “reality”, let us at least first agree upon whose version of reality we wish to discuss. Fair enough?

Jill Stein and left wing antivaccine dog whistles Respectful Insolence blog, August 1, 2016 
Dr. Stein is also sadly mistaken about a great many things. For example, her rant about “corporate influence” on the vaccine approval process is straight out of the antivaccine playbook and based on incorrect information. As David Weigel pointed out, the most members of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee work at academic or medical institutions, not drug companies.
...all meeting materials are posted to the FDA website. Dr. Stein can peruse them herself going back many years if she so desires. In fact, I urge her to do so. 
...Dr. Stein is utterly clueless how vaccines are approved and has repeatedly slandered the FDA over it.
...Similarly, the linking of “Monsanto lobbyists” to vaccine regulatory approval is yet another page straight out of the antivaccine playbook.
...In addition, Dr. Stein seems not to be up on the latest vaccine data.
Not surprisingly, Dr. Stein’s admirers leapt to her defense with scientifically ignorant assertions that she’s not antivaccine because she says she’s not antivaccine.

Here's an interview by the environment journalist Bo Gardiner with the vaccine expert Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrician who heads both the Division of Infectious Diseases and the Vaccine Education Center at The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, where they discuss Jill Stein's position on vaccines:
BQSTART
BO GARDINER: Are you familiar with recent statements by Dr. Jill Stein on vaccines, including last week’s Washington Post interview? 
DR. PAUL OFFIT: Yes, and they’re illogical. On the one hand, she says vaccines are an important health initiative that saves lives. But on the other hand, she says that vaccine regulators are unduly influenced by the pharmaceutical industry.Then she throws Monsanto in there, who has nothing to do with vaccines. If you’re going to claim a vaccine conspiracy, give an example, otherwise you’re just a conspiracy theorist.
BO GARDINER: How is Dr. Stein’s rhetoric similar or dissimilar to the most well-known physicians who are notorious for public positions in sympathy with prominent anti-vaccination groups?
DR. PAUL OFFIT: Similar. Bob Sears, Jay Gordon, Lawrence Palevsky, and Joseph Mercola say the same things. [Note: Those individuals are all well known for sowing vaccine distrust.]
BO GARDINER: I received dozens of comments from Dr. Stein’s supporters cheering what they took to be a strong anti-vaccination message: they said her statements were, for them, proof of a government conspiracy covering up harm from vaccines, that we should stop vaccinating our children, or vaccinate for fewer diseases, or ignore vaccine schedules. So the concern that she’s sowing vaccine distrust isn’t hypothetical or exaggerated, it’s very real and already happening.

It’s now “inevitable” that the contiguous United States will lose all of its glaciers within a matter of decades, according to scientists who have revealed the precipitous shrinkage of dozens of glaciers in Montana. 
Warming temperatures have rapidly reduced the size of 39 named glaciers in Montana since 1966, according to comparisons released by the US Geological Survey (USGS) and Portland State University. Some have lost as much as 85% of their expanse over the past 50 years, with Glacier national park, site of 37 of the surveyed glaciers, set to lose all of its eponymous ice formations within the next few decades. Of the 150 glaciers that existed in the park in the late 19th century, only 26 remain.

It’s a disturbing trend on the rise in America that shows the importance of immunization and the dangerous power of misinformation.
A new paper published in PLOS One by John Cook, Stephan Lewandowsky, and Ullrich Ecker tests the power of inoculation; not against disease, but against the sort of misinformation that created the conditions leading to Minnesota measles outbreak. Inoculation theory suggests that exposing people to the tricks used to spread misinformation can equip them with the tools to recognize and reject such bogus claims.
The study focused specifically on misinformation about climate change. The scientists wanted to determine if inoculation could boost peoples’ resistance to false balance in the media, and efforts to cast doubt on the 97% expert consensus on human-caused global warming.
The two issues are connected – in climate stories, journalists will often present arguments by climate scientists and climate deniers with equal weight, creating the perception of a 50/50 split when in reality, 97% of experts are on one side, as elegantly illustrated by John Oliver in this clip with over 7 million views from his HBO program Last Week Tonight :
In one experiment, before showing people a media story with this sort of climate false balance, the study authors first provided a group with information about the 97% expert consensus, and delivered an “inoculation” explaining the misleading effects of false balance media coverage.
They found that in the group that was only exposed to the false balance story, average perceived consensus, acceptance of human-caused global warming, trust in climate scientists, and support for climate policy all fell. When subjects were first inoculated against false balance and told about the expert consensus, these factors instead all increased. The authors concluded:
In sum, the effect of false-balance media coverage had the greatest effect on perceived consensus among the various climate attitudes measured. However, a consensus message presented with the false-balance message was effective in increasing perceived consensus, thus neutralizing the negative influence of the misinformation. In addition, we found that an inoculation message was effective in neutralizing the effect of misinformation on perceived consensus.
In a second experiment, they exposed participants to consensus misinformation via the infamous Oregon Petition, explained in the video below, and again inoculated one group against the misinformation
The inoculation this time consisted of a mixture of text and a figure of a tobacco ad with the text “20,679 Physicians say ‘Luckies are less irritating’” to show participants a similar previous example of the fake experts technique employed in the Oregon Petition. 
As in the first experiment, exposure to only the misinformation decreased participant perception of the expert consensus, acceptance of human-caused global warming, and support for climate policies. However, exposure to the inoculation offset the effects of the misinformation.
I asked lead author John Cook how these findings can be implemented in the real world where misinformation about subjects like climate science and vaccines is pervasive.
One of the unique elements of the inoculation we tested in our study is that we never actually mentioned the myth that we were inoculating against. Instead, we explained the general fallacy that the misinformation employed - the technique of using fake experts to cast doubt on expert agreement on a scientific topic. This tells us that explaining the techniques of denial can help people spot attempts to mislead them, hence neutralizing misinformation that uses those techniques.
Arguably, the most effective way to practically implement inoculation is in the classroom. Decades of research have found that one of the most powerful ways to teach science is through misconception-based learning: teaching science by directly addressing misconceptions and misinformation about the science. Two ways we’ve put this into practice is through a Massive Open Online Course on climate science denial that uses the misconception-based-learning/inoculation approach and a college textbook that teaches climate science while debunking common climate myths. 
In short, the more we explain the techniques of science denial and misinformation, the more people will become inoculated against them. When we’re exposed to examples of people using cherrypicking or fake experts or false balance to mislead the public, it becomes easier to recognize those techniques, and we’re less likely to fall for them in the future. Teaching people to recognize those techniques is a primary goal of the Denial101x free online course mentioned by Cook.
When anti-vaxxer Andrew Wakefield was confronted with the consequences of misinforming the Somali immigrants in Minnesota, he told a Washington Post reporter “I don’t feel responsible at all.” One wonders whether we’ll be hearing those words from climate deniers in the coming years.
Hopefully it won’t come to that, if we can avoid the worst consequences of human-caused climate change. Inoculating people against the techniques used by climate deniers and misinformers can help us achieve that goal.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/may/08/study-to-beat-science-denial-inoculate-against-misinformers-tricks

 Scott Pruitt, the EPA administrator, has chosen not to renew the terms of nine of the 18-member board of scientific counselors, which advises the EPA on the quality and accuracy of the science it produces. The group, largely made up of academics, is set to be replaced by representatives from industries that the EPA regulates.
 Deborah Swackhamer, chair of the board, said that with other planned departures, the panel was left with five members, including her, in the midst of an EPA hiring freeze.
 “The committee has been eviscerated,” she told the Guardian. “We assumed these people would be renewed and there was no reason or indication they wouldn’t be. These people aren’t Obama appointees, they are scientific appointees. To have a political decision to get rid of them was a shock.”
 The nine departing members – who worked on matters including toxic water pollution, climate change and chemical safety – all completed three-year terms. The decision to not renew those terms has opened the way for the Trump administration to refashion the scientific board in line with its industry-friendly agenda that has sought to strip away various pollution rules in the name of “regulatory certainty”.
A spokesman for the agency told the New York Times: “The administrator believes we should have people on this board who understand the impact of regulations on the regulated community.”
There would be a morality issue if the committee is turned into a political pawn of a certain viewpoint
 This could lead to multiple instances of conflicts of interest, Swackhamer said, despite clear EPA ethics rules. 
“If you have industry hand-picked people,” she said, “the concern would be that they would have a frequent conflict because we discuss areas that touch upon big industry.
 “This administration has made statements not terribly favourable to science. There would be a morality issue if the committee is turned into a political pawn of a certain viewpoint. Our credibility would be destroyed. We would be seen within the scientific community as tainted.”
Courtney Flint, a board member and professor of natural resource sociology at Utah State University, said she was told on Friday her term would not be renewed.
“This came as a surprise as I had been told that the appointment would be renewed,” she told the Guardian, adding that the board “has been careful to avoid partisanship in our scientific recommendations”.
“I am hopeful that this advisory work can continue to be done by objective scientific experts that represent a cross-section of societal voices to inform policy.” 
 Pruitt, a former Oklahoma attorney general who sued the EPA multiple times over its pollution rules, has criticized the science produced by the agency to support its regulations. 
In March, Pruitt reversed a move to ban chlorpyrifos, a widely used pesticide, despite the advice of EPA scientists that it could be harmful to children and farm workers. Pruitt said: “We are returning to using sound science in decision-making, rather than predetermined results.”
John O’Grady, president of a union that represents more than 9,000 EPA employees, said he was concerned that the agency would now be “repopulated with scientists who operate within the realm of opinion, rather than fact”. 
“We are already aware of the opinion of this administration and Mr Pruitt with respect to climate change,” he said. “However, opinions are neither fact nor theory and do not belong to the realm of science.
“Without independence and sound peer review of the science conducted by the agency, it will be impossible to distinguish between good science and bad science at the US EPA.”
 Republicans have complained about the EPA’s scientific advisory board, claiming that it is too heavily weighted in favour of academics who support regulation. 
In February, Lamar Smith, chairman of the House science committee, said: “The EPA routinely stacks this board with friendly scientists who receive millions of dollars in grants from the federal government. The conflict of interest here is clear.”
 Members of the board, however, deny that they are politically motivated, pointing to the ethics training and vetting they receive, similar to that undergone by career public servants.
Swackhamer said: “We have spirited conversations about the science – we don’t just rubber-stamp what the EPA wants to do. These people are valuable, highly qualified and highly vetted. It’s troubling that political considerations have come into this.”
In a statement to the Guardian, an EPA spokesman said: “EPA received hundreds of nominations to serve on the board, and we want to ensure fair consideration of all the nominees – including those nominated who may have previously served on the panel – and carry out a competitive nomination process.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/08/epa-board-scientific-scott-pruitt-climate-change

• One solution to the question of retesting older drivers (Letters, 3 May) would be to require them to resit the theory test. This has the advantage that it requires up-to-date knowledge of road signs and there is also a reaction time test. As so much is constantly changing on the roads today this ought perhaps to be mandatory for drivers of all ages every few years.Jenny PageSidmouth, Devon 
• Richard Dawkins would prefer TV subtitles to interpreters when French speeches are broadcast (Letters, 6 May). Unfortunately the BBC at least seems to have a rule that no subtitle should be left on the screen long enough for anyone to read it. Until that changes, I’ll vote for interpreters.Chris BirchLondon
• Sue Trowbridge (Letters, 5 May) writes about Swedish naming convention for grandparents. It is even more clear cut on the Indian subcontinent: a father’s father is Dada, a father’s mother is Dadi. Similarly, a mother’s parents are Nana and Nani. A father’s brother is Chacha, and his wife is Chachi; a mother’s brother is Mamoo, his wife is Mami. San CassimallyEdinburgh
• When my father died in January my five-year-old nephew lamented that he now had no grandfathers left. At least, he consoled himself, he had a spare grandma. My mother and the other one are now fretting over which of them is only for use in emergencies.Richard JeffcoatBirmingham

Where is the evidence that it is weak?
Climate change (AGW) is a scientific paradigm, so well-established that it sits alongside other paradigms as plate tectonics, evolution, and relativity.
Tens of thousands of pieces of research in geochemistry, palaeontology, oceanography, atmospheric physics, and many more fields of study, have resulted in this overall concept.
Concepts become scientific theories by the accumulation of evidence that can only be explained in one way.
Any other idea would need to explain at least as much evidence in a different way.
Which would include the huge mass of evidence from the geological record.
A scientific paradigm will only change if a new paradigm is found that explains not just the existing evidence but even more new evidence.
There is no sign at all of that process happening over AGW, because there is no evidence accumulating that would initiate a paradigm shift.
The concept that global warming is being caused by human activity has - like other scientific paradigms - :
....... coherence - consilience - and - consensus ......
Coherence - a theory that coherently explains the multiple observed lines of empirical evidence across multiple aspects of the climate system.
Consilience - the predicted and projected changes being confirmed across multiple scientific disciplines observing the multiple aspects of the climate system.

The glaciation of Antarctica began around 34 million years ago, when CO2 reduced from around 1000 ppm to around 600 ppm.
The reduction is linked to increased weathering of the newly-rising Himalayas.
Antarctic glacial inception began at around 750 ppm, and spread more widely as the CO2 level continued to fall.
So - eventually - if CO2 rises back to those levels (around 800 ppm) allowing for the fact that it takes a lot of (latent) heat to melt ice at zero C to water at zero C - this would create conditions where Antarctica would become ice-free again.

This is so because of the sheare size of the carbon reservoir in the permafrost. If warming continues, the amount of carbon dioxide released will double atmospheric carbon dioxide in 50-100 years. Without out this input, many models now predict that we will reach 2.0 degree C average global warming in about 50 years. With the input it could be as little as 25 years, and within 50-100 years we may be looking at carbon dioxide concentrations that will force a global mean temperature in excess of 4 Degrees C.
At 2 Degrees C of mean warming, places like Kansas City will have temperatures above 100 Degress F about 75-100 days out of the year. At 4 Degrees C of warming temperatures in places like Kansas City could climb as high as 125 Degrees F for 100 days out of the year. The effects on food production will be staggering and billions will die, not just from the heat but from starvation and lack of water, which evaporates rapidly when soil temperatures are high. To make matters worse that level of carbon dioxide will rapidly lower the pH of world oceans, wiping out species that require calcium to be pumped across their cell membranes to produce endo and exoskeletons. The oceans provide about 50% of all protein consumed by humans. Lowered pH will likely reduce that by about 80% in less than 100 years time.

That acidity increase gravely affects many sea creatures, particularly shell-forming ones, as their ability to make viable shells absolutely depends on seawater being within a relatively narrow range of alkalinity.
This and other consequences of reducing seawater alkalinity (increasing its acidity) will, if continued much further, cause a dying off of much marine life, and that in turn will cause major releases of, yes, CO2, but also of sulphur-based gases of high toxicity.
So not only will increased CO2 accelerate global heat retention via the greenhouse effect, but it will also poison the oceans and thus the atmosphere and, with that many land and marine life forms.

It is good that we are trying to understand the dynamics of the CO2 model. The basis for many of the calculations regarding man made CO2 are that the rest of the worlds sources and sinks are stable over the last period, and man-made CO2 is the main change.
I have seen articles about increased 'greening' on the planet and growth in vegetation, faster decay due to increased temperatures, 10 fold increase in phytoplankton, increased absorption of atmospheric CO2 due to its higher concentrations.

 Measurements of carbon dioxide levels taken from aircraft, satellites and on the ground show that the amount of CO2 emitted from Alaska’s frigid northern tundra increased by 70% between 1975 and 2015, in the period between October and December each year.
 Researchers said warming temperatures and thawing soils were the likely cause of the increase in CO2 at a time of year when the upper layers of soil usually start freezing over as winter sets in. 
In the Arctic summer, the upper level of soil, which sits above a vast sheet of permafrost that covers much of Alaska, thaws out and decomposing organic matter starts to produce CO2. From October, colder temperatures help freeze the soil again, locking up the CO2.
Alaska’s warming autumns and winters are altering this process. Whereas soils 40 years ago took about a month to completely freeze over, the process can now take three months or longer. In some places in the state, the soil is not freezing until January, particularly if there is a layer of insulating snow.
The result is a huge and continuing expulsion of CO2, a planet-warming gas, into the atmosphere. In 2013, a particularly warm year racked by wildfires in Alaska, around 40m more tons of CO2 was given out by soils than absorbed by vegetation – an amount four times larger than that emitted by the state’s use of fossil fuels.
“A lot of models were predicting this thawing would happen, but not for another 50 to 100 years – we didn’t think it would happen this quickly,” said Roisin Commane, researcher at the Harvard John A Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and lead author of the report, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
 “The timescale of this surprised many of us,” she said. “There is a lot of potential CO2 from these soils, which worries people. We’d prefer the carbon stays there.”
 Commane said the large volume of CO2 released suggested some of it was coming from permafrost. Typically found a meter or so below much of Alaska, permafrost contains carbon that has been frozen for up to 40,000 years. It is being scrutinized by scientists concerned that it is starting to thaw. 
 It is estimated that Arctic permafrost contains roughly twice as much carbon as the Earth’s entire atmosphere. This means its disappearance would probably contribute to a severe change in the climate that would be dangerous to many species, including humans.
 “Some of this CO2 has to come from permafrost thawing but we don’t know how much,” said Commane. “That is something we really want to work out.”
 Data for the research was taken from Nasa analysis of CO2 from aircraft and satellites, as well as readings from a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration station in Barrow, Alaska.
 The Arctic is warming at around twice the rate of the rest of the world and Alaska has experienced three record warm years in a row. In 2016, the average temperature was 5.9F warmer than the long-term average.
“The entire Alaska region is responding to climate change,” said Donatella Zona of San Diego State University in California, who was not affiliated with the study. 
“The amount of carbon lost from Arctic ecosystems to the atmosphere in the fall has increased significantly over the past 40 years. By better capturing these cold season processes and putting previous smaller-scale measurements into a bigger context, this study will help scientists in their efforts to improve climate models and predictions of Arctic climate change.” ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/08/alaska-climate-change-tundra-soil-carbon-dioxide

The problem with the models isn't that they need to 'guess' or 'approximations' it's that there isn't the computing capacity to actually model the atmosphere to the level of detail that the knowledge of physics would allow. So simplifying assumptions have to be made. You don’t have the processing power to model individual atoms in the oceans so they need to simplify by, for example, modelling how 1 cubic kilometre of Ocean might behave, but this still is based on physics. Another problem is that you'd need to know the initial state of the atmosphere accurately. 
These limitations will always make it very difficult to accurately model what will happen to the Earth. They'll not be able to tell you what the exact temperature of 2075 will be, although they could fairly accurately tell you the average temperature for 2070-2080. This doesn't make it useless at all. You could consider these models to be trial runs about how a planet similar to Earth would behave if you increased CO2 and then you use this to inform your decision about what policy to take. 
This isn't that controversial an idea even, you rely on the same idea every time you visit a doctor. Drugs trials are done on a set of volunteers and they monitor how the respond to a drug. Normally all patients don't respond the same and you end up with a probability distribution of side effects and benefits. When a doctor is deciding how to treat you he's doing so based on the probability distribution of how other patients have responded. He can't know what your exact response will be. 
This is the decision we have to make on climate change. Scientist can't tell you exactly what will happen to the Earth we need to make a decision based on the probabilities. You have cancer which left untreated has a 95% of killing you or you can have chemotherapy which will make you sick in the short term but there is a 70% it’ll cure you. You might be mad you didn’t listen to the doctors advise 30 years ago and avoid this whole situation but we have to now deal with the situation we are in.

Somebody on a different Guardian thread asked recently why the chemist Arrhenius, who’d published his arguments about warming due to CO2 more than a century ago, should be quoted at all on the relationship between CO2 and climate. Well, here’s why (in my view). Without the benefit of supercomputers to run advanced climate models, Arrhenius was able to calculate that the temperature change at the last ice age corresponded to a drop in CO2 to between 55 and 62% of the inter-glacial value. It took the best part of a century for climate scientists to measure the CO2 in ice cores and find that the decrease during glaciation was from about 280 ppm to around 180 ppm, i.e., to around 64% of the inter-glacial value. Not a bad “guess”, eh? Does it not occur to you that the same kind of reasoning might be applied to ask what might happen if the CO2 increases above the interglacial value (280 ppm)? Well, Arrhenius’s calculations suggested several degrees Celsius rise, for a doubling of CO2. In other words, we don’t need elaborate computer models, which you call “BS”, to tell us that adding CO2 to the atmosphere indefinitely is expected to have a major effect.', u'recommendation_count': u'9', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1494315017000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'co2', u'effect': u'who \u2019d published his arguments about warming'}], u'author_id': u'16662762', u'in_reply_to': u'98156139', u'id': u'98169399', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'asgerboots', u'text': u'Back in 2008 the Guardian gave us only 100 months to save the planet, and nothing has changed.', u'recommendation_count': u'10', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1494305860000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'16410077', u'id': u'98161620', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'TonyW', u'text': u'I don't think we're at 1.83C over 1750 but there may well have been some months last year that got to that level.

This would seem to be a partisan assertion with no evidence. 
I could just as easily assert that:
The politics of climate change have been hijacked by a very small percentage of very vocal climate change deniers. Many of these are funded by large corporations with a vested interest in keeping polluting the atmosphere. 
That these few dissenters have persuaded a cohort of followers to join in their political game. 
That they have done this by largely by characterising themselves as heroic champions of the downtrodden right wing who are engaged in fighting a crusade those hated pinko's on the left (ie anyone not alt-right). A very effective technique used extensively in the 1930's. 
That as I can see these followers are blind to any rhyme or rational reason in their fanatical hatred of the left. They see climate change denial as a means to attack the hated left. 
That their followers seem incapable of putting aside their hatred and doing a simple risk assessment. They seem unable to ask what harm could switching to renewable energy do as compared to the fossil fuel and global warming path. The worst harm of choosing the renewable path is a major hit to the bottom line of a few multinationals, it no longer hits the consumers' costs. The worst harm of choosing to continue on the fossil fuel path is that human life could become tenuous, large numbers of people will be displaced as tracts of land become submerged or untenable, global conflict could increase. 
That they seem to be unable to comprehend is that even if climate change is possibly a myth, switching to renewable energy is a good insurance policy. It won't cost a lot and it could save the earth if the climate scientists are right and they are wrong. 
That switching to renewable is a very small price to pay for peace of mind.

As part of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the group from 39 different countries were starting their work on a major report that will tell governments and policymakers what kind of impacts they can expect when global warming reaches 1.5C.
That report is scheduled to be ready in late September 2018 and will assess in detail what’s known about the impacts 1.5C of global warming could have on societies, ecosystems and efforts to reduce poverty.
But new research published in a leading scientific journal suggests that just eight years after that report is published, the world might have already reached that 1.5C target – or at least one definition of it (some senior scientists disagree with some of the assumptions in the paper – read on for those important caveats).
Published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, the research looks closely at the influence of a mechanism in the climate known as the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO).
“The IPO is like the long-term version of El Niño – it’s like El Niño’s uncle,” says Ben Henley of the University of Melbourne and the research’s lead author.
When heat gets trapped in deeper layers of the Pacific Ocean, this is known as a negative phase of the IPO. 
Since about the year 2000, the IPO hit this negative phase, which tends to slow down the rise in global temperatures that’s being caused by humans burning too many fossil fuels and cutting down forests. 
But around 2014, scientists say that this IPO started to shift, possibly towards a positive phase that would act like an accelerator on global warming.
Henley and his colleague Andrew King, also at the University of Melbourne, wanted to know how quick global temperatures might reach 1.5C, relative to where they were between 1850 and 1900. 
According to the paper, the “rate that global temperatures approach the 1.5C level is likely to be significantly quicker, or slower, depending on the IPO”.
After using the latest computer models of the climate and allowing for the added greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, Henley and King looked to see what the coming decades have in store depending on the phase of the IPO. 
If the IPO turns positive, then the average across the models shows that global temperatures hit 1.5C in around 2026. If the IPO was to turn negative, then this delays the 1.5C threshold by five years or so.
Henley told me: “Policymakers have to be aware of just how quickly we are approaching this level. But that doesn’t mean that the target is not a sensible thing to have.
“While we might overshoot 1.5C, stabilising global temperatures at that level still remains a worthwhile goal.”
Past inaction means we will exceed 1.5C no matter what we do. The key issue, however, is what we do next.
The paper also gives other projections for breaching 1.5C based on different assumptions and different models. 
For example, if you wait until global temperatures go above 1.5C over a five-year average period, then some models suggest that if the IPO stays negative for longer, the 1.5C breach doesn’t happen until around the year 2040 (but this is an outlier in the paper). 
Associate Professor Julie Arblaster, a climate scientist at Monash University who was not involved in the research, told me the research “highlights the role of natural or internal variability in the climate system in hitting climate targets”,
Arblaster pointed to one study published last year in the journal Nature Communications that suggested the switch to a positive phase of the IPO might have already happened.
She added: “Other things may also impact the timing of course, such as a large volcanic eruption, but this study helps by providing an estimate of the contribution of the climate system’s internal variability in hitting that target.”
Henley told me a key motivation for doing the sums on the 1.5C target was to help policymakers understand what kind of timeframe they have to work with. 
When countries were negotiating for a new global deal to cut greenhouse gas emissions and slow the impacts of climate change, many smaller and less developed countries were worried that a 2C global warming target was setting the bar way too high. Some scientists also shared this concern.
So there was a push to have a 1.5C target included in the text of the deal.
Article 2 of the Paris agreement states that countries agree to keep global warming “well below 2C above pre-industrial levels” but to also pursue efforts “to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C … recognising that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change”.
Bill Hare is an Australian climate scientist and founder of scientific consultancy group Climate Analytics. Hare is a veteran of the United Nations climate talks.
In an email, Hare said the paper showed “that very ambitious near-term mitigation is required to limit warming to 1.5°C and this analysis underscores this”.
But Hare and his colleagues also had some reservations about the paper’s conclusions. 
Hare said the IPCC’s interpretation of when you can say that 1.5C target is breached was based on much longer time periods than the Henley and King paper.
He also said the assumption in the paper that greenhouse gas emissions would continue to rise under a “business as usual” scenario didn’t reflect how countries were taking action under the Paris agreement. Using more optimistic scenarios could bring temperatures down by as much as 0.2C by 2030.
Joeri Rogelj of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria, also pointed out that the convention in UN climate negotiations was to refer to targets in terms of longer time frames of 20 or 30 years.
He thought the paper’s assumptions that emissions would remain high were “not compatible” with the agreements countries had made in Paris, but he did agree that the paper demonstrated how urgent the issue was.
Professor Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, director of the Global Change Institute at the University of Queensland, is a senior lead author on a chapter of the special report that will look at the impacts of 1.5C global warming on humans and natural environments.
Hoegh-Guldberg, who was not speaking from an IPCC perspective, told me the research would “wake some people up to the fact that exceeding 1.5C will happen within the next decade, give or take a couple of years”.
“One unknown that’s associated with the study is the effect that anthropogenic climate change might be having on these long-term climate patterns themselves. Some research groups have provided compelling evidence that patterns associated with El Niño, for example, may actually be amplified by warming.”
He added: “Many scientists have increasingly pointed to the unmanageable ecological and human impacts as average global surface temperatures exceed 1.5°C, and great economic and environmental costs that are likely to be associated. 
“Unfortunately, past inaction means that we will exceed 1.5C no matter what we do. The key issue, however, is what we do next. 
“People speak of overshoots as being one of the scenarios that we are likely to face. This is not an escape clause as the overshoot is likely to be catastrophic.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2017/may/09/planet-could-breach-15c-warming-limit-within-10-years-but-be-aware-of-caveats

“Most countries have a legal basis on which future action can be built,” said Patricia Espinosa, the UN’s climate change chief, at an international meeting on climate change in Bonn, Germany.
She said the findings were cause for optimism, adding that laws were one yardstick for tracking action on global warming, alongside investment in renewable energy or backing the 2015 climate agreement, ratified by 144 nations.
The study, by the London School of Economics (LSE), reviewed laws and executive policies in 164 nations, ranging from national cuts in greenhouse gases to curbs in emissions in sectors such as transport, power generation and industry.
Up to 47 laws had been added since world leaders adopted the Paris agreement to combat climate change in late 2015, a slowdown from a previous peak of about 100 a year between 2009-13 when many developed nations passed laws.
Donald Trump doubts that climate change has a human cause and is considering pulling out of the Paris climate agreement but legislation is often complicated to undo.
“If you have that big body of 1,200 laws it is hard to reverse,” said Samuel Fankhauser, the co-director of the LSE’s Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment.
The study said that developing nations were legislating more but there were still many gaps. Nations including Comoros, Sudan and Somalia have no climate laws.
“We don’t want weaklings in the chain,” said Martin Chungong, the secretary general of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. He urged all countries to adopt laws that help limit downpours, heatwaves and rising sea levels.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/09/climate-change-laws-exceed-1200-worldwide-finds-lse-study

Yet the rate of inspection and enforcement actions for environmental health, food safety and hygiene, and health and safety have all been falling. The statistically average workplace now expects to see a health and safety inspector once every 50 years.
In the name of cutting red tape, governments of all political persuasions have attacked independent regulation and enforcement. Budget cuts in the name of austerity have compounded the problem – especially at the level of local authorities. There is now a plethora of schemes to outsource and privatise wholesale some regulatory and enforcement activities. Private companies are increasingly involved in “regulating” either other private companies, or themselves, or both. Such changes mark the beginning of the end of the state’s commitment to forms of social protection put into place since the 1830s.Steve TombsProfessor of criminology, Open University
• Recent reports say parts of the British Isles are in the early stages of drought, with less than normal amounts of rain in the past few months. South-east England is particularly affected. But hasn’t our climate often broken the norms in the last 40 years? Past performance is no guide to what will happen in the future. It would be a good time now, in this pre-election period, to ask our politicians what contingency plans they have for a prolonged drought lasting two or more years. Our survival may depend upon them.Geoff NaylorWinchester

About 90 people gathered in a public garden on the fifth floor of Donald Trump’s building in midtown Manhattan to encourage the New York City government to divest its pension funds from fossil fuel companies. Organizers from environmental group 350.org said individual states and local councils can still take action on climate change, even in the face of a government that seems ambivalent on the subject.
“We need our governments to act, but we’re not powerless when they don’t,” said May Boeve, executive director at 350.org.
“We’re trying to make a connection between the fact that the Trump administration is run by fossil fuel millionaires, from Rex Tillerson to Scott Pruitt. And there’s an effort to try to get the public and elected officials to break sides with fossil fuel industries and divest.”
Trump is expected to make a decision on whether to remain in the Paris climate agreement later this month. The president has promised to “cancel” the agreement, under which almost 200 countries agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but his current thinking is unclear. A meeting of his top advisers on the subject was set to take place on Tuesday but was postponed.
Tuesday’s “teach-in” protest was part of a week of Global Divestment Mobilization organized by a coalition of activist groups. Rallies encouraging governments to divest from the fossil fuel industry were taking place in 46 different countries. In New York City, activists are pushing for comptroller Scott Stringer, who oversees the city’s $175bn pension funds, to divest investments in oil and gas companies like Exxon. 
The rally took place in one of two “public gardens” in Trump Tower, which as privately owned public spaces are open to members of the public. It included a quiz on which banks invest in fossil fuels, and a slightly on-the-nose tug-of-war which depicted Stringer being pulled in different directions by oil and gas companies and “the people”.
New York City council member Helen Rosenthal, state senator Liz Krueger and state assemblyman Felix Ortiz are among the elected officials also demanding that the city ditch its investments in fossil fuel industries.
“By fully divesting New York City pension funds from coal, oil and gas, we would take a prudent step toward protecting 1.5 million pension holders, withdraw our support from companies that are driving climate change, and align our financial interests with our goals of moving toward a cleaner, fossil fuel-free energy system,” Rosenthal said.
A spokesman for Stringer said the comptroller did not have the power to unilaterally divest. The city’s $175bn is spread across five different pensions, each of which has its own board of directors who decide where money will be invested.
The rally, organized by 350.org and New York Communities for Change, is part of a series the groups have held in Trump Tower. Trump has not returned to the building, where his wife, Melania, and 11-year-old son Barron have lived since his inauguration in January. The first lady has said she and Barron will move to Washington at the end of the school year.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/09/trump-tower-rally-fossil-fuel-divestment-paris-climate-deal

Since none of those individuals had the power to make the entire planet uninhabitable for the entire human species, no

So in fingering the Republicans as ""The most dangerous organisation"" because they can make the entire planet uninhabitable, somehow the Russian government, who likewise have that power, get off scot free? If that's Chomsky's justification it's a shit one.
The president of the US of A can order a nuclear strike, yes, but the Republican Party as an organisation can't. Judging by the last year, it can barely organise a piss up in a brewery - it tried hard to stop Trump becoming president and failed utterly.
So that argument is not good enough. Show me how the Republican party comes anywhere close to the manifest threat to human life that Stalin's, Mao's, Pol Pot's and Hitler's governments managed. How many thousands have died at Republican party hands in comparison to the documented millions of the above four organisations?
Remember that it was a Republican president, Reagan, that initiated the START talks, and another one, Bush, that signed START 1 with Gorbachev. Nixon, a Republican, created the EPA that Trump is now trying to handicap. Repuch
Yes, the Republicans are temporarily unhinged by their corrupt attachment to fossil fuels, but that cannot last. Their constituents are ultimately not going to want to see their homes flooded and crops die for very much longer before the AGW denial will have to stop. No amount of campaign contributions from the fossil fuel lobby will prevent politicians acting once the Arctic disappears in summer.

A bill to repeal a Department of Interior rule that reduces the venting, flaring and leaking of methane from oil and gas drilling on federal land failed by 51 votes to 49, with Republicans John McCain, Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham siding with Democrats to vote it down.
The unexpected defeat is a blow to Republicans who eyed the methane rule as a priority for repeal. The rule, crafted under Barack Obama’s administration, would prevent around 180,000 tons of methane entering the atmosphere a year and save states more than $20m a year in lost royalty revenues.
Methane is a short-lived but potent greenhouse gas, being about 25 times more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide. About a third of US methane emissions come from oil and gas drilling, which put the industry in the sights of the Obama administration’s climate change agenda.
Donald Trump has supported ditching the methane rule, which requires operators to use the latest technology to prevent leaks, and the House passed a bill to get rid of it. The Republican-controlled Senate appeared set to follow suit after senator Rob Portman of Ohio, considered a swing voter, said the rule “would have hurt our economy and cost jobs in Ohio by forcing small, independent operators to close existing wells and slowing responsible energy production on federal lands”.
However, the vote has instead resulted in a surprise win for environmental groups and climate researchers, who warn that methane emissions must be curbed if the US is to avoid the worst ravages of climate change.
“Methane emissions are not just a climate problem but contribute directly to poor air quality,” said Gavin Schmidt, a senior Nasa climate scientist, on Twitter. Schmidt added the vote was “good news”.
 Michael Brune, executive director of the environmental group the Sierra Club, said: “Today is a victory for our public lands and for the health of families across America, and a defeat for Donald Trump, corporate polluters and their friends on Capitol Hill. 
“People across the country will continue to resist and hold Congress and Trump accountable for any efforts to put the profits of polluters before the health of our families and our communities.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/10/methane-emissions-senate-republicans-vote-fails

 When trees or other deep-rooted vegetation are replaced with vegetation that uses less water, the water table may rise to cause dryland salinity.
 Salinity has been exacerbated by human activity, mainly agriculture. In some regions, problems originated over 100 years ago, from factors including excessive land clearance and large scale planting of pasture and crops. Once established, salinity can have adverse effects on agriculture. The cost to agricultural productivity from salinity was estimated at $187m in 2000. If the water table rises through increased irrigation then irrigation salinity can occur. 
Salinity is a major threat to the health of many inland water systems. And of course more taxpayer money is going to farmers to update their systems, they’re not going to pay for it themselves when middle class welfare is available to them.
“The LABOR Australian Government is working to improve the efficiency and productivity of on farm irrigation water use and management. The On-Farm Irrigation Efficiency Program is part of the Sustainable Rural Water Use and Infrastructure Program. 
The $450 million On-Farm Irrigation Efficiency Program (the Program) is aimed at assisting irrigators within the southern connected system of the Murray-Darling Basin to modernise their on-farm irrigation infrastructure while returning water savings to the environment.”
Jumping on the bandwagon of farmer mentality for simplistic fire management namely; cut it down and graze it or crop it, has no credibility.
And we know the giant agri-chemical companies feeding farmers all manner of toxic rubbish to “care” for their land refuse to provide money for research! That’s done by taxpayer funded CSIRO, one of the entities the IPA have demanded that the NewsLtd/Abbott Coalition privatize!

In 2012 a Farmonline article titled “10 Of Our Best” tells how ‘INSTEAD of buying feed during the devastating drought last decade, Riverina [Moulamein rice and sheep growers]… Ian and Camilla Shippen decided to buy properties.’ (And buy and sell water rights. Am I correct in believing Ian’s brother is Malcolm Shippen who bought the Four Arrows Group North Tahara farm with a view to ethanol production?)
Readers may recall the enormous amounts of taxpayers’ money that was given to drought-affected farmers. 
One of the properties purchased by the Shippen Moulamein drought affected farmers was Barton Station in between Willaura and Moyston, Victoria. The 2826ha Barton Station was purchased by Moulamein farmers Ian and Camilla Shippen in 2008 for $11 million. 
The Shippens of “10 of our best” sold Barton Station three years later to the Qatar Hassad Foods –in Hassad’s $35 million 8500ha buy up of spectacular prime Western District farmland.
Mr Shippen told Farmonline that: ""Money is a driving force but it's the thrill of trying to do something that people say can't be done. That's what drives you,"" he said.

Canberra correspondent Bernard Keane http://www.crikey.com.au/2009/01/20/ethanol-not-really-all-that-green/
‘The primary (and until recently dominant) producer of ethanol in Australia is Manildra, a major donor to the NSW Labor Party. In 2006-07 alone, Manildra donated over $200,000 to the NSW ALP. 
Imports of ethanol were slapped with a punitive excise by the Howard Government in 2002 at the behest of Manildra, which has also donated generously to the Liberal Party’.
And as to the stated greenhouse benefits of ethonal, that’s bunkum, but the myth benefits farmers (by the way I was informed by a Mackay sugar mill worker that as of last year there was only one sugar mill in Aust that was NOT foreign owned).
Keane: “The then-Australian Greenhouse Office commissioned a study by the CSIRO that indicated there was little difference in emissions between E10 derived from molasses and premium unleaded. Data from the International Energy Agency collated in a Masters thesis by grain merchant Dennis Ward suggests a 5% biofuel mandate across the OECD that is, if 5% of all transport fuel in the OECD were replaced with ethanol the reduction in world greenhouse emissions would be a quarter of 1%.”
Using prime farmland and grain to produce ethanol cos you were lucky enough to score patronage from governments to whom you donated money doesn’t always work out. Ask Agri Energy now called Sirocco Energy (Sirocca Energy is ‘a conventional, onshore oil and gas exploration company focused on the African continent’) and the Four Arrows Group. 
Goes to show that buying up farms thinking you’re going to make a killing in a government mandated ethanol scam can be risky.
In March 2010 the Price family's Four Arrows Group sold its North Tahara property near Wagga Wagga in the NSW Riverina to Wellship Pty Ltd, a company associated with Melbourne stockbroker Malcolm Shippen, brother of the Barton Station sell off.

Others with close knowledge of the rules agree they probably mean we spent a lot of money to stop farmers from clearing land they had never intended to clear, or were never going to be able to afford to clear.
“Some of it is land they would have cleared, and we are getting genuine abatement from that, but almost certainly a big chunk of it would never have been cleared and is not additional at all,” said one insider.
We also end up paying many hundreds of dollars per hectare to a farmer for not clearing land that might only cost $50 a hectare to buy outright
With the carbon price repealed … And now, under Direct Action, the cost – and risk – is born directly by the taxpayer.
Our $660m certainly bought some abatement, but probably not 47m tonnes…It would also save us from spending even more money trying to reduce emissions by stopping farmers from felling trees they may never have cut down anyway.

Cotton is a crop that should never be grown in Australia along with rice. And to make matters worse Australia does not even own the water rights. They've been sold off along with the farms to the foreign owners as well.

Everything we need is conveniently at our fingertips, so why bother thinking about where it comes from? If we pick up a banana in the supermarket and see a brown spot, we can exchange it for another. If avocados are $5 this week, there’s always a cheaper alternative in the next aisle. We avoid misshapen carrots and hunt around for the crunchiest, shiniest and cheapest red apples available.
Time to stop the trolleys. The rapidly changing climate is shaking up what makes it to the supermarket shelves and Australian farmers are getting hurt in the process. Droughts, floods, heatwaves, changing rainfall patterns and declining yields are hammering them from all sides, and in a myriad of ways. 
Extreme weather events make Australia’s food security increasingly vulnerable and extreme, unpredictable weather is climate change’s specialty. Last summer, for instance, more than 205 records were broken around the country as heatwaves and record hot days scorched many regions – particular in Queensland and New South Wales. As temperatures rise, this alters growing seasons and makes stock management more difficult. It’s not just hotter conditions farmers are worried about, either. Severe flooding is also expected to increase in frequency and, while up in the north there may be fewer cyclones, climate scientists say they will be more ferocious.
Food bowl areas all across Australia, including the Murray Darling basin, are at risk from declining rainfall and heat stress. If farmers cop it, then so do consumers. If we lose agricultural production from these areas, then we will all be giving up an ability to put fresh Australian fruit and vegetables on the table, with ease, every day. 
Australia as a whole will suffer because agriculture is a vital cog in our economy and is the most exposed of our industries to climate change. According to the National Farmers’ Federation, the agricultural sector at farm-gate contributes 2.4% to our total gross domestic product (GDP) – or $58.5bn. The majority of the 150,000 farm businesses in Australia are small, family owned businesses, with 96% having a turnover of $2m or less.
So when extreme weather events, including the slow-moving ones like drought, do arrive they hurt farmers hard and fast. Next in line? Shoppers. Consider the sky-high price of bananas following Cyclone Yasi in Queensland as a recent example. Continual, major losses from within this sector are not something that consumers, the economy or government can take lightly. 
For those that enjoy a glass of Australian wine with dinner, consider this: according to a recent report by the Climate Council, 70% of Australia’s best grape growing regions are predicted to be in jeopardy by 2050 because grapes will ripen too early. The Shiraz of tomorrow will suffer from our lack of action today. 
By failing to swiftly and meaningfully act on climate change, we are dumping a lifetime of extreme weather events and food insecurity onto future generations. The good news is that all shoppers can play a significant role in mitigating the worst impacts of climate change on the food and drink everyone enjoys.
First, demand immediate and meaningful action on climate change from the federal government. The electricity system is by far the biggest polluter. Australia urgently needs smart policies to fix the energy sector and significantly cut carbon pollution. A rapid transition to renewable energy is a must. 
Second, now is the time to rediscover paddock-to-plate connections and recognise that food doesn’t start its life on the supermarket shelves. Learning more about the origins of your favourite groceries and buying local can not only reduce food miles and emissions but also support farm businesses all over Australia. 
When a dollar is spent on locally produced food, that dollar keeps circulating in the community; paying for Landcare membership, shopping at the local stock feeds or supporting essential services, like kindergartens. By contrast, a dollar spent on cheap imports flies straight out of the country.
Finally consumers can throw their support behind farmers fighting against climate change and come up with a solution. Farmers are custodians of about half of Australia’s landmass. Right across the country, farmers are exploring ways to use renewable energy, regenerate soils and sequester carbon. 
The old slogan said “every family needs a farmer”. With climate change upon us, farmers need all families to stand up for Australian agriculture.

A secondhand EV, with decent batts (you'll be able to check this) would make for an excellent second car purchase given that they require so little maintenance. If the batts are bad, then paying for a new set would give you a top quality car for ten years.

Most car journeys in the UK are under five miles The vast majority of people travel less than ten miles to work. At the moment, people justify the expense of a car with shopping, school runs and weekend leisure (personal freedom). But with truly driverless, electric cars, hire should be much cheaper. With far fewer moving parts the vehicle (normal sized, once the tech matures) should last longer than today's cab-trade vehicles. And you won't need to collect/return a driverless hire car: it's just a taxi hired for time rather than distance. 
With electric + truly driverless, the reasons for owning a personal car diminish sharply . Vehicles in urban areas will divide sharply between transport and manual-option trophies: why bother with upkeep, licensing, the eternal search for parking places and depreciation?
I remember what streets looked like when every street wasn't choked with parked cars: peaceful Accessible. Children could glance across the road and see the other side of the street; we could walk and cycle around as kids in a relaxed way that today's under-40s can hardly imagine.
If you don't feel the need to always sit inside a machine, you can already buy an electric bike for roughly twice the price of the equivalent unpowered bicycle. It'll take you 50 miles on a couple of kwh: ballpark cost = a penny a mile. (2-3p a mile averaged over the whole life of the battery). The swankier bikes already have an 80 mile range.
If you think in terms of an invisible stoker pedalling in tandem behind you, the normal power boost that a bog-standard ebike gives you is a selection from half-a-stoker to two, or two-and-a-half. You shift between modes depending how much effort you want to put in.
In the UK and EU, ebikes as bicyles are limited by law to 15.5mph: which is about the same or better than average traffic speed in most cities. You can pedal faster of course, but the power cuts out and will only kick back in when you dip below that speed.
The law in the UK limits the type to ""pedelec"" which senses you pushing on the pedal and kicks in at the general power level you've selected (eg eco, cruise, turbo). On the continent they can choose throttle control, but UK law limits the throttle option to walk-speed (so you can get a boost off at the lights before pushing on the pedal; or to walk your shopping up stairs.)
Grocery shopping on a bike is low-stress, not confined to the huge end-of-week out-off-town haul. A few minutes here or there on the way home: people shopping by bike tend to waste less of what they buy, possibly because they buy less and more often; it's fresher, and they have a clearer idea of who'll be eating it when. 
Licensed as a moped or motorbike, ebikes already can do above the UK speed limit, but still look like a chunkier bicycle; you can park in the hallway. Apart from machines for people with a sentimental heritage interest (or a small penis) this is what motorbikes are shortly going to become: the distinction from a bike more legal than technical.
Bicycles are fun though, and an ebike still makes you more active than sitting in a car: it's like being nine again. If these prognosticators are anything like right, then cycling will become a lot nicer and safer, in cities where the traffic is more aware of you as a pedestrian or cyclist, and isn't belching fumes, and where the roads are much clearer of parked cars.
Cycling -- and walking -- to school will again be feasible for many more schoolchildren. 
Middle-aged (grandparent-aged) people like me who had great freedom and room to play as kids, we know what the intervening generation(s) have missed in terms of personal freedom as cars came to dominate everything: developing atonomy, making our own connections with neigbourhood and friends.

When a hire-car becomes much the same thing as a taxi -- it comes to you, it takes itself back -- and where the distinction between a taxi, public transport and ride-sharing becomes fuzzy, what's so great about owning a car, paying road license, maintaining it, hunting for parking-places -- and seeing it depreciate?

A Swedish startup claims these smaller, lighter EVs could help cut congestion and toxic levels of air pollution.
Uniti, which crowdfunded €1.2m (£1m) to develop the prototype of its EV, has already managed to capture the attention of Siemens. The two companies recently announced a partnership which will allow the car’s entire production process to be planned in a virtual setting before implementing it in the real world.
The ultimate goal is to produce around 50,000 cars per year in a fully automated production facility in Sweden, with the first deliveries scheduled for 2019 and expected to cost £17,500 each – a figure that is likely to limit its success.
The Renault Twizy, another micro EV that costs £6,995 (excluding the monthly £45 battery hire charge), has sold 19,589 units since its launch in 2012.
“Mostly they are too expensive,” says Dr Peter Harrop, chair of IDTechEx and co-author of a report on the micro EV market. “But China and Taiwan will get the price down, and others are adding innovation to make them more attractive.” 
Micro EVs are much smaller and lighter than standard EVs like the Chevrolet Bolt, Tesla Model S and Nissan Leaf. Uniti, for example, weighs 400kg and comes with a 11 or 20 kWh battery. 
However, standard EVs’ bigger batteries allow for longer ranges; the entry-level Tesla Model S 60, which costs from £66,500, can manage just over 200 miles between charges, compared to an estimated 93 miles for Uniti’s two-seater EV.
Nevertheless, Uniti’s range is ideal for city driving, says Lewis Horne, the company’s CEO. He feels the smaller battery, compact size and carbon fibre and bio-composite body also make it more environmentally friendly than EVs that cleave to traditional car designs.
“If we make electric cars in the exact same way we’ve made cars for the last hundred years – big steel frame structure, remove the combustion engine and replace it with an oversized and overpowered electric powertrain – that’s problematic,” he says. 
“A 90 kWh lithium iron battery that’s used to carry around one human occupant is not sustainable.”
As well as the Twizy and standard EVs, Uniti faces competition from the Sion Urban, an upcoming EV with integrated solar cells that can recharge its battery from the sun, and the Eli Zero, a two-seater micro EV with a top speed of 25 mph, which is due to launch in January 2018 for around £8,000.
Eli, the startup behind the car, envisions a future where low speed personal vehicles are used for central travel within cities, and high speed autonomous car-sharing services cater for journeys over longer distances.
Shaina Denny, head of marketing at Eli, says the Smart car, which launched in 1998, has helped pave the way for micro EVs. “When Smart came along, they spent millions of marketing dollars showing people that they can accept a small car, and [...] people are now a lot more open minded than they were even a few years ago.”
Although Tesla has shown that it’s possible for a new company to shake up the car industry, Tim Schwanen, director of the Transport Studies Unit at the University of Oxford, believes micro EV startups like Uniti and Eli still face a tough road ahead.
“The car industry [...] is a sector that has extremely high entry barriers. It’s very difficult for new entrants to gain a foothold,” he says, adding that big players like Nissan and Renault “have a whole apparatus of marketing, distribution, maintenance and expertise behind them that these new companies really lack”.
That might explain why the micro EV market has already experienced at least one false start – MIT’s CityCar, selected as one of the best inventions of 2007 by Time magazine, never made it out of the prototype stage. 
In the long-run, says Schwanen, “popularisation of these micro EVs will depend to a substantial degree on the role of policy”. Governments could introduce parking exemptions to encourage people to purchase one, for example, though he feels the vehicles may be better suited to car sharing schemes and private fleets than individual ownership.

A gathering of Trump’s top advisers was set to take place on Tuesday but has been postponed due to scheduling conflicts, as the administration ponders US involvement in the international climate deal. 
The unusually public internal debate over the future of the deal has shown deep divisions within Trump’s administration as to whether to ditch the pact, which was struck in 2015 when nearly 200 countries agreed to curb their greenhouse gas emissions to avoid dangerous climate change.
Trump, who promised to “cancel” the agreement during the presidential election campaign, has said there will be a “big decision” on the accord ahead of a G7 meeting of countries later this month in Sicily. On Tuesday however, Sean Spicer, Trump’s spokesman, said a decision will now be made after the G7 meeting.
“It’s a sign that the president wants to continue to meet with his team ... and come to a decision on what’s (in) the best interest of the United States,” Spicer said
The president is reportedly leaning towards exiting the agreement, although he may still decide to downgrade US involvement rather than end it completely. 
Different factions in Trump’s orbit have clashed over whether the US should pull out. Steve Bannon, Trump’s top strategist, favors withdrawal, as does Scott Pruitt, the EPA administrator, who has called it a “bad business deal for this country”. Rick Perry, the energy secretary, said last month “we probably need to renegotiate” the agreement. 
Meanwhile, Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state, and Trump’s family members and advisers Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, are understood to favor remaining in the deal. Ivanka Trump is set to meet separately with Pruitt on Tuesday to discuss the Paris pact and according to the Associated Press has been handed the task of reviewing US climate policy.
Discussions have become somewhat bogged down in a legal debate over whether the US could downgrade its emissions reduction goals. Barack Obama’s administration set a target of a 26-28% reduction in emissions by 2025, based in 2005 levels.
The Paris agreement states: “A party may at any time adjust its existing nationally determined contribution with a view to enhancing its level of ambition.” Pro-exit elements in the administration have argued that this text would make it hard to cut the US’s emissions reduction target and may even be used by environmentalists to challenge Trump’s attempts to dismantle Obama’s clean power plan. 
 The Paris agreement is built on a series of voluntary targets set by individual governments with no penalty for failing to meet them. Obama-era officials who helped craft the UN document point out that the language specifically encourages further ambition while allowing nations to backtrack if necessary, as Japan has done in the wake of the Fukishima nuclear disaster.
 “The issue of changing targets has come up during the negotiations and the answer is clearly yes – you can change them,” said a former US government official familiar with the process, who asked not to be named.
 “There’s clearly an expectation that you’d change it in the higher direction but it’s not legally prohibited to change it in the other direction. This is a red herring, used to get people nervous about legal risk. People seem very focused on an imaginary risk and not the very real economic and diplomatic risk of withdrawing.”
 Several countries have urged the US, the world’s second-largest greenhouse gas emitter, not to leave the Paris agreement and risk undermining it. Only two other countries – Nicaragua and war-torn Syria – are not party to the deal. 
On Tuesday, the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, vowed to maintain the Paris deal in a call with the French president-elect, Emmanuel Macron. According to the Chinese foreign ministry, Xi told Macron that China and France “should protect the achievements of global governance, including the Paris agreement”.
Obama has also defended the agreement, telling a conference in Milan on Tuesday: “It’s important that big countries that are big emitters like the US and China ... lead the way.
“The current administration has differences with my administration in terms of environmental policy,” the former president said. “The good news is the private sector has already made a determination that the future is clean energy. Those things are locked in now, into the energy sector.”
Some US foreign policy experts have warned Trump that the US’s standing in the world and its position as a clean energy leader would be weakened by withdrawing, for no tangible benefit.
 “Withdrawing would be harmful mostly to the reputation of the US; it would severely downgrade its leadership status in the world,” said Maria Ivanova, a global governance expert at the University of Massachusetts. “There’s no space for a vacuum, so if the US leaves the world of clean energy and energy efficiency, then that vacuum will be filled by somebody, probably China.
 “Some countries would decry the US leaving while others will say: ‘Now we can pull together on this.’ Countries stepped in when the US pulled out of Kyoto and we got the Paris agreement. There shouldn’t be a place at the table for countries who say they disrespect the agreement but will stay and influence what other nations do.” 
Big businesses have added their voice to the debate, with a group of more than 200 large investors this week joining calls from companies, including fossil fuel interests, to stick with the status quo. A recent letter signed by BP, Shell and Rio Tinto informed Trump that the Paris deal “expands markets for innovative clean technologies, generating jobs and economic growth”, adding that “climate change presents US companies with both business risks and business opportunities”.
But dozens of conservative and free market groups are urging Trump to follow through with his promise to exit the deal, claiming it wages “regulatory warfare” against America.
“The Paris climate treaty is an all-pain-for-no-gain agreement that will produce no measurable climate benefits and exacerbate energy poverty around the globe,” said Myron Ebell, former head of Trump’s EPA transition team and a director at the Competitive Enterprise Institute.
 The American public is largely supportive of the deal, according to polling conducted by Yale University. Nearly seven in 10 registered voters say the US should stay involved in the climate pact, with just 13% wanting an exit. A slim majority of Republican voters want to remain.
 The world’s average temperature has increased by around 1C since mass industrialization, with 16 of the 17 warmest years on record all occurring since 2000. The Earth hasn’t experienced carbon dioxide levels as high as they are now for at least 3m years, when the sea level was about 80ft higher than it is today. 
 Scientists have warned that countries face a shrinking window of time in which to cut heat-trapping emissions to avoid further warming beyond 2C that would cause severe sea level rise, heatwaves, spread of disease and the potential mass displacement of people.

Sorry to be a bit of a pedant, but in science a theory cannot be proven, only disproved when observable facts contradict it. There can be (a growing and substantial) body of evidence supporting a theory, in which case it confidence in it will grow, but it will still not be proven. It is the hallmark of a 'proper' scientific theory that it can be falsified. Any framework that will explain all possible outcomes of an experiment is unfalsifiable and not a scientific theory.

This is a scientifically dubious claim. Why? It's because that methane carbon atom (CH4) came from the grass or grain the cow ate (as carbohydrate) which was removed from the atmosphere in the form of CO2 by plant photosynthesis. Methane in the atmosphere is oxidized back to CO2 over about 10 years. This cycle does NOT increase atmospheric CO2.
This is different from methane released from oil drilling and natural gas production - those carbon atoms were removed from the atmosphere millions of years ago and have been sitting underground ever since. When that methane is released and oxidized back to CO2, it DOES increase atmospheric CO2.
This is really why the only way to slow global warming rates is to eliminate fossil fuel production and combustion, period, end of story - coal, oil and gas have to be phased out entirely and replaced by non-fossil renewable energy systems.

From solar to fake meat and low-carbon concrete, Oliver Milman explores some of the best examples of climate change-tackling innovations and innovators.
 Large-scale solar is a booming industry in the US, with the sector now employing twice the number of people involved with coal mining. But the decarbonization of America’s energy system is happening at a more local level, too.
 There are 25 states with at least one community solar project online, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, and 2016 was a bumper year, with 218 MW added. 
 “It’s picking up speed, and there’s a lot in the pipeline, so it’ll be a mainstream driver of solar in the future,” said Alex Hobson, a spokeswoman for the association. “There is room to grow and there’s a lot of interest from people who never thought about solar, such as those renting or who are moving out of their buildings in the near future.”
 Community solar works by allowing several people, such as those in a building with several apartments, to derive energy from a solar project installed on their building or elsewhere. Some utilities provide customers the ability to purchase the renewable energy from a shared facility, while in other cases groups of people band together to take advantage of state and federal incentives to make the investment themselves. California, Colorado, Massachusetts and Minnesota are currently leading the way.
 Agricultural activities currently contribute about 10% of America’s total greenhouse gas emissions each year, largely due to the methane expelled by cattle.
 Americans are eating less beef than they did a decade ago, but further reductions would be handy if the US is to reduce its emissions to levels that would help avoid dangerous climate change. A raft of new meatless meat options have been made available for those who are reluctant about going vegetarian but can’t quite stomach the impact of meat production.
 The Impossible Burger, a fake meat offering, has gained plenty of headlines due to the fact it “bleeds” much like the real thing. The $12 burger, backed by investors including Bill Gates and Google, has confused some diners but it’s hoped it will help make people cut down on beef, saving land, water and emissions in the process. There is plenty of competition, too, from brands such as Beyond Meat, Gardein and the venerable Tofurky.
 Worldwide use of concrete is soaring, largely due to a building boom in China and, to a lesser extent, India. In fact, China has used more cement since 2011 than the US did during the entire 20th century.
 The greenhouse gas emissions in its production are significant, prompting researchers to come up with a greener alternative. In February, Rutgers University’s Richard Riman announced a new technology that can make a variety of materials, including concrete. Combined with cement, the product can reduce the carbon footprint of cement and concrete by up to 70%, according to the university.
“I looked at how shellfish make ceramics at low-temperature, like carbonate crystals, and then looked at what people can do with water to make landing strips in Alaska, and I said we should be able to do this with ceramics, but use a low-temperature chemical process that involves water,” Riman said.
“When you can develop technologies that are safe and easy to use, it’s a game-changer.”
A technology company called WISErg has developed a product called the Harvester, which transforms food waste into fertilizer than can be applied to lawns. The product, launched in 2014, has helped the company get more than $30m in investment.
 In the same area, a startup in Connecticut is working on replacing gasoline-run mowers with a solar-charged alternative that, for each lawn, saves emissions equivalent to those of a car on the road for 12,000 miles.
 Wind currently supplies around 5% of America’s electricity but the sector is on the up thanks to the introduction of offshore wind farms.
 In December, the first US offshore wind turbines started turning near a small island off the coast of Rhode Island. The Block Island wind farm is small – capable of powering about 17,000 homes – but has opened up the way for further developments along the coast.
 Donald Trump isn’t a fan – he has fought a losing battle to prevent a wind farm near one of his golf courses in Scotland – but the falling cost of turbines is making offshore wind more competitive. Maryland is currently mulling two different proposals for offshore wind which would dwarf the Block Island development.
 Electric vehicle sales jumped 70% in 2016, following a disappointing previous year, with more than 30 different models on sale by the end of the year. Tesla, Chevrolet, Nissan and Ford lead the way, with more than half of sales occurring in California, which mandates a certain slice of auto sales must be electric.
 Continued growth could depend on whether a federal tax credit is extended but the electric vehicle market is maturing from a niche oddity to a competitive international field. The Chinese government is calling on auto manufacturers to sell more electric vehicles to improve air quality, with Ford announcing it will electrify 70% of the vehicles sold in the country by 2025. There’s still a long way to go – many drivers still worry about the availability of recharging stations – but this is yet another clean energy market that America could lead in.
 Even the sober assessment of the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) leaves much to guesswork when it comes to meeting emissions reduction goals. If the world is to avoid 2C or more of warming, as-yet undeveloped technology will need to be used to extract carbon dioxide from the air at some point, due to the patchy progress in cutting emissions.
 One desperate intervention could be solar engineering, which is being studied by a team led by David Keith at Harvard University. The researchers are looking at how chemical compounds, such as limestone dust, can be dispersed in the atmosphere, thereby scattering sunlight and sparing an area below from its heat. 
 How this can be achieved, and whether it is even desirable to do so, is an ongoing debate. But if we continue to cook our planet, then governments may have to turn to the likes of Keith to help avert the worst.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/05/climate-change-innovations-fake-meat

Milankovitch cycles are an unproven theory and very poorly understood
BQEND
You are aware that it is based on the pure physics of Newton. Later bettered by Einsteins theory of special relativity?
Ironically, Andre Berger that you cite, has been one of the leading minds reflecting upon the M-cycles. His paper is solely based on the questions about how energy is separated on this planet following them - and the causality of when glacial inception occur. 
It took half a century of scientific testing between the orbital effect could be demonstrated with data. This was because science spent the year in between figuring out how to sample deep time from the oceans many kilometres below the surface without disrupting the sediments. Science worked hard to figure out how stable isotopes can be measured accurately. Entire scientific topics were busy figuring out how to tie deep time chronology together. Global scientific investigations figured out how to use mathematics in a way that allowed spectral analyses to be performed. 
All this led up to the final nail - around 1976 (yes the Hays et al paper). 
It is not poorly understood at all. It is very well understood and proven with ice-cores going 800.000 years back in time - and with ocean cores going millions of years back in time. 
The glacial inception problem, the cycle-skipping problem, the question of 100,000 pacing being a true cycle or a ""resonance multiple of frequencies"" or even a slow feedback from bedrock being eroded and changing topography - are all interesting dynamical ideas. 
But the amount of forcing is really really really well understood. 
And here is the problem for deniers who use this example: When you spin it - it always come out as a problem of climate sensitivity. Either you have to say that natural forcings must alone cause a lot of change (high sensitivity to small amounts of forcing) or you end up arguing for a low sensitivity of natural forcings (which after summing up cause CO2 to be more relevant than they try to argue for). The foot ends up in the mouth however you wish to spin Milan like this - and whenever this is pointed out the proponents of the arguments go into defensive mode and say in essence ""much is not known about the universe"". 
Biggest fail though is to use one of the many many insightful papers of Andre Berger to argue for the theory of orbital forcing to be poorly understood. It is about as clever as using a paper from Stephen Hawkins about Hawkins radiation from black holes to say that the universe is strange and that physics can not explain anything. 
Sure - the mid-Pleistocene shift in ice-volume rhythm is an interesting question. It is a fun ""problem"" in science. But it is not about uncertainty in the external forcing. 
PS: Science are not in the business of ""proving theories"".
Let me ask you the following questions: 
1) If it were not for science - would you know about ice-ages?2) If it were not for science - would you have ever heard about an astronomer from Serbia in arrest if it was not for science?3) Did you ever actually understand what this gentleman who did not want to fight a war wrote scientifically? 
How about actually studying a subject, that involves also understanding the message, how it is treated over a century, understand why we climate scientists affectionately at times call Milutin the happiest ""war criminal in the history of science"". Science is also history and culture - but most of all it is understanding.

No.
The Earth warmed out of the last glacial stage until around 9,000 years ago.
Then the temperature was (nearly) stable for about 4,000 years - this is called the Mid-Holocene Climatic Optimum, or Mid-Holocene Warm Period.
Then, about 5,000 years ago, it began to cool very very slowly - until humans began to add lots of CO2 to the air.
Then it started to warm quickly, reversing the cooling trend.
Temperatures at points in the Mid-Holocene Climatic Optimum might have been (just about) as warm as in the later 20th century, but only in the summer and only in the northern hemisphere.
It's increasingly likely that the Earth is now warmer than at any time since the Eemian interglacial, over 115,000 years ago.
The Eemian was warmer than the Holocene because of higher insolation.

If over half the surface area of the planet becomes inhospitable, it will not render Earth uninhabitable, but it will be unrecognizable and existentially challenging for the majority of the people, species and communities on Earth.

Warming temperatures have rapidly reduced the size of 39 named glaciers in Montana since 1966, according to comparisons released by the US Geological Survey (USGS) and Portland State University. Some have lost as much as 85% of their expanse over the past 50 years, with Glacier national park, site of 37 of the surveyed glaciers, set to lose all of its eponymous ice formations within the next few decades. Of the 150 glaciers that existed in the park in the late 19th century, only 26 remain.
The disappearance of glaciers in Montana is part of a broader loss that will see all glaciers, defined as moving bodies of snow and ice larger than 25 acres, largely vanish from the lower 48 states of America by the mid point of the century, according to Dr Daniel Farge, lead USGS scientist.
“It’s inevitable that we will lose them all over the next few decades,” Farge said. “The Colorado glaciers started melting before Montana’s and while there are larger glaciers in the Pacific north-west that will hold on longer, the number vanishing will steadily grow until none are left.”
Andrew Fountain, a geologist at Portland State, added: “While the shrinkage in Montana is more severe than some other places in the US, it is in line with trends that have been happening on a global scale.”
Rising temperatures – Montana is warming nearly twice as quickly as the global average – and changes in precipitation patterns are eroding away glaciers in the state and elsewhere along the Rocky mountains. Last year, scientists in Colorado found that the Arikaree glacier, which is likely more than 1,000 years old, has been thinning by around a metre (3.2ft) a year over the past decade and will vanish within 25 years.
Warming winters are bringing more rain, rather than glacier-forming snow, to Montana and other states. Even when there is plenty of snow, as Montana experienced this winter, the increasing heat of spring and summer is melting it away more quickly. Spring snow melts are now occurring at least two weeks earlier than they were in the 1960s.
Scientists analyzed the extent of the 39 Montanan glaciers by studying aerial and satellite imagery stretching back to 1966. The latest data, from 2015, shows that there are now just 26 glaciers larger than 25 acres. The largest, Harrison glacier, is now 410 acres – a 19% decrease over the past 50 years. Others have declined by up to 85%.
Glaciers have been in this stretch of the northern Rockies for around 7,000 years and the study of tree ring data and piles of rocks left behind by shifting glaciers show there were around 150 of the ice formations in the Glacier national park area in 1850. Most have now disappeared.
Farge said glaciers started to shrink from around 1910 and then entered “rapid and continual” melting from the 1970s onwards. The environmental conditions now experienced in the region are a marked departure from historical norms.
“The glaciers have waxed and waned with different climate fluctuations but this is the first time they are heading for almost certain extinction,” Farge said.
“This is the first time in 7,000 years they’ve experienced this temperature and precipitation. There’s no hope for them to survive. We’d need a major reversal where it would get cooler, not just stop getting warmer. There’s nothing to suggest that will happen.”
Farge said the decline of the glaciers outlined in the research is probably conservative as it focuses upon the extent of the glaciers, not the volume. Thinning glacier ice may cover a reasonable area but is particularly vulnerable to further warming and melting.
Last year, 2.9m people visited Glacier national park. Future tourists will be confronted by a vista devoid of glaciers, a loss that Farge said will be “poignant”.
“We hope that loss contributes towards a dialogue about what to do about it,” he said. “It’s important that the data is out there and is being discussed.”
According to Nasa, the world’s glaciers have lost around 400bn tons of ice per year since 1994, a decline that has impacted wildlife, increased wildfire risk in places and contributed to rapid sea level rise.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/11/us-glacier-national-park-is-losing-its-glaciers-with-just-26-of-150-left

BQEND
Which is a 100% wrong statement. While I did address some of the errors made by a climate denier about the depth to which IR will penetrate water, it is still not particularly deep. The heat transfer to Ocean's is still restricted by convection and conduction. 
If you look at my links you'll see that I have 2x referred to how boreholes are used as climate proxies which go back to 1500. 
Explained perhaps most simply in this link:
http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/pd/climate/teachingclimate/surftemps2000yrs.pdf
While radiation isn't going to go far into a solid and there will be no convection it doesn't mean that no heat transfer is taking place. 
While it is a complicated example nonetheless it is still pretty standard thermodynamics and until equilibrium is reached the temperature will increase throughout the crust which is adding heat.
The difference between the Oceans is that it is easy to measure with most boreholes in fact drilled for a different purpose to the climate data which they are used for. 
As I tried to explain above the temperature on the surface acts like a voltage. In this case, if you change the voltage then the current will continue to flow.
BQSTART
Nearly all caves are at a temp which is essentially the average at that location for the year.
BQEND
Which means that if they are more than 10m down can only happen from heat transfer...
Although, it is largely irrelevant and the temperature differences involved could be 0.001K order of magnitude and still be significant.
More significantly is that the energy entering the continental system is definitely higher than the global energy inventory has accounted for.

It's worth taking a look at the chart of the lapse rate again.
Notice there are three hot spots, and two cold spots between them.
Positive gradients indicate warming from above, negative gradients warming from below. Energy always flows from hot to cold, source to sink.
The hot regions are where energy is absorbed, the cold regions are thermodynamically ""furthest"" from these energy sources.
As the sun's radiation hits the thin outer atmosphere at the top of the thermosphere, x-rays are absorbed at this level, causing the first spike.
The atmosphere cools as we descend further from this region.
The next hotspot is at the top of the stratosphere is where UV is absorbed by the ozone layer.
Finally, at the surface there is a hot spot where visible light is absorbed by the surface.
The increased greenhouse effect reduces the energy reaching the base of the stratosphere, making that cold point colder.

I was about to question your assertion that the top of the troposphere was cooler as well as the bottom being warmer. It seemed more likely that the top of the troposphere stayed the same temp and the bottom warmed, in which case the temp gradient lines wouldn't cross at all. But if nearly all the CO2 remains in the troposphere, then I see what you mean it may well be that the top boundary is in fact cooler.
BQEND
I found this piece on sks which seems to support what I am saying about the reasons for stratospheric coooling.

Stratospheric Cooling and Tropospheric Warming - Revised

BQSTART
In concluding, this paper has explained the mechanisms which cause the troposphere to warm and the stratosphere to cool when the atmospheric level of CO2 increases. The dominant mechanism involves the conversion of the energy of motion of the particles in the atmosphere to IR radiation which escapes to space and the second method involves the absorption of IR energy by CO2 in the troposphere such that it is no longer available to the stratosphere. Both methods act to reduce the temperature of the stratosphere.
BQEND
-----------------

BQSTART
This has made me realise that I don't understand the interactions of the atmospheric layers and global warming.
BQEND
Not sure I do either, that's why I want to discuss it.

BQSTART
Is it right that the raised CO2 level is restricted largely to the troposphere (because the atmosphere is not wel-mixed about that)?
BQEND
Not sure about CO2, but the troposphere is the turbulent wet atmosphere, the water does not make it much higher than that.
The stratosphere is layered, laminar, dry and the layers don't mix much.

BQSTART
Is that what people talk about when they refer to the 'missing tropospheric hotspot' which seems to be dsomething deniers harp on about? I thought that that was something to do with latitude, and not just altitude.
BQEND
Yes, this is localised in the tropics, an obvious consequence of any surface warming for what ever reason, not specific to AGW.

How do we find a new [scientific] law ? 
First we guess it, ... [ pause for laughter to die down … ] then we compute the consequences of the guess to see what it would imply. And then we compare those computation results directly to observation to see if it works.
If it disagrees with experiment, it’s wrong. In that simple statement, is the key to science.
It doesn’t make any difference how beautiful your guess is. It doesn’t make any difference how smart you are, who made the guess, or what his name is. If it disagrees with experiment, it’s wrong. That’s all there is to it.

BQEND
Isn't that the ""Effective Emission Height"" (EEH), the (completely abstract / theoretical) lowest altitude with the temperature of the Earth's ""blackbody temperature"" of 255°K (-18°C) ?

BQSTART
As we are warming the surface, and cooling the stratosphere, the gradient of the line will change.
BQEND
As I understand it part of the AGW hypothesis is that the gradient (slope) of the lapse rate does not change (?), but adding CO2 to the atmosphere raises the EEH resulting in the ""intercept"" with the surface (altitude = 0 / sea level) being ""moved to the right"" (as you put it), i.e. the surface temperature will increase.
Altering both the EEH and the stratosphere's temperature / lapse rate might result in the absolute temperature of the tropopause (where the sign of the lapse rate changes from negative to positive) changing, but as far as I am aware there is no theoretical basis for saying this temperature has to be a single ""fixed"" value.
Satellite data is unlikely to have the (spatial) resolution to investigate this idea.

We’ve known that for many decades. In fact, there are no reputable scientists that dispute this fact. There are, however, a few scientists who don’t think the warming will be very much or that we should worry about it. These contrarians have been shown to be wrong over and over again, like in the movie Groundhog Day. And, a new study just out shows they may have another error. But, despite being wrong, they continue to claim Earth’s warming isn’t something to be concerned about.
Perhaps the darlings of the denialist community are two researchers out of Alabama (John Christy and Roy Spencer). They rose to public attention in the mid-1990s when they reportedly showed that the atmosphere was not warming and was actually cooling. It turns out they had made some pretty significant errors and when other researchers identified those errors, the new results showed a warming. 
To provide perspective, we know the Earth is warming because we can measure it. Most of the heat (93%) goes into the oceans and we have sensors measuring ocean temperatures that show this. We also know about warming because we have thermometers and other sensors all over the planet measuring the temperature at the surface or in the first few meters of air at the surface. Those temperatures are rising too. We are also seeing ice melting and sea level rising around the planet. 
So, the evidence is clear. What Christy and Spencer focus on is the temperatures measured far above the Earth’s surface in the troposphere and the stratosphere. Generally, over the past few decades these two scientists have claimed the troposphere temperatures are not rising very rapidly. This argument has been picked up to deny the reality of human caused climate change – but it has been found to be wrong.
What kinds of errors have been made? Well first, let’s understand how these two researchers measure atmospheric temperatures. They are not using thermometers, rather they are using microwave signals from the atmosphere to deduce temperatures. The microwave sensors are on satellites which rapidly circle the planet. 
Some of the problems they have struggled with relate to satellite altitudes (they slowly fall over their lifetimes, and this orbital decay biases the readings); satellite drift (their orbits shift east-west a small amount causing an error); they errantly include stratosphere temperatures in their lower atmosphere readings; and they have incorrect temperature calibration on the satellites. It’s pretty deep stuff, but I have written about the errors multiple times here, and here for people who want a deeper dive into the details. 
It’s important to recognize that there are four other groups that make similar measurement estimates, so it’s possible to compare the temperatures of one group against another. The new paper, completed by Eric Swanson and published by the American Meteorological Society compares the results from three different groups. He focused on measurements made over the Arctic region. His comparison found two main differences amongst the three groups that suggests the errors.
To better appreciate the issues, the satellites have instruments called Microwave Sounding Units (MSUs) or more recently, Advanced Microwave Soundings Units (AMSUs). These instruments allow reconstruction of the lower troposphere (TLT), the mid-troposphere temperature (TMT), and the lower stratosphere temperature (TLS). But the measurements are not at a specific location (like a thermometer) - they are smeared out over large spaces. As a consequence, it’s possible to have one layer of the atmosphere contaminate the results of another layer. You wouldn’t for instance, want your measurement of the troposphere (lower atmosphere) to include part of the stratosphere (above the troposphere). 
Among the key differences among the research teams are their methods to ensure this contamination is minimized. According to the recent paper, which was published in January 2017: 
At present, the UAH v6 (most recent Christy/Spencer data) results are preliminary and a fifth revision has now been released as v6beta5 (Spencer 2016). The release of the UAH version 6 products before publication is unusual, and Spencer recently stated that a manuscript has been submitted for a peer-reviewed publication. While some may find it scientifically inappropriate to utilize UAH v6b6 data before publication, these data have already been presented in testimony during congressional hearings before both the U.S. House and Senate and have also appeared on websites and in public print articles. 
The author compared the Christy/Spencer data (UAH data) with another group (the RSS group) and found that the results diverged during the 1986-1988 time period. This shift “could arise from a step change or bias in either series.” When the author compared UAH with the third group (NOAA), the difference was still evident. However, when he compared RSS to NOAA, there was hardly a difference. 
The author also noted that the timing of this divergence coincided with the merging of a new satellite NOAA-9, and this satellite has previously been identified as a source of error in the UAH results. But the author continued the analysis to more recent times and found another anomaly in 2005 which has since been corrected in NOAA.
Look, measuring temperatures from satellites flying high above Earth is hard. No one doubts that. But let’s not be deluded into thinking these satellites are more accurate than thermometers (as some people suggest). Let’s also not blindly accept low-ball warming information from research teams that have long histories of revising their data. I created the image below a few years ago to show the upward revisions made by the Christy/Spencer team over time in their global troposphere temperatures. 
It is relevant to be reminded of these revisions; had we believed the results from the 1990s, we’d still think the world was cooling, and we’d still be wrong.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/may/11/more-errors-identified-in-contrarian-climate-scientists-temperature-estimates

The Nordic country takes up the two-year chairmanship of the body, increasingly a forum where arguments about climate change play out, at a ministerial meeting on Thursday in Fairbanks, Alaska, where the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, will represent the Trump administration.
The meeting is due to set targets to reduce black carbon in the Arctic, a pollutant that traps atmospheric heat, but comes amid fears the US is poised to downgrade its commitments made at the 2015 Paris conference on climate change.
Harri Mäki-Reinikka, the Finnish ambassador for northern policies, called for the Paris treaty to be respected. 
“We hope there will be no deals over the heads of others – these are very global issues. Arctic conditions are changing. If the temperatures are two degrees higher globally that can be four degrees higher, or even six degrees in the Arctic,” he said.
“What is even more worrying is that ice and snow are melting faster than we estimated, and that will change the composition of the waters and even the sea level might be rising. If we have two countries, Russia and the US, not sharing the view that climate change is happening or is manmade or how much it is manmade, it is very difficult to proceed.”
Mäki-Reinikka said “a month ago Putin said climate change is not man made” but recent reports of bubbles of methane gas forming in Siberia, potentially putting more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, could mean “a vicious circle of climate change and global warming will be faster, and the Paris climate change agreements will need to be stronger”.
Russian scientists have mapped out 7,000 dirt-covered mounds in Siberia, which have mysteriously taken shape in the otherwise flat tundra landscape. Some are slowly filling up with pressurised carbon dioxide and methane, with some on the verge of exploding.
Efforts are under way by some British climate experts to persuade senior Russian scientists to think again about climate change.
A debate is still raging within the US administration about whether Donald Trump should stick to his campaign commitment to abandon the Paris treaty.
Another member of the Arctic council, Norway, has also been putting pressure on Trump with its environment minister, Vidar Helgesen, this week saying that climate change was now seen by military planners as a serious international security challenge. 
There are eight member states on the council and about $400bn (£310bn) is being invested in the region, with the majority of that sum from Russia.

He was speaking at the end of a meeting of the eight-nation Arctic Council in Alaska, a consultative body dedicated to sustaining the Arctic.
The members signed a document “noting the entry into force of the Paris agreement on climate change and its implementation, and reiterating the need for global action to reduce both long-lived greenhouse gases and short-lived climate pollutants.”
The representatives also state that they recognise that “activities taking place outside the Arctic region, including activities occurring in Arctic States, are the main contributors to climate change effects and pollution in the Arctic, and underlining the need for action at all levels.”
Temperatures have been rising faster in the Arctic than elsewhere, revealing the acute threat to the region and leading to fears about a wider knock-on effect around the globe.
There have been fears that the council, which is not a formal decision-making body, would be unable even to agree a joint declaration.
Donald Trump, in his presidential campaign, described climate change as a Chinese hoax, but since then there has been a huge debate raging inside the administration about whether to pull out of the Paris treaty, signed in 2015, or to lower the level of US commitments.
Tillerson sought to reassure the international Arctic community, saying “we’re not going to rush” to make a decision, but that the American government would make “the right decision for the United States”.
“We are appreciative that each of you has an important point of view, and you should know that we are taking the time to understand your concerns,” Tillerson said. “The Arctic Council will continue to be an important platform as we deliberate on these issues.”
There were also fears that wider geopolitical tensions will develop in the Arctic as the US, Russia and China battle for oil and gas resources likely to be opened up by the melting of icecaps and unfreezing of waters.
But in their opening remarks, foreign ministers from the world’s eight circumpolar nations instead reaffirmed their commitment to keeping the world’s geopolitical tensions out of the forum’s work, which focuses on environmental issues and sustainable development.
“The Arctic Council is so valuable to all of us, and very much for Canada, [because] it’s where we, the Arctic nations, can set aside issues outside the Arctic and appreciate that we have shared stewardship of this region,” said Canadian foreign minister Chrystia Freeland.
“The US-Russia initiative will make it easier to move equipment, samples and data across borders in the north and facilitate scientific collaboration and sharing.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/12/us-signs-treaty-to-protect-arctic-giving-some-hope-for-paris-agreement

The reef is not and was never a barrier to rising water levels

Of course it is, ie. a barrier against high-tides and storm surges. This is a well known phenomenon and indeed is how such coral atolls form in the first place. Such barriers, without being any kind of total barrier simply slow down the flow to effectively reduce the maximum inside the fringing reef. Another example of the same phenom is the building of deep channel in the Venice lagoon to allow those large cruise ships to enter. They inadvertently allow a much greater inflow from tides and storm-surges which has greatly worsened the flooding of the city. (And in fact, as with these Pacific island, the large extraction of ground water from the entire Veneto basin, has also caused the same ingress of salt water.)
And stop spitting chips, I didn't say the sea level isn't rising (though it is a trickier thing to measure than you think; most earlier measurements have been clouded with systematic inaccuracies) but that it is exacerbated by these other factors.

AR5 Synthesis Report:
Coastal systems and low-lying areas will increasingly experience submergence, flooding and erosion throughout the 21st century and beyond, due to sea level rise (very high confidence). The population and assets projected to be exposed to coastal risks as well as human pressures on coastal ecosystems will increase significantly in the coming decades due to population growth, economic development and urbanization (high confidence). Climatic and non-climatic drivers affecting coral reefs will erode habitats, increase coastline exposure to waves and storms and degrade environmental features important to fisheries and tourism (high confidence). Some low-lying developing countries and small island states are expected to face very high impacts that could have associated damage and adaptation costs of several percentage points of gross domestic product (GDP) (Figure 2.5c). {WGII 5.3–5.5, 22.3, 24.4, 25.6, 26.3, 26.8,29.4, Table 26-1, Box 25-1, Box CC-CR}

No Party in Australia, allows grassroots members to design Party policy, have a say as to how our elected politicians vote on Bills before the Parliament, or affect the direction of the Party like the Australian Greens does. As a mere member, I can come up with an idea for a policy and put it to my local Greens branch for discussion. If they agree my idea, my idea is then put to State council. If they agree with my policy idea, then it is put to National Council. If they agree to my idea, my policy idea can become Greens policy that they take to an eleciton and that is put on their website. In fact, this is how most of the Greens policies have evolved. No other Party allows mere menbers to have that amount of say, and therefore, the Greens are the total opposite of being totalitarian, which means 'a dictatorial form of government' according to the Australian Concise Oxford Dictionary. Greens policies are actually incredibly mainstream - which you would have found pout if you had cared to read them. However it is people such as yourself, who are totally ignorant to what the Australian Greens represent, and the Murdoch press, who deliberately perpetrates lies and misinformation about the Greens, that people like yourself gullibly believe, who adopt ignorant attitudes about the Greens, and then spruike these attitudes as facts. I bet you have never attended a Greens meeting or checked out the Greens website, or spoken to a Greens politician.

But our findings also suggest that although the islands may not be swamped by rising seas, they are likely to change in size and shift their position on the surface of reefs. The rate of these changes may also increase as sea level rises. 
This raises questions for their ongoing habitation. How will physical changes to the islands affect drinking water supplies, and how will communities need to adapt their farming practices? Questions about island change must be addressed urgently in order to inform decision making and secure the future of Pacific nations.

Erietera Aram’s water analogy is apposite. His country faces being lost under the waves of the Pacific Ocean.
Migration is the last option. We want to save our countries
The i-Kiribati man is in Australia delivering his message about the reality of climate change in his country, and of its immediacy. Each discussion, he says, is like a drop of water, adding to the one before it, slowly building understanding of the existential threat to his people and place.
“Climate change is not something off in the future, it’s not a problem for later. We are living it now,” he says.
The archipelago of Kiribati – 33 tiny coral atolls spanning 3.5m square kilometres of ocean – is the world’s lowest-lying country, with an average height above sea level of just two metres.
Most of the 113,000 i-Kiribati live crammed on to Tarawa, the administrative centre, a chain of islets that curve in a horseshoe shape around a lagoon.
“My place is very small,” Aram says. “If you stand in the middle, you can see water on both sides. We are vulnerable. One tsunami, one tsunami and our whole country will disappear.”
Already, there is less and less of Kiribati for its inhabitants. The coastline is regularly being lost to king tides and to creeping sea levels, and in a very real sense, there is nowhere to go.
The loss of land is causing conflict – Tarawa is growing ever more densely crowded, as families living on the coastline are forced inwards, infringing on another’s claim.
The next round of multinational climate talks in November – COP 23 – will be chaired by Fiji, and is expected to swing particular focus of the global climate debate to the Pacific, where comparatively minuscule amounts of carbon are produced, but the effects of climate change have been felt first, and most acutely.
Assuming the COP presidency, the Fijian prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, said he would “bring a particular perspective to these negotiations on behalf of some of those who are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change – Pacific Islanders and the residents of other small island developing states and low-lying areas of the world”.
But the islands’ fight to be saved was everybody’s, Bainimarama said.
“Our concerns are the concerns of the entire world, given the scale of this crisis.”
Aram and compatriots from Kiribati and fellow low-lying islanders from Tuvalu are travelling with the Edmund Rice Centre, a social justice group, across Australia. They have met politicians, unions, coalminers, and officials from the CSIRO and power stations “and we think they have heard our stories, they understand how serious this is”.
Recent reports from groups as disparate as the World Bank, the Menzies Research Centre and the Lowy Institute have suggested allowing open-access migration from Pacific Islands to Australia as a more effective economic stimulus than aid, and as a strategy for coping with the impacts of climate change, which are already beginning to see islands across the Pacific lost to the sea.
In April, the former US deputy undersecretary of defence Sherri Goodman visited Australia, and said the Pacific was “right in disaster alley” and the region would be “on the frontlines” of widespread forced migration caused by climate.
The issue of a mass migration is a contentious one for the Pacific Islands facing annihilation under the waves. Many islanders are resistant, but understand it may be inevitable.
“We don’t want to leave our country,” Aram says. “We love our land, and it doesn’t have the same meaning to be living somewhere else. We don’t want to be migrants of climate, but if there is no change our country will disappear into the sea.”
It feels terrible, he says, to worry about one’s country’s very existence.
“What will happen to my children’s country, that’s why I worry. What am I leaving behind? We are the voice of the children of these vulnerable countries.”
Aso Ioapo from Tuvalu says “migration is the last option of the Tuvaluan people”.
“Our history and our culture are very important to us, and we believe that this is the place we are supposed to be. We don’t want to lose that, we don’t want to lose who we are.”
Tuvalu has had an increasing number of cyclones, of greater intensity, over recent years. In 2015, Cyclone Pam sent massive waves washing over some entire islands. About 45% of the country’s 10,000 population was displaced, the government said.
“The cyclones are occurring more regularly, and they are more powerful now,” Ioapo said.
“We have to face that we might have to go to another place. That is hard. But migration is the last option.

Fracking may be impractical in parts of the UK due to the scarcity of local water supplies, and in other areas will have an impact on local water resources, the water industry has admitted, in a deal struck with the oil and gas industry. ... 
In a memorandum of understanding published on Wednesday, the water trade body Water UK and the UK Onshore Operators Group (UKOOG), which represents fracking companies, agreed to cooperate on expanding the number of fracking sites in the UK.
But in their agreement, noting ""the pressure on local water resources"", Water UK acknowledged: ""The quantities of water needed vary by site and throughout the gas exploration and production process, but the demand could have an impact on local water resources. This demand may be met from a number of sources, including the public water supply, direct abstraction, water transported by tanker from other areas, or recycling and reuse of treated flowback or produced water.""
They added: ""However, where water is in short supply there may not be enough available from public water supplies or the environment to meet the requirements for hydraulic fracturing.""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/27/water-shortages-fracking-impractical-uk

I am accusing the Conservative Party led by Theresa May of pursuing a dangerous and reckless policy which may put the public, the natural environment and the economy at serious risk. It is a reckless policy which pays no attention to joined up thinking about the problem and the risks. The Conservative government has put no resources into improving water supplies, building more reservoirs. River levels are recklessly lowered with licences for abstraction which should never have been granted because it dries up reservoirs and depletes aquifers.
This is what the one time Conservative Water Minister said about 2012.

As environment minister in the spring of 2012, I was warned that the chance of avoiding a massive drought was about 3%.

For Hughes, the impact of drought on the life of the river is critical because of the water abstraction regime, where water is taken from a ground source for irrigation or is treated for consumption. “In a normal, healthy environment wildlife can cope with drought and floods,” she says. “In 2015, 3,000 fish were killed due to over-abstraction. Of all the abstraction licences, only about 25% allow for an environmental flow. All the others are historical. There’s  a huge legacy of over-abstraction, so in times of drought the abstraction is going to continue until there’s nothing left for the rivers. We’re advocating for a sustainable abstraction regime. It’s more of a policing issue: there must be a sufficient level of water in the river for the environment that is safeguarded.”

Tewkesbury in Gloucestershire, famous for its abbey, the Wars of the Roses battle in 1471 and the floods that ravaged the town in 2007, might seem an unlikely place to look for evidence of impending drought. But stroll along the riverbank at Abbey Mill Gate and the signs are there: the mud is cracked and dry, the reeds brown and withering, and the water is starting to form pools.
“The water levels are low. I notice it when I put my bucket in the water,” says Christine Greenwood, who has spent the past year living on a barge at Abbey Mill, where a spur of the Avon meets a tributary of the Severn. “It affects us because we can’t turn the boat.” In the last week Abbey Mill Gate has featured consistently near the top of the list of rivers in the county with levels well below their normal minimum. Although rain is expected to give Tewkesbury’s rivers a little relief this weekend, it Tewkesbury is one of many places that could be hit by an expected summer drought following one of the driest winters in more than 20 years.
Greenwood points to a small wooden jetty on the far side of the river. “The water would normally be up to the edge,” she says. “Now the water laps almost a metre below at the poles supporting the jetty.”
Such small signs of change are familiar to environmentalists and scientists: they suggest that the river system is suffering the effects of a concerted period of low rainfall, an event whose most likely outcome is drought. And while falling levels can be inconvenient for the people living on the rivers, they can be catastrophic for the wildlife that is a crucial part of the river ecosystem.
“At the moment, river flows are low and affecting migratory fish – salmon, sea trout, eels, shad, lamprey,” says Arlin Ricard, chief executive of the Rivers Trust. “All of these species’ migration upstream will be affected by low flow. It’s already having an effect. Salmon will be the first casualty, then trout, then coarse fish. Those migrating are struggling most because they need a good flow of highly oxygenated cold water to move upstream. Then you will start to see algal blooms caused by warm, nutrient-rich water. They will smother or kill off fish and invertebrates and deplete oxygen from water. During previous droughts, we’ve seen blue-green algal blooms on reservoirs, which can render water unfit for consumption.”
Kathy Hughes, a freshwater specialist at the WWF, says other river species could be threatened by drought. “The situation is challenging because wildlife is in a slow, steady decline. Thousands of fish die every year because of a lack of water in the rivers. Kingfishers need healthy amounts of water, water voles are on a knife-edge. When there is no water, they have no refuge to hide from predators and during drought their population can be wiped out.”
The early signs of drought are following a pattern familiar from 2012: a reasonably dry summer last year, a dry winter and a couple of dry months in the spring. April saw just 41% of average rainfall nationally; the six months from October were the driest since 1995-96. The Environment Agency said that, while some rivers, reservoirs and groundwater sources were lower than normal, there were currently no water supply issues as a result of the dry weather. However on Friday Affinity Water, which supplies 3.6 million customers in the south-east, urged people to save water because of a lack of rainfall. The company said that the region had received just over half its average rainfall since July resulting in low river levels.
For Hughes, the impact of drought on the life of the river is critical because of the water abstraction regime, where water is taken from a ground source for irrigation or is treated for consumption. “In a normal, healthy environment wildlife can cope with drought and floods,” she says. “In 2015, 3,000 fish were killed due to over-abstraction. Of all the abstraction licences, only about 25% allow for an environmental flow. All the others are historical. There’s a huge legacy of over-abstraction, so in times of drought the abstraction is going to continue until there’s nothing left for the rivers. We’re advocating for a sustainable abstraction regime. It’s more of a policing issue: there must be a sufficient level of water in the river for the environment that is safeguarded.”
Environmentalists had hoped that a new water bill would include a reform of the abstraction licences, but the bill has been postponed due to Brexit.
For Ricard, population density and climate change have exacerbated the effect of low rainfall. “We’re a really drought-prone country, that’s why we struggle. Because of our population density – in the south and east it’s 1,000 people per square mile – we have less rainfall per head than anywhere in Europe, apart from Cyprus and, bizarrely, Belgium. Most scientists and environmentalists would see what is happening now as symptomatic of climate change or a period of change. As environmentalists, we are always saying that we’re seeing these consistent problems of climate change manifest themselves as drought or flood. All those formulas of a once in a 100-year event don’t work any more.”
He says that while water companies have learned from previous droughts – by increasing the ability to transfer water by pipe between areas – other measures, such as improving soil quality and an expanded system of farm reservoirs, can offer a longer-term solution.
“Paradoxically, to protect yourself from drought takes very similar measures as it does to protect yourself from flood,” he says. “You need to look to the uplands and wetlands and retain as much water as possible. What’s the one thing we can do? Improve soils and increase the potential of soil to retain and receive water and let it flow through to the aquifers. We’re not doing it.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/13/unhappy-tales-riverbank-drought-disaster-avon-wildlife

This hypothesis has been refuted: both Ocean heat content and atmospheric temperatures are rising. The oceans are warming, not cooling.

Another explanation, not necessary excluding the first, is variation of cosmic rays intensity due variation of Solar magnetic field.
BQEND
Cosmic ray intensity increases with increased solar radiation which, according to Svensmark's hypothesis, would seed more low clouds to trap heat.

The PETM was a major warming event around 56 million years ago, and there was no ice age after that.
Not for well over 50 million years, anyway.
Like many other hyperthermal events, the PETM is marked in the geochemical record by a negative carbon isotope excursion, which means that lots of carbon of organic origin was added to the atmosphere.
That's very much what is happening now - in the current case, the carbon is from fossil fuels.
There's an interesting discussion of the PETM, and the possible mechanisms behind it, here:

the company’s knowledge of climate change dates back to July 1977, when its senior scientist James Black delivered a sobering message on the topic. 
“In the first place, there is general scientific agreement that the most likely manner in which mankind is influencing the global climate is through carbon dioxide release from the burning of fossil fuels,"" Black told Exxon’s management committee. 
A year later he warned Exxon that doubling CO2 gases in the atmosphere would increase average global temperatures by two or three degrees—a number that is consistent with the scientific consensus today.

As droughts and major storms are at historical lows and the sea level rise is unchanged from a century ago, food production is as high as it as ever been. People are living longer than ever no need to panic yet then?
BQEND
Droughts in the United States may be at a historical low (though the means of monitoring this aren't exactly the most scientifically reliable). You might want to look up what ""global average"" means.
Even within the US, eight of the ten hottest years on record have been since 1998. Globally, all ten have been. Average temperatures across 48 states have risen year on year for the past century, with the rate drastically increasing in the last 30 years. The last decade has had twice as many record high temperatures as record lows.
Tropical storm activity has increased in the Atlantic, Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico for the past 20 years. 
The sea level rise is not ""unchanged from a century ago"". Sea levels have been rising at roughly 3mm per year since 1993, with a forecast rise of 52-98cm by 2100, or a conservative estimate of 28-61cm if we actually take action - this could be completely thrown off depending on what happens to the flow of ice from the Antarctic ice sheet, which could contribute another 20cm alone. 
As for ""food production is as high as its ever been"" - that is part of the problem. The food we eat is wholly dependent on the oil industry and from production to transport, expends more energy than we will ever get out of it. That's before you even look into how grossly inefficient the meat industry is alone.
Similarly, ""people are living longer than ever"" contributes to the problem.
Your mentality, when not sharing debunked and just plain made up denier nonsense, appears to be one of ""things are fine now, so why worry?"", which is singularly blinkered and naïve at best and dangerous at worse.

NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE | LETTERPrintShare/bookmarkAnthropogenic contribution to global occurrence of heavy-precipitation and high-temperature extremes
E. M. Fischer & R. KnuttiAffiliationsContributionsCorresponding authorNature Climate Change 5, 560–564 (2015) doi:10.1038/nclimate2617Received 27 November 2014 Accepted 18 March 2015 Published online 27 April 2015
Climate change includes not only changes in mean climate but also in weather extremes. For a few prominent heatwaves and heavy precipitation events a human contribution to their occurrence has been demonstrated1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Here we apply a similar framework but estimate what fraction of all globally occurring heavy precipitation and hot extremes is attributable to warming. We show that at the present-day warming of 0.85 °C about 18% of the moderate daily precipitation extremes over land are attributable to the observed temperature increase since pre-industrial times, which in turn primarily results from human influence6. For 2 °C of warming the fraction of precipitation extremes attributable to human influence rises to about 40%. Likewise, today about 75% of the moderate daily hot extremes over land are attributable to warming. It is the most rare and extreme events for which the largest fraction is anthropogenic, and that contribution increases nonlinearly with further warming.

In fact, climate forecasts conducted in the 1990s have been quite accurate in simulating what happened since the year 2000. 
A study by Myles Allen and colleagues at Oxford University, for example, compared climate forecasts that begin in 1996 with the actual temperatures observed since.
They found that the simulations accurately predicted the warming experienced in the past decade to within a few hundredths of a degree.

One of the starkest alterations to the White House’s website following Trump’s assumption of office was the scrapping of an entire section on climate change, stuffed with graphs on renewable energy growth and pictures of Barack Obama gazing at shriveling glaciers, to be replaced by a perfunctory page entitled “An America first energy plan”.
In the more than 100 days since, the administration has largely opted for a chisel and scalpel approach to refashioning its online content, but the end result is much the same – mentions of climate change have been excised, buried or stripped of any importance.
Federal government websites are being combed through to apply new verbiage. The state department’s office of global change, for example, has removed links to the Obama administration’s 2013 climate action report and mention of the latest UN meeting on climate change. Text relating to climate change and greenhouse gases has also been purged.
Trump’s desire to champion the coal industry is reflected in the Department of Energy’s online pages aimed at educating children. Sentences that point out the harmful health consequences of burning coal and other impacts of fossil fuels have gone.
Alterations to the Department of the Interior’s climate section weren’t quite as subtle. A nine-paragraph description of melting glaciers, wildfires and invasive species driven by climate change has been pared down to a single, noncommittal line.
And then there’s the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the target of severe cuts to its climate programs by the administration and led by an administrator, Scott Pruitt, who has defied basic scientific understanding of climate change.
On 28 April, the EPA announced in as quiet a way possible – it was a Friday at 7pm – that its website was “undergoing changes that reflect the agency’s new direction” under Trump and Pruitt. This would involve “updating language to reflect the approach of new leadership”.
Immediately, the EPA’s climate change section disappeared, to be replaced by a static holding page. This page linked to a “snapshot” from 19 January that includes copious information on the basics of climate change, the amount of greenhouse gases emitted in the US, temperature data and how the EPA is helping tamp down emissions. 
These changes have caused deep alarm among environmental groups and some scientists, who fear that tweaked online language may soon morph into reams of climate data being deleted. While the record-keeping rules of the EPA and other agencies demand that data is retained, there is little to stop the administration hiding it from public view, only to be obtained via freedom of information laws.
Groups such as DataRefuge and the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI) have swung into action to monitor and archive climate and other data, just in case. EDGI uses a team of volunteer analysts to track changes to around 25,000 pages across multiple government agencies.
 Maya Anjur-Dietrich, member of EDGI’s website tracking committee, said the initiative has “observed several emerging patterns, which notably concern climate change and renewable energy”.
 “Across multiple agency websites, we have seen a reduction in usage of terms like ‘climate change’ and ‘greenhouse gases’, and an overall reduction in access to information pertaining to climate change,” she said. 
“In a few cases, we have also observed shifts in economy- and business-oriented language, where the descriptions of the office focuses have increased their mentions of helping to grow infrastructure, create jobs, and stimulate the economy. 
 “On certain DOE (Department of Energy) pages, in particular, we have seen a shift in emphasis away from renewable energy and, in some cases, towards usage of fossil fuels.”
 Anjur-Dietrich pointed out that federal government websites have always been regularly updated, either during an administration or its transition. But unless care is taken, broad, important themes such as climate change can become obscured. 
 “It is when web pages are changed without transparency, explanation, or careful documentation that the public’s access to information – and thus the ability to understand the implications of that information – is imperiled,” she said. 
Activists have sought to resurrect removed information through the so-called Beetlejuice provision, which is where three separate freedom of information requests for the same thing requires the content to be publicly displayed. 
The Beetlejuice tactic has been used on a range of agencies – including Nasa and the EPA – for climate data, renewable energy information and other content. Researchers fret that changes to online generalities aimed at the public may ultimately grow to become threat to their work. 
“It’s a serious concern that we will lose this information because long-term, large-scale environmental data is very hard to come by,” said Stuart Pimm, an ecologist at Duke University who submitted one of the freedom of information requests. 
“At this stage it’s a fear – I haven’t had colleagues saying they tried to get data and it’s no longer there. But this has to be viewed in the context of an administration that’s very hostile to science. I mean, we have a president who has said climate change is a Chinese plot.”
Amy Atwood, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, added: “Scrubbing information about climate change will not make it any less dangerous.
“We’re going to fight the Trump administration’s efforts to bury the science showing the dangerous impacts of climate change at every turn.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/14/donald-trump-climate-change-mentions-government-websites

Invest in plastics recycling plant,article,http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/may/15/ikea-peak-stuff-plastics-recycling-renewables,0,"Ikea has bought forest in Romania and the Baltics, wind farms in Poland and now it is investing in a plastic recycling plant in the Netherlands.
For the Swedish furniture giant, extending control across its supply chain in this way could help it become more sustainable by avoiding environmentally damaging activities like illegal deforestation and plastic waste.
Ikea is not alone in this strategy. 
Apple, for example, has invested in forest in the US to increase the supply of sustainable pulp and paper goods that it needs for packaging. Google and Amazon, meanwhile, are two of a number of big companies that have bought renewable energy, in part to protect themselves against variable electricity prices.
The latest Ikea move saw it acquire a 15% minority stake in Dutch plastic recycling plant Morssinkhof Rymoplast, spending some of the €3bn (£2.54bn) the company has allocated to sustainability investments.
Plastic production accounts for 6% of global oil consumption (pdf), a figure expected to grow to 20% by 2050 on current trajectory.
With increasing consumer awareness around plastic waste, Ikea’s investment in Morssinkhof Rymoplast builds on the company’s goal (pdf) to make its plastic products (representing around 40% of its total plastic use) using 100% recyclable and/or recycled materials by August 2020.
Pia Heidenmark Cook, Ikea’s acting chief sustainability officer, says the investment is intended to help Morssinkhof Rymoplast develop its capabilities. The Dutch company currently has facilities across the Netherlands and the capacity to produce more than 220,000 tons of high grade recycled materials a year.
“It is our first investment with the recycling industry […] so at this point, it’s really a learning experience to understand more about what is needed for getting high quality plastic that can be fed into our products,” says Cook.
Jakob Rehme, professor of industrial economics at Sweden’s Linköping University, suggests that such investments can be a logical preemptive step for a company whose demand for materials is so significant. “This [demand] means they often need to tackle the sourcing strategy that could lead to a resource scarcity – of recycled plastics for instance,” says Rehme.
If and when regulation gets tougher and producers are required to have a percentage of recycled plastic in new products, an investment in recycling will help Ikea secure what could become a highly sought after material.
“We’ve seen this trend in a number of business sectors,” says Dexter Galvin, head of supply chain at CDP. “Climate change and resource scarcity present global supply chains with significant risk […] some businesses respond with a broader global sourcing model but many are pursuing vertical integration [where a business expands its operations in the supply chain].”
For some, however, there are concerns around the motivations and consequences of businesses expanding in this way.
Rehme says, for example, that a significant driving force behind the food and drink industry’s investments in recycling has been to avoid regulation and shape a voluntary system instead. He warns that while large company involvement can potentially be a force of good, they can also end up dominating an entire supply chain and hurting SMEs or companies from developing nations.
For Donna Marshall, associate professor at University College Dublin, it can also be about greenwash. In the absence of demonstrating real progress when it comes to reducing environmental impact, she says, providing innovative sustainable suppliers with support is “great PR for a company”.
Ikea disputes such criticism of its latest investment. “Our approach to the circular economy is not to buy up recycling companies,” says Cook. “It’s one element to learn more and better understand upcycling, but it’s not the prime strategy.”
With Ikea’s plans to open its first store in Hyderabad, India, next year, and ambitions to hit €50bn (£42.29bn) revenue by 2020, Cook says the circular economy is integral to expanding without using further raw virgin materials.

Some earth science background on that -
The glaciation of Antarctica began around 34 million years ago, when CO2 reduced from around 1000 ppm to around 600 ppm.
The reduction is linked to increased weathering of the newly-rising Himalayas.
Antarctic glacial inception began at around 750 ppm, and spread more widely as the CO2 level continued to fall.
So - eventually - if CO2 rises back to those levels (around 800 ppm) allowing for the fact that it takes a lot of (latent) heat to melt ice at zero C to water at zero C - this would create conditions where Antarctica would become ice-free again.

Specifically what are the company plans for managing the transition from an oil & gas company to an energy company fit for the future. Fields with high costs will be viewed by major oil & gas firms as sunset regions. Some such fields in the North Sea already are. Long before oil & gas are viewed as sunset industries the return of assets will increasingly be the concern for major institutional investors such as pension funds. None will invest in companies with a large holding of long term ‘stranded assets’. Stranded oil assets occur when costs to exploit the oil field are more than expected returns from the oil market. Speculators will however continue to chase a return on assets betting they can narrowly avoid left holding worthless or falling value shares.
The International Energy Authority (IEA) in Paris each year produce an outlook which is often used as basis in many long term investment decisions. The IEA has been spectacularly over optimistic regarding world-wide coal demand over the last five years, constantly having to downgrade forecasts as the world moves away from this polluting sunset industry.The IEA current outlook to 2040 predicts an 11 million barrels per day (bpd) increase in oil demand largely due to China accounting for 4.1 million bpd and India 6 million bpd. The IEA see the 1.2 million EV’s in 2015 growing to 30 million by 2030 and 150 million by 2040. Oil use in 2040 will fall by 1.3 million bpd only then impacting upon the oil price. Using the IEA’s figures plenty of years ahead for CEO’s to enjoy large re-numerations investing in oil based largely on China and India’s future oil demand. 
Except China and India have other ideas that blow apart the IEA’ predictions. For both countries the import costs of oil is high and pollution in cities a major concern for citizens. Electric vehicles are now seen as part of the solution. China said last month it expects to have at least 20% of annual auto sales to come from EV’s by 2025, nearly 7 million EV’s annually within a decade. India are being more aggressive. A government run think tank has advised India can save $60 billion and clean up its cities by making car transportation 100% electric by 2032. After that date no new gasoline or diesel cars sold in India. By 2030 that would mean 10 million EV cars annually. The IEA called the Indian Government’s plan ‘ambitious’ and promised a detailed review before the next report. Judging by its past predictions for coal, IEA downgrades on oil growth are likely to be a yearly event. The question for CEO’s is when will oil demand growth turn negative?
The IEA’s outlook for 2017 due in November will be studied by many, not least CEO’s in major oil & gas companies.

The UK-based firm suffered a rare and humiliating shareholder rebellion last year when chief executive Bob Dudley’s £14m pay package was voted down, against the backdrop of record company losses.
Another uprising is unlikely at the AGM on Wednesday, when investors will be asked to approve the £9m salary for Dudley in 2016 – 40% lower than in 2015 – as higher oil prices pushed the company back into profit.
However, for the first time in three years, shareholders will also decide on a binding new pay policy for 2017-20, which would lead to a £2.9m cut in Dudley’s maximum payout.
Campaigners are encouraging investors to vote against the policy on the grounds that company strategy appears “misaligned” with the Paris climate deal’s goal of avoiding dangerous global warming. 
ShareAction acknowledged BP was doing better than rival Shell on removing oil and gas volume production targets from its pay policy, but said BP’s corporate strategy was failing to adapt the firm for a lower carbon world. 
The group added that a green light would lock in a pay policy at a “critical” time for addressing climate change, as 2020 is seen as the last year by which carbon emissions must peak for the world to be likely to keep temperature rises below 2C.
The Church of England, which has BP in the top holdings of its £9bn funds, said it would be voting against both Dudley’s pay and the remuneration policy.
“We’ve noted this year that there has been some improvement on executive remuneration. That said, it is still an extremely large award when you look at the whole package and compared to peers so we obviously remained concerned,” said Adam Matthews, head of engagement for the church commissioners.
But with just 50% of shareholders needed to approve the remuneration policy, it is unlikely to be derailed.
The three big proxy shareholder advisory services – Glass Lewis, ISS and IVIS – have recommended a vote in favour or have no concerns with the policy, the first time all three have been supportive for several years.
Separately, the authoritative Carbon Disclosure Project placed Shell one spot above BP at four out of 10 in a new league table of how oil and gas companies have responded to investor concerns on climate change. The group called Shell’s link between remuneration and carbon emissions a “landmark”, and noted that BP had no equivalent measure.
Anglo-Dutch rival Shell’s AGM, which takes place on 23 May, will also have its remuneration and climate change policies scrutinised. ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/15/bp-shareholders-urged-reject-executive-pay-package

The idea that UK-based cattle are fed grass and exclusively grass is simply wrong. And as I've shown, a lot of UK dairy is not pasture based. Plus, obviously, the UK is not self-sufficient in animal products, and there are plenty of other animal products that do not involve cows.

Lol, cattle and sheep can be factory farmed. I think you need to get out more. Also even if you want argue that they are just out grazing they still require more land and water than plants. 
Yes, I am aware that fruit and vegetables require water, I never denied that, but they require LESS (do you get that, less?) than meat farming. That is because as explained earlier the meat industry needs the water for the animals, and to use on the plants grown to feed the animals (Most animals are fed on crop based diets, not just on grazing alone). Also animals need water to survive (There you learn something new everyday, don't you? Now lets hope you don't ask me again why animals need water).

Meat production contributes disproportionately to these problems, in part because feeding grain to livestock to produce meat—instead of feeding it directly to humans—involves a large energy loss, making animal agriculture more resource intensive than other forms of food production. The proliferation of factory-style animal agriculture creates environmental and public health concerns, including pollution from the high concentration of animal wastes and the extensive use of antibiotics, which may compromise their effectiveness in medical use (Horrigan et al., 2002: 445).

Regardless of how the animals are raised, most of the water footprint of beef comes from how they’re fed, and more specifically the water it took to grow their feed. While they may start out eating grass, in the US, 99 percent of all livestock spends some final portion of their life “finishing” in a feedlot or concentrated animal feeding operation (CAFO) where they eat mostly corn- and soy-based feed, along with forage like alfalfa. The other 1 percent continue grazing on pastureland and are given very little supplemental feed. Both systems have a very high green water footprint because both rely heavily on rainfall; pastureland grasses and most corn and soy crops are typically not irrigated.Industrial beef has a high grey water footprint because of nutrient runoff from fertilizers and pesticides applied to the corn and soy crops and contaminated runoff from mismanagement of cattle manure. 
A staggering 51 percent or more of global greenhouse-gas emissions are caused by animal agriculture
what water does the meat ''industry'' use?
Is that not simple? It takes an enormous amount of water to grow crops for animals to eat, clean filthy factory farms, and give animals water to drink. A single cow used for milk can drink up to 50 gallons of water per day—or twice that amount in hot weather—and it takes 683 gallons of water to produce just 1 gallon of milk. It takes more than 2,400 gallons of water to produce 1 pound of beef, while producing 1 pound of tofu only requires 244 gallons of water. 
what is the meat ''industry''?
Those who raise then slaughter animals for consumption (Bernard Matthews is part of it)
Using land to grow crops for animals is vastly inefficient. It takes almost 20 times less land to feed someone on a plant-based (vegan) diet than it does to feed a meat-eater since the crops are consumed directly instead of being used to feed animals. 
Commercial fishing methods such as bottom trawling and long-lining often clear the ocean floor of all life and destroy coral reefs. They also kill thousands of dolphins, sea turtles, sharks, and other “bycatch” animals. Coastal fish farms release feaces, antibiotics, parasites, and non-native fish into sensitive marine ecosystems.

This is the crucial thing - grass-fed meat is still unsustainable at the current consumption levels because the number of cattle/sheep you can accommodate per hectare is fairly low.
Intensively reared indoor meat sounds abhorrent - but is it actually less sustainable than using many acres for grass-fed animals? To know which is the most sustainable, we need the figures on how much land is used for growing fodder crops to feed indoor livestock and how much meat this system produces per hectare of cropland and compare that with how much grass-fed meat is produced per hectare of grassland.
Of course we are going to hell in a handcart if we don't dramatically reduce meat consumption because there too many billions of us to consume this much meat without using up all the land and killing what's left of the ecosystem.

BQENDFirst, no I'm not.
And second, what do you imagine the driver for a great deal of tropical rain forest destruction in particular is?
Let me enlighten you. It is the lack of the cheap fossil fuel energy we are so fortunate to have in the developed world.
Without it cities in developing countries, full of people, are forced to burn timber, bought from illegal loggers who clear forests to meet demand. Farmers move into the cleared land which, without fertilizers, last for about 3 years before they are barren. That could be alleviated with cheap fossil fuel energy which would allow production of cheap modern fertilisers.

Perhaps this is what makes it easier to eat them, wear them and experiment on them. Some of the more hardcore carnivores will loudly claim that the taste of a bacon sandwich is worth committing any cruelty for, but most of us eat meat while averting our gaze from its source.
Of course, we are not alone in eating other animals. Many other species have a meat-based diet – even some species of plant. Animals eating other animals is a critical part of the food web. But humans have twisted their natural inclination into a highly destructive, carnivorous, corporate machine.
Some people forswear meat for health reasons, and some, following in the footsteps of Leonardo da Vinci, see the killing of animals and humans in a similar light. But it starts to get more difficult to separate fact from fiction when we focus on the environmental impacts of livestock. They are a major contributor of carbon emissions, certainly, but placing the blame for climate change entirely on cattle farming is misleading.
When it comes to farm animal numbers, the statistics are frightening. The world’s average stock of chickens is almost 20bn, or three per person. Cattle are the next most populous breed of farm animal at 1.4bn, with sheep and pigs not far behind at around 1bn each. And farm animals that are raised intensively require a staggering amount of animal feed and water. Soya production, mainly for animal feed, has devastated ecosystems in Latin America. All in all, livestock production occupies the vast majority of agricultural land and is the main reason why 50% of the wildlife we share our planet with has disappeared since the start of the industrial revolution.
As a result there is a general consensus that eating less meat and dairy produce is one of the best ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, feed 7 billion-plus people and protect biodiversity. And the focus, up until now, has been on cattle rather than pigs and poultry. This is partly because ruminants or grass-eaters emit methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Cattle farms have also been responsible for large-scale destruction of important ecosystems both directly for grazing and indirectly for animal feed. The expansion of cattle farming in the Amazon, for example, has been responsible for one-eighth of all forest destruction globally in recent times.
So there is no denying that cattle have caused extensive environmental damage in many parts of the world. And over-grazing of cattle, especially in drought-prone regions, has been a significant cause of soil degradation. Soil is key. Soil is the largest land-based reservoir of carbon on Earth, absorbing it from trees and vegetation as they die and decay. Losses of carbon from chemically intensive use of soils and land-use change from ploughing up grasslands and clearing forests and peatlands constitute the second-largest source of CO2 after burning fossil fuels. It’s a little-known fact that soils store four times more carbon than all trees and other life. We will not be able to feed people in the future if the soil continues to be degraded, and we are degrading soils at a faster rate than ever before.
Our number one priority has to be to protect the soil, but the destruction of our soil is where the issue of meat becomes a bit less one-sided.
The traditional solution to soil exhaustion is crop rotation. Without the use of crop rotations which include grass and legumes, crop production comes to depend more and more on synthetic chemicals: manufactured fertilisers – a huge source of climate emissions – and heavy use of pesticides to control weeds, pests and diseases.
Turning exhausted cropland over to grass pasture can protect soils and build soil carbon, while still producing food. Small numbers of animals that eat grass and arable byproducts which we cannot eat could be good for the environment – if they are not displacing critical wildlife habitat such as forests and peatlands. Low-intensity grazing allows fallow land to remain productive, encouraging farmers to protect their soils and reducing the pressure on the land. And if you have pasture anyway, why not use it to give cattle a free lunch?
So the distinction diehard carnivores need to make is not between cattle and chickens or pigs but between intensively farmed animals – which depend heavily on grain or soya and are therefore in direct competition with humans for land – and those that predominantly eat grass or, in the case of pigs, heat-treated swill from our waste food mountains. This means no industrially raised chicken and pork, as it is nearly all intensively reared indoors on animal feed. Factory farming is not only unacceptably cruel, but unsustainably inefficient.
So for people who are not vegans or vegetarians, but still want to do their best for the planet, the most sustainable option is much smaller quantities of higher-quality, mainly grass-fed meat, along with less dairy, more fruit and vegetables, and less processed food. How much less meat? A lot less. Unless, that is, you can persuade all of your friends to go vegan.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/16/meat-eaters-soil-degradation-over-grazing

Fat, slow over the ground and unspeakably terrible looking, they should never have evolved into anything more than an entomological pilot project. 
In some variants, their heads resemble human brains that have been caramelized with a blowtorch. Mandibles, jammed into the bottom of the face part, glisten with alien goo. In their most gregarious morphological variation, black and dun stripes run down their bodies, mimicking something an avid golfer would wear to a funeral. They are speckled with sparse little hairs, like the budding moustache of a teenage Lothario, while their stubby legs appear to have been distributed randomly, and without consideration for balance and mobility.
Unfortunately, as it happens, armyworms do not appear fat and ugly to each other – or not, following one of nature’s great acts of mercy, when they’ve hatched into the world’s most boring looking moth. They reproduce at a staggering rate, with each female laying about 1000 eggs in a 10-day lifetime. And though they may be slow crawlers, they are strong fliers. Every year spodoptera frugiperda, or the fall armyworm, travels from Mexico to Canada, a distance of at least 3000km.
But if they have a dominant evolutionary superpower, it is rapacious communalism: in their larval stage, they advance in squadrons, platoons, battalions, armies – tens of millions storming the countryside, eating every crop or garden they can get their mandibles on. Most pests will consume only the good bits, but armyworms will strip even a fully-grown maize plant down to the last leaf. 
Spodoptera have proved to be a blight in North America, South America, the Middle East, the South Pacific islands, Australia – pretty much everywhere. There are five species of armyworms, but we’re concerned here with the aforementioned frugiperda which is headquartered in North and South America; and the exempta, usually based in Africa. 
Spodoptera exempta – the African armyworm – specialises in cereals, and has been causing havoc on the continent for decades now, spreading out slowly from the east and in 2009 sparking a state of emergency in Liberia. 
The new arrival, however, is spodoptera frugiperda, more commonly and chillingly known as ‘the fall’. This variant, which eats pretty much anything, has enjoyed a long, awful history in South America – managing it costs the Brazilian economy a staggering $600 million a year. In January 2016 it was detected for the very first time in Africa, in Nigeria. (As for how it it got there from the Americas, it either flew in on prevailing winds, or caught a plane. No one is yet sure). 
By April 2016, the pest had travelled to several other West African countries and to Central Africa. By December, it was detected in Zambia, Zimbabwe and Malawi, and was storming South Africa’s borders. Last week, Ghana’s parliament was asked by the minister of agriculture to declare a ‘state of emergency’, and take urgent action as the fall arrived en masse. 
Last week, Ghana’s parliament was asked to declare a state of emergency as a plague of ​​fall armyworm arrived
But why this particular plague, and why now? Is it the newish mash-up between local and invasive species that has produced such unstoppable consumption machines? Or has modern farming – in particular, modern African farming, which depends increasingly on planting vast tracts of a single staple – made it easier for them to advance? In regions stricken by climate change, and which in some parts have recently suffered (or, in some cases, is still suffering through) a once-in-a-generation drought, are armyworms not just another manifestation, albeit the most revolting, of the colossal challenges facing Africans as the world warms? At this stage, no one is really sure certain how best to answer these questions. But there is one last, and far more pressing, problem: can the armyworms be stopped before they eat Africa bare? 
If there is a three-star general currently conducting the war against genus spodoptera, it must be a Lancaster University professor named Kenneth Wilson. According to his university profile, Wilson “ is fascinated by the interactions between parasites and their hosts, be they insects, birds, mammals or humans.” 
He first became interested in African armyworms after studying their migration through Kenya 25 years ago. The sweetener, as far as his particular discipline was concerned, was the armyworm’s achilles’ heel: when he tried to transport live specimens back to a lab in Nairobi, he found that they would succumb to a virus, and none of them would survive the journey. There was a devastating natural loop at work here: a voracious parasite was felled, and easily so, by a voracious infectious agent. His work began to echo almost exactly the plot of HG Wells’ War of the Worlds, in which invading Martians are eventually killed off by microbial infection to which they had no immunity – “slain, after all man’s devices had failed, by the humblest things that God, in his wisdom, has put upon this earth.”
Wilson, who is currently in the field in Tanzania, remains in equal measures enthralled and terrified by these critters. “I got to wondering how armyworms could be such a devastating pest when they seemed so susceptible to this virus,” he explained over email, “and I have been studying the interaction between armyworms and their viruses ever since.”
His research suggested that the obvious solution to any armyworm infestation was to replicate the virus, and employ it as a biological agent in order to eradicate the blight. But this was easier said than done, and his research was anyway focused exclusively on the African armyworm. The recent introduction of the fall into the African theatre served, according to Wilson, “as the latest twist.”
And not a good twist. Given that the fall has only been in Africa since January 2016, no one is quite sure how severe the impact will be. “People are rightly scared about what’s going to happen,” Wilson told me.
Making matters worse, armyworms tend to love maize, the local staple. The practice of monoculture farming – lots and lots of maize, as far as the eye can see – is a key component to any form of industrial agriculture. But it has provided the African armyworm, which specialises in cereals, with a continent-wide all-you-can-eat buffet. “For the many farmers who also grow small amounts of other crops such as beans, peas and other vegetables, their livelihoods were safeguarded to an extent by these other crops,” Wilson explained. “But the fall armyworm has a much broader host range”– translation: it’ll eat anything – “so potentially can also eat these other crops if maize is not available.” 
This attack on regional food security has been compounded by an X factor: climate change. “Drought followed by lots of rain is perfect for armyworms,” said Wilson, describing exactly the kind of weather conditions that are becoming the sub-Saharan norm. And so, in dry years, African crops suffer for the obvious reasons. In non-drought years, there are still the armyworms to contend with. Southern Africa’s recent drought, vicious by any estimation, was broken by the tropical cyclone Dineo, which touched down on the coast of Mozambique mid-February. Much of the region was swamped with massive, in some cases unprecedented, amounts of rainfall. Undaunted – nay, encouraged – onward marched the armyworm.
When the infestation was detected in South Africa in January, it did not come as a surprise to the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Daff), who had effectively posted wanted posters throughout the agricultural community in preparation for a first sighting. The fall armyworm was already listed as a quarantine pest for South Africa in terms of the Agricultural Pests Act 1983. After the first suspected specimens were collected on a farm in the northern province of Limpopo, Daff requested a diagnostic report from the Agricultural Research Council, Plant Protection Research Institute (Arc PPRI), which on February 3 confirmed the armyworm’s identity. 
Daff had already constructed a sort of historical narrative regarding the outbreak, which squared with Kenneth Wilson’s and other expert assessments. Relying on a worst case scenario, which had been realised in other countries as the worm made its way south, Daff thus informed commodity and research organisations of a possible threat, and encouraged farmers to report suspicious pest damage. 
Serendipitously, Daff had recently introduced the South African Emergency Plant Pest Response Plan, which was designed to diagnose and detect new pest infestations. Wisely, the government treated the outbreak as a crisis, and detection was just the first in what was necessarily a tiered attack. According to Makenosi Maroo, Daff’s chief director, stakeholder relations and communications, the department set up an internal joint operations centre, along with a steering committee that included “research, industry and provincial government role players”. But if African armyworms were the known known, the fall was the known unknown – there was no protocol in South African on how best to halt its progress.
As ever, the fallback option was to nuke them with chemicals. But which chemicals? “As the fall armyworm is a new pest to South Africa, no pesticide was previously registered to be used against it,” said Daff minister Senzeni Zokwana, during a hastily called press conference on 6 February. “A process of emergency registration of agricultural chemicals is ongoing with two active ingredients already registered to be applied against this pest. As with all agricultural remedy applications the label instructions must be followed in accordance to the supplier’s recommendations.”
It’s possible that they will spread from Africa to Southern Europe, and then on to northern Europe and possibly Asia
Which was sound advice. But given that the effectiveness of the pesticide regime was still largely speculative, South Africa was due a lucky break. And the country got one due to a quirk in the harvesting schedule: the bulk of the season’s maize crop was unaffected and already drying for harvest, which meant that the armyworms were late for dinner. And there was more good news, at least as far as South Africa was concerned: the country produces most of its maize crop in areas where frost occurs, and armyworms can’t handle the cold. But in the warmer northern provinces of Limpopo and Mpumalanga, to say nothing of the rest of the continent, this was hardly an upside worth mentioning. 
Still, Hamlet Hlomendlini, a spokesperson at AgriSA, a local lobby group, seemed to feel that the crisis was not much of a crisis at all. “We don’t see it as a threat right now,” he told me. “We feel that the department of agriculture is on top of it, and it was restricted to a few isolated farms in Limpopo. It was a question of finding the right pesticides. It seems like things are under control.” 
This would likely sound like an excess of sanguinity to Wilson. When I asked him how seriously African policymakers should be taking the armyworm blight, he was unambiguous. “Very.”
Nothing is certain at this point, but it’s clear that the infestation is spreading rapidly, without respite. A state of emergency has just been declared in Ghana. But the real kicker is that fall and African armyworms, as Wilson puts it, “have teamed up to provide a deadly double act.” This entomological suicide squad will cost a lot of money to control, and if they aren’t kept in check, the stakes get higher. From Africa, said, Wilson, “it’s possible that they will spread to Southern Europe, with seasonal migrations into northern Europe and possibly also into Asia.”
There’s some hope of nailing down an effective pesticide regimen, but that comes with its own problems – poisoning the environment, pollinators, livestock and humans not minor among them. Besides, the fall is resistant to many of the chemicals currently being deployed across the continent. With this in mind, Wilson and his collaborators have been working on a biopesticide derived from the natural disease that was killing his specimens in Kenya all those years ago. 
By his own admission, this is a time-consuming and expensive pursuit. At the moment, Wilson is in Tanzania battle-testing the new weapon. “We are currently at the stage where we are asking some fundamental questions,” he told me. “Will the armyworms develop resistance to the biopesticide in the same way as insects often do against chemicals? Will the virus evolve to be less effective if we produce lots of it under field conditions? And can we make the biopesticide more effective by formulating it in a different way?”
The armyworm is not waiting for Wilson and his team. And while the outbreak is apparently under control in South Africa, no other African country can match Daff’s sophistication. The Central African Republic is in the midst a long-simmering civil war; Zimbabwe is in perennial economic free-fall; and even boring Zambia is undergoing political instability. Next year, according to the experts, a drought beckons. The world’s ugliest worm thrives on exactly this kind of chaos.

While rising carbon dioxide concentrations in the air can be beneficial for plants, it is also the chief culprit of climate change. The gas, which traps heat in Earth’s atmosphere, has been increasing since the industrial age due to the burning of oil, gas, coal and wood for energy and is continuing to reach concentrations not seen in at least 500,000 years. The impacts of climate change include global warming, rising sea levels, melting glaciers and sea ice as well as more severe weather events. 
The beneficial impacts of carbon dioxide on plants may also be limited, said co-author Dr. Philippe Ciais, associate director of the Laboratory of Climate and Environmental Sciences, Gif-suv-Yvette, France. “Studies have shown that plants acclimatize, or adjust, to rising carbon dioxide concentration and the fertilization effect diminishes over time.”
“While the detection of greening is based on data, the attribution to various drivers is based on models,” said co-author Josep Canadell of the Oceans and Atmosphere Division in the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in Canberra, Australia. Canadell added that while the models represent the best possible simulation of Earth system components, they are continually being improved.

Why on earth would you bring up something like 'conservsation of energy' when I asked you about a scalar (1D) linear relationship that supposedly describes our climate? 
Or that germs and atoms exist? Why!? Or why the next canard, that: CO2 is GHG!?
You started here with some generic (simplistic) claims about how H2O functions in the atmosphere, which quickly devolved into pure waffle (ie ""to a first (second,, third, fourth, ..) approximation"") to defend some equally simplistic 'understanding' of feedbacks, seemingly not even aware that these feedbacks are all but certain, both wrt function, signs and magnitudes (apart from being (described as) a simplisitc 1D linear relationship, which is what you (and SkSc-level activists) then believe is the 'explanation').
If you had studied this topic since 1958 (which I doubt), and cite ""all models are wrong ... "", and even contributed to published work? And been around prominent people .. 
 Why then all these extremely shallow talking points? Why the list of 'thermodynamics', 'radiative physics' and 'transfer', 'Stefan Boltzman', 'conservation of energy' (and you forgot 'momentum') etc which nowhere are the least contentious, or are the crux with the models? 
If you truly have studied (or just followed) this topic for decades, you surely must be better informed than just piling on simple (and irrelevant) talking points and lists about unrelated stuff. 
BTW, you've given me the Stanford/Leading philosophers/Nobel Laureates etc rant before. Absolutely none of that is an argument. And although you say sensible things about modelling, you get several important things badly confused. I just point out the last one, where you claim: 
BQSTART
i) the big picture is crystal clear: adding CO2 at the rate we've been doing will dangerously heat the planet. There is ZERO evidence to refute that, and .. 
ii) .. there is no known model that can explain the current data without also implying this danger.
BQEND
Re i) the whole issue is the magnitude of that effect (even you must know that!?) and the jury is nowhere near a verdict there. Further, the 'dangerously' is pure conjecture, has zip to do with 'evidence' and would anyway be value judgment, not a scientific issue . Particularly since the magnitude is so uncertain still.
 And ii) is the unscientific appeal to ignorance
So James, I still think that you don't have a better understanding of the topic than what is fed to you by SkSc (or whichever resource you draw your 'understanding' from). Simply because your talking points don't rise above that level, and moreover because of the (long list of irrelevant talking points and ) deflections you try when I point to the weakness of this understanding.

I think I understand the roles that models play in science, and their limitations. 
The shorthand is that ""All models are wrong. Some are useful.""
Having said that, you seem to be deeply confused about the role that models play in climate science. The basic heating effect underlying AGW is explained by extremely basic scientific models: thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, radiation physics, etc. There is basically no chance in hell those theories/laws/models are wrong in any way that would have any practical import wrt AGW.
We also have hard empirical evidence of the heating effect of CO2 on the planet. These results depend on our models of how various kinds of thermometers, photometers, etc. work. Here there is a bit of uncertainly since some of those devices are only known from historical descriptions, and the models for estimating temperatues at various altitudes from satellite readings are still very rough, but even if you restrict your attention to modern devices for which we have extremely good models, the evidence for AGW is absolutely overwhelming.
The models for paleo climate are still a work in progress, but still are way better than they need to be for the purpose of informing the main aspects of AGW.
Finally, the models that attempt to predict long term climate on small scales seem to be more than good enough to be useful, even if they are rather limited by the computational resources needed to get detailed results. As computational resources increase and the treatment of clouds, water/ice boundaries, waves, improves, these results will become even more useful. But they are already vastly more accurate and precise than they need to be to drive major global policy decisions. Put another way, they are good enough that it would be insane to ignore them or to pretend that they are inadequate. 
Each kind of model contributes a piece of the puzzle, and many of the details are still obscure, but the big picture is crystal clear: adding CO2 at the rate we've been doing will dangerously heat the planet. There is ZERO evidence to refute that, and there is no known model that can explain the current data without also implying this danger.', u'recommendation_count': u'3', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1495420292000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'10053869', u'in_reply_to': u'98973229', u'id': u'99021719', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Walsunda', u'text': u'It's not about caring, it's about understanding the words you use.

But what you describe is a merely the one dimensional 'understanding' of climate, the simplistic (1D) linear formula, that 'climate' is temperaturechange (Delta-T)), whoch is ruled, ruled by the sum of radiative forcings (RF), through a sensitivity (lambda) :
Delta-T = lambda * RF wherein all assumed (bot negative and positive) feedbacks are included and combined in the scalar sensitivity value (lambda).
But this (formula) is not the climate, nor is it the atmospheric system. It is merely a very simplistic rudimentary assumption of how such a relation may be described. To the point: 
This (simple) description is neither the atmospheric system, nor is it an explanation of how it functions! At best it may be a reasonable assumption (=hypothesized model) of how some limited part of it may respond to a perturbation though a (then emerging) curve fit. 
Neither pointing again at the terms 'forcing', 'sensitivity' or 'feedbacks' and repeating them i shriller voice, nor throwing in Stefan Boltzman equations will changa that fact. 
The linear 1D (and assumed) description is neither 'the climate' nor how it works!
And this also should be obvious to anybody with even just a modicum of scientific training. Note: I don't say that this description must be wrong or that there isn't something to how you try to argue the case. 
All I was saying is that the terms with their labels in a formula doesn't make reality abide by it. And also, that most here are only capable to point at those labels (and that formula) and claiming 'this is 'the science' saying that I'm right'
H2O is the most importan GHG, and labelling it 'feedback' neither chamges that, nor makes it a slave under what some would bundle together and in turn label 'forcings'.
If you can't make it past this very simple and obvious facts, you don't even understand the SkSc narrative, which by no means is 'the science' or even a halfway reasonable understanding of how the climate functions.
But thank you for your reply which both demonstrates that you are pointing at the labels, and that SkSc is (essentially) where your 'understanding' comes from ...

Stephens didn’t assuage those fears when he devoted his first column to punching hippies, absurdly suggesting that our lack of progress on climate policy is a result of greens being too mean to climate deniers.
Stephens lamentably stayed on the subject of climate change in his second and third Times columns as well. In those pieces, he used corn-based ethanol subsidies as an example of where climate policy has gone wrong:
So let’s talk about ethanol and other biofuels, a subject some climate-change activists might prefer to forget. In 2007, George W. Bush used his State of the Union speech to call for huge increases in the production of renewable and alternative fuels such as ethanol. Democrats were firmly on board, and President Barack Obama pursued a largely similar course in his first years in office.
This is a clear case of cherry picking. There are hundreds of examples of climate policies with varying degrees of effectiveness; why focus on just one? Many environmental groups and “climate-change activists” have long opposed corn-based ethanol subsidies, as Stephens himself noted. Politicians of both political parties supported those subsidies because they were popular in corn-growing Midwestern states. It had little if anything to do with climate efficacy. So why blame “climate-change activists” for these politically-motivated subsidies?
For his next misleading argument, Stephens shifted to German electricity costs:
The country is producing record levels of energy from wind and solar power, but emissions are almost exactly what they were in 2009. Meanwhile, German households pay nearly the highest electricity bills in Europe, all for what amounts to an illusion of ecological virtue.
Stephens’ comparison to 2009 is another example of blatant cherry picking. German carbon emissions that year were particularly low, due in part to the global recession. The long-term trend is unmistakable:
Just asking @nytimes: why would @BretStephensNYT compare latest German greenhouse gas emissions with 2009, of all years? Delicious cherries! pic.twitter.com/r0J6slelpc
It’s also odd that Stephens criticized Germany for its electricity bills, given that the report he referenced shows they’re a bit lower than what Americans pay. The difference is that while German electricity rates are 3.3 times higher than Americans’, their electricity consumption is 3.4 times lower. In other words, German policies have been successful in cutting the nation’s carbon pollution while still keeping their electricity bills a bit lower than Americans’. 
The country is far from perfect – they still rely on coal for a significant amount of that electricity generation – but from a climate policy perspective, Germany is mostly a success story. America’s per-person carbon pollution is nearly twice as high as Germany’s.
Although his columns are riddled with these sorts of misleading cherry picks, worse yet is that Stephens’ arguments are red herrings, distracting from the elephant in the room. 
Stephens’ columns worry that America will jump on the bandwagon of any feel-good climate policy. If only we lived in a world where that were a legitimate concern. In reality, the Trump administration is taking every possible step to undo all American climate policies. They’re considering withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement because they believe it won’t allow America to increase its carbon pollution. 
The administration has effectively declared war on the Earth’s climate and our future well-being. Noam Chomsky has called the Republican Party the most dangerous organization in human history because of its climate denial and policy obstruction.

Stephens’ focus on corn-based ethanol is like a cancer patient worrying about a hangnail. Certainly, all parties should debate the best and most effective policies to address climate change. We’ve been pleading with Republicans for years to engage in that debate. Democrats have proposed all sorts of different policy solutions - government regulations, free market cap and trade systems (a Republican invention), small government revenue-neutral carbon taxes - you name it. They’re not the problem. 
Fortunately, some prominent Republicans have stepped up to engage in the climate policy debate. Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham authored past climate legislation. 19 House Republicans have joined the Climate Solutions Caucus, 12 of whom just introduced The Climate Solutions Commission Act that would establish a commission to recommend economically viable climate policies. And a group of Republican elder statesmen on the Climate Leadership Council met with the White House to recommend support for a revenue-neutral carbon tax.
However, while deserving of great praise and encouragement for their efforts, these climate realist Republican Party leaders are in the minority. The question is whether they can wrest control of the party away from the climate deniers and policy obstructionists before too much damage is done to the Earth’s climate and the future prospects of the GOP.
The Republican Party used to be conservative on environmental issues, as Tea Party co-founder Debbie Dooley has noted:
On this issue, the conservative approach requires major efforts to cut carbon pollution. Merely investing in research and clean technologies, as Stephens supports, is grossly insufficient. 
It’s worthwhile to challenge New York Times readers’ notions and worldviews, but not if it’s done in an intellectually dishonest way on the greatest existential problem we face today. Stephens could use his platform and influence to try and reverse his party’s policy obstruction; instead he’s chosen to concern troll Times readers. They expect and deserve much better.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/may/16/ny-times-stephens-cant-see-the-elephant-in-the-room-on-climate-change

Both of the major parties are currently focused on winning hearts and minds in Queensland, with the state’s marginal seats likely to determine the outcome of the next federal election.
The Coalition has been criticised by environment groups for not acting fast enough to protect the reef, and the government’s support for the Adani coalmine has also been controversial both locally and nationally because of its potential impact on the reef.
In January Guardian Australia revealed that millions of dollars of commonwealth money was being handed to tourism-linked groups for reef protection, despite official advice recommending against the projects, or repeatedly finding them to be failing.
Earlier this year, the head of the United Nations environment program warned the battle to save the world’s coral reefs was at “make-or-break point”. Erik Solheim said governments needed to intensify concrete actions including limiting greenhouse gas emissions, plastic pollution and impacts from agriculture.
In a statement issued in advance of Sunday’s announcement, the prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said the new funding was an investment in the health of the reef and the tourism jobs dependent on it.
“Like reefs all over the world, the Great Barrier Reef is under pressure,” Turnbull said. “A big challenge demands a big investment – and this investment gives our reef the best chance.”
Turnbull said the reef restoration science associated with the funding would be shared internationally and with Pacific neighbours.
“As a highly respected philanthropic organisation, the Great Barrier Reef Foundation has a strong fundraising track record, and will seek corporate contributions to further enhance this work,” the prime minister said.
The funding package includes $201m for improving water quality with changed farming practices such as reduced fertiliser use, $100m for reef restoration science, $58m to combat the crown-of-thorns starfish, $45m for community engagement, including drawing on Indigenous traditional knowledge for sea country management, and $40m for monitoring reef health.
The study on coral mass mortality, published in Nature and led by Terry Hughes, the director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies – published in April – examined the link between the level of heat exposure, subsequent coral bleaching and ultimately coral death.
It found that 29% of the 3,863 reefs that make up the Great Barrier Reef lost two-thirds or more of their corals. It said “initially, at the peak of temperature extremes in March 2016, many millions of corals died quickly in the northern third of the Great Barrier Reef over a period of only two to three weeks”.
“These widespread losses were not due to the attrition of corals that slowly starved because they failed to regain their symbionts. Rather, temperature-sensitive species of corals began to die almost immediately in locations that were exposed to heat stress.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/29/budget-earmarks-500m-to-mitigate-great-barrier-reef-climate-change

An analysis of the latest global sales of electric vehicles found that nearly half the vehicles registered in Norway in the first three months of 2018 were electric (48%), compared to just over a third (35%) during the same period in 2017. The vehicles are run almost exclusively off the nation’s hydropower resource, underlining Norway’s claim as the world leader.
China’s raw numbers were the most impressive, even if the total market share of e-vehicles was only 2% of new registrations.
In the first quarter of 2018, 142,445 electric vehicles – private cars, lorries, trucks and buses – were sold in China, a 154% increase on the previous year.
Stefan Bratzel of the Centre of Automotive Management (CAM), which compiled the data, said: “China and Norway are exceptional in e-mobility. The lead market remains China, where substantial industrial policy motives are driving battery-electric vehicle technology forward.
“In Norway, where now almost half of new vehicle registrations are e-vehicles, it becomes clear how quickly a change in drive technologies can take place. Generally, e-mobility is also gaining momentum.”
In the UK, e-vehicle sales reached 14,084 units in the first quarter of 2018. Plug-in hybrid vehicles accounted for 71% of the sales. The market share of electric vehicles increased from 1.5% a year ago to 2%.
The German market is also be gathering momentum, with the share of electric vehicles rising from 1.2% in 2017 to 2%. At the same time, new registrations of diesel vehicles are in freefall. According to the latest data, diesel’s market share is 31.3% – a decline of 25.4% on the year before.
Globally, new registrations of e-cars are expected to increase moderately by 2020, and will range between 2.5% and 6% of market share, according to CAM. 
By 2025, about 25m newly registered electric cars are expected in the most optimistic scenario, which would equate to a 25% market share; this could potentially rise to a 40% share by 2030.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/19/e-vehicles-electric-cars-uk-sales-rise-norway-china

While the North Meadow Lake near Utqiaġvik, formerly known as Barrow, may be relatively nondescript, it will be the staging ground this month for an ambitious attempt to safeguard the Arctic’s rapidly diminishing sea ice and stave off the most punishing effects of global warming.
Tiny spheres of reflective sand will be sprinkled upon the lake to see if this can prevent the lake ice from melting or slow the process down. Should testing prove successful, the project, called Ice911, has the grand vision of slathering around 19,000 sq miles of sea ice – equivalent to the size of Costa Rica – with trillions of sand grains in order to stem the loss of ice cover and prevent runaway climate change.

“The ice in the Arctic isn’t going to come back by itself,” said Leslie Field, founder of Ice911. “And we don’t have much time left.”
Field, a Silicon Valley engineer and researcher who worked for Chevron and HP, said she was inspired to intervene in the Arctic after seeing Al Gore’s climate change parable An Inconvenient Truth in 2006. 
“It hit me like a train,” she said. “The importance of the Arctic just leapt out to me.
“I looked at it and thought: ‘What if this is a materials problem?’ You go through the list of things that aren’t adding pollution or foods to the environment and it’s a fairly short list. I’ve been through a few options and this one has legs.”
For the past decade, Field has been testing out various materials that might provide a protective barrier to the winnowing sea ice, conducting tests in barrels of water in laboratories, on lakes in California and Canada, on a pond in Minnesota. 
Testing is now set to take place in the tundra of the Alaskan Arctic, near a research station where scientists generally observe changes in sea ice, rather than attempt to halt or reverse them. Scientists flock to Utqiaġvik to survey seabirds or gather data from boreholes in the tundra – there are about 80 beds in austere cabins at the Barrow Arctic Research Center and all will be full this summer.
“Leslie is kind of a one-off,” said Nagruk Harcharek, a senior official at the Ukpeaġvik Iñupiat Corporation, which operates the research centre. “I think her dream is to go pretty big time. Whether that’s realistic and is going to save the world, I don’t know.”
Field is attempting to resurrect the reflectivity lost by the Arctic as sea ice has receded due to a warming atmosphere and ocean. Sea ice is being lost at a rate not seen in at least 1,500 years, with Nasa calculating it is disappearing by about 13% a decade. 
In March, the National Snow and Ice Data Center reported that the Arctic had reached a seasonal maximum of 5.59m sq miles – the second-lowest peak extent in the 39-year satellite record. Scientists forecast that Arctic sea ice could completely vanish in summertime by the 2040s. 
As sea ice is lost, it locks the Arctic into a downward spiral. Less stark white reflective surface, or albedo, means more dark ocean, which absorbs sunlight rather than repels it, thus speeding up the warming process and spurring further melting. Older multi-year ice, 10ft thick in places, accounted for just 1% of the winter ice pack last year, meaning the sea ice that remains is now largely composed of newer, thinner and less reflective ice.
Field claims that her solution could save what’s left. Tiny balls of silica, measuring less than the breadth of a human hair, should reflect 90% of the sun’s heat. This “emergency first aid” is framed as a chance for the world to be afforded more time to slash greenhouse gas emissions. 
The cost and logistics are daunting, however. It’s unclear how the sand grains will be distributed, although Field prefers the idea of ship-based deployment rather than using aircraft. 
Field isn’t targeting the whole Arctic region – instead focusing on areas such as Fram Strait, between Greenland and the Norwegian island of Svalbard – but the cost to festoon 19,000 sq miles of ice in silica would still be around $750m, not including labour.
The continual funding for such an effort will have to come from private donors, or the UN, or perhaps the World Bank. That, too, isn’t certain as yet, despite a “large-scale launch” of ice covering earmarked for 2020.
The world may have warmed by around 1C (1.8F) over the past century but the Arctic far outstrips this global average and is warming at around twice the rate of the rest of the world.
In places, the rate of warming has been astonishing. Novembers in the Alaskan town of Utqiaġvik, formerly Barrow, are now 5.5C warmer than they were in 1979. This past winter, the warmest on record in the Arctic, saw some locations exceed 20C hotter than normal.
The Arctic is dominated by sea ice, unlike the Antarctic which is essentially a huge land-based ice sheet. As the ocean and atmosphere warm, sea ice is shrinking in extent, at around 13% a decade since 1979, according to Nasa. The bright white surface of ice, known as albedo, is giving way to the dark ocean, meaning that sunlight is being absorbed rather than reflected, amplifying the warming effect.
These “rapid and dramatic changes” are introducing a “new normal” to the Arctic, according to US government scientists in a report card last year. Storms are eroding away ice-free coastlines, summer wildfires are becoming fiercer and certain species, such as polar bears, are increasingly struggling to find food. This is all providing a major challenge to communities in the Arctic, but a boon to the shipping industry, which can navigate the area more easily. This task will get even simpler once the Arctic is ice free in summertimes, forecast as soon as 2040s.
“It’s not chump change, but compared to other options it’s cost effective,” she said. “It’s a matter of trying to prevent the horrific list of things, such as sea level rise, storms and so on, that will come from climate change. Things that will cost us trillions, not billions.”
Ice911 isn’t the only direct environmental intervention, known as geoengineering, plotted for the Arctic. 
A team of scientists at Arizona State University want to add an extra metre of sea ice to the Arctic’s current thickness by spending $500bn on a network of 10m wind-powered pumps that would be used to push seawater on to the surface of the ice where it would freeze.
“Our only strategy at present seems to be to tell people to stop burning fossil fuels,” lead physicist Steven Desch said last year. “It’s a good idea but it is going to need a lot more than that to stop the Arctic’s sea ice from disappearing.”
In the Paris climate accords, world governments agreed to a 2C warming limit. Most plausible forecasts concede this won’t be possible with emissions reductions and renewable energy ramp-ups alone. Some sort of technology that captures carbon or removes it directly from the atmosphere will be needed. 
No such viable technology exists at any sort of scale, but a number of geoengineering projects of various hues (Field calls her option “soft” or “eco” geoengineering) have in recent years jostled to forge a breakthrough. 
There is the plan to use 16tn miniature robots to deflect the sun’s heat away from Earth; or the project to pump aerosols into clouds in order to “brighten” them and bolster their reflective power. Another scheme, devised by the scientist who developed Australia’s polymer bank notes, is trialling a thin “sun shield” to be placed over parts of the Great Barrier Reef, which has recently suffered from severe coral bleaching. 
A separate project, led by the Harvard physicist David Keith, plans to head to Tuscon, Arizona, this year to launch the “StratoCruiser” – a high-altitude balloon equipped with sensors that will spray a mist of molecules such as sulfur dioxide or calcium carbonate into the atmosphere to deflect sunlight and spur cloud formation. Harvard’s solar geoengineering program has received funding from Bill Gates, among other sources.
These and other similar projects have faced criticism over potential unintended pollution, as well as the even more hazardous prospect of handing countries a reason to slow down their emissions cuts in favour of a geoengineering panacea that may never arrive.
János Pásztor, a former UN assistant secretary general for climate change, recently called for a pause in solar geoengineering so that unforeseen risks could be properly explored. 
In a speech to Arizona State University, Pásztor singled out Keith’s experiment. “Some time within the next year, we may see the world’s first outdoor experiment on stratospheric aerosol injection take place here in the skies above Arizona, yet for the most part governments are not aware of, nor addressing, the profound governance issues this poses,” he said.
“We urgently need an open, inclusive discussion on how the world will research and govern solar geoengineering. Otherwise we could be in danger of events overtaking society’s capacity to respond prudently and effectively.”
Some scientists are also wary about interventions to restore Arctic sea ice, broadly following the same precautionary principle that tweaking the composition of an ecosystem can have far-reaching ramifications, such as unleashing the cane toad in Australia or allowing feral hogs to run rampant in Texas. 
“I think there are good intentions to solve this difficult problem,” said Cecilia Bitz, an Arctic sea ice expert at the University of Washington. “I don’t fault people looking for geoengineering solutions but I believe it will be cheaper and more effective to reduce our emissions.”
Bitz said she was “not very optimistic” about Ice911’s plan as it creates “very small particulates that are very dangerous for ecosystems”, despite Field’s assurances that the silica will be harmless to wildlife. The silica material will average 60 micrometers, which is “well out of the range of danger” caused by particulates that are typically smaller, at 10 micrometers or less, according to Roman Decca, who works on strategy and engineering at Ice911.
“You could put a big sheet on top of the ice instead, I suppose, but that could trap seals,” said Bitz. “The idea of spraying seawater on top of the ice is interesting and potentially effective, but it’s very costly. All of these solutions would be very expensive. We need to mitigate our greenhouse gas emissions, first and foremost.”
Even if the silica proves benign to the Arctic environment, keeping a lid on warming in the region could backfire anyway, according to Julienne Stroeve, senior research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center.
“Weather patterns and ocean currents bring excess heat to the poles to balance out the planet, so you might invigorate those warming systems,” she said. “It might all be a bit futile.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/23/sprinkling-sand-save-arctic-shrinking-sea-ice

Financing of the project is still to be finalised, but the construction costs will be paid for by the mainly state-owned EDF of France and state-owned CGN of China.

Hinkley has faced ongoing criticism, and calls have been made for the project to be completely halted. According to December 2017 estimates, Hinkley is being built for £20.3bn by 2025, to be paid over a 35 year period. It was reported that two firms could already build wind turbines for £57.50 per megawatt hour for 2022-23, while Hinkley's costs would mean £92.50 per megawatt hour, not generated for at least two years later

That's not how science works, including climate science.
The current paradigm on climate change is based on evidence from tens of thousands of pieces of research in multiple fields of science.
Earth systems respond to forcings, including radiative forcing from greenhouse gases.
Geological history tells us -

BQSTART
The most important lessons drawn from geology are that the earth’s climate can change radically and that the pace of change can be rapid. 
Geology also supports the theory that past periods of especially warm temperature were caused by high atmospheric carbon dioxide level

But add equal capacity of wind to the mix, and the need for storage drops to 6 hours, because the wind blows at night. Add interconnectors between geographically separated regions where wind speeds are uncorrelated and storage needs drop even more. The CSIRO has done a study on this using actual data for demand and weather:
BQSTART
CSIRO Energy chief economist Paul Graham says that additional storage is not needed for up to 40 to 50 per cent wind and solar penetration. That’s because the grid can rely on existing back-up ( built to meet peaks in demand and for when coal and gas “baseload” generators trip or need to be repaired). 
Beyond those levels, storage needs to be part of the equation. But again, not as much as many would think. But as the back-up generators gradually exit the grid, they can be replaced by various storage types, until storage then becomes the principal form of back-up and grid security on the grid.The CSIRO modelling showed that at very high levels of wind and solar, a maximum of half a day’s average demand was needed for storage. In some areas of the grid, only around three hours might be needed.
This is an important point, because some renewable critics say that about a week’s worth of storage is needed, and multiples of wind and solar capacity required for back up. These would be the same people that argue that climate science is a hoax, but it is a view that has more traction than it should.
BQEND
4 hours of storage would add just US$18/MWh to the cost of wind plus solar. And that's now: battery costs are halving every 3 years as we move down the learning curve.

Part of the problem is a lack of easily understood technology options that need to be made apparent as costs come down. One of those technologies - in fact a very important one - is hydrogen. Transport, heating, industry and on-demand power all require a relatively straightforward 'drop-in' alternative to fossil oil and gas. We can use hydrogen in different ways for all these use cases, and this message needs to be elaborated upon and driven home to politicians. 
It would help if companies like Shell had more ambition - but again politicians need to be made aware of cost-effective alternatives to all the various fossil fuel dependencies that exist - so that effective policy measures can be implemented. Massive fossil fuel funding in many institutions does not make the task of simplifying this escape route any easier, nor does the lack of consensus regarding precisely what these alternatives are, and how best to foster their development within the economy. 
Much more thought needs to be put towards these issues, as we can see that without answers being available in the minds of some politicians - despite the necessity to arrive at any answer at all - we are witnessing the types of irrational and faulty decision making that occurs in their absence. 
The reality is that with a solid understanding of the mechanics of the situation; one technology - hydrogen - can have a profound effect on all of the areas many people are independently trying to finding workable fixes for. And with a zero-carbon energy system the opportunity for lasting, meaningful and stable growth presents itself. We either take the opportunity hydrogen presents, or we fail and witness the consequences - which are likely to be very different to anything experienced in the past.', u'recommendation_count': u'2', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1524675615000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'17280722', u'id': u'115120377', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'jacloushr', u'text': u'Can't believe you believe ad hominem is a legitimate argument.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1524656220000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'16275884', u'in_reply_to': u'115104561', u'id': u'115105583', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'mickeycogan', u'text': u'That would be like someone in the 1980s claiming mobile phones are not that mobile and have a short battery life and are not worth pursuing.

1856 - Eunice Foote published a scientific paper in the Journal of American Science, entitled “Circumstances Affecting the Heat of the Sun’s Rays.”
The paper was a report of an experiment in which she put various atmospheric gases into glass vessels with thermometers inserted.
She wanted “to determine the different circumstances that affect the thermal action of the rays of light that proceed from the sun.”
Oxygen and hydrogen, when pumped into the glass containers and exposed to the sun, displayed no significant difference in temperature in comparison to the control vessel containing air.
Pumping carbon dioxide into another receiver, also exposed to sunlight, Mrs. Foote wrote that the mercury in the thermometer leaped, with the one containing the carbon dioxide becoming much hotter, “more so than the others.”

Twice now Shell has lined up superstars including Jennifer Hudson, Pixie Lott and Yemi Alade to sing about solar panels, hydrogen cars, clean cooking stoves and lights powered by a bag of rocks and gravity.
In 2016, Shell even flew three of the stars to the Rio Di Janeiro favela of Santa Marta to put on a concert.
Shell has said the first video – Best Day of My Life – was watched “more than 800m times”. The second video, On Top of the World, was as sickly sweet as the first and has racked up 19m views on YouTube since it was released in December 2017.
Why pick Santa Marta? As Shell itself explained, it is “one of Rio’s most headline-grabbing favelas” and it’s where they chose to help a winner of one of their entrepreneur awards put up some solar panels. 
If you watch the pop videos, or hang around Shell’s YouTube channel, or see much of their marketing material, or visit their very flashy tumblr site, you’ll see very little of what Shell spends most of its time and money actually doing – drilling for lots and lots of oil and gas. 
How sceptical should the millions of millennials in Shell’s marketing blitz – the Jennifer Hudsons and Pixie Lotts and their millions of Twitter and Instagram followers, for example – be of Shell’s contribution to the climate challenge? 
So happy I got to be a part of On Top Of The World with @Shell and 4 talented artists. Together we can #makethefuture! Have you see the full video yet? https://t.co/fEPjVdZbCT #Sponsored pic.twitter.com/DYtOzciSGC
In its annual reports and brochures for investors, Shell’s forewords and introduction will always note the challenge of bringing down greenhouse gas emissions and how the future energy mix will need to change. Shell says it supports the global Paris climate agreement.
But Shell’s central role in this challenge is what? Give the world more oil and gas. The marketing efforts of Shell are not new, and neither is the cynicism towards them.
In 2009, the Guardian’s George Monbiot took the company to task for its advertisements and marketing messaging that had already fallen foul of advertising regulators in the UK. 
In his 2012 book Greenwash (which I was paid to help fact-check), author Guy Pearse said “the award for most prolific oil industry greenwasher goes to Royal Dutch Shell” for years of campaigns just like #makethefuture. 


Shell chairman Chad Holliday even went as far as evoking the spirit of Mahatma Gandhi in the company’s approach to the climate issue. “As Mahatma Gandhi is often quoted as saying, ‘The future depends on what you do today’,” wrote Holliday before outlining a new target the company had set to cut its own emissions by half by 2050.
This target includes the emissions from burning all the extra oil and gas they are enthusiastically pulling out of the ground and beneath the sea bed in locations across the world.
Shell says it was producing 3.7m barrels of oil every day in 2017 which, using the US EPA’s calculations as a guide, generates about 47 Mt of CO2e every month. 
So what is Shell’s actual contribution to the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels and releasing methane that is helping drive dangerous climate change?
I checked their annual sustainability reports going back to 2011 – around the time when Shell was planning its mercilessly mocked “Let’s Go” marketing campaign. 
Shell’s direct emissions – those it has targeted for cuts – have hovered in the mid-70Mt mark since 2011. 
In total, if you think it’s fair to include in its footprint the extra energy Shell buys to get its products to market, and then the burning of all their oil and gas by consumers, Shell’s contribution in 2017 was 664 Mt CO2e (for context, looking at figures gathered by the World Resources Institute, there are only 11 countries in the world with a footprint bigger than that). In 2011, Shell’s footprint was 570Mt.
Shell has been making much of its “New Energies” venture that look at hydrogen power, wind, biofuels and carbon capture and storage.
New Energies is part of the company’s “Integrated Gas” business – the same part of the company that explores for gas, extracts it, processes it and then gets it to customers. 
Shell doesn’t report separately the capital spending or revenue for “New Energies” but has said publicly it plans to invest between $1bn and $2bn a year on the division. 
What does that look like, in the context of capital spending across the rest of the company? In 2017, Shell made a $15.8bn profit and its annual report shows that they made capital investments of $23bn. 
Shell is in the process of divesting its interests to cut debt – a divestment the company says will be $5bn a year for the rest of the decade.
In Shell’s latest annual report, Holliday wrote that “oil and gas will remain central to our business for many years” and how more investment was needed to develop oil and gas reserves. 
In 2017 in Canada, Shell divested out of probably the most polluting of all fossil fuel enterprises – getting oil out of tar sands in Alberta.
But why did they do that? Was this a pique of conscience over the legacy those activities will leave on the environment and the climate? No. 
According to Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden, the divestment was “prioritising businesses where we have global scale and a competitive advantage such as Integrated Gas and deep water.”
Holliday says “the greatest contribution Shell can make to providing more and cleaner energy is to deliver more natural gas” and that, as communities “seek cleaner alternatives to coal” gas will be more important than ever. 
But as some analysts note, investing in new gas infrastructure risks locking in decades more of dependency on fossil fuels that is incompatible with the Paris goal to keep temperatures “well below 2C”.
Shell is currently lined up with other fossil fuel giants in a court case in the United States – accused by some Californian cities of being responsible for knowingly warming the climate and pushing up sea levels.
A recent trove of Shell documents unearthed by Dutch journalist Jelmer Mommers shows the company has been aware of the potential impact of the burning of its products since at least 1988. 
Looking at the documents, it looks like Shell’s interpretation of the science around climate change and impacts of its products has drifted – both internally and what the energy giant was prepared to say about it in public.
But back to #makeithappen and Shell’s other “challenge” – its need to keep young people on side. 
In advertising and marketing industry publication Campaign, Shell’s “head of integrated brand communications”, Malena Cutuli, spelled it out. 
“It’s no secret that Shell’s own macro challenge is particularly tough, so amidst deep cynicism and complexity, we needed to develop a disruptive approach to engage young people in our new energies mission,” she said. 
Featured in the pop videos and tumblr sites is an initiative to give people in developing countries more clean-burning cookstoves to avoid them dying from breathing in polluted indoor air. This is a huge issue and one that the World Health Organization says kills more than four million people a year.
What is Shell’s actual contribution to clean cookstoves in developing countries that gives them the licence to brag about it in slick advertisements?
According to the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves directory, Shell’s contribution to their work has been $12m in donations and time spent with the initiative. That’s not a small amount, but for a company the size of Shell it is about 0.07% of its 2017 profits.
Shell also took a food truck around New York and made young people jump on pads that converted their energy to electricity in return for, presumably, some food.
“What better way to get people engaged in the global energy challenge than by tapping into a universal passion – food,” said Cutuli.
Actually, I can think of another way. Several actually. 
One might be to avoid being the gullible millennial who takes directions on the future of energy from one of the world’s biggest fossil fuel companies. 
Another might be to “get engaged in the global energy challenge” by understanding that for all Shell’s earnestness about combatting climate change, its carbon footprint is bigger than most countries.

Speaking at the opening of a new national memorial and museum chronicling America’s history of lynching and racial violence in Montgomery, Alabama, Gore said that the US could expect to see many more major disasters of the ilk of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria last summer. 
The most vulnerable to the damage and suffering would be poor and older Americans, infants and children, and African Americans, who live in large numbers in urban areas where the heat island effect intensifies rising climactic temperatures.
Almost eight out of 10 African Americans live within 30 miles of a coal-burning plant, are three times more likely to die of airborne pollution than the overall population of the US, and black children suffer twice the levels of asthma with 10 times the level of asthmatic deaths, Gore said.
The former vice-president to Bill Clinton, who famously won the popular vote in the 2000 presidential election but was defeated by George Bush on the electoral college count, launched an attack Scott Pruitt, the beleaguered administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), for whittling down safeguards and regulations on air pollution. Pruitt is fighting to save his job having become engulfed in a raft of ethical controversies.
Gore said of Pruitt: “I don’t know why he’s still in office, though I kind of do know.”
He went on to accuse big business of leaning on Donald Trump to preserve Pruitt’s job. “The big grifters depend on the little grifter, and the big grifters have contacted the head grifter and said ‘Keep him in there’,” Gore said.
The climate change advocate was speaking at a two-day summit organized by the Equal Justice Initiative, a civil rights legal group in Montgomery. Under its director Bryan Stevenson, EJI has created a new museum and memorial that commemorates the victims of racial violence in the US and looks at the roots in slavery and segregation of the modern epidemic of mass incarceration.
Gore called on his audience to remain hopeful that something could still be done to combat climate change in the US and beyond. He pointed out that the first occasion in which the US could legally withdraw from the Paris agreement on climate change would be 4 November 2020 – a day after the 2020 US presidential election.
“If there is a new president, there is a 30-day notice period to rejoin the agreement,” he said.
Gore added that maybe it wouldn’t be that long before Trump left office. “We’re only a little over a year into this experiment and in science and medicine some experiments are terminated early for ethical reasons.”
In his assessment, Trump had proved to be less capable of inflicting damage on the environment than he had feared, Gore said. “In the rush to do what the big polluters wanted him to do as quickly as possible they have made a lot of mistakes and the courts are striking down some of their actions. We have a lot of resilience built into the American system. They are doing damage for sure, but I believe much of it can be overturned.”
Gore finished with an impassioned call for reforms to protect the US democratic system from the caustic influence of rich individuals and corporations. “Out democracy was hacked long before Vladimir Putin hacked it, by big money and big lobbying. In order to solve the climate crisis we’ve got to fix the democracy crisis.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/27/al-gore-climate-change-impact-black-poor-people-more

Donald Trump last year pulled the US out of the deal, which was signed by Barack Obama, making the US the only country opposed. Even Syria, torn by a seven-year civil war, has signed the pact.
Bloomberg, whose net worth is pegged by Forbes at about $50bn, was speaking on Earth Day, to CBS’s Face the Nation. He did not commit to provide funds beyond 2018 and said he hoped that by next year Trump would have changed his mind.
“America made a commitment and as an American, if the government’s not going to do it, we all have responsibility,” he said. “I’m able to do it. So, yes, I’m going to send them a cheque for the monies that America had promised to the organization as though they got it from the federal government.”
Trump, he said, should be able to “listen to others and change his mind. A person that doesn’t change their mind isn’t very smart. And he’s been known to change his mind.
“He should change his mind and say look there really is a problem here. America is part of the problem. America is a big part of the solution and we should go in and help the world stop a potential disaster.”
Asked if he thought the non-binding nature of the Paris deal was a problem, in terms of other countries not sticking to its aims for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the effect of climate change, Bloomberg said: “Look, it’s dangerous to keep doing what we’re doing.
“If everybody would do the right thing, yes, it would be better. But if some people or some countries do the right thing we all benefit from that.
“All I know is that America, I believe, will meet its commitment by 2025 to reduce greenhouse gases by an agreed amount, and if we do it hopefully other countries will do it as well.”
Asked if he was “filling a leadership gap”, the media baron – who was a Republican mayor and considered a 2016 presidential run as an independent – said: “Well, I think that this is what the American public when you poll them say they want to do.” 
The odds on him running for the White House in future, he said, were “not very high”.
The Trump administration has also rolled back Obama-era environmental regulations at home. Bloomberg said the man in charge of much of that roll-back, Scott Pruitt, Trump’s scandal-ridden Environmental Protection Agency chief, had “walked away 100%” from doing his job, which “is to protect the environment”.
Bloomberg said Pruitt, who has expressed doubt about accepted climate science, was “saying the environment doesn’t need protection” and saying instead he would “try to protect jobs”. 
“That’s not his job,” Bloomberg said. “His policies are not good for the world. That to debunk science and walk away from it is just ridiculous. Even if you don’t believe it. If there’s a possibility that it’s right, you have to take prophylactic actions to prevent a disaster.”
Firing Pruitt would be up to Trump, Bloomberg said, adding: “If he could get Scott Pruitt to change his policies, then he can keep him.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/22/michael-bloomberg-paris-climate-pact

Johnson has also failed to mention climate change in any official speech since he took the office, in marked contrast to his two predecessors.
The cutback in climate change diplomacy has come despite the prime minister, Theresa May, asserting that the UK leads the world on climate action. The UK has been praised for its past climate diplomacy, which helped pave the way to the landmark Paris agreement.
“It is extremely disappointing,” said Prof Sir David King, who was the foreign secretary’s special envoy for climate change from September 2013 until March 2017.
“Yes, we have the Paris agreement, but everybody knows the difference between what the agreement says – if possible no more than 1.5C rise – and what countries have promised is enormous,” he said. “There is a very big amount of work to be done. Other countries have had an enormous amount of respect for what Britain has delivered. If you then cut back the British effort then of course there is a real danger that the focus drifts away.”
Johnson gave an assurance that King’s work would continue under his replacement. But FoI documents show that the number of officials working full time on climate change fell from 72 to 55 between early 2016 and 2018, despite the issue being a “network-wide priority” across the UK’s diplomatic corps.
A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said climate change is one of the Foreign Secretary’s key priorities.
“Climate diplomacy could not be more important,” said Barry Gardiner, shadow minister for international climate change. “This is the year countries are supposed to ratchet up their Paris commitments, but so far the government has failed to step up and increase their aspirations. Sadly this government’s rhetoric versus reality is skewed.”
In January, May said: “We are supporting the world’s poorest as they face up to the effects of rising sea waters and the extreme weather events associated with climate change. We will continue to lead the world in delivering on our commitments to the planet.”
In April, climate change minister Claire Perry said: “The UK is leading the world in tackling climate change while growing our national income, ensuring we are best placed to help other countries reduce harmful carbon emissions.”
However, Johnson has yet to mention climate change in an official speech. His predecessors as foreign secretary made strong speeches on global warming, with Philip Hammond saying at a 2015 event in Washington DC: “Unchecked climate change, even under the most likely scenario, could have catastrophic consequences … Our history shows us that when the US and the UK take a lead, we can persuade the world to follow. And we must take that lead.”
In 2011, William Hague said: “Climate change is perhaps the 21st-century’s biggest foreign policy challenge. You cannot have food, water, or energy security without climate security.”
Johnson has given speeches about ending the illegal ivory trade that drives the poaching of elephants and has ordered a ban on avoidable single-use plastics from the Foreign Office’s UK operations by the end of 2018. 
In a newspaper column in 2015, the hottest December ever recorded, Johnson cited climate change sceptic Piers Corbyn as saying “the whole global warming theory is unsound, to say the least”. 
A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said: “The UK was instrumental in securing the Paris agreement on climate change. We are helping other countries to meet their targets and we are confident that we will be able to meet our own groundbreaking target of reducing emissions by 80% by 2050.”
She added: “We have repeatedly made our views clear to the US Administration.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/25/foreign-office-climate-staff-cut-by-25-under-boris-johnson

A study by researchers at the US Geological Survey (USGS), the Deltares Institute in the Netherlands and Hawaii University has found that many small islands in the Pacific and Indian Oceans will be uninhabitable for humans by the middle of this century. That is much earlier than previously thought.
Experts say the findings underline the looming climate change driven migration crisis that is predicted to see hundreds of millions of people forced from their homes in the coming years.
More than half a million people around the world live on atoll islands, often extraordinary and beautiful structures based on coral reefs. Their closeness to sea level makes them particularly vulnerable to climate change. 
The increase in urgency comes because, according to the authors of the report, previous studies had been based only on predicted sea-level rises. Today’s study also examined the impact of wave driven flooding on the availability of fresh water.
Saltwater flooding, leading to the contamination of water sources, will see most atolls become uninhabitable sometime between 2030 and 2060, said Curt Storlazzi, USGS geologist and lead author of the new report. “The tipping point when potable groundwater on the majority of atoll islands will be unavailable is projected to be reached no later than the middle of the 21st century.”
The primary source of freshwater for populated atoll islands is rain that soaks into the ground and remains there as a layer of fresh groundwater that floats on top of denser saltwater, according to the study. But as atoll islands are regularly swamped by salt water this freshwater will be contaminated making “human habitation difficult in most locations beginning between the 2030s to 2060s, requiring the relocation of island inhabitants or significant financial investments in new infrastructure.”
“The overwash events generally result in salty ocean water seeping into the ground and contaminating the freshwater aquifer. Rainfall later in the year is not enough to flush out the saltwater and refresh the island’s water supply before the next year’s storms arrive repeating the overwash event,” explained Stephen Gingerich, USGS hydrologist and co-author of the new report.
The authors say although the study was focussed on Roi-Namur Island on Kwajalein atoll in the Marshall Islands, the results will apply to people living in atolls around the world – including the Caroline Islands, Cook Islands, Gilbert Islands, Line Islands, Society Islands, Spratly Islands, Maldives, Seychelles, and north-western Hawaiian Islands.
But the fate of people living on atolls will be just one part of the much wider climate migration crisis, said Dina Ionesco, head of migration, environment and climate change at the International Organisation for Migration. “Millions of people are going to be at risk from extreme heat, extreme water shortages and flooding as well as sea level rises... we are talking about something that is going to play a huge role in the years ahead in terms of forcing people to leave their homes.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/25/climate-change-to-drive-migration-from-island-homes-sooner-than-thought

""The calculus of many policymakers, economists, fossil fuel companies, and indeed scientists, is that the most economical way to stay below 2°C is to delay most emissions reductions for decades to come, and then to play catch up by relying heavily on as-yet technically and economically unviable negative-emissions technologies""
BQEND
A recipe for disaster, surely? Logically the best way to handle emissions is to cut as fast and as quickly as feasibly possible at the level of a war effort[1], because this will buy us more time to sort out the difficult final 20% of emissions.
Consider a 'normal' household. Very roughly 1/3 emissions are on electricity; 1/3 on heating and 1/3 on cars. Maybe that's slightly out. So, by switching to renewable electricity and maybe being able to shift 50% of the heating to electricty and by switching to a fully electric car we can cut out: 1/3+1/6+1/3 of our domestic emissions = 5/6, just 17% to go.
The thing is, that's an easy 83%. Here I've ignored externalities (goods and services we buy use and sell that cost emissions); so maybe I should have split the figures into 25% externalities, and 25% each for all the rest. This leaves us with 3/8ths of our emissions remaining, or 38% to go. Still, pretty good for something that can be achieved by a high proportion of society.

So, by switching to renewable electricity and maybe being able to shift 50% of the heating to electricty and by switching to a fully electric car we can cut out: 1/3+1/6+1/3 of our domestic emissions = 5/6, just 17% to go.

We can't switch to renewable electricity because it's intermittent. We could perhaps reduce electricity emissions by another 60% or so (much more if we use nuclear).
Switching 50% of heating to electricity will be difficult for the existing housing stock. Electricity is much more expensive than gas, renewable electricity even more so. 
Fully electric cars would reduce emissions by about 50%.

one common culprit is responsible for the majority of both climate change and air pollution: fuel combustion.

Each year, 6.1 million lives are lost prematurely due to air pollution.
BQEND
NB : As ""JayThomas"" pointed out just ""below"" (I'm in ""Order by -> Newest"" mode), most native-English speakers would infer from this that the ONLY cause of those 6.1 million deaths was ""air pollution"". The formulation is misleading.
In the dim and distant past know as ""When I were a lad ..."", we were taught that ""air pollution"" consisted of ""NOx + SOx + Particulates"", with ""Ozone"" and the differentiation between PM10, PM5, PM2.5 and PM1.0 getting added some time later.Note that the particular case of ""carbon pollution"" came under ""Soot : a subset of the 'Particulates' bit"".
The link talks about the ""contribution to"" 6.1 million deaths from PM2.5 and ozone but there's nothing there about CO2 being a ""contributing"" factor ...
For particulates and SOx (at least), ""scrubber"" technology has been available, and continuously improved upon, since the 1960s and the first ""Clean Air Acts"" in America and Europe. This would have a dramatic impact on the number of (mainly Chinese and Indian) deaths reported on above if added to coal power stations, as well as reducing the size and intensity of the ""Asian Brown Cloud"".

Are you seriously suggesting that the ""dominant risk"" in the world moving away from fossil fuels is that we might suddenly end up 'not having' them. That is the only interpretation of your comment that makes any sense.
You and Yetypu are both guilty of this most ridiculous of strawman arguments - no-one is suggesting that we simply stop burning fossil fuels.
As a result, the sudden loss of fossil fuels cannot possibly be the dominant risk here, and all your mentioning of the iMechE, iChemE, the IET and others doesn't add any weight to the strawman at all.
The dominant risk from a rapid (but not sudden) move away from fossil fuels is that there is some kind of financial crisis caused by assets becoming stranded. That is something the BofE is already warning against, and the withdrawal of investment assets from the sector is a reflection of such risk avoidance.

Britain cannot rely on Europe to help keep the lights on during extremely cold weather, a report out on Monday warns, underlining the vulnerability of the country’s energy supplies to market volatility. 
During the cold snap at the start of March — dubbed the “Beast from the East” — domestic demand for power surged. Britain’s interconnector with France, however, exported power to the continent on two of the coldest days — February 28 and March 1 — new research shows.

National Grid has warned that the UK would not have enough gas to meet public demand on Thursday, as temperatures plummeted and imports were affected by outages.

At the 2015 U.N. climate summit in Paris, world leaders agreed to limit global warming below 2°C to avoid catastrophic impacts of human-caused climate change. The science consequently dictates that, for a 50% chance of staying below 2°C, around 1,000 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (or 300 billion tonnes of carbon) can be emitted between now and 2050, and close to zero thereafter. We’re currently emitting 36 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. However, the potential greenhouse gas emissions contained in known, extractable fossil fuel reserves are around three times higher than this carbon budget, meaning that 66% must be kept in the ground.
The debate du jour thus centers on which emissions reduction pathway is most optimal for staying below 2°C. The calculus of many policymakers, economists, fossil fuel companies, and indeed scientists, is that the most economical way to stay below 2°C is to delay most emissions reductions for decades to come, and then to play catch up by relying heavily on as-yet technically and economically unviable negative-emissions technologies. However, a crucial number has been neglected in this mainstream calculation: 6.1 million.
Each year, 6.1 million lives are lost prematurely due to air pollution. Though most acutely and visibly hampering megacities of the developing world, air pollution is a growing public health emergency that affects almost all of us in our daily lives, whether or not we are aware of it. The Health Effects Institute estimates that only 5% of the global population are lucky enough to live in areas with air pollution levels below safe guidelines. Though recent studies suggest there may in fact be no risk-free level of air pollution.
Why is this number relevant to climate policy? Because one common culprit is responsible for the majority of both climate change and air pollution: fuel combustion. Burning coal, oil, natural gas, and biomass – for everyday uses ranging from electricity, heating, cooking, to transportation – releases hundreds of gases and particles, some of which disrupt the climate system or are harmful to human health, or both. Climate change could also worsen air quality in the future.
Decades of research have revealed that air pollution is associated with a wide range of diseases and disorders, including asthma, cancer, heart disease, stroke, and premature birth. There is also emerging evidence that pollution from coal combustion and motor vehicles can cause development delays, reduced IQ, and autism in children. The societal and economic costs of air pollution are multifold. There are costs to the affected individuals, to their families and to society in terms of direct medical costs, costs to healthcare systems, productivity losses, and lower economic growth (not to mention costs resulting from damages to ecosystems).
Yet almost none of these costs stemming from our fossil fuel reliance are included in the majority of cost-benefit analyses of climate mitigation strategies. A recent study estimates that the health co-benefits from air pollution reductions would outweigh the mitigation costs of staying below 2°C by 140–250% globally. Historical evidence paints a similar picture. The EPA estimates that the U.S. Clean Air Amendments cost $65bn to implement, but will have yielded a benefit of almost $2tn by 2020 in avoided health costs.
Many public health expert groups have underscored the enormous opportunity for leaders worldwide to design policies and initiatives that will simultaneously tackle climate change and air pollution. Examples include replacing the most carbon-intensive and polluting sources such as coal and heavy-duty diesel with lower-emission or renewable alternatives, ending fossil fuel subsidies, redesigning urban spaces to make it easier and safer to commute by foot, bicycle, and public transportation, and transitioning to a more circular and sustainable economy. While the climatic mitigation effects of such measures are long-term and dispersed globally, the health benefits are immediate and local. 
For too long, the enormous toll of disease and deaths from fossil fuel pollution has been neglected in climate change policies and underappreciated by the public. But public health data makes it clear that not all 2°C scenarios are created equal. The lives and well-being of hundreds of millions of us – especially our children – could be at stake. We would be remiss to ignore it.

Some of the less obvious effects could be just as transformative, however, involving innovations such as smart houses and smart roads, widespread changes to the countryside wrought by new tree-planting and new farming practices designed to conserve soils.
There may need to be restrictions, too – in air travel, private transport, new building construction and our food and waste habits.
At the meeting this week of heads of government of the Commonwealth, government minister Claire Perry made the surprise announcement that she would ask the Committee on Climate Change, the government’s statutory advisers on climate change, to consider ways the UK could become “net zero-carbon” by 2050. That is widely regarded as being in line with the goals of the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change, which require governments to hold global warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, with an aspiration to hold warming to less than 1.5C, regarded as the limit of safety for small islands, which risk being swamped by rising sea levels.
Though her words were rather vague, the commitment was widely interpreted as laying the groundwork for a major change to the UK’s long-term climate policy. Currently, ministers are pledged to cutting emissions by 80% by 2050. To reduce them to net zero by the same date, with only three decades to go, is a big step up.
Dustin Benton, policy director at Green Alliance, a thinktank, said the government would have to bring forward new measures as a matter of urgency. “The government has made real progress on some issues, such as diesel cars and offshore wind, but there are glaring holes in areas such as energy efficiency and onshore renewables,” he said. “The UK can achieve net zero emissions, but to do so the government will need to fill these gaps and develop a new set of policies.”
Benton highlighted waste, housing and transport as key areas in which new policies could cut emissions fast, and said progress on these could give the government the confidence to continue with the policies needed.
Renewable energy is likely to be one of the chief beneficiaries. The industry has had a turbulent time in the last few years, with the removal or slashing of key subsidies and clear messages from ministers under the last government that onshore wind turbines were unwelcome.
However, thanks largely to the growth in renewables, the UK’s electricity network was able to run without coal for two days this week, a landmark achievement.
Emma Pinchbeck, executive director of trade body Renewable UK, said: “It is in the UK’s best interests for ministers to be ambitious on climate change action. The science shows we need to stay within 2C for the good of all nations, including the UK and Commonwealth countries. Meanwhile, rapid technology developments suggest that successful future economies will be those powered by low-carbon energy.”
Noting that wind power is now the cheapest new form of power in the UK, she presented a vision of the UK’s low-carbon future in which society broadly would benefit, because it would mean “renewable energy, better quality homes, cleaner and more efficient transport systems and smart technologies”. She said: “What’s best for the planet can also turn out to be best for the economy and for people.”
However bright the low-carbon future, hard choices will have to be made. Greenpeace’s executive director John Sauven spelled it out: no new runway at Heathrow. “The data show that the challenges posed by emissions from transport – land, sea and air – and our reliance on gas for heating will have to be confronted as a matter of urgency. The government must accept that no new runway at Heathrow will fit inside our carbon budget.”
Less comfortably for many environmental campaigners, the government is also likely to have to consider new nuclear reactors. The plans for the UK’s first new atomic power plant in a generation, at Hinkley Point, have already run into controversy. The price paid to France’s partly state-owned EDF has been decried as far too high, and construction has proceeded slowly. 
On energy efficiency, too, the government will need a new approach. The flagship “green deal” policy aimed at encouraging householders to take on loans to insulate their properties proved a failure, and nothing new has been proposed to take its place. Ministers have shown little sign of wishing to grapple with the problem. Another technology that might have helped towards zero-emissions targets, carbon capture and storage, was scrapped under George Osborne and would be costly to revive.
On a separate front, however, there have been important positive signals. As well as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the UK could meet its carbon targets by increasing the absorption of carbon dioxide. Plans to grow new forests have been enthusiastically endorsed by Michael Gove, the environment secretary. This could provide a “carbon sink” to reduce the UK’s contributions to global warming. Likewise, better management of the soil by farmers could increase its carbon storage capacity, and Gove has made clear he sees this as a priority. 
If all these developments are not enough, ministers may also seek refuge in an often overlooked part of climate change policy. Since the Kyoto protocol of 1997, systems of trading carbon have been mooted and approved as ways of generating investment flows from the rich to the poor world. The idea is that rich countries that find it costly to cut their emissions can instead offset them by funding emissions reduction projects, such as wind farms or solar panels, in poorer nations. This is controversial, as many green campaigners insist that emissions cuts must be made at home, but it may be an option ministers wish to keep open.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/20/what-steps-can-the-uk-take-to-reach-net-zero-emissions-by-2050

BQENDAR5 went to press in 2013. It can hardly account for papers written 3 years leater.
And there is a huge gulf between the fake experts and their total lack of any meaningful knowledge and the actual science. Here is the paper they quote

BQSTART
Antarctica has the potential to contribute more than a metre of sea-level rise by 2100 and more than 15 metres by 2500,
BQENDThis does nothing to contradict the IPCC.
And if one looks at figure 4 (page 595 in Nature volume 531) in the cited paper one can see the later figure quoted is only under RCP8.5 out too the year 2200.
Under RCP 4.5 sea level reaches 5m in 2500.

Consensus denies on both sides.
Obviously the Guardian commenters show their contempt for science by agreeing. 
If anyone thinks the IPCC is wrong they can produce a document that is better, one more able to stand the test of time. They cant, they wont, its classic conspiracy theory stuff. Insinuations, cherry picked data points and distortions. 
Not one person with the spine to stand up for the IPCC. 
Even the area highlighted, sea level rise. The IPCC has always been explicit its assessment is incomplete and has a caveat
BQSTART
Thermal expansion is projected to contribute more than half of the average rise, but land ice will lose mass increasingly rapidly as the century progresses. An important uncertainty relates to whether discharge of ice from the ice sheets will continue to increase as a consequence of accelerated ice flow, as has been observed in recent years. This would add to the amount of sea level rise, but quantitative projections of how much it would add cannot be made with confidence, owing to limited understanding of the relevant processes.

You seem to assume that reducing the CO2 intensity of their economy will harm their industries.

This is a very well put question. 
For example Pruitt now wanting to reduce the car-emission standard for US brands (domestically). This may look fantastic for car manufacturers - until they consider that they actually want to compete on the international marked with their product - aka exporting stuff. 
Who wants ""coal-powered"" cars from the US when the rest of the world has way stricter emission standards? And what will happen to US car-makers next time the oil-barrel price tag sniff at 100 USD? Last that this happened, the people in US choose to import cars with better mileage. The barrel of oil now is at ca 70 dollar.

From the Penn State climate scientist Michael Mann. ""We are seeing increases in extreme weather events that go well beyond what has been predicted or projected in the past. We're learning that there are factors we were not previously aware of that may be magnifying the impacts of human-caused climate change."" Among those are ""subtle mechanisms involving the behavior of the jet stream that may be involved in explaining the dramatic increase we've seen in floods, droughts, heat waves and wildfires,"" he said. 
""Increasingly, the science suggests that many of the impacts are occurring earlier and with greater amplitude than was predicted,"" Mann said, after considering new research since the milestone of the IPCC's Fifth Assessment, which served as the scientific basis for the Paris Agreement.
""We have literally, in the space of a year, doubled our assessment of the potential sea level rise we could see by the end of this century. That is simply remarkable. And it is sobering,"" he said.

So-called climate sceptics have only one plan - to confuse people.
They provide a selection of conflicting ideas, along these lines:
When considering global temperature rise, declining sea ice area, melting glaciers, or sea level rise .........
(a) it is not happening and
(b) it is a natural event and
(c) it is a good thing
All at the same time, or one at a time, as required.
Some say ""Temperatures havn't changed for ...... years."" (With various different numbers in the gap.)
Others say ""The Earth has been cooling for ..... years."" (As above)
Some say ""It's the Sun causing the warming."" (solar scientists don't agree).
Others say ""It's all a hoax"".
Or ""It's a religion"".
Others say ""There's an Ice Age coming"".
Or ""It's all caused by volcanoes.""
And so on and so on.
Some say there is no such thing as a greenhouse effect (there is), others say the rise in CO2 is natural (it isn't).
When one of them posts any one of the above ideas, strangely the others (who have posted different ideas just before) don't pile in and argue with them.
They only argue with people posting material based on scientific research.
It's a fringe view, based on no evidence.
They appear to be just another group of conspiracy theorists - but of course some are linked to various vested interests.

George W. Bush’s former EPA administrator Christine Todd Whitman delivered the scathing explanation:
If his actions continue in the same direction, during Pruitt’s term at the EPA the environment will be threatened instead of protected, and human health endangered instead of preserved, all with no long-term benefit to the economy.
As a perfect example of those actions, the Daily Caller recently reported that at a gathering at the fossil fuel-funded Heritage Institute, Pruitt announced that the EPA and federal government will soon end two important science-based practices in evaluating the costs and benefits of regulations.
When the EPA regulates pollutants, the practice often yields what are called “co-benefits.” For example, limiting allowable mercury pollution can force dirty coal power plants to install pollution-control equipment or shut down. Since coal plants produce other pollutants like soot, the regulations not only reduce mercury levels, but also particulate matter in the air. The latter isn’t an intended consequence of the regulations, but creating cleaner air and healthier Americans are unintended “co-benefits” of limiting another pollutant.
In doing cost-benefit analyses, the EPA accounts for all direct benefits and indirect co-benefits of its regulations. Certain industry groups and conservative pundits don’t like that approach, because they care more about polluter profits than they do about clean air and healthy Americans. However, during the George W. Bush administration in 2003, the Office of Management and Budget issued a guidance saying that it’s important to consider co-benefits:
Your analysis should look beyond the direct benefits and direct costs of your rulemaking and consider any important ancillary benefits and countervailing risks. An ancillary benefit is a favorable impact of the rule that is typically unrelated or secondary to the statutory purpose of the rulemaking (e.g., reduced refinery emissions due to more stringent fuel economy standards for light trucks)…
Pruitt wants to disregard this Bush-era guidance and instead consider only the costs and benefits of regulating the “targeted pollutant” (mercury, in our example). They want to ignore the lives saved by also incidentally reducing particulate matter pollution. To be blunt, this makes no sense, unless your goal is to protect polluters at the expense of public and environmental health.
As a backup argument, industry groups argue that the EPA overestimates these co-benefits because particulate matter (specifically, PM2.5) isn’t harmful to human health below a certain threshold value. Not coincidentally, Pruitt’s EPA hired a scientist who has argued that American air is “a little too clean for optimum health.” However, EPA looked at the associated science and issued a memo in 2012 concluding,
Studies demonstrate an association between premature mortality and fine particle pollution at the lowest levels measured in the relevant studies, levels that are significantly below the [National Ambient Air Quality Standards] for fine particles. These studies have not observed a level at which premature mortality effects do not occur. The best scientific evidence, confirmed by independent, Congressionally-mandated expert panels, is that there is no threshold level of fine particle pollution below which health risk reductions are not achieved by reduced exposure.
The bottom line is that when considering all effects, the benefits of EPA pollutant regulations often far outweigh their costs. However, the American public sees the benefits in the form of cleaner air and water, better health, and avoided premature deaths, while industries bear the costs of complying with the regulations by reducing their pollution. Hence industry groups and their allies in the Pruitt EPA are trying to cook the books to favor profits over public health. It’s worth reflecting on the disparity between the president’s claims that EPA’s goal is to achieve “record clean Air &amp; Water” and its apparent actual goal of maximizing polluter industry profits.
While Security spending was somewhat more than his predecessor, Scott Pruitt has received death threats because of his bold actions at EPA. Record clean Air &amp; Water while saving USA Billions of Dollars. Rent was about market rate, travel expenses OK. Scott is doing a great job!
At the Heritage Institute gathering, Pruitt also promised that the Trump administration will stop using the ‘social cost of carbon’ – an estimate of how much carbon pollution costs society via added climate damages – in crafting regulations. The Obama administration first started using the social cost of carbon in cost-benefit analyses of various government regulations. For example, when the Department of Energy considers stricter energy efficiency standards for appliances, it will account for the benefits of slowing climate change by reducing electricity consumption. Industry groups challenged that policy in court, but the Obama administration won.
Under Trump and Pruitt, the EPA has started engaging in bogus accounting to deflate the estimated social cost of carbon, and now Pruitt has promised they’ll stop using it altogether. It’s simply another way for the EPA to put industry profits above public health benefits.
Pruitt hasn’t yet made good on these promises to the polluting industries, but if he does, environmental groups are confident they can beat him in court. David Doniger, senior strategic director of the National Resource Defense Council’s climate &amp; clean energy program told me:
If Pruitt finalizes the Clean Power Plan repeal or any other rule by revising consideration of co-benefits in this way, or dropping them entirely, you can be 100% sure that we and others will sue, probably in D.C. Circuit challenges to his actions. We are confident the courts will hold this reversal of practice arbitrary and capricious. The only sound way to assess the benefits of a rule, and to weigh them against costs when that is allowed, is to assess all the benefits that can be reasonably expected to come from the action. 
It’s worth remembering that “The mission of EPA is to protect human health and the environment.” The mission of the Pruitt EPA seems to be maximizing polluting industry profits at the expense of human health and the environment. 
It’s also important not to let Pruitt’s rank corruption and scandals distract from the damage he’s doing to EPA’s mission. As Christine Todd Whitman noted, the whole world is worse for Trump having nominated and the Senate GOP having confirmed Scott Pruitt to lead the EPA into a new era of maximizing industry profits and pollution at the expense of public and environmental health.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/apr/23/pruitt-promised-polluters-epa-will-value-their-profits-over-american-lives

The centennial flame in Ottawa was first unveiled during celebrations marking the 100th anniversary of the Canadian confederation. Initially envisioned as a temporary installation, the flame remained so popular with visitors that it has continued to burn ever since.
But the federal government has announced that it is now exploring a number of options to reduce the environmental impact of the flame, one of which includes swapping the fire with LED lights. 
A spokesperson with Public Services and Procurement Canada, the government agency tasked with overseeing the project, confirmed it is “exploring options for alternative sustainable approaches to fuel the centennial flame”.
Federal government offices have come under pressure to reduce or eliminate carbon dioxide emissions resulting from daily operations as part of the government’s climate strategy.
The flame is fueled by natural gas ferried across the country from western Canada, a region of the country where environmental groups and indigenous activists are currently protesting against pipeline expansions and carbon emissions from tar sands.
In September 2017, the government attempted to decrease the emissions of the flame by striking a “net zero” deal with Bullfrog Power, which provides gas to the flame. The energy company offsets the emissions from the flame by pumping biogas – a cleaner alternative – into its existing pipeline infrastructure in order reducing emission in a separate location. Bullfrog Power declined to comment on the extent of emissions offset by the deal which currently costs the government US$15,000 a year
The proposed change would not be the first time the monument – a circular fountain with plaques commemorating the dates each province and territory became part of Canada – has undergone a significant makeover. 
Last year, the government spent $650,000 to add an additionally territory, Nunavut, to the monument. The flame has been extinguished on a number of occasions, often the result of poor weather. In 2002, the prime minister of the day, Jean Chrétien, ordered the flame extinguished and covered to avoid damage during the G8 protests in Ottawa.
But if the plan to scrap the flame proceeds, the move would largely be symbolic: Canada emitted 722 megatonnes of carbon dioxide in 2015, making it one of the highest per capita carbon emitting nations in the world, largely a result of its resource-intensive economy, size and climate.

There are no means of reversing the process which is melting the polar ice caps. And very few appear to be prepared to say so.”
Hillman, an 86-year-old social scientist and senior fellow emeritus of the Policy Studies Institute, does say so. His bleak forecast of the consequence of runaway climate change, he says without fanfare, is his “last will and testament”. His last intervention in public life. “I’m not going to write anymore because there’s nothing more that can be said,” he says when I first hear him speak to a stunned audience at the University of East Anglia late last year.
From Malthus to the Millennium Bug, apocalyptic thinking has a poor track record. But when it issues from Hillman, it may be worth paying attention. Over nearly 60 years, his research has used factual data to challenge policymakers’ conventional wisdom. In 1972, he criticised out-of-town shopping centres more than 20 years before the government changed planning rules to stop their spread. In 1980, he recommended halting the closure of branch line railways – only now are some closed lines reopening. In 1984, he proposed energy ratings for houses – finally adopted as government policy in 2007. And, more than 40 years ago, he presciently challenged society’s pursuit of economic growth.
When we meet at his converted coach house in London, his classic Dawes racer still parked hopefully in the hallway (a stroke and a triple heart bypass mean he is – currently – forbidden from cycling), Hillman is anxious we are not side-tracked by his best-known research, which challenged the supremacy of the car.
“With doom ahead, making a case for cycling as the primary mode of transport is almost irrelevant,” he says. “We’ve got to stop burning fossil fuels. So many aspects of life depend on fossil fuels, except for music and love and education and happiness. These things, which hardly use fossil fuels, are what we must focus on.”
While the focus of Hillman’s thinking for the last quarter-century has been on climate change, he is best known for his work on road safety. He spotted the damaging impact of the car on the freedoms and safety of those without one – most significantly, children – decades ago. Some of his policy prescriptions have become commonplace – such as 20mph speed limits – but we’ve failed to curb the car’s crushing of children’s liberty. In 1971, 80% of British seven- and eight-year-old children went to school on their own; today it’s virtually unthinkable that a seven-year-old would walk to school without an adult. As Hillman has pointed out, we’ve removed children from danger rather than removing danger from children – and filled roads with polluting cars on school runs. He calculated that escorting children took 900m adult hours in 1990, costing the economy £20bn each year. It will be even more expensive today.
Our society’s failure to comprehend the true cost of cars has informed Hillman’s view on the difficulty of combatting climate change. But he insists that I must not present his thinking on climate change as “an opinion”. The data is clear; the climate is warming exponentially. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that the world on its current course will warm by 3C by 2100. Recent revised climate modelling suggested a best estimate of 2.8C but scientists struggle to predict the full impact of the feedbacks from future events such as methane being released by the melting of the permafrost.
Hillman is amazed that our thinking rarely stretches beyond 2100. “This is what I find so extraordinary when scientists warn that the temperature could rise to 5C or 8C. What, and stop there? What legacies are we leaving for future generations? In the early 21st century, we did as good as nothing in response to climate change. Our children and grandchildren are going to be extraordinarily critical.”
Global emissions were static in 2016 but the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was confirmed as beyond 400 parts per million, the highest level for at least three million years (when sea levels were up to 20m higher than now). Concentrations can only drop if we emit no carbon dioxide whatsoever, says Hillman. “Even if the world went zero-carbon today that would not save us because we’ve gone past the point of no return.”
Although Hillman has not flown for more than 20 years as part of a personal commitment to reducing carbon emissions, he is now scornful of individual action which he describes as “as good as futile”. By the same logic, says Hillman, national action is also irrelevant “because Britain’s contribution is minute. Even if the government were to go to zero carbon it would make almost no difference.”
Instead, says Hillman, the world’s population must globally move to zero emissions across agriculture, air travel, shipping, heating homes – every aspect of our economy – and reduce our human population too. Can it be done without a collapse of civilisation? “I don’t think so,” says Hillman. “Can you see everyone in a democracy volunteering to give up flying? Can you see the majority of the population becoming vegan? Can you see the majority agreeing to restrict the size of their families?”
Hillman doubts that human ingenuity can find a fix and says there is no evidence that greenhouse gases can be safely buried. But if we adapt to a future with less – focusing on Hillman’s love and music – it might be good for us. “And who is ‘we’?” asks Hillman with a typically impish smile. “Wealthy people will be better able to adapt but the world’s population will head to regions of the planet such as northern Europe which will be temporarily spared the extreme effects of climate change. How are these regions going to respond? We see it now. Migrants will be prevented from arriving. We will let them drown.”
A small band of artists and writers, such as Paul Kingsnorth’s Dark Mountain project, have embraced the idea that “civilisation” will soon end in environmental catastrophe but only a few scientists – usually working beyond the patronage of funding bodies, and nearing the end of their own lives – have suggested as much. Is Hillman’s view a consequence of old age, and ill health? “I was saying these sorts of things 30 years ago when I was hale and hearty,” he says.
Hillman accuses all kinds of leaders – from religious leaders to scientists to politicians – of failing to honestly discuss what we must do to move to zero-carbon emissions. “I don’t think they can because society isn’t organised to enable them to do so. Political parties’ focus is on jobs and GDP, depending on the burning of fossil fuels.”
Without hope, goes the truism, we will give up. And yet optimism about the future is wishful thinking, says Hillman. He believes that accepting that our civilisation is doomed could make humanity rather like an individual who recognises he is terminally ill. Such people rarely go on a disastrous binge; instead, they do all they can to prolong their lives.
Can civilisation prolong its life until the end of this century? “It depends on what we are prepared to do.” He fears it will be a long time before we take proportionate action to stop climatic calamity. “Standing in the way is capitalism. Can you imagine the global airline industry being dismantled when hundreds of new runways are being built right now all over the world? It’s almost as if we’re deliberately attempting to defy nature. We’re doing the reverse of what we should be doing, with everybody’s silent acquiescence, and nobody’s batting an eyelid.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/26/were-doomed-mayer-hillman-on-the-climate-reality-no-one-else-will-dare-mention

As part of the Arctic Dispatches series, reporting from Alaska, Oliver Milman asked whether the catastrophic melting of Arctic ice could be reversed using an unlikely substance – sand.
It’s a compelling read that explores unusual ways technology and creative thinking could be employed to slow the effects of climate change.
Our only strategy at present seems to be to tell people to stop burning fossil fuels. It’s a good idea, but it is going to need a lot more than that to stop the Arctic’s sea ice from disappearing.

Last week it was announced that the British government would consider a ban on cotton buds, plastic drinking straws and other single-use plastics, following the success of the 5p plastic bag charge. But compared to the plastic bag ban introduced in Kenya last year – which threatens up to four years’ imprisonment and fines of up to $40,000 (£31,000) for anyone producing, selling or even carrying a plastic bag – Britain’s actions look like child’s play. Jonathan Watts has been in Nairobi and writes about the impact of the Kenyan ban eight months after it was introduced.
Winners of the Goldman environmental prize were announced this week, celebrating six remarkable success stories – five of them driven by women – of individuals or groups who have taken on powerful vested interests.
Among the winners were Makoma Lekalakala and Liz McDaid, who took on Jacob Zuma and Vladmir Putin in a legal challenge over nuclear power and won, and Claire Nouvian, a journalist turned activist who, inspired by the vampire squid, is fighting for less destructive fishing practices.
This article in the Christian Science Monitor about teenage girls in rural India who got sick of waiting for the adults to fix things and took over their town. Among their successes so far: getting a library and bus stop in their community.
One of the side effects of the introduction of the plastic bag is that it killed off centuries-old crafts all over the world. When I was growing up in Somaliland, every mother (or servant, for the rich) took these beautiful baskets made of wicker-like material to markets every morning. The baskets were reusable and handwoven exclusively by women who made a decent living from their craft.
And then one-time-use plastic came. The art of basket-weaving died off. I don’t think there is a single skilled basket-weaver left in Somaliland today.

What's more, the number of domestic cats is playing havoc with the song bird population.
BQEND
Yes I agree. Having a few cats around to keep the numbers of vermin like mice and rats under control isn’t a bad thing but in some urban areas with multiple households all with multiple cats there are just too many of them.
I ended up with a cat by accident when I rescued a stray kitten. He is an outdoor cat with a keen hunting instinct but thankfully his skills at catching birds don’t match his instincts. 
I’ve had one bird in 5 years. I’ve had a few mice and a couple of (live) slow worms which I saved. I’ve also had a live frog which screamed (which scared the cat, he hasn’t brought one in since). He mainly likes to fish in my neighbours pond. Doesn’t kill the poor fish, just brings them to me acting very pleased with himself and always with one wet front leg/paw where he scoops them out.

There is a chill in the air, quickly warmed by a buzzing atmosphere more like a music festival than an ethical food fair, as BBC Radio 1Xtra and House of Camden DJs play records, cocktails are poured and entrepreneurs sell zines and street wear alongside the vegan sushi, patisserie and “filthy vegan junk food”.
Davidson had been running weekend markets at the venue when she noticed a sharp increase in the number of vegan food businesses and vegan menus on offer. So last September, with her colleagues, she decided to put on a one-off vegan night market, with music, drinks and food. “On the day there were queues around the corner,” she says. “We were not prepared for it at all! There was so much interest that by Christmas we decided to make it a monthly thing. It’s all happened very quickly.” Inspired by its success, and the traders she was working with, Davidson switched from vegetarian to a vegan diet in January.
“We’re riding on that wave of veganism getting into the mainstream,” Davidson says. “People are curious about it and they’re finding out that vegan food is not just a boring salad, it’s experimental, and the food traders are amazing – people can have a drink, listen to music and hang out. First and foremost, we want to offer a positive platform, whether you’ve never had a fried jackfruit before or you’re a longstanding vegan.” Many of the traders are new to it as well, with a couple of them having launched their businesses at Vegan Nights. “It is a community and everyone supports each other’s businesses. It’s great to be a part of it.”

Veganism might have recently acquired a hipster cache at buzzy London events such as Vegan Nights and the weekly Hackney Downs market established by influential blogger Sean O’Callaghan, AKA “the Fat Gay Vegan”, but its surging popularity is a national phenomenon, with plant-based food festivals and businesses booming from Bristol to Inverness.
The high street is adapting with incredible speed. Big chains such as Marks &amp; Spencer and Pret a Manger have introduced vegan ranges, Wagamama has a new vegan menu, Pizza Hut recently joined Pizza Express and Zizzi in offering vegan pizzas, while last year Guinness went vegan and stopped using fish bladders in its brewing process, after two and a half centuries. Scrolling through Twitter’s popular #veganhour (an hour of online recipes and ideas running 7-8pm every Tuesday, and trending at number seven nationally when I looked), alongside less surprising corporate interventions from Holland &amp; Barrett and Heavenly Organics is a tweet from Toby Carvery, trumpeting its vegan cherry and chocolate torte. Sainsbury’s and Tesco have introduced extended new ranges of vegan products, while the latter recently appointed American chef Derek Sarno to the impressive job title of director of plant-based innovation.
If this is the year of mainstream veganism, as every trend forecaster and market analyst seems to agree, then there is not one single cause, but a perfect plant-based storm of factors. People cite one or more of three key motives for going vegan – animal welfare, environmental concerns and personal health – and it is being accompanied by an endless array of new business startups, cookbooks, YouTube channels, trendy events and polemical documentaries. The traditional food industry is desperately trying to catch up with the flourishing grassroots demand. “What do you mean, weak, limp and weedy? In 2017, the vegan category is robust, energetic, and flush with crowdfunding cash,” ran an article headlined “Vegan Nation” in industry bible the Grocer in November, pointing to new plant-based burger company Vurger, which hit its £150,000 investment target in little more than 24 hours.
The rapid explosion of the annual Veganuary campaign, in which curious omnivores and vegetarians sign up to try out veganism for a month and are then plied with recipes and other advice, shows how fast veganism is growing. (The choice of January is significant, given the resonances of fresh starts, good intentions and post-Christmas diets.) Veganuary was launched in 2014, with 3,300 people signing up; by 2016, there were 23,000 participants, then 59,500 in 2017, and a staggering 168,000 this year – and these are just the numbers that signed up officially online. Notably, 84% of this year’s registered participants were female, while 60% were aged under 35. Showbiz magazines and websites are full of lists of fully vegan celebrities – Ellie Goulding, Natalie Portman, Ariana Grande, Woody Harrelson, JME, Ellen DeGeneres, Liam Hemsworth; we could go on – all of them making Beyoncé and Jay-Z look a bit wet, having tried a vegan diet for just 22 days.
A weekend outing to Blackpool in 2018 offers much of what it always did: seagulls, slot machines, big-screen sport, family meal deals, “traditional fish and chips”, pirate rides, poncho vendors, palm-readers and pound shops. But there are other, newer diversions, too. On a grey Saturday morning in low season, at St Thomas’ church, north of the city centre, the Blackpool Vegan and Green festival is humming with people. Something of the church’s evangelical spirit is alive here, too.
“We’re in a non-vegan world,” says volunteer Elizabeth King, delivering her “10 steps to going vegan” talk in a back-room. “But things are changing rapidly – and if you’re trying to go vegan, you’re a pioneer.” She talks about shopping challenges and getting around social stigma, meal-planning and vitamin supplements, how to make holidays and dining out easier, how to check labels and online resources – and the group of new vegans and could-be-vegans asks keen questions and shares local tips. “People have an assumption you live off lettuce, don’t they? But that’s changing.”
With almond milk and vegan ranges now available in supermarkets, it’s a testament to soaring public curiosity that people are being drawn to once specialist events in such numbers. “It’s jam-packed isn’t it!” says Michelle Makita, with a laugh, from the Little Blue Hen vegan soap stall. Over the course of the day, hundreds of people stream in; visitors from across Blackpool, the north-west, even Spain. There is an African superfoods stand, a Glaswegian jerk pie company, Turkish gözleme flatbreads, cakes, curries, wraps, sushi, vegan candles, vegan pet food, shlocky T-shirts and accessories (“Zombies eat flesh, go vegan”). Darting around in a high-vis jacket, organiser Roddy Hanson squeezes past the prams, teenagers, bearded veterans in earth-tone baja tops, normies and newbies.
Grabbing some air and calm when the lunch rush has finally subsided (at about 4pm), Hanson is a mine of information about vegan history and culture and has seen a tightly bound, activism-driven outsider community become an accepted phenomenon in a matter of a few years. “When I went vegan in the 1980s, it was primarily two groups: hippies and punks. Some people who come to our events think it’s going to be wall-to-wall people with pink hair and piercings, but the whole culture has changed – it’s a very broad cross‑section.”
He has been vegan for 30 years, a veteran of animal rights activism, but this convivial, family-day-out approach to winning converts is more his speed. “I’ve never been the sort of person who wants to stand outside fur shops and get into arguments with people. It’s more positive this way and you can choose to engage with it if you want, rather than be confrontational. I’ve been involved in anti-circus demos where fights have broken out with some of the protesters and the circus staff; that kind of thing was a lot bigger in the 80s. Now it’s based around vegan groups and fairs, which didn’t really exist then.”
Last summer, Paul White opened Faringo’s, the first vegan restaurant in Blackpool. Only a year ago, he was an omnivore, running a hotel with an Italian steakhouse attached in which he was also head chef. One weekend, they had a vegan guest staying, which prompted “lots of lengthy conversations” about veganism and he decided to try running a small vegan menu alongside the existing one. “Within two weeks, we had more people eating vegan food than anything else,” he recalls. “What surprised us was people were coming from all over Blackpool. There were hidden vegans in Blackpool who were struggling in silence! That was June last year and at that point we decided to turn the restaurant 100% vegan and it just exploded on Facebook. I went vegan as well, as head chef, and I feel better for it. We have such a wide range of people coming in: we’ll have a table of six people who are protesters from an anti-fracking demonstration [Preston New Road fracking site is just three miles away], sat next to a table of two people who are multimillionaires, sat next to international rugby players.”
Whereas before, veganism may have been viewed like you were giving up something, now it’s been reframed as what you gain
There’s been a knock-on effect to their success, he says, with numerous other restaurants in the city beginning to offer vegan options on their menus – and White is preparing to open the first vegan food shop in Blackpool, too. One of the main drivers, he says, is the critical mass of information available online, both motivating people to change in the first place and making it easier than ever to do so. “When people see documentaries like Cowspiracy, one is enough. The fact social media is as big as it is now, it spreads things so much faster. I think that’s why it’s mushrooming right now. And it is mushrooming.”
In May 2016, the Vegan Society commissioned Ipsos Mori to poll 10,000 people on their dietary habits and found that Britain’s vegan population had increased from 150,000 to 542,000 in the space of a decade (alongside a vegetarian population of 1.14 million). Of those, 63% were female and, significantly for veganism’s future growth, almost half were in the 15-34 age category. What is astonishing is that the pace of change in the two years since the survey was carried out has been seemingly exponential – it seems plausible to speculate the number may have doubled again in that time.
Tim Barford, manager of Europe’s largest vegan events company, VegfestUK, has been vegan for three decades and points to the deeper roots of this recent explosion of interest. “There is a big plant-based shift culturally,” he says, “a systemic change in the way that we’re approaching food and the way that we feed ourselves. Remember that successive governments over 15 years have been ploughing money into persuading people to eat more fruit and vegetables, with the five-a-day campaign. Then you’ve got a real cultural change among millennials, which is very much built around justice and the way we look at animals.”
He also points to a new non-violent breed of millennial activist, such as James Aspey, who took a year’s vow of silence to raise awareness of animal rights issues. “Thirty years ago, it was more balaclavas and intimidation, almost verging on terrorist activities. This new breed are not playing up to that stereotype – they recognise the danger of it. There’s a real understanding and compassion among today’s activists. I’m a bit older and that wasn’t there in the radical 70s and 80s, with the punk rock, ‘fuck you’ kind of attitude – it’s now more reflective and therefore more effective.”
That less aggressive approach is winning a lot of new converts, but for veterans such as Barford it’s still an evangelical movement with an irreducible political message. “Our challenge with VegFest is to combine the feelgood factor, the fun and sociable atmosphere, with quite a strong moral and ethical standpoint. We want to attract people in without putting them off, but then once we’ve got them in, we don’t want them to walk away thinking this is just a health fad, just food and shopping and entertainment.”
He thinks the rise of Jeremy Corbyn – a vegetarian of almost 50 years, who has recently spoken about his admiration for his vegan friends – has helped fuel “a definite appetite for justice. Justice is no longer a dirty word, people can have a conversation about justice for the 70bn animals killed for food, without being shot down and screamed at as a radical extremist – and I think Corbyn has helped a bit, with the way he’s won over a bit of the middle ground.”
One influential factor that comes up regularly when talking to new vegan converts is a series of polemical online documentaries, or “advocacy films”, many of them on streaming services such as Netflix, documenting the damage animal agriculture does to the environment, or meat-eating does to human health, or exposing gory scenes in slaughterhouses and factory farms. In Blackpool, Michelle Makita tells me the 2005 film Earthlings, with its harrowing, hidden-camera footage of animal suffering, was the epiphany that led her to switch to veganism. “I think I cried for about three days – I was hysterical,” she says. The thriving sub-genre’s titles tell their story in microcosm: Vegucated, Planeat, Forks Over Knives, Live and Let Live, Peaceable Kingdom. A common trope among recent converts is that the revelations about the brutality of the meat, dairy and egg industries were hidden from view, until these documentaries exposed them.
The genre’s influential break-out hit was the 2014 documentary Cowspiracy, which looks at the environmental impact of animal agriculture, its contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation and excessive water use. It is a film about climate crisis in the first place, which argues that meat and dairy farming is the hidden evil responsible for a dying planet. Made by Californian documentary-makers Keegan Kuhn and Kip Andersen, amiable frontman Andersen tells the story of how Al Gore’s film An Inconvenient Truth changed his life as a young man (“It scared the emojis out of me”) and committed him to an environmentally conscious lifestyle. With Kuhn, he has now no doubt changed the lives of countless others by persuading them that turning off the taps, cycling everywhere and home composting is not enough: that worldwide conversion to veganism is the only possible way to save the planet.
Cowspiracy’s marketing strapline claims it is “the film environmental organisations don’t want you to see”. The alleged conspiracy of the title is that environmental groups such as Greenpeace, Sierra Club and the Rainforest Action Network are focusing all their efforts on fossil fuels and renewable energy, while ignoring the real threat from livestock farming. The evasiveness of their spokespeople on camera is often embarrassing, although perhaps the reason these NGOs wouldn’t want people building their politics around the film is its fast-and-loose use of highly questionable statistics. The original version of the film claimed 51% of global greenhouse gases were produced by animal agriculture, based on a single, non-peer-reviewed academic paper – the scientific consensus is closer to 15%. “Don’t use the 51% figure. Please. You’re making us all look bad,” vegan author Danny Chivers wrote in the New Internationalist. “If you want more people to understand that animal agriculture is a significant part of the climate change picture, bear in mind that there are lots of good reasons why many people are focusing on the fossil fuel industry and it’s not an either/or issue.”
For the version that premiered on Netflix in 2015, Andersen and Kuhn changed the figure and Leonardo DiCaprio came onboard as executive producer. Since then, they have made an equally hard-hitting follow-up, What the Health, which looked at the effect of meat and dairy on human diseases. While their films have been controversial (registered dietician and vegan Virginia Messina called What the Health “junk science”), their impact as polemicists is undeniable in a world where different strategies of evangelism are always being debated. Cowspiracy’s original crowdfunding pitch speaks volumes about its appeal: “Together, we aren’t just creating a movie, we are creating a movement.”
Of course, the vegan movement already existed, but Cowspiracy’s success reflects a new emphasis on animal agriculture, in particular cattle farming, in the context of the deepening climate crisis. Critical in this refocusing from animal welfare as the primary motive for veganism was a 2006 report produced by the UN, Livestock’s Long Shadow, which described the livestock sector as one of the most significant contributors to environmental degradation, both globally and locally. A follow-up UN report in 2010 warned that rising meat and dairy consumption, and a global population predicted to be 9.1 billion by 2050, meant a shift towards veganism was vital to save the world from climate catastrophe and food shortages. Overall, agriculture accounts for 70% of global freshwater consumption, 38% of total land use and 19% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions; within this, the footprint of meat and dairy production is heavily disproportionate.
Oxford academic Dr Marco Springmann has attempted to model what a vegan planet would look like, especially as climate change, food shortages and population growth intensify. He projected that were the world to adopt a vegan diet by 2050, the global economy would benefit to the tune of $1.1tn savings in healthcare costs and environmental savings of $0.5tn and a cut in greenhouse gas emissions by two-thirds. It’s quite hard to argue with numbers that speculative – especially when one is not a fellow of the Oxford Martin Programme on the Future Of Food – but what is certain is that the makers of Cowspiracy were right in their general argument, if not some of the key specifics.
“Our motivation was that animal agriculture was so under-discussed,” says Kuhn. “We really felt promoting a plant-based lifestyle had to be at the forefront of the environmental movement and environmental veganism had to be a movement in itself, versus animal rights or health.”
The speed of change they have witnessed since then has been exhilarating – even in just four years. “Information can pass so freely and easily now,” Anderson says. “It was only a matter of time before the truth about animal agriculture was revealed. It’s not in your face like racism or sexism – it’s deeply ingrained in our culture, and financially ingrained, but now that it’s revealed, people just don’t want to be a part of that horrific industry. It’s like a weight off their shoulders; getting clean of the lies and the destruction.
“People feel empowered, it doesn’t feel like a sacrifice. That’s a huge shift. Whereas before, veganism may have been viewed like you were giving up something, now it’s been reframed as what you gain: you gain health, you gain a greater sense of living in bounds with your values, you gain all the environmental benefits.”
One can become vegan in stages – there are no rules and you are only answerable to your own conscience
Kuhn says that consumer pressure from below will create a domino effect. “These corporations are just going to follow the dollar, and follow consumer demand, which hopefully will force them to switch to sustainable, plant-based agriculture.” The next step, he says, is to push governments to abandon tax breaks and subsidies to animal farmers. They are keeping the advocacy-via-documentary ball rolling. Currently in production are Seaspiracy, which focuses on the oceans and “the myth of sustainable fishing”, and Running for Good, a sports documentary following British marathon runner Fiona Oakes, “to break the stereotypes that veganism holds you back from any kind of athletics”.
Rapidly growing consumer awareness and changing eating habits have combined with a dawning realisation about the extent of the sustainability crisis to send shockwaves through the food production industries. With broad agreement that the future of animal agriculture has to change, the big money investors are moving quickly. Richard Branson announced last year that he was investing in a startup called Memphis Meats, which is developing lab-grown meat from animal cells as an alternative to animal agriculture, sometimes called “clean meat”. “In 30 years or so, I believe we will be shocked [that] we killed animals en masse for food,” he wrote. “Tyson Foods, one of the biggest meat businesses in the world, has recently invested, joining the likes of Bill Gates and Cargill, the second-largest beef producer in the world. It’s no surprise that the meat and dairy substitutes industry is predicted to be worth $40bn by 2020.”
The executive vice president at Tyson, Justin Whitmore, made a telling comment in explaining the company’s diversification in the face of a looming crisis of sustainability. “We don’t want to be disrupted,” he said in February. “We want to be part of the disruption.” While clean meat is not vegan, by definition, it is a parallel response to the same problem – and is accompanied by the soaring popularity of alternative vegan proteins such as tempeh, amaranth, seitan and nutritional yeast.
Even within the hard-headed world of big capital, there are serious manoeuvres afoot to push food production away from meat and dairy. In 2016, a group called Fairr (Farm Animal Investment Risk &amp; Return) co-ordinated a group of 40 large institutional investment funds, including Swedish state pension funds, worth $1.25tn (almost £900bn) publicly to urge major food producers and retailers such as Kraft Heinz, Nestlé, Unilever, Tesco and Walmart to develop alternative, plant-based sources.
“There’s growing investor support,” says Rosie Wardle, who worked on the project for Fairr. “Across the board now, market research firms, food analysts, industry commentators, they’re all talking about alternative proteins and flexitarian diets – they’re the key food trends for this year. The risks around intensive livestock production are becoming harder to ignore and people recognise that is going to impact business as usual.”
Fairr’s latest report, Plant-Based Profits, points to the rise of flexitarian diets among young adults who may not be full-time vegans. Fairr’s head of research, Aarti Ramachandran, sees the industry moving only in one direction. “Companies are investing in a lot of research and development because they know that today’s millennials are tomorrow’s consumers and they’re going to be setting the stage in terms of future growth prospects. That’s a key point that our investors are interested in: this is a market that’s not going to go away. Plant-based diets aren’t a trend or a fad; we see this very much being the basis of consumer growth.”
The business world seems to agree. In the last few months, you can scarcely move on Forbes.com for articles with headlines such as “Here’s Why You Should Turn Your Business Vegan In 2018”. With this kind of money swirling around, and a combination of hipster entrepreneurs, hedge funds and major supermarket chains defining veganism in 2018, it’s easy to see why some vegans feel that the movement’s traditional association with anti-capitalism is a position rapidly disappearing in a fog of marketing hype. Popular, youth-orientated vegan cookery startups such as Bosh.TV, which scored 1m followers on Facebook within a year of launching, as well as a Bosh! book deal, define the new spirit of veganism as a lifestyle, rather than the cornerstone of a political worldview. “Just three years ago, we weren’t even vegan ourselves,” wrote cheerful founders Henry Firth and Ian Theasby, recalling late-night kebabs on the way home from the pub. “Back then, the ‘V’ word had a touch of anger associated with it; it was loaded with political and ethical connotations.”
The promotion of a flexitarian approach of reducing the use of animal products, without cutting them out altogether, has raised hackles among some activists. In 2014, the Vegan Society rebranded with a “love vegan” campaign to mark its 70th anniversary, which proposed “a few small changes” if full veganism seemed a step too far. This prompted a backlash among some animal rights activists and claims that the organisation was more interested in being a marketing body for vegan businesses than an ethically driven campaign group. “Is veganism no more than a capitalist lifestyle choice?” ran a rhetorical question on the Red Black Green blog. “Veganism was for a long time associated with the counter-culture and seen as difficult,” wrote Vegan Society CEO, Jasmijn de Boo, in 2013. She spoke of softening the movement’s image: “One can become vegan in stages – there are no rules and you are only answerable to your own conscience.”
Veganism’s mainstream rise has certainly benefited from this conscious rebranding: for better or worse, it is much cooler than it used to be. “It’s a lifestyle, a community, a culture, an ever-expanding club where the only price of entry is being mindful and making a positive change,” goes the motto of the Young Vegans pie and mash shop in north London. Social media has spread the word with incredible speed, via Twitter hashtags, thriving “wellness” and cookery YouTube vloggers and Instagram influencers. It’s not just the obvious clean-eating celebrities and channels that have taken up the subject: even Unilad, a site not exactly known as a bastion of compassion and political sensitivity, commissioned a powerful 20-minute documentary, Meat the End, about “the horror and abuse” of animal agriculture.
With a seemingly growing number of young people trying out vegan diets for personal health reasons (39% of the generally young, generally female Veganuary participants cited this as their motive), and its association with often controversial social media influencers, concerns have been raised that veganism provides a socially acceptable cover for disordered eating. “Are you depriving yourself or finding plant-based alternatives? This is where a lot of my problems lay,” wrote Lila Flint Roberts in an open letter on the Not Plant-Based blog. “I was just another individual who turned veganism into an eating disorder.”
British Dietetic Association spokeswoman and registered dietician Linia Patel is more than familiar with the problem. “We do see this. It’s very easy for people who have problems with disordered eating to take on veganism as a mask for something deeper that’s going on, because it’s cutting out huge food groups and for them it’s a way to control their diet that’s socially acceptable.
“At the moment, it’s so faddy, and there are Instagram influencers who are becoming vegan, and maybe it works for them, in their specific scenarios. The key point is always individualisation and research – to know why you’re doing it and how to do it properly, rather than just jumping on a trend. People can run the risk of being deficient in b12, even protein and iron.” She is keen to point out though that, done correctly, going vegan can be very good for health.
With a potential post-Brexit trade deal with the US threatening to flood the British market with farming practices currently prohibited in the UK by EU regulations – chlorinated chicken, beef with growth hormones and bacon with banned additives – the appeal of a plant-based diet could get another substantial spike in the near future. With or without such a trigger, a major shift in the way British people think about the food they eat and how it is produced is underway – driven by an increasingly networked, savvy millennial generation who realise that the certainties of the world they are growing up in are deteriorating fast. Veganism is no longer niche or difficult and, as industrial agriculture bends to adapt to consumer demand and its own crisis of sustainability, it is only going to get more accessible – and more popular.
Kishani Widyaratna, 32: ‘‘My veganism fits in with the rest of my politics, which are very left-leaning’Works in publishing and runs the Tinie Tempeh vegan Instagram account
I’ve been vegan 10 years. In 2008, Jamie Oliver made a TV show, Jamie’s Fowl Dinners, going behind the scenes of egg and chicken farming, and he showed male chicks that are useless for the egg industry being suffocated in a Perspex, oxygen-deprived box, live on television. It sounds like Black Mirror but it happened. I’d been vegetarian since I was 13 and seeing that pushed me to look into how dairy and eggs are farmed on an industrial scale; it went from there. It’s an extension of the basis of my vegetarianism: I didn’t want to kill anything to live.
I’ve always loved food and cooked from a broad range of cuisines. My heritage is Sri Lankan and food and eating are important elements of that. Starting my Tinie Tempeh Instagram, I wanted to do something that would encourage me to cook, but also I wanted to create something fun and positive. So hopefully you can look at my feed and see the variety in what I eat as an enthusiastic home cook with a big appetite. I wanted to help show how easy it has become [to be vegan]. The transparency of social media means it’s not so much of a leap of imagination for people any more.
A significant part of vegan Instagram has these unhealthy trappings of being super body-conscious and clean eating-focused: there are a lot of thin, lean, white bodies and, frustratingly, you don’t have as high a visibility for the vegans who are people of colour or queer or fat or eating whatever they want. But things are slowly changing, with the vegan junk food movement for example and I’m glad to add to the visible women of colour in that space.
I’m also inspired by people such as Ruby Tandoh and Bethany Rutter and their desire to liberate our personal relationships to food and the body, so I wanted to showcase vegan food that was about enjoyment without shame. I’ve also made a group of vegan friends through Instagram and I’ve learned so much about places to eat, things that I can cook; it’s educational, too.
My veganism fits in with the rest of my politics, which are very left-leaning, informed by an intersectional feminist approach and also I’m a person of colour moving through the world. So while I am passionate about animal welfare and the environment, there are other struggles that are equally important to me and each feeds into the other.
Jamie Kidd, 35: ‘Glasgow is a great place to be vegan. There’s a real community’Founder, Cool Jerk Vegan Pies, Glasgow
I run a vegan scotch pie business. I always had a passion for food and being from Dundee, which is pie country in Scotland, I felt inspired and thought no one else was doing it. I started two and a half years ago and the response was great; we couldn’t keep up with demand to begin with. The biggest seller here is the “macaro-nae cheese pie” – because macaroni pies are a bit of a Scottish delicacy. I travel all around Scotland and north England, sometimes as far as Brighton and London to do vegan festivals. The haggis and mash always seems to do really well when I go down to England, maybe because haggis is seen as slightly exotic. I’m really into Glasgow’s music scene and I’m lucky that I’ve got to sell pies to some of my musical heroes, such as Stuart Braithwaite from Mogwai, a couple of guys from Belle and Sebastian; Field Music seem to be particular fans.
I’ve been vegan for five years and I was vegetarian for five years before that. I didn’t really see the difference between being vegetarian and being a meat-eater, because you’re still contributing towards animal suffering. I found it relatively easy to switch because I live in Glasgow, which is a great place to be vegan. There are a couple of long-term established vegan restaurants here and in the last few years at least half-a-dozen new vegan places have opened – I think in total we’ve got about 12 now. A new one just opened last week.
The venues have been really supportive of vegan market stalls and startups such as mine. There’s a bar-restaurant venue called the Flying Duck that has a monthly vegan market and it’s free for the stallholders, which is great. There’s a real sense of community – we all help each other out and share ideas. We don’t see each other as being rival businesses; the ultimate aim is to grow the vegan movement.
Samantha Reidy, 27: ‘I pretty much went vegan overnight after binge-watching Netflix documentaries’Artist, Cleveleys, Lancashire
I’ve been vegan for two years. Prior to that I wasn’t even vegetarian but I spent one weekend binge-watching all the documentaries on Netflix – Cowspiracy, Forks Over Knives and Earthlings – and I pretty much went vegan overnight. I was really shocked by them and I thought: I can’t eat meat any more, I can’t eat dairy any more.
I found the transition really easy. There are a lot of foods that are accidentally vegan and there are so many alternatives now it doesn’t have to be expensive. Even in quite a small town we have a massive “Free From” section in the supermarkets.
I watched a lot of vegan vloggers as well. I think YouTube’s becoming bigger than TV and a lot of people my age watch that instead. It seems more genuine because it’s not edited by corporations; it’s done by somebody in their bedroom with a camera and you can relate to that person better.
I joined the Vegan Society as soon as I went vegan. I really like their magazine and they have loads of information. Then they asked me if I would like to be a representative for them. As an artist, I make some vegan stickers and badges – it seems like a good way to express your beliefs. I also own a lot of vegan tote bags and I always use them when I go shopping; it’s a bit of subtle campaigning. Veganism is a community and it’s growing. Hopefully one day it won’t be a community, it will be everyone.
Dan Strettle, 66: ‘There is a domino effect within families – parents are listening to their children’Owner, Alternative Stores, Newcastle upon Tyne
I was in sixth-form at school, and I was anti-vivisection, and this lad in my class says: “If you don’t believe in experimenting on live animals, why do you eat them?” So I thought about it, woke up the next morning and said: “I’m going vegetarian.” But my concept of vegetarian was veganism; I didn’t realise there was a halfway stage. I was fully vegan by 1969 – next February it will be 50 years. I’ve never felt better.
When I changed, they said: “Oh, it’s a fad, give him six weeks, we don’t even know any vegetarians, let alone vegans – he’s one of these hippies, I mean look at his hair.” For school lunches I took in something called Nutmeat. It comes in a tin – it’s nuts and flour, combined to make what looks like luncheon meat, and you slide it out of the tin, cut it into slices. You had to go to a health food shop and there was one called Milburns in Newcastle; we used to go there every week.
There’s a bunch of vegan places in Newcastle now; we’re catching up with Berlin – that’s the leader. Vegans have never had it so easy! I run a vegan shop. We have a little bit of opposition from the supermarkets now, but we’re all right because people go in the supermarkets, see there’s one flavour of vegan cheese and then they come to my shop and see there’s 12 flavours. We don’t mind the supermarkets – they’re like a gateway drug: we’ve got the variety that the vegans and vegetarians want. They come to us for perfume, soap powder, toothpaste, all the groceries and the whole foods. Our bestseller is probably Sosmix. We sold 4 tonnes this year – that’s the same stuff I was eating in the 1970s!
We must be getting half-a-dozen new people a week coming in and saying: “Someone in my family has gone vegan and I don’t know what to feed them; can you help?” Or: “My son went vegan three months ago and we’ve all joined him now.” There is a domino effect within families and parents are listening to their children. There was a lad who came in who was 10 – he had made his own decision to be vegan; he was so determined, and his parents were so supportive. It’s great to see.

Spring is held in a sort of suspense. The sun’s growing confidence brings hope, but the blizzards are back again, shutting out the light, clogging the floor of Strid Wood with snow, smothering the first leaves of dog’s mercury and ramsons. Around this date in previous years I have heard drumming snipe on the moors or found breeding frogs in the ponds around here, but there will be few such mood-lifting discoveries today.
Spring cold snaps are not unusual, but this one results from this winter’s dramatic destabilisation of the polar vortex, the wall of wind that encircles the Arctic. As we have been strafed by snow, the temperature in parts of the sunless polar region has been as much as 35C above average, prompting fresh consternation among climate change experts. 
Yet the effect on the ground here is not without its charm; in the Valley of Desolation, snow has draped itself over the tangled boughs of oak and dusted the brackets of a mazegill fungus so they look a bit like iced buns. It is a dissonant overlay of realities; the snow revives innocence, but the jarring background note is impossible to ignore. 
This secretive nick in the side of Wharfedale is misleadingly titled; it has a pair of exquisite, exuberant waterfalls and some lovely pockets of broadleaved woodland. But it can attest to the profound mutability of weather and climate. In recent times, it has been the site for an interesting reflection on Wharfedale’s past: the plantations leading up the valley, designed by the Bolton Abbey estate’s head forester, Roy Lingard, emulate the regeneration of the area after the last ice age, from post-glacial tundra to temperate woodland. And its Tolkien-esque name comes from an 1826 storm that was powerful enough to flatten many of its trees, leaving behind scenes of such destruction that the bleak moniker stuck. 
All of which is a reminder that climate needs no help to change, or to wreak havoc, but we are giving it a shove; what this place may look like even in another 100 years is anyone’s guess.

""2.2. Climate change and the conceptual penisNowhere are the consequences of hypermasculine machismo braggadocio isomorphic identification with the conceptual penis more problematic than concerning the issue of climate change. Climate change is driven by nothing more than it is by certain damaging themes in hypermasculinity that can be best understood via the dominant rapacious approach to climate ecology identifiable with the conceptual penis. Our planet is rapidly approaching the much-warned-about 2°C climate change threshold,and due to patriarchal power dynamics that maintain present capitalist structures, especially with regard to the fossil fuel industry, the connection between hypermasculine dominance of scientific, political, and economic discourses and the irreparable damage to our ecosystem is made clear.Destructive, unsustainable hegemonically male approaches to pressing environmental policy and action are the predictable results of a raping of nature by a male-dominated mindset. This mindset is best captured by recognizing the role of the conceptual penis holds over masculine psychology.When it is applied to our natural environment, especially virgin environments that can be cheaply despoiled for their material resources and left dilapidated and diminished when our patriarchal approaches to economic gain have stolen their inherent worth, the extrapolation of the rape culture inherent in the conceptual penis becomes clear. At best, climate change is genuinely an example ofhyper-patriarchal society metaphorically manspreading into the global ecosystem.The deep reason for this problematic trend is explained, in its essence, by McElwaine (1999), where he writes, “Pickett suggests that we have to choose between capitalist rationalism and cultural subcapitalist theory” (Pickett, 1993). Contemporary capitalist theory, a.k.a. neocapitalist theory, derivesits claim on rationalism directly from the hypermasculine focus in science and society that can best be accounted for by identification with the conceptual penis. Paxton and Scameron (2006) seem to agree, noting that, “neocapitalist materialist theory holds that reality comes from the collective unconscious, but only if the premise of dialectic objectivism is invalid; if that is not the case, sexualityhas significance.” Toxic hypermasculinity derives its significance directly from the conceptual penis and applies itself to supporting neocapitalist materialism, which is a fundamental driver of climate change, especially in the rampant use of carbon-emitting fossil fuel technologies and careless domination of virgin natural environments. We need not delve deeply into criticisms of dialectic objectivism,or their relationships with masculine tropes like the conceptual penis to make effective criticism of (exclusionary) dialectic objectivism. All perspectives matter.One practical recommendation that follows from this analysis is that climate change research would be better served by a change in how we engage in the discourses of politics and science, avoiding the hypermasculine penis-centric take whenever possible (Kaijser & Kronsell, 2013).""

Thanks for your observation of climate, some regions are feeling the effects more than others right now, and we're only in the beginning of the changes coming due to the momentum in Earth's energy system and climate.
This graph of the last 400,000 years of global temperature, CO2 and sea level derived from ice cores doesn’t look like it was created randomly, but rather by a clock mechanism.
Fifty years before we knew how to create such a graph the work by a scientist named Milankovitch indicated that when we got our act together we would see Earth’s orbital cycles, which operate on time scales of tens to hundreds of thousands of years, in the record.
Notice how they track roughly together and also how far current CO2 has blown off the graph, to a place not seen for millions of years, long before modern humans existed.
It takes time for temperature and sea level to equilibrate with our current forcing of increased atmospheric CO2 and we could blow much further off that graph.', u'recommendation_count': u'3', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1522792653000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u""the momentum in earth 's energy system and climate"", u'effect': u'coming'}], u'author_id': u'15131989', u'in_reply_to': u'114296333', u'id': u'114324571', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'nhoj', u'text': u'“Energy subsidies are projected at US$5.3 trillion in 2015, or 6.5 percent of global GDP, according to a recent IMF study.

The glaciologist Richard Alley mentioned in a presentation (linked to below) that for the decade before Hurricane Katrina, nearly every geoscientist he knew teaching an Introduction to Geology course taught it was coming.
The course material was largely drawn from material prepared by the government, for the government, with government funding and everyone who was paying attention knew for decades that New Orleans is sinking, the protective delta is eroding, sea level is rising and maximum storm strength may be increasing.
All of these things affect optimal levee design.
So surely our economically efficient society appropriated the funds to raise the levees that protect New Orleans.

In other words, using this earlier baseline results in an additional 0.28°C rise. When using an even earlier baseline, i.e. 1750 or preindustrial, it could be 1.53°C warmer, as discussed in an earlier post. In other words, merely changing the baseline to preindustrial, as agreed to at the Paris Agreement, can show that we're already above the 1.5°C guardrail that the Paris Agreement had pledged we should not cross.There's more! As a recent publication points out, most methods that calculate the global temperature use sea surface temperatures. However, doesn't it make more sense to calculate the temperature of the air just above the sea surface? Measuring air temperature at the surface is done in the case of temperatures over land, where one doesn't measure the temperature of the soil or rocks when telling people how warm it is. Since air surface temperatures are slightly higher than sea surface temperatures, the result of looking at air surface temperatures across the globe would be a temperature that is approximately 0.1°C warmer. Furthermore, many areas in the Arctic may not have been adequately reflected in the global temperature, e.g. because insufficient data were available. Since the Arctic has been warming much faster than the rest of the world, inclusion of those areas would add another 0.1°C to the rise. Adding this to the above 1.53°C rise makes that it's already 1.73°C (or 3.11°F) warmer than preindustrial.""

A sophisticated society (where the individual is forever living within the hierarchical-hegemony) is the one that intimates the desires of the populace, while also administering to the needs of the economy and its more focused range of financial understanding, as we know. 
Having a functional economy and a limit to family-size within economic constraints may be unreasonable, within a universal basic income frame. I would hate to see it go wrong. However, I think the current system is not functioning on many levels; despite this being most probably due to a crisis of fate given the leadership role assumed by the west over recent years.
Universal Basic Income ties us closer (in a slightly ideosyncratic way) to various brands of communism we may be able to substitute with decent software at some later date. As I say, qualifications and comprehension tests may be required and I am not an enemy of beaurocracy and administration although I can understand the frustrations perhaps of those who are.

Behaving as if it is degrades democratic process and our personal political sovereignty. 
A zero-sum game is a contest for control of finite resources. Whatever one gains, another must lose. When two or more candidates compete for a single public office, only one can win, so many people view politics as bloodsport, applying “winner takes all” thinking to everything political. But elected officials are not conquerors; they are sworn servants to all their constituents. 
The beating heart of a free society is the guarantee of personal political sovereignty, safeguarded by transparent institutions, checks and balances, and a free press.
Political sovereignty is informational sovereignty. Disinformation disempowers. Distortion of our informational environment has slowed humanity’s overall effort to eliminate corruption and transcend harmful practices, like those that destabilize Earth’s climate. 
What corrosive hyper-partisanship misses is that human intelligence, creative collaboration, and adherence to basic principles of fairness, make more good possible and so result in real value added — throughout the system, for the benefit of everyone. 
Success requires dealing ably with complexity. 
Neurons in the human brain organize themselves into vast 7-dimensional sandcastle structures — flashes of consciousness that emerge and disappear in millionths of a second. Brains are organic synaptic networks. More connections mean more possibilities – more “going on.” Bigger, more complex constellations of neural-attentive cohesion are effectively a bigger landscape for thoughtful attention, recall and imagination — an expanded, diversified space for figuring out what needs figuring.
Zero-sum thinking strips intelligence from our politics. Generative thinking recognizes that complex constructive interactions make us smarter, more capable, freer, and more secure. 
At the human scale, we naturally demand trustworthy generative value-building be an organic part of our experience. If we are informationally sovereign, we can scale up smart decision-making to correct hidden market failures and expand routine access to increased value for everyone.
To distort and disrupt climate and energy decision-making, carbon polluters spent hundreds of millions of dollars over several decades. Their aim was to degrade the sovereignty of voters, consumers, rivals in the innovation space, the free press, and even nation states.
Such corrosive behaviors have undermined the competitiveness of polluting industries, making outdated methods appear longer lived than they stand a real chance of being, even as they build up unprecedented, nonlinear carbon liability. Market forces will eventually stop rewarding ever more costly carbon-intensive practices that put irreplaceable natural life-supports at risk. 
• In 2017, the United States spent as much in disaster relief — for floods, wildfires, drought, and storms — as the total comparable spending from 1980 to 2010.
• We now have scalable clean power-generating technologies, cost-effective industrial-scale and in-home battery storage, and rapidly expanding clean finance. 
• In many places, wind and solar are now cheaper than coal, and distributed energy production systems are supported by decentralized information networks. 
• Entrepreneurs are learning to empower communities to share surplus clean energy amongst themselves, overruling the market dominance of fuel-burning power plants. 
The practice of depending on society (and natural systems) to absorb unaffordable costs of doing business generates massive structural debt — investment risk and secondary liability built into the structure of the economy. Soon, markets may have access to high-precision calculations of such costs, in near real time. There is no reason for such risky business models, or corrupt institutions, to continue to undermine humanity’s ability to solve big problems. 
• We are now witnessing the rise of high-efficiency climate-smart finance to drive new investment and innovation in many sectors. 
• The mainstreaming of green bonds and application of smart carbon pricing policies will make the whole economy more efficient at building value for people, institutions, and enterprise. 
• High-resolution Earth systems science and new data technologies will soon allow us to acquire actionable resilience intelligence at both the planetary and human scales.
The work of making a better, freer, more livable world is in our hands. We owe it to each other, and to those who will come after us, to go beyond zero-sum thinking, out-maneuver corrosive political actors, and build new value wherever human ingenuity allows.

The difference is that there is an implicit assumption that current conditions will continue.They won't.
We are all aware of Liebig's law that will result in a maximum output from agriculture being reached under optimal conditions.
And these optimal conditions are going to be compromised by AGW and resulting climate change.
Therefore, the claim is debunked.
Unless you'd like to bring forward some Evidence()TM) that Liebig's law is false, and or future conditions for agriculture will be more beneficial globally, and debunk the paper in the ATL article.

Yet another debunked denier meme.
Food production may still be growing currently, due to increased mechanisation, use of pesticides and increased farm acreage.
However those are all finite inputs to the equation, and a shifting of climate will not be offset by them.
In addition, as has also been pointed out, the nutrient quality of many key crops declines as CO2 increases, so the increased output will not equate to increased nutrient value for consumers.

According to the elliptical variations in the Earth’s orbit (a set of cycles with overall cycle times of hundreds of thousands of years) the Earth should be in a slow cooling pattern. According to the other two Milankovitch Cycles (Axial Tilt and Precession, with cycle times of 41,000 and 22,000 years) the Earth should also be slowly cooling because we were heading into the next glaciation, and until about a hundred years ago this was the prevailing pattern.
For the six thousand years leading up to the Industrial Revolution the pattern was slow cooling at an average rate of about 0.2 degrees C per millennium. There were ups and downs due to changes in ocean currents and solar output, but at most those changes were around 0.1 degree C per century and after five or six hundred years the average global temps returned to the cooling trend.
In the last hundred years we have seen global temperatures climb just over a full degree C with the majority of that increase in the last forty years. Solar out put has actually been declining slightly during those last forty years.

The scepticism that I advocate amounts only to this: (1) that when the experts are agreed, the opposite opinion cannot be held to be certain; (2) that when they are not agreed, no opinion can be regarded as certain by a non-expert; and (3) that when they all hold that no sufficient grounds for a positive opinion exist, the ordinary man would do well to suspend his judgment.
BQEND
For surface temperatures, 1. applies, the experts are unanimous.
For tropospheric temperature though it's 2. the experts are not agreed.
If you compare the trends, they are all similar except UAH which is an outlier.
This does not justify rejecting UAH, and it certainly does not justify rejecting the rest in its favour.

Readers of this column have certainly heard about temperature targets such as 1.5°C or 2°C. These targets refer to allowable temperature increases over pre-industrial temperatures. If humans take action to hit a 1.5°C target, it means we are committed to keeping the human-caused global temperature rise to 1.5°C. Similarly for a 2°C target.
The lower the target, the smaller the climate change. The smaller the climate change, the better. But is it worth the effort to set lower targets? I mean, if 2°C is good enough, why take the trouble to keep temperatures within 1.5°C? 
Fortunately, a new paper just out in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A asks this question. Specifically, they ask “How much larger are the impacts at 2°C compared to 1.5°C?” A follow-on question asked by the authors relates to what conditions occur at a particular level of warming, such as 2°C. This is a really important question because policymakers need to know what it will take to adapt to a 1.5°C world or a 2°C world.
The authors focus on the impact of climate change on food security, and in particular, how changes to extreme weather will impact food production. The weather issues that are central to this study are drought and precipitation. We know that in a warming world, the weather will get wetter. This is because warm air is more able to hold water (air can be more humid). As a consequence, when rains fall, they come in heavier bursts. We are already seeing this in the US, for example, where the most extreme rainfalls are increasing across the country.
But, at the same time, evaporation happens quicker and areas can dry out faster. So, when the rains stop, drought can set in quicker and more severely. 
So, there are competing issues and an obvious question is, which will win out? Will the world become drier or wetter? The answer to this question depends on where you live. It is likely that areas that are currently wet will become wetter. Areas that are currently dry will become drier. This is just a general rule of thumb, there are variations to this rule. But it is a pretty good generalization.
This behavior is vexing for farmers because it makes planning for the future complicated. But this study at least shines some light on the subject and helps us prepare. To complete the study, the authors considered an Earth that has 1.5°C warming and another Earth with 2°C warming. The authors then identified specific measures for extreme weather. Among the measures are the annual maximum temperature, the percentage of days with extreme daily temperatures, the number of consecutive dry days, and the maximum rainfall in a 5-day period. 
Measures of heavy rainfall and drought were combined with societal factors to form a Hunger and Climate Vulnerability Index. The index incorporates how exposed a country is to climate hazards, how sensitive a country’s agriculture is to climate hazards, and how able a country is to adapt. With these metrics and indices calculated for 122 countries in the developing and under-developed parts of the globe, the authors show that some areas will be more impacted than others. 
Increased wetness will affect Asia more than other regions. Among their predictions is that the water flowrate in the Ganges river may increase by 100%. However, increases to drought could hit Africa and South America hardest. An example outcome is that the Amazon river flow may decrease by 25%. They also found that for most of the planet, a 2°C world is worse than a 1.5°C world. This is to be expected, but now there is a way to quantify the impact of incremental increases in temperature on societal impact.
When the authors continued their look at various regions, that found that temperature changes are amplified in some locations. For instance, with a 2°C warmer world, the land areas mostly warm by more than 2°C. In some regions, like North America, China, northern Asia, northern South America, and Europe, the daily high temperature increases could be double that of the globe on average.
In the figure below, the Hunger and Climate Variability Index is shown for a 2°C warmer world. The image is scaled according to how vulnerable they are to food insecurity. Countries with a larger value are more vulnerable than countries with a smaller number. Any country with a vulnerability greater than 1 is more vulnerable than any country today.
As lead author Richard Betts explained,
Food insecurity is affected by many factors, not just climate. Poverty, access to irrigation and transport networks are all crucial. But increased flooding or drought can impact food production and distribution, making food systems less secure.
I’ll offer a couple of words of caution. The study really focused on drought and rainfall only. There are other societal impacts that are not included, like sea level rise or ocean acidification. With drought and precipitation, at least the climate behaves somewhat proportionally to the warming. But with something like sea level rise, things are far less certain. There, tipping points may exist that once we cross them, there is no going back. For instance, is there a tipping point for ice sheet loss from Greenland or Antarctica? A certain temperature threshold that once passed cannot be reversed? 
The other word of caution is that this study is purposely limited to extreme weather, fresh water, and agriculture. There are many other impacts of climate change on society that are not captured in this research. 
But that aside, this is an important study that helps us identify the winners and losers in a warming world and helps policymakers decide whether we should take action now to try to limit temperature increases to 1.5°C or 2°C. From a practical matter, we humans are not doing enough to hit either temperature target, but at least we have some idea of the wisdom (or lack thereof) of our actions.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/apr/03/scientists-examine-threats-to-food-security-if-we-meet-the-paris-climate-targets

That is you. Not one iota of empathy for people ‘inferior’ to yourself, heaps of sneering loathing. Classic sociopathy, right? If you were to talk as you write in any public venue put a Nazi rally you would be shouted out by both the left and the right. As you well know, because in the real world you probably disguise your true nature, reserving it for anonymity in places like this. Feel free to quote any public intellectual using words like epsilons and morons when talking about disadvantaged, or simply less educated people. You are proof that educated is not the same as intelligent. A non-biased observer would struggle to find a fragment of intellectual thought in your posts – perhaps you can copy and paste something you wrote that an intellectual would claim as worthy?
Instead, you appear angry, hateful, and there is something wrong (possibly little-man syndrome) about someone living thousands of miles away feeling the need to slander millions of people elsewhere. Why do you get off on it? Why do you resort to crude stereotypes, nasty assumptions, and hubris at the cost of not saying anything worth saying? There is no sign in the vocabulary, or the style of your writing that you are over school age. It is a simple rant.
“But many millions of them chose ignorance.”
Prove that ludicrous claim please. Intelligent people tend to blame the system before blaming the results of the system. You do the opposite, blaming young people rather than the educational process. Scientifically your claim is bogus. People are a product of their genetics and environment and their personality traits are all but formed by the age of 8. Yet you blame lack of motivation etc on children who are hardly responsible for their genetics, upbringing and role models. Lazy thinking. Sure, some godlike people such as yourself (the clue is on your alias), have come out ok, but many do not have the ability to struggle uphill. This is why people with brains do NOT blame the kids and instead try to improve the educational system – as all governments do.
I am educated, and run 2 of my own businesses. I voted Brexit for several reasons, not least of which was that I prefer power and decisions to be distributed more locally, not more at a distance.

It did not. How many voters do you believe were not aware that the net figure was 250 by the time they voted. Really, honestly, hand on heart, do you actually not believe that there were many (if any at all) that did not know. It’s not as if it wasn’t shouted at them (figuratively) every day by multiple sources prior to the vote.As for your claiming to have addressed the 250 figure, yes a mild and discrete admission toward the end of your posting (not that it matters, since everyone the facts). Your comment “I’ll clarify that what you would mean to say were you informed, is that brexit was driven primarily by ignorance, manipulation, prejudice and confusion.” In fact most clearly demonstrates the attitude to Bexit voters from a large percentage of Remainers. Arrogance. More usually followed by insults of course, and certainly not usually by any attempt at engaging in debate, though I congratulate you on at least engaging intelligently rather than with the usual abuse (though of course, I disagree with you!).And to your comment “What was it for you? Wages been driven down by immigration? Overburdened services? Housing crisis? Country overpopulated? Which lie did you swallow?”, as usual you are guessing wrongly. I am one of the fortunate ones working in an industry that has not been adversely affected by mass immigration (at least not as far as I am aware – I work in technology so I am more likely to be affected by globalization/offshoring than mass immigration), I am fortunate enough to own my own house and if anything will “downsize” at my next move. I have not needed social services and have been fortunate enough to enjoy excellent health – so the NHS crisis has not (yet?) affected me. However, I have seen those around me affected by the onslaught of mass immigration and excessive population rise. What you call “lies” is in fact everyday experience for them. Undeniable, and backed by the facts and figures. I live in the south east, not so far from London, so I guess the main effect I have noticed from the population explosion is the crowding of roads in my area; a natural consequence of the mass immigration and the mass exodus of people outward from London. An irritation to me, and one that is relatively easily solved for me by moving out further from cities. Would that the more serious problems experienced by those around me were so easily solved.You say “The approximate cost of a tv license per citizen.”. Oh dear. I’ve done that one to death elsewhere, but to summarise – The calculation spreads the amount across every person, yet every person does not work (children, and unemployed), plus not everyone pays the same tax (many pay none, and many more already pay less than their cost to the system). Consequently, that money is not extracted from people evenly. You know this, yet you choose to deceive in your comparison. An you have the cheek to complain endlessly about the 350/250 matter. Unbelievable. One final point on the matter, The cost of a tv license to you might be mere pocket money, but (since you are averaging it across all the population) to those on low incomes it is not so insignificant. In fact, using your idea, it would have to be multiplied by four or five for a family with two or three children. Quite onerous an amount for many.As for “And you think that’s a bad deal. Well, I think that’s pure ignorance. I couldn’t care less if ignorant people hate something they don’t understand. They’ll get it soon enough when the lies they’ve swallowed fail to materialise.”. Well, a little rude, but he-ho. Quite expected and as I said, not as abusive as others. Anyway, let’s have the opportunity to see whether Brexit works out fine financially for most. If it turns out not so good, then we could have another referendum in say 20 years time, and rejoin if that is what people want.

As the EU withdrawal bill inches its way through parliament, the environmental implications of Brexit are being revealed.
BQEND
Here's one thing that could be improved - the protected status of the Great Crested Newt. This ended up on the EU's protected species list because frankly UK naturalists had not shown a great interest in it, so when species were being assessed there weren't many records. The result has been an industry of licensed 'ecologists' who earn their living by looking for these animals on building sites with the result that developments take longer to build or can be utterly frustrated. Of course when you pay people to look for something they will find it. And there are now over 60,000 known sites for these animals - so not exactly rare. There are species not so designated that are known from less than 50 sites. Moreover it is not unknown for these not-especially-rare newts to be introduced to sites under threat of development bringing the legislation into disrepute. The building industry is aware of this and various engineering Consultancies now offer black-box certification services which can be manipulated to miss these animals - e.g. by looking at the wrong time of year.

You are correct, the suvirinn UK can do what it wants.Without implementing any stringent change in the existing legislation (I shall spare you, the [evil] EU [empire] moving the goal posts, it can, including during the Transition Period, the legally binding terms of the TP make provisions for that), the EU labeling rules come in full force to curtail that freedom.British farmers ""freed from the shackles of the EU"" can diverge from EU standards at will....at their own expense.
Leavers have, again, nicely cornered themselves, either they abide by EU standards or diverge towards ""Americanized"" standards but in this case meeting British people expectations regarding animal welfare and environment preservation will make them uncompetitive.There is no middle way between the two models.Oh, and the Chinese middle class customer, upon buying imported food products, is more and more aware of this difference of standards, just like we, Europeans, are.
""But public acceptance of biotechnology is a key challenge for the future introduction of GM crops in China, and despite attempts by the government to persuade consumers of the safety of such foods, opinions remain highly polarized.""

Again, you continue to harp on about the £350 / £250 difference as if it were the most important issue in the country and that it decided the outcome of the referendum.
BQEND
No I'm not. I'm just showing using very available evidence that it was a lie.
BQSTART
As for your claiming to have addressed the 250 figure, yes a mild and discrete admission toward the end of your posting (not that it matters, since everyone the facts).
BQEND
No. I've addressed each way in which the claim was a lie in my original post.
BQSTART
Arrogance. More usually followed by insults of course, and certainly not usually by any attempt at engaging in debate
BQEND
Only in your mind. I'd say the fact I addressed your point specifically, referenced a fact, and phrased my critique as a question somewhat makes that claim ridiculous and unfounded. 
BQSTART
However, I have seen those around me affected by the onslaught of mass immigration and excessive population rise
BQEND
Well the facts don't support that claim. So either you're referring to isolated incidents that do not reflect the macro scale of which this issue is dealt with, or (more likely) you're referring to ignorant and prejudiced assumptions.
BQSTART
You say “The approximate cost of a tv license per citizen.”. Oh dear. I’ve done that one to death elsewhere, but to summarise – The calculation spreads the amount across every person, yet every person does not work
BQEND
Yes I'm aware of that. But it's a way of communicating a sum of money per person that is readily acceptable. The point is that by offering a greater return the investment is sound.
BQSTART
You know this, yet you choose to deceive in your comparison. An you have the cheek to complain endlessly about the 350/250 matter.
BQEND
It isn't a 350/250 matter. The entire claim is a lie. That's your label, and it's fallacious. I'm saying (again) ""It's a lie with regards to it's amount sent. It's a lie with regards to the implication it will be spent on the NHS in full. It's a lie that omits the truth of the Net fee over the gross. It's a lie that ignores the number of recipients that money goes to presently that will want a government commitment to match that in spending, and it ignores the estimated 10 times this amount in economic benefit we receive.""
BQSTART
Well, a little rude, but he-ho. Quite expected and as I said, not as abusive as others. Anyway, let’s have the opportunity to see whether Brexit works out fine financially for most. If it turns out not so good, then we could have another referendum in say 20 years time, and rejoin if that is what people want.
BQEND
So you're sat here defending a lie, that's been proven a lie - said by liars... in order to justify a move that has no evidence supporting it as a good idea (whilst plenty showing it to be a bad idea). And you think the 'oh well - we can always reverse it in 20 years' excuse is justification? Don't make me laugh....

Leaving the European Union could be the single most environmentally damaging act taken by government in the past half-century.
Almost all of the UK’s environmental policy derives from our membership of the EU. Across the full range of issues – air and water pollution, habitats and species protection, waste management and recycling, energy efficiency, carbon emissions and energy policy – it is EU regulation that has raised standards.
Most current EU environmental law will remain in place – initially. But, unless specifically prevented by a future EU-UK trade agreement, a future government could weaken it. Recognising this danger, the secretary of state for the environment, Michael Gove, has promised a consultation on a new, independent body to enforce environmental law. But it is not clear if this will have the powers of the European commission and the European court of justice.
Environmental NGOs have started campaigning for new legislation. But the opportunity may be greater than they had recognised. Until recently, regulation has mainly worked by requiring businesses or products – farms, factories, buildings, cars – to cut waste and pollution. But the overall impact on the environment has not been controlled. Reductions have been outweighed by the counter-effect of economic growth and new products and processes.
The exception has been in the field of climate change. It is not just individual products and companies that are required to cut greenhouse gas emissions: whole countries are. Under EU law, and the UK’s own 2008 Climate Change Act, environmental limits have been imposed on our entire economy. The act requires the government to limit the total carbon emissions of the UK to levels set in law.
The Climate Change Act has been extremely successful. But climate change is not the only environmental threat
The revolutionary nature of this approach has not been widely understood. The Climate Change Act effectively places the UK economy under a sustainability constraint. Every five years, the government of the day is required to adopt a legally binding “carbon budget” setting limits on the total greenhouse gas emissions of the UK economy in a five-year period. Such budgets must be set for 15 years ahead, to give businesses and investors time to plan, and they must lie on a trajectory towards the long-term goal of an 80% reduction in UK emissions by 2050 (defined relative to 1990 levels).
The Climate Change Act has been extremely successful. But climate change is not the only environmental threat. Last month, the intergovernmental panel on biodiversity warned that human destruction of nature is rapidly eroding the world’s capacity to provide food, water and security to more than 3 billion people. The UK may be only 40 years away from the near-eradication of soil fertility. Our air pollution is estimated to shorten 40,000 lives a year.
A sustainable economy act should now be the new model. At its core would be a legal requirement on the government to set environmental limits, and to produce economy-wide plans to achieve them. Over time these limits should include air pollution, soil degradation, resource depletion, plastics pollution and biodiversity loss. All together they would bring the economy within a sustainability constraint.
For each major environmental impact, the act would establish a long-term goal and require the government to set shorter-term targets and plans. So, for example, the 25-year goal of eliminating non-recyclable plastics would be implemented through a series of five-year plans to cut plastic waste by a specific number of tonnes. A long-term goal of restoring biodiversity to, say, a 1980 benchmark would be implemented through successive five-year targets for individual declining species.
The goals and targets would be based on the advice of an expert and independent sustainable economy commission, modelled on the climate change committee, which would in turn report to parliament.
It has now been 30 years since Margaret Thatcher warned that “no generation has a freehold on this Earth. All we have is a life tenancy – with a full repairing lease.” It is finally time to recognise the fundamental truth that environmental degradation arises from within our economy. Only by constraining it to live within the planet’s limits, in law, can we ensure a sustainable future.

Friends of the Earth Netherlands on Wednesday demanded the Anglo-Dutch company revise plans to invest only 5% in sustainable energy and 95% in greenhouse-gas emitting oil and gas.
The environmental group said this business strategy would increase the impact of climate change, especially on the world’s poorest people and those most prone to flooding. It has given Shell eight weeks to shift to a cleaner tack, after which it says it is prepared to invoke international obligations, human rights treaties and laws on hazardous negligence. 
Heading the group’s legal team is Roger Cox, who led and won a landmark climate case in 2015 that insisted the Dutch government should set more ambitious emissions targets.
“This is the first case we know of in the world that seeks preventive action from a company over climate change,” Cox told the Guardian. “We are not asking for damages. We want Shell to steer away from its current course and to get in line with the Paris agreement.”
Shell is one of the world’s 10 biggest carbon emitters. In its annual report last year, the company publicly declared support for the Paris climate deal. It has also outlined “decarbonisation pathways” to move away from dependency on fossil fuels, but environmentalists are frustrated at the glacial pace of change and the weak investment in renewables and carbon capture technology.
Friends of the Earth says the company should be held to account for the approximately 2% of the historical emissions of carbon dioxide and methane it has added to the atmosphere between 1854 and 2010. It has previously taken the company to court for the damage it caused around oil fields in Nigeria.
“Currently Shell and companies like it are acting like big tobacco in decades past by failing to take responsibility for the harm that they cause,” said Craig Bennett, chief executive of Friends of the Earth England, Wales and Northern Ireland. “Shell must now move on from its history of Earth-damaging fossil fuel extraction and play a major part in the transition to a sustainable future, to keep temperature rises to near 1.5C.”
A spokesperson for Shell said the company strongly supported the Paris agreement, “but we believe climate change is a complex societal challenge that should be addressed through sound government policy and cultural change to drive low-carbon choices for businesses and consumers, not by the courts.” 
Given the vast discrepancy in financial resources, any legal battle between Friends of the Earth and Shell would be a challenge of David and Goliath proportions.
But Dutch courts have produced surprises. Arguably the biggest victory for climate litigators anywhere in the world was the 2015 ruling that the Dutch government’s plans to cut emissions by just 14-17% compared to 1990 levels by 2020 were unlawful, given the scale of the threat posed by climate change. The court in The Hague ordered the government to raise targets to at least 25% within five years, although the government is appealing against the decision.
If the Friends of the Earth case goes ahead, Cox said it will depend on the legal duty of everyone in the Netherlands to prevent harm to others when it is reasonably preventable. The duty of public care was easier to prove against the government. It will be tougher against a private company, but Cox said the plaintiffs will emphasises that Shell has specific responsibilities because it has contributed to greatly to the problem of climate change.
 Courts in other countries are increasingly a climate change battleground. 
According to  the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia law school in New York, there are now more than 1,000 cases in the world. Most are claims for damages in the US.
 In January, New York city announced plans to sue five fossil fuel firms – BP, Exxon Mobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Shell – for their contribution to climate change, which has caused flooding and erosion in the city. Local governments in California and elsewhere have launched legal actions, alongside private citizens. Last month, a group of 21 young plaintiffs overcame a major hurdle when a judge rejected moves to dismiss their lawsuit, which argues the US government’s failure to curb CO2 emissions violated their generation’s constitutional rights to life, liberty, and property.
In the most prominent UK case to date, a high court heard the first climate challenge last month against the British government, brought by 12 citizens through a legal group called Plan B which has the support of the government’s former chief scientific adviser, Prof Sir David King.

Where ""it"" is rooftop solar electricity generation and ""that"" is reducing the amount of network needed.
If I have rooftop solar panels under subtropical insolation, during the times of maximum electricity demand in our house that occur on days when the wet bulb temperature is over 34 degrees C, the reverse cycle air conditioner in our living room , the overhead fans, the LED television, the fridge, the laptop and the IPad draw their electricity from the rooftop panels. This electricity consumption involves zero use of the electricity distribution network.
If I have no rooftop solar panels but my neighbour four doors down does, on days in excess of 34 degree C wet bulb temperature, the appliances we run as described above, are supplied with power from 50 metres away rather than from a coal fired power station 190 km away. This reduces the amount of network needed to deliver electricity to our house.
As both these scenarios are occurring on 34 degree plus wet bulb temperature or days of maximum electricity demand the solar panels reduce the amount of power that must be sent from the distant coal fired power station through the network. That network must have sufficient capacity, in simple terms enough wires of sufficient thickness or conductance, to deliver the electricity from the coal fired power station to the consumers on such peak demand days. Rooftop solar panels reduce the amount of electricity that must be sent long distances from the coal fired power station. 54% of the retail cost of electricity goes to meet the cost of constructing and maintaining a electricity distribution network of sufficient capacity to deliver power on those days of maximun demand. This is known as the network cost. By reducing how much power must be delivered from the coal fired power station rooftop solar panels reduce that network cost, the largest component of your electricity bill.

Firstly, you have to really love the life-giving and not-really-all-that-deadly rock from the late Permian and Carboniferous which, if they made it into a snack bar, you would totally want to eat it and then rub the bits left sticking to the wrapper all over your naked form.
Second, you need to harbour a deep dislike for renewable energy, which you find untrustworthy and suspicious because its feedstock is as illusive as catching sunbeams and harnessing atmospheric pressure differences.
Thirdly, you need to have enough respect for a great Australian war hero and nation builder – Sir John Monash – that you’d appropriate his name and legacy for your own little coal gang.
Oh no wait, there are four rules. Because, most importantly, to qualify for coal star membership of the Monash Forum, you need to be a climate science denier – a proper one that goes to climate denial meetings on the other side of the world and gives speeches and stuff.
Like Nationals MP George Christensen, for example, who seems to have been a chief architect of the Monash Forum. 
In 2014, Christensen flew to Las Vegas to speak at a meeting of the Heartland Institute – a so-called “think tank” that’s part of the organised machinery of climate science denial.
Christensen’s speech was titled “Climate Change: Where the Horror and Comedy Genres Collide” which, it might occur to some, could have been a prescient commentary on the Monash Forum.
Two years earlier, Heartland had corporate backers and their cash heading for the exit after one of the most ill-judged billboard campaigns in history. “I still believe in Global Warming. Do You?” asked the billboard, next to a mugshot of terrorist and serial killer Ted “Unabomber” Kaczynski.
When US president Donald Trump announced his country’s withdrawal from the United Nations Paris climate agreement, Heartland’s president was on the invite list for the Rose Garden announcement.
Christensen’s new Monash recruit, former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce, is another to have warmly embraced the vast body of evidence linking fossil fuel burning to climate change.
Then there’s former prime minister Tony Abbott, who, like Christensen, has long rejected the conclusions of all the world’s major scientific institutions on the risks of burning the Monash Forum’s favourite food. 
Last year, Abbott flew to London to deliver the annual lecture of the Global Warming Policy Foundation. How the coal executives must have laughed at Abbott’s ham-fisted comparisons of emissions cuts to goat sacrifices “to appease the volcano gods” (he actually said that). 
Liberal MP Craig Kelly is another frontbencher in the Monash Forum. Kelly is chair of the backbench energy committee. 
In 2015, Kelly tried to “balance” a parliamentary briefing delivered by respected climate scientists by inviting some climate science deniers from Melbourne’s Institute of Public Affairs – a group that, if it’s possible, loves coal more than he does. 
The forum’s manifesto, if you’ve had the misfortune to read it, has all the creepy qualities of the old bloke selling cigarettes to school kids down the back of the oval.
have you read the retrograde #MonashManifesto? text reproduced here.i'm offering 12-to-1 odds (payable in wine) that there won't be a new coal fired power station operating in australia before 2030 (or ever).#auspol pic.twitter.com/CeV6AdruP2
After pushing the myth of “cheap power” with no mention of the fuel’s actual social and environmental costs, the forum says, “all Australian governments must overcome their current coal-phobia and ensure that coal-fired power stations continue to be built.” 
As maybe I’ve just illustrated, it’s easy to be flippant and dismissive about the role and impact of climate science denial on Australia’s climate policy.
Yet the undermining of mountains of scientific evidence over the course of more than two decades has poisoned and politicised an issue that was urgent two decades ago.
When analysts ask why Australia’s energy policy is in crisis, there’s a tendency to forget the illogical political animosity towards renewables that stemmed from climate science denial. 
The thinktanks that want to tell you that the science is flawed are the same ones still pushing coal, still lobbying against clean energy and still trying to sell that mythical clean coal.
There’s an argument too that it’s only really possible to get all warm and fuzzy about coal if you hide yourself from the true impacts that burning it is having now, and will have in the future, and that goes for the the majority of the Coalition that aren’t members of the Monash group.
If you want to understand why Australia got itself into an “energy policy crisis” with spiralling retail electricity prices, then the Monash Forum gives you a handy list of characters and some warmed-up coal industry talking points.
Once they’ve stopped selling us subsidised coal, they no doubt have a great line in second hand typewriters that you could use to knock out your next fax.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2018/apr/05/you-dont-have-to-be-a-climate-science-denier-to-join-the-monash-coal-forum-but-it-helps

 But amid mounting interest in “solar geoengineering” – not least among western universities – a group of scientists from developing countries has issued a forceful call to have a greater say in the direction of research into climate change, arguing that their countries are the ones with most at stake. 
 Scientists have long known that manmade events like pollution in the atmosphere, smoke from forest fires and volcanic eruptions can create a cooling effect.
That has led scientists at Harvard University to propose their own experiment, which they call “stratospheric controlled perturbation effect”, or SCoPEx for short. It involves using a balloon to test the controversial proposition that aerosols released at a height of 20km in the Earth’s atmosphere can alter the reflective properties of cloud cover.
Now a dozen scholars, from countries including Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Ethiopia, India, Jamaica and Thailand, have joined the debate, arguing in the journal Nature that poor countries should take a lead in the field since they have most to gain or lose from the technology.
 The cooling effect has long been known in phenomena such as “ship tracks” – narrow artificial clouds of pollution, created by emissions from ships, that contain more and smaller water droplets than typical clouds, making them brighter and more reflective of sunlight.
 “Solar geoengineering – injecting aerosol particles into the stratosphere to reflect away a little inbound sunlight – is being discussed as a way to cool the planet, fast,” the scientists write in Nature.
 “Solar geoengineering is outlandish and unsettling. It invokes technologies that are redolent of science fiction – jets lacing the stratosphere with sunlight-blocking particles, and fleets of ships spraying seawater into low-lying clouds to make them whiter and brighter to reflect sunlight. 
 “Yet, if such approaches could be realised technically and politically, they could slow, stop or even reverse the rise in global temperatures within one or two years. 
 “The technique is controversial, and rightly so,” they add. “It is too early to know what its effects would be: it could be very helpful or very harmful. Developing countries have most to gain or lose. In our view, they must maintain their climate leadership and play a central part in research and discussions around solar geoengineering.”
 In an interview with Reuters, Dr Atiq Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies and the article’s lead author, amplified his arguments.
 “Clearly [solar radiation management geoengineering] could be dangerous, but we need to know whether, for countries like Bangladesh, it would be more or less risky than passing the 1.5C warming goal. This matters greatly to people from developing countries and our voices need to be heard.
“The overall idea [of solar geoengineering] is pretty crazy, but it is gradually taking root in the world of research,” said Rahman.
The solar geoengineering studies may be helped by a new $400,000 (£284,100) research project, the solar radiation management governance initiative (SRMGI), which is issuing a first call for scientists to apply for finance this week. 
The initiative is financed by the Open Philanthropy Project, a foundation backed by Dustin Moskovitz, a co-founder of Facebook, and his wife, Cari Tuna. 
The fund could help scientists in developing nations study the regional impacts of solar geoengineering, for instance on droughts, floods or monsoons, said Andy Parker, a co-author and project director of the SRMGI. 
Rahman said the academics were not taking sides about whether geoengineering would work. 
And not everyone is convinced by the prospect of the technology.
In a leaked draft of a report about global warming due for publication in October, a UN panel of climate experts express scepticism about solar geoengineering, suggesting it may be “economically, socially and institutionally infeasible”.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/apr/05/scientists-suggest-giant-sunshade-in-sky-could-solve-global-warming

Governments across the world rely on IEA projections to set energy policies, but the agency’s figures – which are influenced by the oil industry – are pushing them off track to reach the targets of the Paris climate agreement, says the report.
The study, released on Thursday by research and advocacy NGO Oil Change International, claims the agency’s investment projections remain massively skewed towards oil and gas, effectively encouraging governments to overshoot emissions targets and worsen climate damage.
In its annual World Energy Outlook, the IEA provides a series of possible scenarios, each of which is dependent on the decisions taken by governments. Oil Change International says all of them would break the Paris targets to keep global temperature rises to well below 2C, or ideally 1.5C, by the end of the century.
Under the most prominent and widely used of the IEA’s pathways – the “new policy scenario” – the world’s carbon budget for 1.5C would be exhausted by 2022, and for 2C by 2034, the report calculates. Even its most ambitious outlook – the “sustainable development scenario” – would bust the 2C budget by 2040, even though it assumes the deployment of as yet untried to extract carbon emissions from the atmosphere, it says.
“The IEA provides an energy roadmap that is supposed to lead us to safety, but in fact it takes us over the cliff,” says Greg Muttitt, research director at Oil Change International. “Any government or financial institution that uses these scenarios as a basis for investments in oil and gas is getting seriously bad information. It’s shocking how far off the Paris agreement they are.”
In a statement to the Guardian, the IEA said any suggestion its sustainable development scenario was unaligned with the Paris goals was incorrect because it envisaged a peaking of emissions before 2020, followed by a sharp decline. It said its new policies scenario was intended only as a reference that showed current and announced policies are “far from enough to avoid severe impacts of climate change” and will very quickly use up the global carbon budget. 
The IEA noted it has also outlined a “faster transition scenario” that illustrates how the Paris goals can be met using existing technologies. This will be updated in April.
The Paris-based IEA was established in 1974 in the wake of an oil crisis with the goal of ensuring “reliable, affordable and clean energy” for its 30 members – states in the rich-nations club of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.
More recently, it has tried to widen its focus to renewables and to encourage participation by emerging economies such as China, India and Brazil, which are now associate members.
Oil Change International says, however, this key organisation remains closely wedded to the fossil fuel industry, pointing out that two of the authors of the most recent World Energy Outlook were on secondment – and receiving salaries – from Shell. It says the IEA also continues to put the interests of wealthy nations first because its forecast for 2040 suggests India would cut emissions by 46% while the European Union would trim by only 40% – in an apparent contradiction of the climate negotiation principle that rich nations should bear the bulk of the responsibility because they have contributed most of carbon dioxide now in the atmosphere.
Muttitt said the IEA needed to catch up with changing priorities and to follow the example set by the World Bank, which in December announced it would cease upstream investment in oil and gas by 2019 in response to the threat posed by climate change.
A spokesperson for the IEA said it was not beholden to any industry, that the two dozen authors – and several hundred reviewers – of the World Energy Outlook came from a wide range of fields and that the agency’s work benefits from input from governments, NGOs and a wide range of industries, including renewable companies. It also noted the most recent ministerial meeting backed a modernisation strategy to turn the IEA into a “global clean energy hub”.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/05/iea-accused-of-undermining-global-shift-from-fossil-fuels

The Greek word skepsis means investigation. By calling themselves skeptics, the ancient skeptics thus describe themselves as investigators. They also call themselves ‘those who suspend’, thereby signaling that their investigations lead them to suspension of judgment. They do not put forward theories, and they do not deny that knowledge can be found. At its core, ancient skepticism is a way of life devoted to inquiry. It is as much concerned with belief as with knowledge. As long as knowledge has not been attained, the skeptics aim not to affirm anything. This gives rise to their most controversial ambition: a life without belief.

I think this is because the deniers have hijacked the word ""belief"" to make it a pejorative, implying irrationality or religion.
In fact, we all have a belief system that gets us through our daily activities. I believe the sun will rise tomorrow. This belief is nothing to do with religion; it's because there are very good grounds for thinking it will do so, and because no-one has time to go around evaluating everything they think a priori</I>. 
You and I have very solid ground for believing in global warming. The evidence is overwhelming to those prepared to look at it with an open mind.
There's nothing wrong with belief; it's essential.

But the proliferation of media outlets has led to more competition. And as we see across so many product lines, greater competition frequently leads to plummeting quality. Currently media is actually incentivised to misrepresent the truth because a bolder, more extreme claim is more likely to get clicks (to a far greater extent than a crazy headline would encourage someone to buy something).
Increasingly, I'm seeing the state of our media - in the broadest sense, but including the traditional outlets - as one of our most vital problems. I don't see inaction as viable. It's all very well saying there are laws in place, but they don't work now, and I don't see them ever being able to deal with a media outlet that has a specific bias. You can lie just as effectively by only reporting selected facts as by creating your own facts.
That's why I said the alternative might be incentivisation. If people valued being told the truth a bit more (my point 1) there might be a way to demarcate those outlets that consistently mislead.

Do you think human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures?

In our survey, the most specialized and knowledgeable respondents (with regard to climate change) are those who listed climate science as their area of expertise and who also have published more than 50% of their recent peer­-reviewed papers on the subject of climate change (79 individuals in total). Of these specialists, 96.2% (76 of 79) answered “risen” to question 1 and 97.4% (75 of 77) answered yes to question 2.

There are two completely incompatible schools of consensus denial.
One maintains that consensus is unimportant and can be ignored. In this case, the level of consensus is irrelevant.
The other that the consensus is overstated and can be ignored. In this case, consensus clearly is important.
Funnily enough, those who hold these conflicting views never seem to notice the mismatch, some adepts even hold both views simultaneously.
As they are engaged in motivated reasoning, they don't really care.
The important thing is to all dismiss expert consensus for whatever reason.

While 85–90% of Democrats are worried about global warming, realize humans are causing it, and are aware that most scientists agree on this, independents and Republicans are a different story. Only 35% of Republicans and 62% of independents realize humans are causing global warming (down from 40% and 70% last year, respectively), a similar number are worried about it, and only 42% of Republicans and 65% of independents are aware of the scientific consensus – also significantly down from last year’s Gallup poll.
The Trump administration’s polarizing stance on climate change is probably the main contributor to this decline in conservative acceptance of climate change realities. A recent study found evidence that “Americans may have formed their attitudes [on climate change] by using party elite cues” delivered via the media. In particular, the study found that Fox News “is consistently more partisan than other [news] outlets” and has incorporated politicians into the majority of its climate segments.
Nevertheless, public awareness about climate change realities has improved over the long-term. For example, about two-thirds of Americans now realize that most scientists agree global warming is occurring, up from less than half in 1997.
There’s also a strong correlation between awareness of the expert consensus, that humans are causing global warming, and concern about the issue. This suggests that when people are aware that experts agree, they accept the consensus and realize we need to address the problem. This is consistent with research finding that the expert consensus is a ‘gateway belief’ leading to public support for climate action.
John Cook and Stephan Lewandowsky, who previously published The Debunking Handbook, teamed up with Sander van der Linden and Edward Maibach to write The Consensus Handbook. It’s a concise and definitive summary of everything related to the expert climate consensus, including how we know 90–100% of climate scientists agree on human-caused global warming, efforts to manufacture doubt about the consensus, its role as a gateway belief, its neutralizing effect on political ideology, and how to inoculate people against misinformation.
Those last points are particularly important in light of the Gallup survey data. There’s an intense battle over public opinion on climate change, with cues from political elites having a polarizing effect that’s largely offset when people become aware of the expert consensus. 
Thus, there’s been a concerted campaign to misinform people about the consensus. That was a key issue that major oil companies accepted in a recent court case, while their fossil fuel-funded supporters denied the consensus in briefs submitted to the court. Meanwhile, the Trump EPA is distributing misleading statements about scientific uncertainty on climate change, helping create this tribal identity that ‘Team Conservative’ denies the realities and dangers associated with human-caused global warming.
However, as the Consensus Handbook discusses, research has shown that inoculating people against misinformation can largely offset its influence.
The bad news is that misinformation can totally offset the influence of facts on topics like the expert consensus on human-caused global warming. The good news is that people don’t like being fooled, so when they’re additionally informed about the tactics used to trick them with misinformation, they’re more likely to accept the facts. 
The challenge is that politicians on Fox News and other media outlets are able to reach a wide audience with their polarizing messages about climate change. Reaching a similarly sized audience not only with facts but also inoculation against the misinformation is a daunting task. However, as John Cook notes,
People always ask me “how do you convince conservatives” or “how do you convince Trump voters” and I answer, “the question isn’t how to convince conservatives, it’s who should we be targeting - our audience is the large, undecided majority”
One key point from the Gallup polling data is that consistently over the past 20 years, less than 10% of Americans have believed that most scientists don’t think global warming is happening. The vast majority of Americans are either aware or unaware of the expert consensus, but few have it backwards. Data from Yale and George Mason universities tells a similar story – only about 10% of Americans think less than 50% of climate scientists agree on global warming. While Americans badly underestimate the expert consensus – just 13% are aware there’s over 90% expert agreement, and the average American thinks the consensus is just 67% – despite growing polarization, few believe that most scientists reject global warming.
Most Americans are simply unaware about and thus underestimate the expert climate consensus. While a number of people can’t be convinced by the facts due to their polarized views, many more in that undecided, uninformed group remain open-minded and reachable.
We could solve the problem if conservative politicians and media outlets would simply stop spreading misinformation about and polarizing the subject of climate change. Sadly, the rise of this ‘tribal epistemology’ has done lasting damage to America, and nobody seems to have any good ideas how to stop or reverse it. But the Consensus Handbook provides some important information about the importance of consensus messaging and tools to help it take hold.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/apr/05/american-conservatives-are-still-clueless-about-the-97-expert-climate-consensus

But the sexual success of this rare and declining orchid in Britain is imperilled by climate change, researchers have found.
The orchid’s ruse only works if a female mining bee, Andrena nigroaenea, has not emerged from hibernation, because as soon as this happens, the orchid cannot compete with the alluring scent of the real thing – and the plant is ignored by the male bees.
While warmer springs cause the early spider orchid to flower earlier in May, climate warming is also causing female bees to emerge from hibernation even earlier – confounding the orchid’s attempts to dupe the male bees.
Phenology is the study of how plant and animal life cycles are influenced by seasonal variations in climate. Similar phenological mismatches have been observed in other ecological relationships, such as great tit chicks no longer hatching soon enough to coincide with peak supplies of their crucial caterpillar food. They could potentially imperil the reproductive success of many species, including the pollination of plants and crops.
Studying 356 years of central England temperature records, as well as specimens of early spider orchids and Andrena nigroaenea from herbariums and museums from Victorian times, researchers from the University of Sussex, the University of East Anglia, Kew and the University of Kent were able to calculate when warm spring conditions caused the female bees to emerge earlier than the orchid.
Their study, published in the Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, found that the orchid’s trick was always a delicate balancing act – even between 1659 and 1710, the peak flying date for the female bee preceded the orchid’s peak flowering in 40% of the years – but it has become even more inefficient.
Mean spring temperature increased from 7.68C to 8.64C over the 356-year study period, and between 1961 and 2014 the female bee’s emergence preceded the orchid’s peak flowering in 80% of the years.
The researchers found the female bee beat the orchid flower in 26 of the 28 years to 2014. Although one pollinated early spider orchid can produce 10,000 tiny seeds, failure to flower before the female bee emerges makes pollination almost impossible, and each orchid is very short-lived.
Michael Hutchings, lead author and emeritus professor of ecology at the University of Sussex, first noticed the changes in flowering times during 32 years studying the rare orchids on the South Downs. The orchid’s range in Britain has drastically shrunk and Hutchings warned that it could become extinct in this country, with climate change also damaging populations of other less specialist plants and animals.
“For years I’ve been speaking at conferences and writing papers saying if we get the habitat management right everything is going to be fine but then the climate warming actually stops the plant producing the seeds,” he said.
“Ecologists have been saying for a long time that if phenologies are changed by changing climate this might disrupt important interactions in communities of species. This study provides the strongest evidence we have that something nasty is happening. There are probably lots of other undocumented cases where similar detrimental effects on species are occurring.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/05/climate-change-threatens-rare-british-orchid-that-tricks-bees-into-mating

The times I have posted up links for people on climate change science and you never hear a blinking word back. Ever.
I've posted up whole pages of links to different talks, different experts, carefully typed out, exactly for people like you, poo-pooing - and you get nothing back. No discussion. People just disappear.
Would you even read the links I posted up? Watch the videos? Listen to the talks? Would you fuck.
You're just hear to insist I'm 'misguided'.

The difference that matters between them is that the ice of the Arctic floats: if it melted nothing much would happen to aggregate sea levels. The ice of Antarctica, like that of Greenland, rests on land. If it all were to melt, as it has done in the far distant past, sea levels could rise by as much as 60 metres. That is most unlikely to happen. What is possible, though, is that the smaller portion of the continent, west Antarctica, which is divided from the rest by a mountain range, could lose much of its ice. Even that would be catastrophic. A significant retreat in west Antarctica, as seems to be already under way, could raise sea levels by between one and three metres by the end of this century. Children now alive will see that happen across their lifetimes. That is what is meant by the urgency of global warming.
This week saw the publication of fresh research showing that the glaciers of west Antarctica are retreating faster than they were at the end of the last ice age, when water levels also rose significantly. The ice sheet is not one homogeneous mass, but a collection of glaciers all moving slowly but inexorably towards the sea. Their retreat is happening underwater, and invisibly, as the ocean erodes the foot of the glacier, known as the “ground line”, where its contact with the sea floor ends. Beyond that point, long tongues of ice stick out into the ocean, providing the coastline that we can see and map. But the capacity of the ice sheet to lock up water depends on the position of the ground line. As that retreats, invisibly, the sea level rises and the whole of the ice sheet grows less stable, something which makes further sea rise still more likely.
Previous surveys have concentrated on a few of the glaciers that are an obvious danger but the research released this week analysed satellite data covering the whole of the coastline of west Antarctica to reach its worrying conclusions. The problem is worsened by the shape of the seabed on which the glaciers now rest. It does not slope towards the deep ocean, but inwards, forming a bowl of which the far side is the mountain range that divides the continent. That means that the process of erosion will be working downhill as it moves inwards, with faster and less predictable results.
The present danger was discovered by measuring the thickness of the ice sheet from space and deducing from this the shape of the glacier beneath. This is much easier than knowing what to do. The contrast between the exquisite technological sophistication employed in the diagnosis of the problem and the lack of international coordination or political sophistication when it comes to solving it, illustrates the crisis of technological civilisation. As a species we have shown enough cleverness to disrupt the world’s climate, but may not have enough to remedy the damage that we’ve done. Things are of course made very much worse by the presence in the White House of an aggressively ignorant and anti-science administration.
Predicting the future of these changes isn’t an exact science, which is one of the things which makes them so frightening, but neither is it entirely guesswork. Ignorance about the size of the threatened rise in sea levels is no excuse for inaction. We know it’s coming. We know it will be disruptive. We don’t know if it will be catastrophic. But the possibility must spur us into drastic action on fossil fuels. Keep them in the ground.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/05/the-guardian-view-on-antarctica-the-worrying-retreat-of-the-ice

They were filtering and purifying the water, but when you walk, they create bumps under your feet. If you walk slowly there’s no problem, or if you are really fussy, you can wear shoes, but no. The mussels had to go and go they did. Then they decided to add sand to the grass shoreline bc sand is so much more comfortable for them. No regard for the silt and iron deposits from the sand turning the shoreline red-brown, increasing algae growth and reducing oxygen in the water. I have given them website links from lake organizations in various other states, detailing the harmful effects of adding sand to a grass shoreline, but year after year, they add more sand. Then they didn’t like the seasonal appearance of Canadian Geese, so they put a light in the water that flashes all night to keep the Geese away.

Sometimes it seems a bit easy to focus on such a famous spot, but it is famous and therefore draws attention and of course the reason that it became famous makes it a relevant spot to explore environmental changes. 
Near where I grew up, on a drive we often took, was an island of beautiful forest set aside as state wayside. I remember this spot throughout my life and I was happy to introduce my son to this small, special spot that was largely unknown beyond the local area (very much unlike Walden Pond).
By the last time I visited the Douglas-firs were large second-growth trees and the big leaf maples formed a lush sub-canopy. Pacific dogwoods added unique flavor, as did the northern most California black oak I have ever found, and the cedars, in moist spots, added their swooping and drooping textural beauty to this lush green oasis surrounded by level farm field and defined by the road on the south. 
I could not put a price on how much this seemingly insignificant corner of land meant to me, and I know to others, and yet there was certainly a price that could be applied to the trees. I unfortunately do not mean in terms of soil health and retention, water quality and availability and also not in terms of carbon being held out of the atmosphere in lovely wood and soft, rich, warm smelling humus, and I don't mean in terms of providing crucial elements for diverse and complex living systems and lively communities. This is a global economy and the prices for timber, and fiber in general, is high.
The state parks system is hugely underfunded due to the ""tax revolts"" of the well healed.  Some years back there was a partial logging cut, but it was not too intense in the trees taken and the broader environmental impact. 
Now I have just come to find out that the land, or at least the timber, was sold to a logging company and the entire forest was cut. The pictures I saw were of a landscape I did recognize. I know in my logical mind that this is the same geographical spot that I visited so many times, but it is in no way the same place. It was shattered and exposed; it hurt me to see this and to think of how this could happen, why it could not be avoided and to think of how symbolic this was for a world being robbed of its beauty and wonder.', u'recommendation_count': u'7', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1523037736000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'the tax revolts of', u'effect': u'hugely underfunded'}], u'author_id': u'4615682', u'id': u'114439691', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'ehmaybe', u'text': u'The Tiber and Thames once flowed with pristine water, does the change similarly condemn the Italian and English souls?', u'recommendation_count': u'6', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1523037559000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'14933002', u'in_reply_to': u'114428392', u'id': u'114439603', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Thomas1178', u'text': u'I think Thoreau’s description is more a hook for the article than a reasonable goal for the lake; that said, turning into a “murky green stew of algae” wouldn’t benefit anybody.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1523036696000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'17571204', u'in_reply_to': u'114434120', u'id': u'114439191', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'originalabsence', u'text': u'Annie might retort of course nature will triumph, we are mere ephemera, as even is pollution but temporary food for mycelium.

The Massachusetts pond was made famous in Walden, the transcendentalist writer’s account of the years he spent next to it in order to “live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life”. The pond has been greatly affected by human activity. Everything from forest fires in the 19th century, to wood-cutting operations, the use of pesticides in the 1960s and increasing tourism have affected the water quality, according to the paper. Over half of the phosphorus in the lake in the summer “may now be attributable to urine released by swimmers”, while a footpath to Thoreau’s cabin “caused large amounts of soil to wash into the lake”.
“In the century and a half since Thoreau and his transcendentalist colleagues wrote of humanity as somehow separate from nature, we’ve become a force of nature in our own right, powerful enough to change the chemistry and temperature of the atmosphere and the ecology of lakes and ponds worldwide,” Curt Stager, a natural sciences professor at Paul Smith’s college, New York, and one of the authors of the paper told CNET.
Stager and his fellow researchers analysed sediment from the pond to determine how the growth of algae has changed. Their research revealed that the major changes in the lake’s algae happened in the 20th century. The closure of a nearby landfill site, the stabilisation of the shoreline and the upgrading of septic facilities have mitigated the effects of humans on the lake since 2000, but the researchers warn that the pond has not returned to the state described by Thoreau.
Writing in the mid-19th century, Thoreau referred to the “crystalline purity” of the pond, to its “remarkable transparency” and its “pure and well-like character”. “Successive nations perchance have drank at, admired and fathomed it, and passed away, and still its water is green and pellucid as ever,” he wrote. “Perhaps on that spring morning when Adam and Eve were driven out of Eden Walden Pond was already in existence, and even then breaking up in a gentle spring rain accompanied with mist and a southerly wind, and covered with myriads of ducks and geese, which had not heard of the fall, when still such pure lakes sufficed them … It is a gem of the first water which Concord wears in her coronet.”
The researchers warn that the lake would likely be further affected by climate change. “The sediment darkening and high percentages of [algae] in the recent sediments of Walden Pond … indicate not only that the lake ecosystem is now quite different from that described by Thoreau but also that it may be primed for more severe reductions in water clarity in a warming future.”
Increasing temperatures in coming decades, for instance, could also increase recreational use of the lake in summer, add researchers, who suggest that a nearby swimming pool would “relieve pressure on the lake”.
“If we’re not careful, this beautiful, iconic lake … could easily become more like a murky, green stew of algae,” Stager told CNET.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/06/pee-and-pesticides-henry-david-thoreau-walden-pond-in-trouble-warn-scientists

Telling banks and insurers they would need to provide more information about the risks they might face from climate change, Mark Carney said failure to do so would have damaging effects for financial stability.
He said the finance industry could be forced into making rapid adjustments if they did not gradually expose where their climate change risks might lie, which he said could trigger steep losses.
The governor warned of a “climate Minsky moment”, referring to the work of the economist Hyman Minsky, whose analysis was used to show how banks overreached themselves before the 2008 financial crisis. 
“Given the uncertainties around climate, not everyone will agree on the timing or scale of the adjustments required … [but] the right information allows sceptics and evangelists alike to back their convictions with their capital,” Carney said.
Speaking at a summit of central bank governors in Amsterdam, Carney said there were growing opportunities for firms to finance the transition to a low carbon economy. He said new technology investments and long-term infrastructure projects would need to be financed at roughly quadruple the current rate.
His intervention comes as Threadneedle Street ramps up its assessment of how well insurers are identifying, measuring and mitigating weather-related risks this year. Insurers were exposed to steep losses by extreme weather events, such as Hurricane Harvey, in the US last year.

He was the consummate politician who could bend nations to his will, but Winston Churchill was powerless when it came to butterflies.
The British prime minister hired the country’s leading lepidopterist and spent years attempting to reintroduce two extinct species into his back garden.
Despite his best efforts, and the release of hundreds of black-veined whites and swallowtails in the 1940s, his schemes to have rare butterflies feasting on “fountains of honey and water” at Chartwell in Kent were an ignominious failure.
Churchill may, however, simply have been seven decades ahead of his time: new research has revealed that climatic conditions may be suitable for the black-veined white to fly in Britain once again.
The species – which is still found across much of Europe – became extinct in Britain after a series of disastrously wet autumns in the early part of the 20th century. Now, with average temperatures rising, experts believe it could prosper here once again.
Two studies in northern France, which has a similar climate to southern England, have found that it would be easy to provide for the black-veined white’s needs by creating flowery field margins and allowing the growth of young scrub such as hawthorn and blackthorn.
Fabrizia Ratto, from the University of Southampton, who conducted one of the studies for the charity Butterfly Conservation, said: “Our study found that the butterfly has a strong preference for small isolated bushes of blackthorn and hawthorn as egg-laying sites with abundant nectar sources such as red clover nearby.
“These habitat conditions can be recreated relatively easily in the UK through the implementation of agri-environmental measures such as nectar flower mixes in crop margins and by allowing some scrub regeneration beside adjacent hedgerows.”
The results of the studies are revealed at Butterfly Conservation’s international symposium in Southampton this weekend.
It is believed that Churchill became fascinated by the spectacular butterflies he encountered while serving as an officer in India. Unfortunately for him, his ambitious attempts to bring back the black-veined white were partly scuppered by his gardener, who accidentally hacked the nests of the young caterpillars from the hawthorn bushes where they had carefully been placed and burned them.
Churchill had no better luck with his attempts to bring the swallowtail back to Kent. Despite enlisting the services of the leading butterfly breeder of the day, L Hugh Newman, he could not persuade it to breed in the wild, and was again not helped by gardeners who burned the fennel which the caterpillars fed upon.
Churchill might have had more success today. While the British subspecies of the swallowtail is confined to the Broads of Norfolk and Suffolk, in recent summers climate warming has encouraged the continental subspecies of the swallowtail to cross the Channel, and several individual butterflies have bred successfully on carrot and fennel plants in gardens and allotments in Sussex.
Maverick attempts such as Churchill’s to reintroduce rare or extinct butterflies are frowned upon by conservation groups because they risk disrupting the scientific monitoring of species or introducing pathogens, but there is an increasing number of officially approved schemes to bring back scarce species. This summer the chequered skipper, which became extinct in England in 1977, is being returned to the forest of Rockingham in Northamptonshire via specimens from Belgium.
Of the possibility of bringing back the black-veined white, Prof Tom Brereton of Butterfly Conservation, who supervised the research, said: “We have so few butterflies in the UK, the return of one of Europe’s most spectacular species would be a major boost for everyone who loves butterflies. Creating habitat conditions for this butterfly would benefit pollinating insects and other valuable species, many of which are threatened by the impacts of climate change.”

Making cement and concrete, which is the most consumed product in the world after water, entails substantial emissions of carbon dioxide, from the chemical processes involved. While manufacturers have for years been seeking ways to reduce this or capture the carbon produced, and to make cement production more energy efficient, the results have failed to keep pace with the need to cut carbon emissions.
The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), which tracks greenhouse gas emissions from leading industries, found in a report published on Monday that Indian companies were performing best on reducing their carbon footprint, partly because they benefit from newer and more efficient manufacturing plants.
In Europe, emissions from cement production were supposed to be reduced under the EU’s emissions trading scheme, which has operated since 2005, under which heavy industries are awarded allowances for the carbon they produce, and if they need to emit more must buy spare permits from cleaner companies. But the price of permits repeatedly collapsed owing to over-allocation of allowances and the scheme does not operate to reduce emissions as much as intended.
Cement production, according to the CDP, accounts for 6% of global carbon emissions, making it the second biggest source of carbon emissions from global industry, after steel. Its wider effects are even more problematic, as the built environment accounts for more than a third of the world’s carbon emissions. The report found that leading cement companies would need to double their efforts to reduce emissions, in order to meet the Paris climate goals.
Paul Simpson, chief executive of CDP, said companies must seek new technologies to overcome the problem: “Cement is a heavy and largely invisible emitter, yet taken for granted as a necessary building block of basic civilisation. Cement companies need to invest and innovate in order to avoid impending risks to their operations and the wider world. There is a solution – cement companies just need to invest properly in finding it.”
He said companies would come under pressure from investors, customers and government regulations, and that delaying changes to their practices would cost companies more in the long term.
The report, entitled Building Pressure, analysed 13 of the world’s biggest publicly listed cement companies, representing 16% of global cement production and with a a total market capitalisation of $150bn.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/09/cement-industry-urged-to-reduce-invisible-global-emissions

Here is the Walsh 1978 paper which is included in the IPCC report, but only from 1973. See fig 6. Had they gone back to 1968, there was 2.5m Km2 less ice than 1973, and 3.5m Km2 less than the 1979 peak. Which makes 1968 about 1m Km2 lower than today, but not a low as the minimum in 2012.

First rule of testing a scientific theory, look for the data that DOESN'T agree with the theory, not focus on the data which supports it. Then, see if there might be any other causes ...
The AMO over the period in question may also be a factor.

We will see to what extent if is a factor as the AMO goes into negative territory again. You will surprised to know that Arctic sea ice was lower than now in the 1940s!

Predictions are that, in summer, most European cities could become as much as 10C hotter by the end of this century, testing the old and very young who both have trouble regulating body temperature.
Cities across the world that are already too hot in the summer are taking a variety of measures from insisting new buildings have gardens on their roofs, painting existing roofs white, colouring roads light grey and planting trees in streets and open spaces. 
The good news is that all these measures work, reducing land surface temperatures by 2C to 3C in the areas where they are applied. Another rather surprising finding is that solar panels, although black, also reduce the heat island effect by absorbing the sunlight (and turning it into electricity). 
Even in rural areas, the type of crops chosen by farmers has an influence – barley reflects 23% of sunlight back into space and sugar beet 26%. Sadly, none of this halts global warming but it does slow it down and buys a little more time.

Lord Lawson appeared on a Radio 4 programme last summer denying the concept of climate change, which prompted complaints from the Green party and the prominent scientists Brian Cox and Jim Al-Khalili, who said it was “irresponsible and highly misleading” to imply there was still a debate around the science supporting it.
I agree with @jimalkhalili . Irresponsible and highly misleading to give the impression that there is a meaningful debate about the science. https://t.co/HtqJf9sBFW
The Today programme featured five interviews on climate change prompted by the release of the film An Inconvenient Sequel, the former US vice-president Al Gore’s follow-up to 2006’s An Inconvenient Truth. Each interview was conducted by the presenter Justin Webb.
Lawson, a former chancellor of the exchequer in Margaret Thatcher’s government, made claims including that “all the experts say there hasn’t been” an increase in extreme weather events. He said the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change “concedes” this, and that, according to official figures, “during this past 10 years … average world temperature has slightly declined”. 
Ofcom received two complaints that the interview broke the UK broadcasting rule 5.1, which states that “news, in whatever form, must be reported with due accuracy and presented with due impartiality”.
“Neither statement was correct, or sufficiently challenged during the interview or subsequently during the programme,” said the Ofcom ruling.
The BBC said it had publicly acknowledged that “some of Lord Lawson’s statements went beyond the intended scope of the interview and he was allowed to make inaccurate assertions which should have been challenged”.
Ofcom was not impressed that a previous appearance on the Today programme in 2014 by Lawson, who founded the Global Warming Policy Foundation, resulted in an internal BBC investigation and ruling that found the same failure to properly challenge his views.
“We found that statements made about the science of climate change were not challenged sufficiently during this interview, which meant the programme was not duly accurate,” said a spokeswoman for Ofcom. “We’ve told the BBC we are concerned that this was the second incident of this nature, and on the same programme.”
The BBC attempted to minimise the fallout of Webb’s failure to address the inaccurate comments at the time, by airing a follow-up item the next morning that “examined some of the more contentious claims made by Gore and Lord Lawson”.
The BBC also published a news story online that “highlighted criticisms of the interview with Lord Lawson and identified the inaccuracy of certain aspects of his contribution”.
Ofcom said these actions saved the BBC from a second breach of the broadcasting rules. Rule 5.2 states that “significant mistakes in news should normally be acknowledged and corrected on air quickly … corrections should be appropriately scheduled”. 
The BBC also included contributions from several complainants and a statement from the Today programme in Radio 4’s Feedback slot 10 days after the original interview.
The BBC decided against pitting Lawson against a scientist who could have challenged his views during the interview. The corporation said this was deliberate, because it had done so in 2014 and the tactic had backfired, legitimising Lawson “by giving listeners the impression of parity between their views”.
The decision not to have an expert on hand to challenge Lawson meant listeners were “not given the full facts” about his stance on climate change, and meant Webb should have been prepared to step in and correct him, Ofcom said.
“The editorial team could have reasonably anticipated there was a risk that Lord Lawson might raise these arguments,” said Ofcom. “The BBC should have planned for that eventuality and the presenter should have been prepared to provide challenge and context to Lord Lawson’s views as appropriate. 
“The BBC’s failure to do this led to significant inaccuracies being broadcast. Critically, these inaccuracies were allowed to stand without challenge or clarification during that broadcast.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/09/bbc-radio-4-broke-impartiality-rules-in-nigel-lawson-climate-change-interview

nitpicking
BQENDI said 10% greater insoultion at high northern latitudes over 10 000s of years is a significant difference not a nitpick.
Either people think it is significant or a nitpick.
Perhaps this is useful to focus people into thinking about where analogues can be useful and where they can lead people to use them in a fashion that potentially misinforms.
A climate analogue for those not aware of it is using previous climate states of the Eatrh to understand our current climate. 
The Eemian* shows us that ice sheets can melt over 10 000s of years with very large forcings. But without explaining that insolation, that is sunlight, was much stronger in the summer months in high northern latitudes so this may not represent an accurate picture of a 2C warmer world from greenhouse forcing risks creating an exaggerated sense of certainty and a lack of clarity over timelines on sea level rise.

I thought not. Now ponder how much the ""free-market"" cost of nuclear fission is today - half a century after it went commercial. It is going up.
BQENDI'm not entirely sure what your point is - there is no such thing as 'free' power.
Wind and solar are free - it is putting them to use that costs the money.. on that level coal and oil are 'free' too, right up to the point where they are extracted and put to use.
The cost of wind and solar are indeed falling but that does no increase their utility, nor does it reduce the utility of alternatives.
At the end of the day we need comprehensive solutions that address the issues of carbon emissions - wind and solar have a major role to play (dependent upon region and use) but it is not a direct competition between nuclear and solar/wind as you imply.Your demand that nuclear must uniquely ""pay for itself"" is an unnecessary prejudice when so many other green solutions (along with sub-systems to allow them to function) will require some manner of carbon tax to be economically viable.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1523730449000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'14842422', u'in_reply_to': u'114582479', u'id': u'114723931', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'TTauriStellarbody', u'text': u'BQSTART

EPA also threatened to revoke California’s ability under the Clean Air Act to impose its own greenhouse gas standards. If they do so, California’s attorney general will sue the EPA.
The Trump Administration’s assault on clean car standards risks our ability to protect our children’s health, tackle climate change, and save hardworking Americans money. We’re ready to file suit if needed to protect these critical standards: https://t.co/AqwDR9Js18 https://t.co/qBalA25Z2l
This lawsuit would be tied up in court for years, and in the meantime California’s more stringent standards would remain in place. Those standards have been adopted by 12 other states, which along with California account for one-third of new car sales in America. Weaker federal fuel efficiency standards wouldn’t much help the US auto industry if they don’t apply to one-third of domestic sales.
The Obama administration set the stricter fuel efficiency standards after the federal government was forced to bail out the auto industry. Struck by the 2008 global recession and a spike in fuel prices, US auto manufacturers, whose fleets were less fuel efficient than foreign competitors, were in dire financial straits. The auto industry thus accepted the federal bailout and didn’t fight the higher fuel efficiency standards – until Donald Trump came into office. California also agreed to the new federal standards in 2008, and now wants to use its Clean Air Act authorization to keep them.
The auto industry has argued that low gasoline prices are the problem, but that’s not a problem they want to solve. In fact, US automakers are in the process of repeating the same mistakes that led to the industry collapse a decade ago: 
""GM will end production of the Chevrolet Sonic subcompact car... part of a broader push by Detroit auto executives to abandon low-margin cars in favor of sport-utility vehicles."" https://t.co/rB4gL3baqi
Other than Russia, no developed country has gasoline prices nearly as cheap as America’s. Australia’s are closest at 35% more expensive than American gasoline. Canada’s are 46% more expensive, and European petrol is about twice the American price.
Automakers are complaining that they can’t meet the stricter fuel efficiency standards because those low fuel prices are causing more Americans to buy gas-guzzling trucks and SUVs. The problem isn’t technological – every major auto company offers a range of hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and/or fully electric vehicles, but these account for just 3% of new car sales in America today.
It’s also important to note that American fuel prices are artificially low because they don’t reflect the associated costs of climate change damages. This is known as the ‘social cost of carbon’ – the costs taxpayers incur to pay for the added damages from climate-intensified hurricanes, floods, droughts, heatwaves, and so on. Economists call these costs ‘externalities’ because they’re not reflected in the market price of fossil fuels. Putting a price on this sort of pollution is ‘Econ 101’, and 95% of economists support either a carbon pollution price or standards like these fuel efficiency rules.
The solution could not be clearer, but it’s not a solution most Americans want to hear – gasoline prices should be higher.
Automakers admit that consumer demand for gas guzzlers is the problem. Conservatives claim to be worried about the ballooning national debt (despite having passed a trillion-dollar tax cut). Environmentalists and scientists want to cut carbon pollution. Donald Trump claims to be worried about America’s crumbling infrastructure. The stricter standards would save $1.7 trillion on fuel by 2025; buying inefficient cars would cost Americans money.
Implementing a carbon pollution tax could solve all of these problems. 
In short, it’s the sort of policy that everyone looking out for America’s long-term best interests should support. Unfortunately, the key power players in this story don’t.
Automakers don’t lobby for a carbon tax because their most profitable models are inefficient trucks and SUVs. As an industry group spokesman told the LA Times,
Manufacturers need to sell vehicles that customers need and want today to fund the technological shifts and electrification and automation expected in the future
That’s a charitable way of saying that automakers want to maximize their near-term profits by continuing to sell lots of gas guzzlers. So, they instead hired a group to submit a climate denial report to the EPA and asked Administrator Scott Pruitt to negotiate a weaker, compromise standard with California. The New York Times reports that talks are quietly ongoing behind the scenes, but thus far Pruitt’s comments have not been encouraging.
 In fact, the EPA Notice repealing the standard didn’t even mention climate change or public health – the primary factors underpinning these fuel efficiency standards. Instead, Pruitt simply scrapped the federal standard and threatened to go nuclear by revoking California’s ability to set its own standards, and California responded by threatening to take EPA to court. The automakers are not pleased.
Honda exec rips Trump EPA plan to lower emission standards: ""We didn't ask for that"" https://t.co/gTdWh5QXMw pic.twitter.com/ZNDuSmcQ1j
But it’s their own fault for relying on an EPA administrator who they know is a fossil fuel industry puppet and an ideologue, rather than advocating for a win-win carbon tax that would have hurt their short-term profits but given the industry long-term certainty and stability. Instead, they’ll likely have to deal with the uncertainty of an ongoing court case and requirements to meet two different standards. As California Air Resources Board Chairman Mary Nichols said last year,
I want to turn to the industry representatives who are here and say, ‘what were you thinking when you threw yourselves on the mercy of the Trump administration to solve your problems?’
In public statements, auto and oil companies support a carbon tax. General Motors, ExxonMobil, Shell, Total, and BP are even founding members of the Climate Leadership Council – a group led by Republican Party elder statesmen but also supported by Stephen Hawking, Steven Chu, and The Nature Conservancy, whose goal is to implement a revenue-neutral carbon tax. However, when similar legislation is actually introduced in Congress, the auto and oil industries refuse to throw their support behind it, and Republican lawmakers inevitably kill it.
In this case, the auto industry tried to bypass the problem while maintaining the short-term profits associated by selling polluting gas guzzlers. Instead they got burned – they’ll still have to meet California’s stricter standards despite the relatively low demand for economic vehicles due to artificially cheap fuel prices. And we’ll continue to wait for enough Republican lawmakers to get on board with a win-win carbon tax.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/apr/10/epas-war-with-california-proves-america-needs-a-carbon-tax

Fewer grayling and grizzled skippers took to the skies than in any year since the scientific monitoring of butterflies began more than 40 years ago.
The annual UK Butterfly Monitoring scheme revealed that seven of the worst 10 years for butterflies have occurred this century. While long-term falls in butterfly populations have been caused by habitat loss, scientists attribute the dramatic recent decline to climate change, pesticides such as neonicotinoids and nitrogen pollution.
While it was hoped that a brighter spring in 2017 would see butterfly populations bounce back after the virtually butterfly-less late summer of 2016, many of Britain’s 59 native species, both rare and common, suffered further falls. Grizzled skipper numbers have more than halved since the 1970s while the grayling’s population has shrunk by 63% in the last decade. The large white – once so common it was a pest – fell by 19% in 2017.
There was some good news, with two species enjoying long-term increases once again experiencing good summers: the red admiral was up by 78% compared to 2016 and the comma rose by 91%. A warm spring and targeted conservation management for a rare butterfly, the pearl-bordered fritillary, also reaped dividends, with a 57% increase on 2016.
“Butterflies are at a low ebb, and going from one bad year to another, not helped by the weather which is all over the place,” said Prof Tom Brereton, head of monitoring at Butterfly Conservation. “A lot of climate change research has focused on average increases in temperature, which should be beneficial to many butterflies but the variable and extreme weather that comes with climate change is having a negative effect and disrupting butterflies.”
Increased nitrogen deposition – via agricultural fertilisers but also pollution from motor vehicles – is highly likely to be causing the disappearance of butterflies such as the grayling and grizzled skipper, according to Brereton.
The caterpillars of such species feed on plants which are easily swamped by more vigorous grasses, which thrive in high-nitrogen conditions.
“The conservation management has not really changed on sites such as nature reserves but the vegetation has subtly changed – it’s grassed over, or become taller and shadier,” said Brereton. “It’s not surprising that insects like the grayling, wall brown and grizzled skipper are struggling.”
Brereton led research which last year uncovered surprisingly high declines of butterflies in urban areas, where vehicle pollution has caused nitrogen levels to soar.
“There does seem to be a correlation between butterflies that have a low nitrogen status and their declines in areas of high nitrogen deposition,” said Brereton. “There is some evidence of this from the Netherlands but more research is needed.”
Butterflies have been scientifically recorded since 1976 by thousands of volunteers for the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme, a partnership between Butterfly Conservation, the Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.

there have been 4000 cases of thyroid cancer, mainly in children, but that except for nine deaths, all of them have recovered. ""Otherwise, the team of international experts found no evidence for any increases in the incidence of leukemia and cancer among affected residents.""

Nothing in the article to suggest a nuclear zealot. In any case the numbers are either true or false irrespective of who published them. And why would a nuclear zealot be any less credible than an anti-nuclear zealot?
And if it is peer reviewed articles you are after, try this one from the institution -Our World in Data- at Oxford University:-Based on historical and current figures of deaths related to energy production, nuclear appears to have caused by far the least harm of the current major energy sources.
It goes completely against what most believe, but out of all major energy sources, nuclear is the safest

The findings, based on multiple lines of scientific evidence, throw into question previous predictions that a catastrophic collapse of the Gulf Stream would take centuries to occur.
Such a collapse would see western Europe suffer far more extreme winters, sea levels rise fast on the eastern seaboard of the US and would disrupt vital tropical rains. The new research shows the current is now 15% weaker than around 400AD, an exceptionally large deviation, and that human-caused global warming is responsible for at least a significant part of the weakening.
The current, known as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Amoc), carries warm water northwards towards the north pole. There it cools, becomes denser and sinks, and then flows back southwards. But global warming hampers the cooling of the water, while melting ice in the Arctic, particularly from Greenland, floods the area with less dense freshwater, weakening the Amoc current.
Scientists know that Amoc has slowed since 2004, when instruments were deployed at sea to measure it. But now two new studies have provided comprehensive ocean-based evidence that the weakening is unprecedented in at least 1,600 years, which is as far back as the new research stretches.
“Amoc is a really important part of the Earth’s climate system and it has played an important part in abrupt climate change in the past,” said Dr David Thornalley, from University College London who led one of the new studies. He said current climate models do not replicate the observed slowdown, suggesting that Amoc is less stable that thought.
During the last ice age, some big changes in Amoc led to winter temperatures changing by 5-10C in as short a time as one to three years, with major consequences for the weather over the land masses bordering the Atlantic. “The [current] climate models don’t predict [an Amoc shutdown] is going to happen in the future – the problem is how certain are we it is not going to happen? It is one of these tipping points that is relatively low probability, but high impact.”
The study by Thornalley and colleagues, published in Nature, used cores of sediments from a key site off Cape Hatteras in North Carolina to examine Amoc over the last 1600 years. Larger grains of sediment reflect faster Amoc currents and vice versa.
They also used the shells of tiny marine creatures from sites across the Atlantic to measure a characteristic pattern of temperatures that indicate the strength of Amoc. When it weakens, a large area of ocean around Iceland cools, as less warm water is brought north, and the waters off the east coast of the US get warmer. 
The second study, also published in Nature, also used the characteristic pattern of temperatures, but assessed this using thermometer data collected over the last 120 years or so.
Both studies found that Amoc today is about 15% weaker than 1,600 years ago, but there were also differences in their conclusions. The first study found significant Amoc weakening after the end of the little ice age in about 1850, the result of natural climate variability, with further weakening caused later by global warming. 
The second study suggests most of the weakening came later, and can be squarely blamed on the burning of fossil fuels. Further research is now being undertaken to understand the reasons for the differences. 
However, it is already clear that human-caused climate change will continue to slow Amoc, with potentially severe consequences. “If we do not rapidly stop global warming, we must expect a further long-term slowdown of the Atlantic overturning,” said Alexander Robinson, at the University of Madrid, and one of the team that conducted the second study. He warned: “We are only beginning to understand the consequences of this unprecedented process – but they might be disruptive.”
A 2004 disaster movie, The Day After Tomorrow, envisaged a rapid shutdown of Amoc and a devastating freeze. The basics of the science were portrayed correctly, said Thornalley: “Obviously it was exaggerated – the changes happened in a few days or weeks and were much more extreme. But it is true that in the past this weakening of Amoc happened very rapidly and caused big changes.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/11/critical-gulf-stream-current-weakest-for-1600-years-research-finds

The Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) has announced it aims to launch a satellite called MethaneSAT by 2021 to scan the globe and make major leaks public. That information will then enable governments to force action, EDF hopes. Building and launching the satellite will cost tens of millions of dollars, but EDF says it has already raised most of the money.
Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, 80 times more powerful than carbon dioxide in the short term, and is responsible for about a fifth of human-caused climate change. The oil and gas industry is to blame for about a third of anthropogenic methane emissions, from fracking and other exploration sites, and from leaky pipelines.
“Cutting methane emissions from the global oil and gas industry is the single fastest thing we can do to help put the brakes on climate change right now,” said Fred Krupp, EDF president. Only 3% of oil and gas companies currently report quantitative methane emissions, according to EDF. “By providing reliable, fully transparent data on a worldwide scale, MethaneSAT will help transform a serious climate threat into a crucial opportunity,” he said.
Plugging methane leaks is widely seen as a fast, cheap way to tackle climate change. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates half of the gas leaks could be stopped at zero cost, because the cost of doing so is offset by the value of the extra gas captured and then sold. But currently public information about the leaks is scarce and near-absent in regions where scrutiny is unwelcome. 
“Our analysis has consistently emphasised that an effective response to the problem of methane emissions requires good data,” said Fatih Birol, IEA executive director. “This announcement is a major step forward.”
“To help companies and countries cut these emissions faster, we need better data that will enable quick, cost effective action,” said Erik Solheim, head of UN Environment. “The MethaneSAT project will help fill this gap, and make us that much smarter as we tackle this threat.”
EDF has hiredTom Ingersoll, an aerospace veteran and entrepreneur. “Advances in space technology have put satellite projects within reach of any organisation with the focus and the will,” he said. EDF has also partnered with Harvard University and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory to plan the mission.
Peter Platzer, chief executive of Spire Global, a satellite company that is not involved with the MethaneSAT project, told the New York Times: “I think this is entirely feasible.”
Some existing government-run satellites do measure methane, but not at high enough resolution to identify specific sites clearly. MethaneSAT is intended to provide a new level of precision and to regularly monitor about 50 major oil and gas regions, accounting for more than 80% of global production. Cattle and other livestock are also big methane emitters as they digest their fodder and EDF says the new satellite will be able to measure emissions from feedlots.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/12/new-satellite-to-spot-planet-warming-industrial-methane-leaks

Out of the roughly 8 million research scientists on Earth, the websites run by so-called climate sceptics constantly quote the same handful of scientists, because they don't have anyone else.
Most of their handful are retired - and are connected to various right-wing political 'think-tanks' in the USA, and/or various fringe eccentric religious organisations.
In addition, not one professional scientific organisation on Earth agrees with the so-called climate sceptics, not in any country, nor in any field of science.
Please try to read actual scientific sources.
Recently I've been suggesting that people read this new document from the Royal Society:
https://royalsociety.org/~/media/policy/Publications/2017/27-11-2017-Climate-change-updates-report.pdf
It's a full survey of the current state of research into key areas of climate science.
The RS is the UK's senior scientific organisation, and the oldest organisation of scientists in the world (founded in the 1660s)
The document was prepared by a team of very-experienced researchers; it's an excellent way to see where we are in this matter right now.

The last decade has produced record-breaking heat waves in many parts of the world. At the same time, it was globally the warmest since sufficient measurements started in the 19th century. Here we show that, worldwide, the number of local record-breaking monthly temperature extremes is now on average five times larger than expected in a climate with no long-term warming. This implies that on average there is an 80 % chance that a new monthly heat record is due to climatic change.

Two papers in Nature, by Caesar et al.4 and Thornalley et al.5, report on past AMOC variability using different approaches. Both conclude that the modern AMOC is in an unusually subdued state, but they diverge in the details of how and when the AMOC’s decline commenced.

European readers should be reassured that the Gulf Stream's existence is a consequence of the large-scale wind system over the North Atlantic Ocean, and of the nature of fluid motion on a rotating planet. The only way to produce an ocean circulation without a Gulf Stream is either to turn off the wind system, or to stop the Earth's rotation, or both.
Real questions exist about conceivable changes in the ocean circulation and its climate consequences. However, such discussions are not helped by hyperbole and alarmism. The occurrence of a climate state without the Gulf Stream any time soon — within tens of millions of years — has a probability of little more than zero.

Why do Democrats back him? | Sarah Meyerhoff,article,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/13/mike-pompeo-disaster-climate-change-democrats,0,"“Ignorant, dangerous, and absolutely unbelievable.” This is how Mike Pompeo, then the nominee for CIA director, described the idea that climate change threatens our nation’s security in his 2017 Senate confirmation hearings. It’s also how our generation and many to come will remember any senator who votes to confirm Pompeo as our next secretary of state.
Donald Trump’s decision to nominate Pompeo to replace the former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson signals loud and clear that he wants fossil fuel barons to continue running our government and state department. Infamous as the “congressman from Koch”, Pompeo is the top all-time recipient of Koch Industries campaign contributions; he accepted nearly $1.5m from the fossil fuel companies between 2009 and 2017. 
In exchange for these payments, he used his tenure in the House of Representatives to stymie progress on climate action, curry favors for big oil and gas, and regularly spread misinformation and lies about climate science to help pad the Koch brothers’ pocketbooks. 
There’s no doubt that Pompeo, widely recognized as a militant climate denier and “yes man” to the president, will pick up where Tillerson left off in gutting the department’s climate diplomacy programs and opening the fragile Arctic to drilling for oil and gas that humanity can’t afford to burn.
And though it seems unthinkable that any secretary of state could be worse for the planet than the former CEO of Exxon, Pompeo is even more extreme than Tillerson in his climate denialism and his opposition to the Paris climate agreement (from which Tillerson urged Trump not to withdraw). 
What’s more, as warming global temperatures spawn extreme weather events, fuel mass migration, exacerbate humanitarian crises and undercut global stability, Pompeo’s anti-Muslim and anti-woman stances, war-hawkishness, and abysmal record on human rights will further endanger billions of people who are hit first and hardest by climate impacts.
With only a few years left to avert catastrophic warming, every single vote to confirm Mr Pompeo is a vote to protect profits of big oil billionaires and destroy the lives and livelihoods of millions around the world. Yet, 66 senators voted to approve Pompeo for his current position as CIA director, including 15 Senate Democrats, the party whose members are most worried about climate change. This includes the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, centrists Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp, and supposed climate champion Sheldon Whitehouse. 
While Democratic lawmakers hit Pompeo hard on a range of foreign policy and human rights questions in Thursday’s confirmation hearing, climate change was hardly mentioned, and so far, only a handful of senators have come out publicly against Pompeo’s pending nomination.
If every Senate Democrat votes against Pompeo, we could stop him from helping Trump continue to put the interests of big oil executives over those of everyday Americans. We need a grassroots groundswell to make this happen.
Over 20,000 young people and citizens across our country have written letters to six of these Democratic senators, which we, along with Climate Hawks Vote, delivered last week to their Capitol Hill offices. Bowing to grassroots pressure, Senators Tina Smith and Brian Schatz vowed to vote against Pompeo’s confirmation at a Wednesday rally alongside Senator Bernie Sanders and activists from MoveOn, Win Without War, J Street, Indivisible, Sunrise and many other ally organizations. 
Ahead of Pompeo’s confirmation vote, young Sunrise leaders across the country are stepping up the pressure on their senators, imploring them to stand by their values and with our generation.
Our efforts will continue long after Pompeo’s nomination battle. To politicians claiming to care about our generation – blocking the Koch Brothers’ most loyal lapdog is a bare minimum. Right now, we’re building an army of young people to end the corrupting influence of fossil fuel executives on our politics, and elect leaders who stand up for the health and wellbeing of all people. 
In schools, houses of worship, small towns, and big cities across the country, young people are mobilizing by the thousands to make climate action an urgent priority and unseat politicians who accept donations from fossil fuel executives.
From big oil to the NRA, young people in this country are tired of the failed politics that have sold out our futures for short-term profits. An overwhelming 80% of millennials support moving to mostly clean and renewable energy by 2030, and we know that we can make the jump while creating millions of good jobs and a brighter tomorrow for all Americans in the process. If our elected officials refuse to recognize this momentum and take action to protect our rights and lives, then we will replace them with leaders who will.

The alert follows the revelation this week that the system is at its weakest ever recorded.
Past collapses of the giant network have seen some of the most extreme impacts in climate history, with western Europe particularly vulnerable to a descent into freezing winters. A significantly weakened system is also likely to cause more severe storms in Europe, faster sea level rise on the east coast of the US and increasing drought in the Sahel in Africa. 
The new research worries scientists because of the huge impact global warming has already had on the currents and the unpredictability of a future “tipping point”. 
The currents that bring warm Atlantic water northwards towards the pole, where they cool, sink and return southwards, is the most significant control on northern hemisphere climate outside the atmosphere. But the system, formally called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Amoc), has weakened by 15% since 1950, thanks to melting Greenland ice and ocean warming making sea water less dense and more buoyant.
This represents a massive slowdown – equivalent to halting all the world’s rivers three times over, or stopping the greatest river, the Amazon, 15 times. Such weakening has not been seen in at least the last 1,600 years, which is as far back as researchers have analysed so far. Furthermore, the new analyses show the weakening is accelerating.
“From the study of past climate, we know changes in the Amoc have been some of the most abrupt and impactful events in the history of climate,” said Prof Stefan Rahmstorf, at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany and one of the world’s leading oceanographers, who led some of the new research. During the last Ice Age, winter temperatures changed by up to 10C within three years in some places.
“We are dealing with a system that in some aspects is highly non-linear, so fiddling with it is very dangerous, because you may well trigger some surprises,” he said. “I wish I knew where this critical tipping point is, but that is unfortunately just what we don’t know. We should avoid disrupting the Amoc at all costs. It is one more reason why we should stop global warming as soon as possible.”
Oceanographer Peter Spooner, at University College London, shares the concern: “The extent of the changes we have discovered comes as a surprise to many, including myself, and points to significant changes in the future.”
A collapse in the Amoc would mean far less heat reaching western Europe and plunge the region into very severe winters, the kind of scenario depicted in an extreme fashion in the movie The Day After Tomorrow. A widespread collapse of deep-sea ecosystems has also been seen in the past. 
But as the Amoc weakens, it might actually increase summer heatwaves. That is because it takes time for the cooling of the northern waters to also cause cooling over the adjacent lands. However, the cooler waters affect the atmosphere in a way that helps warm air to flood into Europe from the south, a situation already seen in 2015.
Other new research this week showed that Greenland’s massive ice cap is melting at the fastest rate for at least 450 years. This influx will continue to weaken the Amoc into the future until human-caused climate change is halted, but scientists do not not know how fast the weakening will be or when it reaches the point of collapse.
“Many people have tried to check that with computer models,” said Rahmstorf. “But they differ a lot because it depends on a very subtle balance of density – that is temperature and salinity distribution in the ocean. We are not able to model this with any confidence right now.”
“We are hoping to somehow make some headway, but I have been in this area for more than 20 years now and we still don’t understand why the models differ so much in the sensitivity of the Amoc,” he said. 
However, Rahmstorf said the international climate deal agreed in 2015 offers some hope if its ambition is increased and achieved: “If we can keep the temperature rise to well below 2C as agreed in the Paris agreement, I think we run a small risk of crossing this collapse tipping point.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/13/avoid-at-all-costs-gulf-streams-record-weakening-prompts-warnings-global-warming

Shipping companies will halve their greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 under the plan, brokered by the International Maritime Organization and binding across its 170 member states.
The agreement will require a revolution among ships, which are overwhelmingly fuelled by heavy oils at present. In future, they will have to not only be more energy-efficient, but also make use of cleaner energy, in the form of batteries supplying electricity, solar and wind electricity generation, and perhaps even a return to sail in some cases, or more controversially to nuclear power, as some warships already use.
Environmental campaigners said the plan was not enough given the urgency of tackling climate change, though they welcomed the deal, which has taken decades of work. Greenhouse gas emissions from shipping and aviation were omitted from the 1997 Kyoto protocol and have been excluded from regulations on carbon ever since, even though shipping is used for 80% of global trade.
Although shipping accounts for only about 2% of global carbon emissions, it has been a cause of particular concern, both because of the increased need for transport under the globalising economy and because many ships use dirty, carbon-rich fuels such as heavy diesel, which would be banned in many countries from onshore transport.
Campaigners said cuts of at least 70% from shipping emissions by 2050, compared with the 2008 baseline chosen by the IMO, would be needed to meet the aims of the landmark 2015 Paris agreement, under which countries have agreed that temperature rises should be limited to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels.
John Maggs, president of the Clean Shipping Coalition and senior policy adviser at the campaigning group Seas at Risk, said: “We have an important agreement and this level of ambition will ultimately require a sector-wide shift to new fuels and propulsion technologies. But what happens next is crucial. The IMO must move swiftly to introduce measures that will cut emissions deeply and quickly in the short term – without these, the goals of the Paris agreement will remain out of reach.”
Sveinung Oftedal, chair of the negotiations at the IMO for the Norwegian government, compared the achievement to the space race, saying: “Like Apollo 11 returning to Earth, we knew we needed to land and we did.”
Countries holding out against a stronger agreement included Brazil, Panama, Saudi Arabia and the US, according to Bill Hemmings, shipping director at Transport &amp; Environment, an NGO. The EU and many Pacific islands were among those pressing for a stronger deal.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/13/carbon-dioxide-from-ships-at-sea-to-be-regulated-for-first-time

This spring, they are not expecting to harvest their open-field crop until the last week of April – a week later than the official start of the season, St George’s Day, 23 April. Welcome to just one of the consequences of Britain’s disastrously delayed spring.
“We have had a very challenging time,” said Guy Smith, vice president of the National Farmers’ Union (NFU). “March breezed in with the ‘beast from the east’ and went out with the worst bank holiday on record.” For asparagus-lovers there is at least an upside. “The combination has to be right for the crowns to push through,” explained Per Hogberg, of grower Wealmoor. “The air temperature has to be at least 12C, while the soil temperature should be between 8C and 10C. With warmer weather expected, consumers can expect a bumper crop in mid-May,” he said.
It is not just asparagus growers praying for a warm, dry spell. The earlier farmers can sow, the more chance their crops have to achieve their potential. “My father was a farmer and one of his sayings was ‘a peck of dust in March was worth a king’s ransom’,” Smith said. “If the ground is nice and friable and makes a good seed-bed then it can be potentially quite lucrative for the farmer. Well, that’s gone this year.”
Farmers griping about the weather goes with the job. But Smith fears something is happening to Britain’s weather that has consequences which stretch far beyond farming.
“We farm in north-east Essex, in the driest spot in the British Isles, and so we’re keen observers of the British weather. More often now we seem to be stuck in long periods of wet months and then long periods of dry months, which is more challenging for farmers.”
Adam Lockwood grows spring onions in the Vale of Evesham in Worcestershire. “At the minute we’re struggling to get going,” he said. “Potato growers haven’t even started planting yet and drilling dates are well behind where they should be.
“We’re lucky in one sense that what we’re doing is all seed. I can buy seed and put it in a shed and it doesn’t matter, but lettuce and brassica growers who have plants raised in a nursery that were ready weeks ago, they’re now having to throw those away.”
Like Smith, Lockwood thinks that the climate is changing. “We’re getting more rain in a shorter period rather than evenly distributed across the year – that’s what I’m noticing. And you’re getting more intense dry periods. It’s more extreme.”
Livestock and dairy producers have been particularly hard hit. “It’s been a very late spring, even for a hill farm where we are,” said Richard Findlay, chair of the NFU’s livestock board, who farms in the North York Moors National Park.
“Instead of keeping the sheep in a couple of days after they’ve had lambs, we’re keeping them in for two or three weeks. We’re very fortunate in that we have the buildings to do it, but a lot of neighbours who don’t are struggling and have had many more losses.
“We have nearly 1,000 sheep and it’s costing us about £1,000 extra a week at the moment to feed and house them to avoid a lot of losses. If we turned them out in poor weather there would be very little grass to eat.”
Findlay believes that it will be farmers who end up absorbing the extra costs, rather than consumers. But this puts them at the mercy of the markets, and poor prices for their lambs later in the year could see some producers call it a day. “It’s been the worst and most challenging time that I can remember,” Findlay said. “It really started last summer, which was very wet and quite cool, and the autumn and winter have generally been very wet. Sheep can stand cold weather and they can stand wet weather but when there is a prolonged period of both, it really pulls them down. We would normally expect to lose 1% of the ewe flock in this winter period and we’ve probably lost 3% to 4%, despite our best efforts.”
What the farmers are experiencing first-hand accords with what scientists are finding. Ed Hawkins, professor of climate science at NCAS-Climate, University of Reading, who helps run www.WeatherRescue.org – a site where volunteers digitise millions of historical weather observations – says that UK temperatures have risen by around 1.5 degrees in the last 150 years.
“It’s basic physics: warmer air can hold more moisture so, as the atmosphere warms, it means, when it does rain heavily, we get more rain than we would otherwise have done from the same storm 100 years ago.”
In the short term, farmers like Smith hope that the coming week’s warmer, drier conditions are going to stretch through April. In the longer term, he believes that the first three months of 2018 should sound alarm bells.
“We need to remember that it’s reckless to take food production for granted,” he said.
Growers say their crops will not be ready until the end of the month, almost three weeks late.
Many growers have yet to plant.
Seeds which should have been sown back in February yet to go in.
Stocks have been kept indoors for weeks, meaning higher fodder prices and possible price rises for consumers.

One of the most pressing challenges facing smaller Commonwealth governments is the impact of climate change, and the rising debt burden we face as a result.
The 2017 hurricane season was one of the most devastating in Caribbean history. In Barbuda and Dominica destruction totalled more than twice annual GDP. The growing severity of hurricanes in the Caribbean is related to climate change, a major global threat primarily caused by countries far richer and larger than our own.
In the wake of increasingly frequent and devastating disasters, and in the absence of sufficient grants to support climate mitigation and adaption and sustainable development, small islands have no choice but to resort to taking on more debt. Yet many already have large debts as a result of past disasters and injustices, loss of trade preferences, and exclusion from debt relief schemes, while our small size makes us more vulnerable to economic shocks such as global financial crises.
As climate change gets worse, we urgently need a new system for fast and effective debt relief when disasters hit. We should not have to bear these extra costs ourselves through climate risk insurance. We call on larger Commonwealth countries, including the UK, to play a leading role in the creation of such a system. Those who have contributed the most to climate change are the real debtors and it is, therefore, unfair that small island developing states, which are most vulnerable, like those in the Caribbean, be indebted as a result.
We look forward to this meeting resulting in a bold decision to address the issues raised above, in the best interests of all.Keith Mitchell Prime minister of Grenada Gaston Browne Prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda 
• Heads of government from the 53 nations of the Commonwealth arrive in London on Monday for their biennial meeting. The official meeting website says that they will “agree how to … create a better future for all our citizens”. But this commitment rings hollow to the millions of LGBT+ people who live in the 37 Commonwealth countries where homosexuality is illegal. For every one of these countries with an anti-gay law, lives are on the line: a lesbian in Sri Lanka who can’t go to the police when she’s attacked; a gay man in Nigeria behind bars just for being who he is; the activists who organise Pride Uganda denied the right to peaceful freedom of assembly and arrested and beaten by police.
Many Commonwealth leaders shamelessly scapegoat LGBT+ people for domestic political advantage. They often exploit the false narrative that homosexuality is a “western import” and argue that for this reason it must be eradicated. With the UK hosting this year’s meeting, we want to put the record straight. It is not homosexuality that is a western import, but homophobia. Most of the laws used to criminalise and persecute innocent LGBT+ citizens across these Commonwealth countries are British exports. This is colonial-era legislation, often unamended, that has been retained since Commonwealth countries became independent. The UK must accept that these laws are one more damning indictment of Britain’s colonial past. All Out and other Commonwealth organisations have come together to demand action. Through our petition we are calling on the UK to use this week’s meeting in London to acknowledge that most homophobic laws across the Commonwealth came from Britain, and to apologise to the millions of LGBT+ citizens of these countries who still suffer under these laws. An apology will clear the legacy of the past and expose the direct responsibility of today’s Commonwealth leaders for the human rights violations they commit against LGBT+ people in their countries.
There is no plan to discuss LGBT+ rights at this week’s meeting. But if the leaders gathering in London and Windsor want the Commonwealth to be recognised as a credible 21st-century global body, they must include an open and frank discussion of anti-LGBT law decriminalisation on their agenda. It is no longer acceptable that love is illegal for millions of Commonwealth citizens. It’s time to fix it.Aderonke Apata Founder, African Rainbow FamilyMatt Beard Executive director, All OutFriedel Dausab Executive director, Out-Right (Namibia)Jaz Dawson Secretary and director, Kaleidoscope Human Rights Foundation (Australia)Rosanna Flamer Executive director, Equal Ground (Sri Lanka)Dr Qasim Iqbal NAZ PakistanIsaac Mugisha Spectrum Uganda InitiativesAkudo Oguaghamba Executive director, Women’s Health and Equal Rights (Nigeria)Leow Yangfa Executive director, Oogachaga (Singapore)

You then link to a study suggesting that volcanic ash contributed to ice sheet melting for 800 years near the end of the last 10,000 years of the last deglaciation. The webpage article you linked to uses the present tense when the past tense is more appropriate to something which occurred 12,000 to 13,000 years ago, and has the title which you reproduce of ""Volcanic Eruptions May Be Rapidly Melting Arctic Ice Sheet, Study Says"". The study describes enhanced melting due to albedo decrease caused by volcanic ash from Icelandic volcanoes impacting on the Fennoscandian ice sheet (Finland, Norway and Sweden) near the end of the last deglaciation.
Your other link is to a Guardian article from last year about the discovery of 90 previously unknown volcanoes underneath the west Antarctic icesheet using ice penetrating radar. In this article Robert Bingham points out that ""The most volcanism that is going on in the world at present is in regions that have only recently lost their glacial covering after the end of the last ice age. These places include Iceland and Alaska. ""
""Theory suggests that this is occurring because., without ice on top of them, there is a release of pressure on regions volcanoes and they become active.""
The article then goes on to say ""And this could happen in west Antarctica, where significant warming in the region caused by climate change has begun to affect the ice sheets. If they are reduced significantly, this could release pressure on the volcanoes that lie below and lead to eruptions that could further destabilise the ice sheets and enhance sea level rises that are already affecting our oceans.
Note that current the level of volcanic activity beneath the west Antarctic Ice Sheet is only producing a small amount of heat compared to the much larger amount of heat coming from the now much warmer Southern Ocean where glaciers are grounded at often considerable depth below sea level. While the volcanism may be a hotter source, the much larger area of the only slightly warmer ocean in contact with the the glaciers provides a greater heat flux.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1523947685000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'volcanic ash from icelandic volcanoes impacting on the fennoscandian ice sheet', u'effect': u'albedo decrease'}, {u'cause': u'albedo decrease caused by volcanic ash from icelandic volcanoes impacting on the fennoscandian ice sheet', u'effect': u'the study describes enhanced melting'}, {u'cause': u'climate change', u'effect': u'the region'}, {u'cause': None, u'effect': u'eruptions that could further destabilise the ice sheets and enhance sea level rises that are already affecting our oceans'}], u'author_id': u'12483673', u'in_reply_to': u'114768463', u'id': u'114809792', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Harry Snape', u'text': u'Perhaps we should not bother fixing up transport systems using current technology, after all flying cars have been postulated for decades, there are even some terrible prototypes that work rather intermittently ...

This process is how nearly all the world's hydrogen is produced principally as a precursor for fertiliser manufacture. The hydrogen is either run through a gas turbine or a fuel cell to generate electricity with only water vapour as the exhaust.The CO2 waste is then forced through seawater to which ammonia has been added.The ammonia having already weakened the NaCl bond allows the carbon to further break the bond and form a precipitate of sodium carbonate - a saleable product.

The size allows us to build renewable generation in geographically dispersed areas, the dispersal gives a lot of variation in wind and solar capacity.

Simple civil engineering of the type used on nearly every Australian farm (I assume the German hydro plants were probably in mountainous regions with high build costs due to dam construction etc).
ANU calculations give the LCOE of a wind/solar and PHS solution at around $75/MWh which is cheaper than new coal at $80 to $130. And far cheaper than nuclear based on build and operational costs.
The size of the country does give us challenges so the ANU costed model includes a new HVDC line along the east coast and across the south coast to include SA - so this includes the SA coast in the Great Australia Bight - one of the windier places in the world.

Look at Sydney, for instance. A massive fire in the vicinity of Holsworthy Military Camp should be a wake-up call.
Do readers know that the NSW Rural Fire Service had a massive hazard reduction burn planned for the Holsworthy Military Area last Saturay commencing at 9 am? In view of articles I have read since the latest fire emergency began, concerning weather conditions and the fire risk existing in that bushland, how was it possible such a massive operation was planned anyway? 
The period during which hazard reduction burns can be attempted safely has clearly shrunk. 
How prepared is the Department of Defence to fight bushfires on their land? Have they learnt anything from another fire emergency that started on Defence land in the Lithgow area more than a year ago? Was there an enquiry into that fire and if so, what were its recommendations? How well are Defence personnel equipped and trained, both to prevent fire emergencies on their own land and to assist fighting wildfires elsewhere? Are there further plans to build housing on land that is part of or abuts the Holsworthy Military Area or heavily wooded areas along the Georges River?
The combination of climate change and massive areas of forest and woodland that surround and adjoin Sydney suburbs should ring alarm bells. In particular, the trend for approving new housing development in heavily wooded areas (Wedderburn is another high risk area) should be resisted.

Far from addressing the environmental, reliability and cost issues surrounding the National Electricity Market, it risks making each of them worse.
This is the substance of the more than 100 submissions from the industry itself from network owners, from retailers large and small, from renewable energy developers, battery and pumped hydro storage developers, software developers, and engineers.
To broadly summarise:
*It will be worse than doing nothing. Several studies now point to the fact that on current policies, Australia will reach around 40 per cent renewables by 2040. The NEG seeks to cap this at 36 per cent by locking in an emissions target that is less than business as usual.
*It is based around the assumption that the electricity industry’s emissions reduction target for 2030 should be 26 per cent. Yet new analysis has shown that emissions will fall by 29 per cent if there are no policy changes. So the NEG seeks to be worse than doing nothing.
*It will lift prices rather than reduce them. For all the modelling that has been done on theoretically pass through mechanisms, there is one simple observation made by everyone – all the way from the ACCC, the networks, the small and medium-sized retailers and others: this design could kill competition. And that means higher prices. Full stop.
*It is too complex. By trying to be something for everyone, particularly to the incumbents, and in trying to pretend that this won’t be some sort of carbon price, the designers have produced a plan of such complexity to be effectively unworkable.
*The reliability guarantee makes no sense. The ESB haven’t even gotten around to spelling out the meaning of reliability, what technology will count towards it, and what won’t. Nor has it said how this can be managed.
*It doesn’t actually address the problem. Frydenberg and Turnbull argue that the NEG is essential to delivering reliability. But as AEMO point out in their latest briefing, the NEG only addresses part of the problem. The rest must come from market design.

A new 12-page discussion paper obtained by Guardian Australia addressing the emissions reduction architecture of the national energy guarantee (Neg) suggests the government is yet to make a decision about whether domestic or international emissions offsets are in or out.
Business has long supported the use of carbon credits as a low-cost means of reducing emissions, but the former prime minister Tony Abbott has styled himself as a fierce opponent, arguing offsets are a form of carbon trading where “Aussie consumers end up shovell­ing our money to foreign carbon traders – and we all know the ­potential for rorts there”.
Despite the lack of clarity both on the use of offsets and the treatment of Australia’s emissions intensive trade-exposed (EITE) activities, the commonwealth is pushing the states and territories to sign off on further work on the Neg when energy ministers meet this Friday.
Some of the jurisdictions were surprised to learn late last week that the Turnbull government would circulate its own paper on the emissions reduction elements of the Neg in the lead-up to the meeting, in addition to technical work supplied by the Energy Security Board.
The Energy Security Board has provided all jurisdictions with a 54-page document outlining the technical design of the new scheme and the mechanisms that will be deployed under the Neg, a policy that would impose a reliability obligation and an emissions reduction requirement on energy retailers and a small number of large electricity users from 2020.
The new commonwealth paper confirms the emissions reduction target for electricity in the proposed Neg will be a 26% reduction on 2005 levels by 2030, despite a new outbreak of internal restiveness on energy policy in which some Coalition backbenchers are arguing they have not signed off on that specific target.
The paper doesn’t make clear how the trajectory will be determined for emissions reduction, but it suggests the initial target will apply for 10 years, before being adjusted every five years “aligning with [the government’s] domestic policy review and refine cycle, and the five-yearly review under the Paris agreement”.
The government is not clear whether external offsets can be used by participants to help them comply with the emissions reduction obligation at least cost. It notes that some stakeholders have raised concerns about the quality of international units.
The paper says the commonwealth “is continuing to consider whether retailers should be able to use external offsets”.
“The government’s position is that if offsets were eligible, it should be in a manner that provides the greatest investment certainty, is technology neutral, helps address small compliance shortfalls and reduces market imbalances.”
The government is, however, clear that more ambitious emissions reduction activities undertaken by state and territory governments through their renewable energy schemes will not ultimately boost the federal target. Several jurisdictions have expressed concern about the Neg on the basis of the low-ball 26% cut.
The paper says: “Where states and territories pursued their own renewable energy targets, such as to achieve investment or employment policy objectives, this would not change the target under the guarantee.”
The discussion paper also makes it clear the government hasn’t yet resolved how to treat EITE activities.
The paper indicates the government is inclined to exempt EITE activities from the emissions requirement under the Neg, as it did under the renewable energy target, but the mechanism for doing it is not yet resolved.
The government has been warned by electricity generators that if retailers are able to remove EITE customers’ load from their emissions obligation, then it could unbalance the Neg. The discussion paper says the government will “carefully consider the issues raised by stakeholders in the design process”.
The chair of the Energy Security Board, Kerry Schott, has written to all ministers urging them to come to the table on Friday. “Providing long-term policy confidence and stability is critical to lowering investment risk in the national energy market and bringing down electricity prices,” her letter says.
 Schott says the Neg will encourage investment in a least-cost portfolio of energy technologies and demand response that is both dispatchable and low-emitting.
 She says the policy is technology-neutral and insists it is not a new trading scheme. 
“The guarantee will use existing mechanisms for the purchase of electricity by market participants,” she says. “Electricity companies already buy electricity from each other to meet their requirements.”
The coming week is critical for the fate of the Neg because any single jurisdiction has the power to break the concept. Changes to the national electricity market rules require consensus between the commonwealth and the states.
While the federal energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, is confident he can get his colleagues over the line, Labor governments in the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria and Queensland are yet to signal public support.
Federal Labor is also yet to signal bipartisan support, and is highly unlikely to sign up if it doesn’t have flexibility to increase the ambition of emissions reduction in the scheme.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/16/coalition-considers-letting-power-companies-buy-offsets-to-cut-emissions

BQENDThis is an unsubstantiated claim
Taking the concrete example of South Australia, which is blessed with a geographical location favourable to persistent strong winds. A very extensive array of windmills has been installed. Electricity in the state is now the most expensive in Australia. But it is also unreliable, because insufficient attention was given to complementary development of infrastructure including storage. As a result, considerable further expenditure is now required in order to increase the reliability of what was already done. This will not actually make the electricity cheaper
Tumbling. Great sound byte.
A unit of energy from a windmill is cheap, so long as you have no requirement that it should be available at a particular time. Similarly a unit of energy from a solar panel. Those with a superficial understanding, and/or with a vested interest, of course like to claim the cost of the opportunistic unit of energy is representative of the genuine system cost. Clearly it is not. For example, South Australia, without hydro that can compensate, without the willingness to pay for hot standby capacity, and with no other reliable base load capable of meeting the State’s full demand, is now staring at how much it will cost to bring their overall electricity generation and distribution up to scratch.

We grow cherries here on the high plateau near the border with New South Wales. Bumble Bees and Honey Bees are not native to Australia but are important as feral and domesticated species in the pollination of crops and the production of honey. Domesticated honey bee hives are placed in fields, orchards and native forests and woodlands to produce a wide variety of different honeys. I particularly like the eucalypt honeys from Western Australia but recurrent drought and unseasonal rains have made them a rare commodity in the east. The main native pollinators of eucalypts and Melaleucas are flying foxes, honeyeaters and lorikeets.
There are native bees which build hives in tree hollows and rock crevices. They have the added advantage of being stingless but don't produce large quantities of honey. Their honey also contains large amounts of pollen which can present allergy concerns but adds to the taste. Their cones are made of resin rather than wax.https://www.aussiebee.com.au/beesinyourarea.html
Our honey bees are free of many of the hive pests found in other countries such as Vorrea mites. Sentinel hives were installed around the Port of Brisbane after a Vorrea infected hive was found on imported mining equipment.
I used to work in the salt marsh and mangroves around the Port controlling disease carrying mosquitoes using bacteria. Sometimes that involved advising local politicians. By talking to those who know what they're talking about did those politicians become the elite. I would be bloody stupid if politician didn't seek out the advice of those who know what they're talking about, but in the extreme right wing sections of the Liberal National Party, when it comes to climate change, that's exactly whats happening.

Another thing that has not happened.
The science behind AGW is based on ordinary physics and chemistry established 150+ years ago. The logical argument and chain of consequences is really simple and unarguable except by those who for some reason want to be contrarians.
The properties of CO2 as a GHG are well established. Its properties are good enough to allow IR heat seeking missiles to work, and the military-industrial establishment have demonstrated this repeatedly, and would be most upset if their scientists were wrong and their products did not work.
The fact that CO2 and other GHGs are increasing is also well established, as shown my monitoring sites globally. If we couldn't even measure the composition of our own planet's atmosphere, then I am sure chemists, astrophyisists and so on would be displeased.
The source of those GHGs is also well established via isotope analysis. I think chemists, geologists, archaeologists and many other scientific disciplines would be unhappy if our understanding of isotopes was wrong.
The results of extra GHGs which are well known, and the resulting warming from them are similarly well known. Earth scientists, biologists and others would be distressed if their basic understanding of ecological webs and their response to changing climates were wrong.
So you're asking people to believe that multiple scientific disciplines have been wrong about basic science for 150+ years, basic science that we use on an every day basis.

There was no consultatation with members regarding the Climate Change Statement.
BQEND
Nor would I expect there to be.
As a member of scientific organisations, trades unions and a council, the general membership are not consulted on every single issue. Instead the issues are decided by the leadership and whichever committee members they have devolved the issue to. This is standard practice.
The membership should only be electing leaders they agree with. The leadership should only be nominating experts to the relevant committees.

Thus, there is no measure of whether it is representative.
BQEND
Incorrect.The leadership of scientific societies are in general elected members. 
If the elected leadership make statements that the majority of the membership think are erroneous then they can vote them out next time, and replace them with leaders who accurately represent the majority of the scientific community.
That nearly every scientific society has reached the same conclusion and issued statements supporting the scientific position on AGW is a good measure that the leadership are accurate in their scientific assessments.

Incorrect.It's not a red herring, as articulated above, it should be easy for sceptics (AKA deniers) by now after decades to have engineered the take over of at least one relevant scientific society and issue a statement as to the true status of the scientific understanding of AGW.
That they haven't indicates they are a minority that lack the Consilience of Evidence(TM) to support their case.
Either that or they are just plain lazy.
This coupled with the lack of scientific papers gives the normal scientist a good indicator that the deniers are out on a limb here, and the Consensus has a Coherent theory, and Consilience of Evidence(TM).

BQENDDon’t you think that this is something of a misrepresentation? You are suggesting that nothing is being done. It’s almost like the Monty Python sketch about the Romans in the Life of Brian!
I would argue that much that is being done is misplaced, inadequately thought through, and very often the result of uneducated politicians assuaging the demands of an ignorant but panicked public. The Alarmists only exacerbate that situation.
For example, by the time that South Australia builds the infrastructure it needs to support the scale of wind farms that it has built, including energy storage, the cost and reliability is likely to be a significantly worse outcome than going nuclear.
These sorts of poor decisions, and resultant ridiculously large escalation in energy costs, have not been caused by the fossil fuel companies.They have been driven by the convictions of a small group of sadly ill-informed people. Problems with their approach were nicely covered in a draft report in 2013 that was simply buried. Exxon, BP, etc were in no way involved in that piece of political manoevering. It was a Green-oriented Labor government. So in what way is this something that can be blamed on fossil fuels, or those who supply them to meet OUR demand?

BQENDWhat you presumably mean (and as supported by the map that this blog presented a couple of articles ago), areas already suffering from disproportionate poverty today will be more susceptible to further problems in the future. It will take how long to fix climate. A couple of centuries at best?
We can deal with poverty within a generation if we were to invest in development in the way that we did for example in Australia in the early-mid 1800s, so that perhaps 4 billion Africans can more rapidly join 2 billion Indians and Chinese on the road away from abject poverty.
Thus the issue of relative priorities. Address climate by all means, but where that conflicts with addressing poverty, address the poverty FIRST. And then those suffering from poverty will be better protected from all manner of change to come.

AGW has been subjected to a phenomenal amount of scrutiny.
BQEND
Not by those who claim the consensus. Those who apply proper scientific scrutiny and scepticism are dismissed and namecalled as deniers. That is not professional scientific scrutiny.
My own experience is with one of those many national scientific bodies that claim to suport the CAGW case - of which I have been a fellow for many years. The 'position statement' was put together by a committee. We members were given no opportunity to provide comment or feedback. The statement did little more than support the IPCC position. There was no evidence of scrutiny by representatives of the organisation.
The 'catastrophic' component of CAGW is fundamental. As for most CAGW sceptics, I don't doubt climate change or global warming, or that humans make a contribution. Eg. we have created the urban heat island effect, and our removal of forests certainly impacts on local climate. The only way we can stop human influence on climate is to commit mass suicide. The issue is whether our impact is catastrophic (short or long term).', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1524140257000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'2595146', u'in_reply_to': u'114889138', u'id': u'114899150', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'ElephantofTruth', u'text': u'I note all your comments. Yes experts give their opinions but courts are not obliged to choose between experts' opinions. Judges will direct juries that in the British courts we do not have trial by expert and that the jurors must reach a decision taking account of all the evidence. Experts' opinions may or may not help them. I have heard contradictory opinions given by eminent medical experts in serious non-criminal cases. I recall a very senior judge saying that if the experts disagreed, he himself was in no position to decide whose opinion was the better.
As far as climate change is concerned, I think 'CAGW' is an unhelpful term, meaning the catastrophic bit. It allows people to say 'How big will this catastrophe be?' and then try to use the absence of a clear answer to undermine the case for AGW. I think the IPCC reports, as I gather second hand from apparently knowlegeable posters here and elsewhere, build in considerable uncertainty. Isn't this kind of uncertainty the very essence of solid science? As other posters suggest, 'proven' is not the right word. But no I don't agree with you either about gravity or AGW. They are both certain beyond reasonable doubt, although that term refers to the standard of proof in a criminal trial and seems inappropriate. I refer you to the paradigm concept, as Rocky Rex and others have often set it out here. We are in a period of normal, certain science in which details are being fleshed out, but main processes are not in any doubt at all. I don't agree that climate science has not applied scepticism to itself. Science IS scepticism, and AGW has been subjected to a phenomenal amount of scrutiny. Yes there are posters here who express themselves in florid language. That does not have much to do with sober science however. The consilience, coherence and consensus mean the science is indeed settled as some put it. We are not 'testing' anything by continuing to burn fossil fuel, we are inviting positively dangerous outcomes. The fact we don't know exactly how muuch and exactly when is a different point.

I agree, scientists would not normally be influenced by a court ruling regarding their own scientific conclusions. I also agree, there are strong parallels between Law and the scientific process. I once did an 'expert witness' training course. I learned a lot about the English Law process, and that the only witnesses in court entitled to give an opinion in place of just reporting fact, are expert witnesses. It is a very specific role. Quite often, expert witnesses (scientists and others) will give differing opinions. It is then up to the court to judge which is more plausible. This means the court must take on some judgement on scientific matters, however unqualified they may be. 
On climate change: The reality is there remains a significant amount of uncertainty. The strongest parts of the case are based on opinion rather than scientific deduction. For example, its an opinion (albeit of experts) that 'more than half of global warming over the past 50 years is manmade'. If you doubt my view, I suggest you carefully read the IPCC reports to understand the evidence that supports that statement. However, many CAGW believers are claiming the uncertainties are much smaller than they are. I believe that in court, the scale of these uncertainties will come out. Of course, defenders of CAGW will try hard to avoid discussing the uncertainties.

You seem to say ‘There was some scientific evidence in a court case, and the science swayed the court’. I am perfectly prepared to believe and accept this. I am not at all convinced that ‘The court swayed the science’ is a sound proposition, unless you had an example of that in mind, and I think perhaps that’s not what you meant. Do you say that any scientist ever modified their views on a scientific point following anything said by a judge or lawyer in legal proceedings? 
There is a simple similarity between the legal process and the scientific method in the sense of collecting evidence and proceeding by sound reasoning, transparently and reproducibly all in a way which can be examined and tested in various ways. But in the kinds of cases you mention of criminal acts, medical negligence and so on, it is not the science which is on trial. Judges and juries are considering scientific evidence as something which may or may not help them settle another matter. Although in courts expert evidence is treated differently from lay witness evidence, it is still nevertheless just like any other evidence in the case, in the sense that it can be accepted, rejected or simply ignored for want of use by the decision maker. 
If the panel, judge or jury in legal proceedings makes a choice against the case which the scientific evidence supported, science does not then revise its views about things in general. If there is conflicting expert scientific evidence about a matter in a legal case, I am not aware of instances in which the scientific community would regard the result of those proceedings as in any way a resolution of scientific disputes.

Absolutely, any councillor worth their salt will be consulting experts as no one can be expected to know everything across every subject. 
Firstly, I have packed my council with a range of experts - farmers (we are a rural community) - an estate Manager who knows commercial practice - a nerd (I'm just a humble techie) - a business man - an HR manager - a school clerk. This gives me as chairman a wide range of expertise to draw on.
Secondly, I've given free reign in our budget for the clerk and secretary to attend training courses, and councillors to attend training courses. At our last meeting on Tuesday this week, one of the councillors requested attending a course before the meeting (signed off immediately !), and another councillor who had missed a course sheepishly offered to pay the expense and attend the next one.
Thirdly, when we did our development plan we hired in consultants. 
I could not envisage operating a council that was doing anything more than the Vicar of Dibley level without trained and competent staff, councillors and consultants.
Later tonight, the entire council is going (""invited"") on a trip to the estate manager's camp for crop pickers followed by a talk on soft fruit growing methods.

Exxon is under investigation by state attorneys general, cities are suing oil companies over sea level rise costs, and Our Children’s Trust is suing the federal government for failing to protect their generation from climate change. At the heart of these legal challenges lies the question – who bears culpability for climate change and liability for its costs and consequences?
Exxon has been a prime target of these investigations and lawsuits since Inside Climate News’ investigative journalism revealed that the company’s internal climate science research warned of the dangers posed by human-caused global warming since the late 1970s.
Recently, Dutch journalist Jelmer Mommers of De Correspondent unearthed internal documents from Shell that began warning of the dangers associated with human-caused climate change 30 years ago. The company’s 1988 report titled “The Greenhouse Effect” warned,
by the time the global warming becomes detectable it could be too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even stabilise the situation.
And, particularly relevant to Our Children’s Trust’s lawsuits, Shell’s 1988 report warned of the climate consequences for future generations.
Similarly, in a 1991 film called Climate of Concern, Shell warned,
Global warming is not yet certain, but many think that to wait for final proof would be irresponsible. Action now is seen as the only safe insurance.
The case against Exxon and Shell is similar to the case against the tobacco companies – that they engaged in fraud to deceive the American public about the health effects of their products. However, the oil companies modified the tobacco playbook. Rather than directly misinform the public, they funneled money to conservative think tanks who did the dirty work as Merchants of Doubt. By both outsourcing the misinformation campaign and allowing their scientists to publish research in peer-reviewed journals – where it was available to but largely unseen by the public – the oil companies tried to buffer themselves against the legal liability that took down the tobacco industry.
The case against the fossil fuel industry largely relies on proving that these companies deceived the American public about the threats posed by consuming their products. The case against the federal government appears more straightforward. In their defense against the cities suing over sea level rise damages, the oil industry lawyers essentially argued that the blame lies not on the producers, but rather the consumers of fossil fuels, and that any economic issues should be addressed through policy rather than in the court system.
But of course, the American government has failed to implement climate policies over the past two decades. In 1998, the Senate refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. The Bush Administration censored government climate science reports and took no action to address climate change. Thanks to a Republican filibuster threat, a carbon cap and trade bill that had passed the House died in the Senate in 2009. The Obama administration finally took concrete steps to address climate change, for example by drafting the Clean Power Plan and signing the Paris climate accords, but the Trump administration has (at least temporarily) reversed all of those efforts.
In short, Our Children’s Trust is correct to allege that the American government has failed to protect the coming generations from the threats and damages of climate change.
The oil companies do make a valid point that consumers share the blame for causing climate change. The public has been aware of the climate threat for over a decade – the subject was popularized in An Inconvenient Truth in 2006. Yet 12 years later, Americans are still buying gas guzzling trucks and SUVs, while hybrid and electric vehicles account for just 3% of new car sales. 
While the electrical grid has become cleaner due to the falling costs of wind, solar, and natural gas displacing coal power plants, Americans haven’t done much to demand or spark that sort of change in other energy sectors. That would take climate policy, which most Americans (including Trump voters) support, but their support is shallow. It’s not an issue that decides votes, so policymakers aren’t pressured to take action.
The fossil fuel industry certainly bears some responsibility for having funneled tens of millions of dollars to climate-denying think tanks that have worked hard to misinform the American public. Republican Party politicians and conservative media outlets have followed their lead in helping to convey that climate misinformation. A recent study found evidence that “Americans may have formed their attitudes [on climate change] by using party elite cues” delivered via the media. The history books will not reflect well on today’s American conservatives.
However, when hybrid cars have been mass produced for over 20 years and yet 97% of new cars sold in America are still powered exclusively by inefficient, polluting, 19th Century internal combustion engine technology, Americans as a whole are also failing to do their part to curb climate change. 
There’s plenty of blame to go around for the mounting climate costs, but so far, taxpayers are footing the whole bill. There may eventually be a court case in which the fossil fuel industry, like the tobacco industry before it, is held responsible for its role in deceiving the American public about the dangers of carbon pollution. And American voters will eventually punish the Republican Party for its decades of climate denial and policy obstruction.

In a strategy published on Monday, BP said there would be no increase in its carbon footprint over the next seven years because it will cut emissions from its oil and gas rigs, and offset the rest.
The UK oil firm said it would achieve a saving of 3.5m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2025. That is equal to about 7% of its current operational emissions.
However, it still has no target for its biggest contribution to global warming, which is the burning of its main products, oil and gas, unlike rivals such as Shell.
Tom Burke, the chairman of environmental thinktank E3G and a former BP adviser, said: “Who cares about operational emissions? The problem is they have nothing to say on their product. This is a 20th century response to a 21st century problem.”
The former UK government adviser characterised the plan as “lightweight PR” and “greenwash”. He said BP had “wasted 20 years” since the former chief executive John Browne tried to reinvent the firm as Beyond Petroleum in 2000.
The criticism was echoed by Carbon Tracker, a thinktank that has analysed the risk of big oil being left with stranded assets by action on climate change, a danger that the Bank of England has also warned of.
“Improvements in BP’s operational emissions, while welcome, are too small to move the needle to prevent runaway climate change or reduce BP’s exposure to carbon risk,” Luke Sussams, the senior researcher at Carbon Tracker, said.
Bob Dudley, BP’s chief executive since 2010, said the company had ventured into clean energy too early last time.
“Some of our investments worked out – others did not. We were early but I don’t think we were wrong because we learned valuable lessons along the way,” he said.
Due to the $65bn bill the company faced in the aftermath of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster, it was only recently that it had been able to afford to move more into greener energy, he said. 
“I think it’s only been the last year or so that financially can we go into it deeper,” he said.
He said the company’s low-carbon plan rests on cutting its own emissions, helping customers cut theirs and growing green energy businesses.
Lord Browne, who led BP between 1995 and 2007, said the strategy was a “great reset for BP” and because of Deepwater Horizon it was understandable that clean energy had not been a recent focus for the firm. 
“There’s only so many things you can focus on at once at a company,” he said.
As part of its emissions target, BP pledged to hold leaks of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, to today’s levels, even as it targets more “leaky” production, such as shale in the US.

At the very least, it must mean having a firm plan in place to deliver your nation’s fair share of the Paris agreement. During that stunning fortnight in December 2015, 195 governments freely and willingly committed not only to keep global warming well below 2C, but to aim for the safer level of 1.5C. And they committed to bring net greenhouse gas emissions down to zero.
I cannot help but feel huge pride that my government was the first in the western world to step up and deliver on the Paris agreement. In June last year, we adopted a target of cutting Sweden’s net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2045, and we set it in law. Within a generation, Sweden will not be contributing to the problem of climate change. Science tells us that if all nations adopt this target, there is a good chance that we will live up to the commitments that we made at the Paris summit, and keep climate change within safe boundaries.
Our law does not only set an emissions target and a date. Every year the government must present a progress report to parliament, and every four years it must make a new set of policies that deliver ever-greater emission cuts. This way we will ensure that we will make steady progress towards our net-zero target.
For these ingredients of our law, we owe the UK a debt of gratitude. Ten years ago, the UK brought in the first law in the world that set a legally binding target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Sweden borrowed heavily from the UK Climate Change Act in drawing up our own, as have other countries such as Denmark and Finland.
Climate laws deliver something that in a healthy democracy is invaluable for businesses and citizens: certainty. Our companies know that fossil fuels will be virtually eliminated over the next 25 years; coal has already gone, and oil and gas will follow. Certainty helps citizens, companies, investors and the government itself to make better decisions. For example, it is clearly good sense that all new houses are built so as to waste very little energy, so eliminating the need for more expensive retro-fitting in a decade’s time.
A number of other countries have stepped up since the Paris summit by committing to net zero emissions targets by 2040 or 2050. They include France, Iceland and New Zealand – but also some developing nations such as Costa Rica and Bhutan. Driven by a progressive alliance including Sweden and the UK, the European Union is heading in the same direction. The EU parliament has already voted for a net zero target, and the commission is updating its energy and climate roadmap in line with the Paris agreement – a process which will inevitably recommend a net zero target for the EU with a target date no later than 2050.
More nations will inevitably follow later this year. In October the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will publish a landmark report which is expected to confirm that the world will need to be at net zero emissions by mid-century in order to deliver on the Paris agreement. Those countries where finance and modern technology are more available will naturally be expected to take the lead in getting there. The IPCC is an intergovernmental body – so at that point, it will clearly be untenable for any western government that does not have a net zero target with an appropriate date and a means of delivering it to claim to be a “climate leader”.
Meeting a net zero target will not be easy for all sectors of the economy. We know how to do it for electricity, heating and road transport; for others such as agriculture and aviation it will be more challenging. Here, we must trust to innovation, the speed of which continues to amaze. And we can accelerate changes in these sectors with specific financial instruments such as the aviation tax that Sweden introduced this month.
Certainly it is not acceptable for any government or statutory adviser to say that net zero cannot be done. It has to be done – because as long as we continue emitting carbon dioxide, temperatures will continue to rise. Claiming that net zero is impossible would mean giving up on the imperative of halting climate change; accepting that we will never hold back the tide of rising sea levels, failing food supplies, species extinctions and an acidifying ocean. That is not a world that I can bequeath to my children and grandchildren; nor, I believe, can any responsible leader.
Ten years ago, the UK won the gratitude of many other nations, including my own, by adopting the Climate Change Act. But science and diplomacy move on; and when the IPCC and the Paris agreement are telling us that greenhouse gas emissions need to reach net zero by mid-century, it is incumbent on us all to reflect that in our national programmes. That, at the very least, is what it means in 2018 to be a “climate leader”.

The announcement by clean growth minister Claire Perry during the Commonwealth heads of government meeting (Chogm) raises the possibility the UK could implement a target to reduce emissions to “net zero” by 2050, tightening the existing goal to cut greenhouse gases by 80% by that date.
Such a target would require more stringent cuts to carbon in the short as well as long term, and a much faster transformation of key parts of the economy – including energy, transport, industry and housing – than has yet been contemplated. The government’s statutory advisers would be expected to set out key choices on how this could be achieved. 
Under the global Paris agreement, countries have committed to curbing temperature rises to “well below” 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to keep them to 1.5C, to prevent dangerous climate change. 
Such a move will require the world to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero in the second half of the century. The UK government pledged in 2016 to enshrine a zero target in law, but has not yet passed any legislation. 
After a global scientific review of the impacts of, and action needed to keep to, a 1.5C rise is published this autumn, the UK’s climate advisers will be asked to review the country’s 2050 target, Perry said in a speech on Tuesday. 
After the report, she said: “We will be seeking the advice of the UK’s independent advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, on the implications of the Paris agreement for the UK’s long-term emissions reduction targets.” 
The committee recently suggested the UK would have to meet the net-zero target by 2045-50 in order to do its bit to ensure global temperature rises do not exceed 1.5C.
A temperature rise of 1.5C is seen by some countries, such as low lying islands at risk of rising sea levels, as the limit beyond which their very existence is threatened. 
Laurence Tubiana, a key architect of the Paris agreement and chief executive of the European Climate Foundation, said: “For a safe climate we need all governments to aim for cutting pollution to net zero levels by 2050. 
“This decision to review Britain’s long-term climate target sends a strong message to the EU and other big economies that London is committed to the Paris agreement, and now it’s time they too considered what more they can do.” 
Ways of meeting the net-zero target could include investing in projects to grow trees and restore soils, to take up greater carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, as well as more controversial measures such as investing in emissions reduction projects overseas. Even with such methods, the UK is likely to have to bring forward targets on phasing out diesel and petrol engines, and expand renewable energy generation and, potentially, nuclear power.
Many actions under Conservative-led governments since 2010, however, have dismayed climate campaigners and may have to be reconsidered. These include the failure to insulate the UK’s draughty homes, limits on renewable energy, the scrapping of carbon capture and storage projects and tax breaks for fossil fuels.
John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said the review was extremely important and could provide a “valuable lead” for other countries. 
“The data shows that the challenges posed by emissions from transport – land, sea and air – and our reliance on gas for heating will have to be confronted as a matter of urgency. 
“Fossil-fuel dependent cars and vans need to be removed from sale by 2030, a step-change in energy efficiency standards in our construction industry should be prioritised, and the government must accept that no new runway at Heathrow will fit inside our carbon budget,” he added. 
The government’s announcement was welcomed by others at the Commonwealth summit, where climate change has been seen as one of the key issues under discussion. Nearly half of the Commonwealth nations are classed as “small island developing states”, which are the most vulnerable to climate change.
Frank Bainimarama, prime minister of Fiji, which currently holds the presidency of the UN’s climate forum, told the meeting: “I am encouraged by Britain’s undertaking to review its climate targets with a view to increasing ambition. The [targets] we all promised to make in the Paris agreement should be setting high standards for the rest of the world to follow. But just as importantly, we in the Commonwealth can show how cooperation based on trust can supply the finance, technology and skilled resources to deliver the necessary transformation in our economies.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/17/uk-to-review-climate-target-raising-hopes-of-a-zero-emissions-pledge

Energy use for air conditioning, refrigeration and other cooling appliances will jump 90% on 2017 levels, experts estimated, posing a challenge for energy grids and efforts to curb climate change.
The University of Birmingham said the rise would come even with conservative estimates of how much demand for cooling was likely to increase in China, India and hotter countries.
“Cooling just really isn’t part of the big debate. And yet we lose 200m tonnes of food each year because of a lack of cooling. That has massive repercussions,” said Toby Peters, a professor in power and cold economy, working at the university, who is also part of the Birmingham Energy Institute.
The institute will host the first ever conference on “clean cold” on Wednesday, exploring how to tackle the problem and boost the 0.2% of energy R&amp;D budgets spend on cooling.
Sir David King, the former government chief scientific adviser and top climate adviser to the Foreign Office, said cooling was critically important. “In terms of energy usage, this is a major issue,” he told the Guardian.
The biggest energy demand for cooling comes from air conditioning to keep people comfortable, but it is also essential for stopping food from going to waste and protecting medicines.
While air conditioning in UK homes is a rarity today, Peters said it was a question of when, not if, the technology became normal for householders.
“I think with temperature rises we will see more and more installations of air conditioning units,” he said.
Global sales of cooling equipment are expected to increase from $140bn (£98bn) today to $260bn by 2050.
That growth presents not just a challenge but a chance for the UK to develop and export new technology.
“It’s not just how many air con units will we have but what is the export opportunity,” said Peters.
The UK has taken the lead on developing greener and more efficient cooling, as part of a clean energy research initiative by 22 countries announced at the Paris climate summit.
If the world’s future appetite for cooling is provided by the current fossil fuel-heavy energy mix, carbon emissions will rise 2.5 gigatonnes by 2050. Global emissions from energy were 35 gigatonnes last year. 
To meet the growth in cooling without pushing up emissions would take almost all the new solar power expected to be installed by mid-century, Peters calculated.
He said: “Yes, we need to look at more efficient cooling technologies and greening electricity, but when you see the size of the demand we have to be much more radical in our thinking and start to invest in [tackling] this.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/17/demand-for-cooling-predicted-to-outstrip-heating-as-earth-warms

The obvious example I can think of is the UK during the Second World War. Back then a coalition government came into being and people were issued ration cards for pretty much everything that was consumable, including fuel. 
If governments around the world got together to recognise that this is an existential problem for much of humanity then perhaps special measures will be brought in until this “war” against climate change is won.
The special measures could include rationing of air travel, scheduled power cuts during the summer for residences, a ban on petrol vehicles for private use, etc, etc. Of course, you’d have to suspend elections unless every political party agreed on the policy.
It’s what’s needed but plenty of people would be pissed off at the measures.

In 2015, cyclone Pam roared across Vanuatu, knocking out power, crippling water systems and levelling homes, schools and churches.
In only 24 hours, the storm dashed the island nation’s hopes of hosting the Commonwealth summit. Three years later, many communities have yet to fully recover, in a place where the impact of a changing climate is on full display.
Vanuatu is one of New Zealand’s Pacific neighbours and friends – and its experience is an increasingly common one. In February, Tonga was hit by its worst cyclone in decades, cyclone Gita. When I visited the country in March, I spent time with schoolchildren who were learning in tents – the roof of their school had been blown off and the classroom walls destroyed by the storm.
Such extreme weather events are tragedies. They are also provocations. They tell us that climate change is not a theory, or a projection, but something that is already happening. They tell us we must be more ambitious when it comes to tackling this urgent global challenge.
The Commonwealth heads of government meeting is a good place to start. Twenty-eight years ago, the same meeting produced the Langkawi declaration on the environment, among the first collective statements to cite greenhouse gas emissions as one of the chief problems facing the world. I am confident that this year’s gathering can be just as decisive by fostering bold commitments to step up climate action.
And while the task ahead is immense, New Zealanders know it can be achieved because we have a proud history of leadership on challenges than can seem too hard to contemplate.
We were the first country in which women won the right to vote, we were at the forefront of the anti-nuclear movement, and we were at the table when the United Nations was born. And we are ready to lead on climate change, the defining challenge of our generation.
That is why my government has committed to setting an ambitious new target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. In June, we are starting a consultation process on how to enshrine this commitment in law.
Our plan includes an expert Independent Climate Commission which will develop carbon budgets through to 2050 – setting a path to carbon neutrality that maintains enough energy to run our economy and country. Along the way, we are committed to helping regions and industries directly affected by the transition move away from fossil fuels, with billions of dollars of investment in local infrastructure and clean energy projects on the horizon.
New Zealand plans to achieve 100% renewable electricity generation by 2035
We are also active in building international cooperation on climate action.
Nearly half of New Zealand’s emissions come from our world-renowned farming sector. This is why we lead the 49-nation Global Research Alliance that is developing techniques to reduce agricultural emissions without compromising food security. And that is why we are committed to helping other countries achieve more climate-friendly agricultural production, in ways that will increase farmers’ yields and build resilience while reducing emissions.
Alongside the UK, we belong to coalitions of forward-thinking countries and cities pressing to phase out coal generation, eliminate harmful subsidies that encourage wasteful fossil fuel use, and help our economies transition to carbon neutrality.
The international consensus on climate change in Paris in 2015 was a historic achievement. Now we all need to do our part by delivering on what we signed up to.
This means setting ambitious and concrete goals, like New Zealand’s plan to achieve 100% renewable electricity generation by 2035. And it means agreeing on the finer details around holding countries accountable for reaching their Paris targets.
Leadership on climate change cannot be left to the big economies. It demands broad and deep action. New Zealand contributes less than 1% of global emissions. Yet together the world’s small emitters account for about a quarter of global emissions. History calls on us to play our part.
At this week’s Commonwealth meeting, I’ll be thinking about Vanuatu’s experience – and the summit that couldn’t happen. I’ll also be guided by a Māori saying from my country – Mō tātou, ā, mō kā uri, ā muri ake nei – for us and for our children after us.
That is what’s at stake when we talk about climate change – the world we’ll leave for the generations that follow us. They are why we need to act now, with purpose and courage.

At some 10,800 sq ft, the model is more than twice the size of a regulation basketball court. Housed at Louisiana State University’s center for river studies, the “Lower Mississippi River Physical Model” will help experts work out how best to enact a state plan to fight coastal erosion. 
The plan calls for diverting nutrient-rich river water from the Mississippi into marshes and wetlands that in recent years have been inundated with salty water from the Gulf of Mexico. Researchers hope that such infusions will reverse some of the devastation the salt water has caused as it has killed off animal and plant life.
Clint Willson, the LSU professor who heads the Center for River Studies, said researchers would be able to study “the flows and the water stages of the water levels in the Mississippi river”. 
“We can also model or simulate the transport or the movement of the Mississippi river sand down the river, and we can do all that in roughly one hour to replicate one year on the river.”
Seawater encroachment has not just damaged wetlands – in many places it has erased them completely. According to Rudy Simoneaux of the state’s coastal protection and restoration authority, Louisiana is estimated to have lost 2,000 sq miles of coastline since the 1930s. That is an area roughly the size of Delaware.
The LSU model cost $4m and is housed a stone’s throw from the actual Mississippi river in Baton Rouge. Among questions that researchers hope it will help to answer are: how will opening one diversion affect the river’s flow? How will diversions affect dredging done by the US army corps of engineers? How will multiple diversions along the river affect each other?
“What you do in one place has an impact on another,” said Willson, “and so the idea of looking at larger-scale impacts or larger-scale processes is critical to looking at what the potential impacts are or the unintended consequences of projects, and so a model of this scale allows you to do that.”

Basically when the AMOC turns off ...
BQEND
From the IPCC's last report (AR5, WG1, 2013).
The conclusion to section 3.6.3 (The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, page 284) :
BQSTART
In summary, measurements of the AMOC and of circulation elements contributing to it, at various latitudes and covering different time periods, agree that the range of interannual variability is 5 Sv (Figure 3.11b). These estimates do not have trends, in either the subtropical or the subpolar gyre. However, the observational record of AMOC variability is short, and there is insufficient evidence to support a finding of change in the transport of the AMOC.
BQEND
From section 11.3.3.3 (Near-term Projected Changes in the Ocean -> Circulation, page 994) :
BQSTART
As discussed in previous assessment reports, the AMOC is generally projected to weaken over the next century in response to increase in atmospheric GHG. However, the rate and magnitude of weakening is very uncertain. ... In addition, the natural variability of the AMOC on decadal time scales is poorly known and poorly understood, and could dominate any anthropogenic response in the near term (Drijfhout and Hazeleger, 2007). The AMOC is known to play an important role in the decadal variability of the North Atlantic Ocean, but climate models show large differences in their simulation of both the amplitude and spectrum of AMOC variability (e.g., Bryan et al., 2006; Msadek et al., 2010).
BQEND
NB : Not just ""uncertain"", but ""VERY uncertain"". Not just ""differences"" (between climate model projections), but ""LARGE differences"".
Clearly you have access to information that has been uncovered in the last 5 years that the IPCC didn't when they were compiling AR5 back in 2010/1/2.
Unfortunately you forget to indicate how you can be so sure that the AMOC is going to ""turn off"". Any chance of rectifying your oversight with a reference (or 3), along with a clarification on exactly ""when"" this is supposed to happen ?
Note that if you cite any recent short-term ""slowdown"" then the following also comes from section 3.6.3 (at the end of page 282 this time) :
BQSTART
Although the AMOC weakening in 2009/2010 was large, it subsequently rebounded and with the large year-to-year changes no trend is detected in the updated time-series (Figure 3.11b).

So your ego is preventing you from reading other commenters' posts while continually applying your elitist snobbery. Goldy made a ridiculous assertion about starvation which directly links to ag industry. Not my fault that you are only reading what you want to read. 
And when you assert someone's assumed political beliefs into a discussion based on their position, you totally discredit yourself as a rational thinker. You require evidence to support assertions, and yet it's impossible for you to make that assertion with evidence. Thus you are a hypocrite and irrational. See how that works? I supply evidence for my assertions. 
Finally, an example of why I get on these threads. Paul Krugman writes this joke of an opinion piece, and because it's in the NYT, it fosters more alarmism based on false information. The second link easily discredits his assertions. 
Krugman is destructive to discourse by his approach (granted, it's an opinion piece....but still), and he's just flat wrong too.

“The fact that we see consistent warming and freshening indicates that the processes we expect to play out over the next century are already underway,” Long said. “Indeed, this study is part of a growing body of evidence suggesting that the world’s oceans are changing — and that the pace of change is beginning to accelerate.”
If the process of Antarctic bottom water formation is being impaired, at least in some regions, then it would be a Southern Hemisphere analogue of a process that has already caused great worry and drawn considerably more attention — a potential slowdown of the overturning circulation in the North Atlantic Ocean, thanks to freshening of the ocean from the melting of Greenland.""

BQENDIt’s the orthodoxy’s equivalent of “infidel”. It does not refer to your view of science, or even climate.

Oh, and their version of “science” is not subject to the test of falsification, and is allowed to adjust its forecasts post hoc - in other words correcting them after the event.

As long as the potential ""conflicts of interest"" are discussed during the confirmation hearings then the fact that someone is an (ex-) oil lobbyist shouldn't be a disqualifying factor ... ON ITS OWN.
Turning the argument around, the opposite argument would be to say that ALL candidates for the post of EPA administrator MUST BE (ex- ?) card-carrying members of Greenpeace / the WWF / FotE / the Sierra Club / ...
That would be a factor to be taken into consideration for any high-level post in an environmentally related government department, but shouldn't be a deciding factor on its own (in either an ""automatically qualifying"" or an ""automatically DIS-qualifying"" sense).

""At very low pressures (below about 0.006 atm), water cannot exist in the liquid state and passes directly from solid to gas by sublimation—a phenomenon exploited in the freeze drying of food. At very high pressures (above 221 atm), the liquid and gas states are no longer distinguishable, a state called supercritical steam.
Water also differs from most liquids in that it becomes less dense as it freezes. The maximum density of water in its liquid form (at 1 atm) is 1,000 kg/m3 (62.43 lb/cu ft); that occurs at 3.98 °C (39.16 °F).[14] The density of ice is 917 kg/m3 (57.25 lb/cu ft).[15][16] Thus, water expands 9% in volume as it freezes, which accounts for the fact that ice floats on liquid water.""', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1524396333000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'3684556', u'in_reply_to': u'114979001', u'id': u'114992794', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Erik Frederiksen', u'text': u'""legal challenges to the oil companies shows up in its true light of being trivial and spiteful witch hunt activity""

One prediction (a pretty obvious one) is that a warmer world will have less snow and ice. In particular, areas that have year-round ice and snow will start to melt. 
Alpine glaciers are large bodies of ice that can be formed high in mountains, typically in bowls called cirques. The ice slowly flows downwards, pulled by gravity, and is renewed in their upper regions. A sort of balance can occur where the loss of ice by melting or flowing at the bottom is equal to the gain of snow and ice by precipitation.
As the Earth warms, the melt line moves upwards so that the glacier melts faster and faster at the bottom, shortening the glacier and reducing its mass. Ultimately, the melted water flows into streams and rivers and ends up in the oceans, contributing to accelerating sea level rise.
While glaciers are interesting from an intellectual standpoint, they are also important to ecosystems and society. For example, the rate of glacier melt affects downstream water levels, river flowrates, and the water available for human use. So, it would be really important for us to be able to predict what will happen with glaciers in the future and plan for how water availability will change. 
Of the groups that track glaciers, my favorite is the World Glacier Monitoring Service, which publishes a survey of the mass changes from selected glaciers around the world, available here and summarized below. The graph shows changes to the mass of the glaciers that are monitored, measured in millimeters of equivalent water.
But this doesn’t tell the whole story because there is very little information about glacier health in the high latitudes (Northern Alaska, Canada, Northern Europe, Northern Russia, etc.). Very few temperature records exist in high elevations in these regions. Furthermore, the temperatures do not extend back very far in time. So, it is challenging for scientists to develop a long-term perspective on glacier health in these areas.
And this is why a new study attracted my attention. A paper was just published by the American Geophysical Union that shared research carried out by Dominic Winski and his colleagues. 
This team of researchers extracted ice cores from the glaciers on Mt. Hunter, in Alaska. The ice cores held snow and ice from as far back as 400 years. The researchers showed that the amount of water melt currently is 60 times greater than it was prior to 1850. They also found that the summertime temperature changes on Mt. Hunter are almost 2°C per century (about 3.5°F). To put this in perspective, the temperatures are rising about twice as fast as global temperatures.
The fact that temperatures on these northern mountains is rising faster than the globe as a whole is something predicted by climate models. The reason it warms so fast in these locations is that as the warming starts, snow begins to melt, exposing dark soil, which absorbs more sunlight, leading to more warming. We call this a feedback loop. There are other feedbacks at play, including changes to vertical temperatures in the air, changes to clouds, and changes to atmosphere currents. These areas were predicted to warm particularly fast, and the measurements confirm the predictions.
The authors recognized that during the summer, the top layer of snow and ice can melt. The liquid water permeates the ice beneath it and refreezes, creating a more solid ice layer than before. Because the bands of solid ice are formed from melting snow, more bands of solid ice mean that summer temperatures were above freezing when the ice bands formed. Measuring the number and thickness of these bands through time gives information about how warm the summer temperatures are. 
So basically, the authors used these annual ice-core bands to deduce temperatures as far back as 400 years ago. They found that the frequency of melting events increased by 57-fold from the 1650–1850 time period compared with 1980–2011. They also measured a 60-fold increase in total melt. These are staggering numbers. I asked the lead author, Dominic Winski to summarize his findings and he told me, 
This research shows that peaks in the Alaska Range sustain additional summertime warming through links with rising ocean temperatures in the tropics. Not only have we learned that summers are much warmer on Mt. Hunter than they were hundreds of years ago, but our research also demonstrates how connected the climate system is, with changes in certain parts of the world affecting places thousands of miles away.

El Nino and other ENSO phase years go roughly from the middle of one calendar year to the next. 2015-16 was a very strong El Nino year comparable in strength to the strong El Nino years of 1997-98 and 1982-83. However 2015-16 was hotter than those equally strong previous El Nino years because global warming had increased the climate and sea surface temperatures. So while very strong El Ninos bump up western Pacific sea surface temperatures for the year, that of 2015-16 was bumping it up from a higher climate temperature. 
The bleaching event of 2015-16 occurred at the end of the Southern summer in March 2016. While some minor coral bleaching occurred in 1997-98, that of 2016 was the first mass coral bleaching event to be observed on the Great Barrier Reef. Large parts of the northern third of the Reef were bleached with high coral mortality within the following 12 months. 
2016-17 was a weak La Nina year with La Nina Southern Oscillation Indices for the second half of 2016 and just over the border into neutral SOIs for the first half of 2017. Nevertheless, in March of last year another mass coral bleaching event, of similar size to that of the previous year, occurred over the middle third of the Great Barrier Reef. 
The mass coral bleaching events of 2016 and 2017 have produced more coral damage than was ""normal"" for similar previous very strong El Ninos and similar previous weak La Nina years.
""The reef is recovering pretty well at the moment.""
The Reef is recovering slowly as it has been seen to do after damage from other sources (cyclones and starfish grazing). Such recovery has been observed to take up to 20 years.
Global warming is increasing the frequency of extreme El Nino events from once every 20 years on average to once every ten years on average. Given the 20 years needed for recovery and the occurrence now of mass coral bleaching during weak La Nina years, this presents problems for long term recovery before the next bleaching event occurs in that area.

The study, published in Nature and led by Prof Terry Hughes, the director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, examined the link between the level of heat exposure, subsequent coral bleaching and ultimately coral death.
The extent and severity of the coral die-off recorded in the Great Barrier Reef surprised even the researchers. Hughes told Guardian Australia the 2016 marine heatwave had been far more harmful than historical bleaching events, where an estimated 5% to 10% of corals died.
“When corals bleach from a heatwave, they can either survive and regain their colour slowly as the temperature drops, or they can die,” Hughes said. “Averaged across the whole Great Barrier Reef, we lost 30% of the corals in the nine-month period between March and November 2016.”
The scientists set out to map the impact of the 2016 marine heatwave on coral along the 2,300km length of the Great Barrier Reef. They established a close link between the coral die-off and areas where heat exposure was most extreme. The northern third of the reef was the most severely affected.

The study found that 29% of the 3,863 reefs that make up the Great Barrier Reef lost two-thirds or more of their corals.
Hughes said researchers were also surprised at how quickly some corals died in the extreme marine temperatures.
“The conventional thinking is that after bleaching corals died slowly of ... starvation. That’s not what we found. We were surprised that about half of the mortality we measured occurred very quickly.”
The study found that “initially, at the peak of temperature extremes in March 2016, many millions of corals died quickly in the northern third of the Great Barrier Reef over a period of only two to three weeks”.
“These widespread losses were not due to the attrition of corals that slowly starved because they failed to regain their symbionts. Rather, temperature-sensitive species of corals began to die almost immediately in locations that were exposed to heat stress.”
The research team observed “markedly divergent responses to heat stress”. Some corals, such as staghorn and tabular corals, suffered a “catastrophic die-off”. Others proved more resilient.
Report co-author Prof Andrew Baird said the coral die-off had caused “radical changes in the mix of coral species on hundreds of individual reefs”.
“Mature and diverse reef communities are being transformed into more degraded systems, with just a few tough species remaining,” he said.The researchers estimate half of the corals in shallow-water habitats in the northern Great Barrier Reef have been lost.“But, that still leaves a billion or so corals alive, and on average, they are tougher than the ones that died. We need to focus urgently on protecting the glass that’s still half full, by helping these survivors to recover,” Hughes said.“The Great Barrier Reef is certainly threatened by climate change, but it is not doomed if we deal very quickly with greenhouse gas emissions. Our study shows that coral reefs are already shifting radically in response to unprecedented heatwaves.”The scientists said their research underscores the need for further risk assessment into the collapse of reef ecosystems, especially if global action on climate change fails to limit warming to a 1.5C to 2C increase on pre-industrial levels.
They also warn that a failure to curb climate change, resulting in an increase above 2C, will radically alter tropical reef ecosystems and undermine benefits they provide to hundreds of millions of people.
Hughes said that left the reef in “uncharted territory”, its future dependent on how quickly emissions peak and come down.
If the targets in the Paris agreement are met, the reef will survive as “a mixture of heat-tolerant [corals], and the ones that can bounce back”.
“Biodiversity will likely be less, coral cover will likely be less,” Hughes said.
If warming continues apace: “Then it’s game over.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/19/great-barrier-reef-30-of-coral-died-in-catastrophic-2016-heatwave

Vanishing ice convulses Alaskans' way of life,article,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/21/alaska-climate-change-winter-way-of-life,0,"A few days before Christmas last year, Harry Brower, mayor of Alaska’s North Slope Borough, was at home when he heard a stunning noise – the sound of waves lapping at the shore.
The sound was as wrenching and misplaced as hearing hailstones thud into the Sahara. Until fairly recently, the Arctic ocean regularly froze up hard up against the far north coast of Alaska by October. In 2017, it wasn’t until the final few days of the year that the ice encased the waves.
The world may have warmed by around 1C (1.8F) over the past century but the Arctic far outstrips this global average and is warming at around twice the rate of the rest of the world.
In places, the rate of warming has been astonishing. Novembers in the Alaskan town of Utqiaġvik, formerly Barrow, are now 5.5C warmer than they were in 1979. This past winter, the warmest on record in the Arctic, saw some locations exceed 20C hotter than normal.
The Arctic is dominated by sea ice, unlike the Antarctic which is essentially a huge land-based ice sheet. As the ocean and atmosphere warm, sea ice is shrinking in extent, at around 13% a decade since 1979, according to Nasa. The bright white surface of ice, known as albedo, is giving way to the dark ocean, meaning that sunlight is being absorbed rather than reflected, amplifying the warming effect.
These “rapid and dramatic changes” are introducing a “new normal” to the Arctic, according to US government scientists in a report card last year. Storms are eroding away ice-free coastlines, summer wildfires are becoming fiercer and certain species, such as polar bears, are increasingly struggling to find food. This is all providing a major challenge to communities in the Arctic, but a boon to the shipping industry, which can navigate the area more easily. This task will get even simpler once the Arctic is ice free in summertimes, forecast as soon as 2040s.
“We’ve had a few warmer days in the past but there was nothing like the past winter,” said Anne Jensen, an anthropologist who has worked in Utqiaġvik, the US’s most northerly town, for the past three decades. It was so warm that the snow melted on Jensen’s roof, causing it to leak.
“This year’s winter stuck out, insanely. It was crazy. Even the younger people noticed that this is something that hasn’t happened before.”
A certain stoicism is required to live in the North Slope Borough, an area of sprawling tundra larger than 39 of the 50 US states that takes in Alaska’s northern coast. The native Iñupiat population have carved out a life here in the brutal cold of the Arctic Circle for at least 4,000 years, subsisting on bowhead whales, seals and caribou. 
Utqiaġvik, formerly known as Barrow, is the largest of the region’s scattered settlements and remains a flinty and unforgiving frontier town despite the arrival of the internet, buzzy snowmobiles and exotic vegetables (a pineapple costs around $9.50 (£6.70) at the main grocery store).
But the past winter, following a string of warm years, points to a pace of change not before experienced by this community. The winter was the warmest on record in the Arctic, with sea ice extent hitting record lows in January and February, ending up at the second-smallest seasonal peak in the 39-year satellite record in March. The smallest was in 2017. The Bering Sea, which separates Alaska and Russia, lost a third of its winter ice in just eight February days. 
Otherworldly temperatures were felt across the region, with the weather station closest to the North Pole spending more than 60 hours above freezing in February, around 25C (45F) warmer than normal, which is equivalent to Washington DC spending a February day at 35C (95F) or Miami baking at 51C (124F). The Arctic was, in spells, warmer than much of Europe.
Utqiaġvik, pronounced oot-ki-ahh-vik or “place where snowy owls are hunted”, got to -1C, around 22C warmer than normal. In December, the temperature readings from the weather station at Utqiaġvik were so freakish that it triggered an automatic shutdown of the system to protect the data from “artificial” figures. It temporarily wiped a year’s worth of numbers.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration called the incident an “ironic exclamation point” to the climate change gripping the Arctic, which is warming at twice the rate of the global average. This winter’s extreme warmth was, in part, driven by an unusual number of storms in the Atlantic that brought balmier air to the Arctic. But scientists warned that 2017 and 2018 should not be dismissed as mere outliers. 
“There’s no reason why this sort of warmth won’t continue. Within the lifetime of middle-aged adults, the Arctic has completely changed,” said Rick Thoman, a Noaa climate scientist based in Fairbanks, Alaska. “The magnitude of change is utterly unprecedented. For a lot of the people who live there, it’s completely shocking.”
The changes are potentially existential on the north slope, where sea ice provides a crucial platform for catching and hauling in whales – a key food source and cultural totem for the Iñupiat. The spring whale hunt, where emerging cracks, or “leads”, in the sea ice funnel whales into the path of waiting hunting crews, requires dependable environmental cycles that have served the Iñupiat for thousands of years. 
“All the indications are there will be a very early loss of ice this year,” Thoman said. “In the 1990s they could do whale hunting in Utqiaġvik up until May or even June. There’s no real chance of that now – the ice will probably start breaking up by early May.
“Native peoples of Alaska are very resilient; they’ve lived here for many millennia for a reason. Some will have to move, hunting will have to change. It can be done but it won’t be easy, it won’t be cheap. There will be a big cost, both financially and culturally.”
Utqiaġvik is wrestling with a number of climate impacts. Its coastline, increasingly shorn of sea ice, is eroding at a concerning rate. The melting of permafrost, long-frozen soils that scientists forecast could end up releasing huge amounts of carbon, is causing some buildings to slump, their walls radiating with cracks.
But it’s the potential threat to the whale quota that causes most angst. Slain whales need to be quickly pulled up on to the sea ice and butchered before the cetaceans’ cooling systems halt and they essentially cook from within. Lack of thick, multi-year ice could hinder the haul-out. Caught whales could even fall through the ice if it’s too thin.
“A couple of years ago the ice was rubble, it was just breaking up,” said Nagruk Harcharek, who has spent many of his 33 years whaling near Utqiaġvik. “It was really late this year and everyone noticed. I’d be lying if I said people aren’t worried.
“Some families rely upon whales for their food. It’s so central to our culture. The spring hunt is spiritual – sitting out there on the ice edge is pretty quiet. There’s the unknown. There’s not much going on. You’re watching, waiting.”
Other heritage is already being lost, with archaeological sites along the coast being washed away at a quickening rate. In September, a major storm crunched into the coast and threatened Birnirk, a village that was inhabited for 1,000 years and is a national historic landmark. 
“It’s very, very grim,” said Jensen, who has worked to excavate and protect several sites. “Most of the coastal sites will be gone in the next 10 to 15 years if the rate of erosion keeps up.”
Across Alaska, dozens of coastal towns are at risk of becoming uninhabitable, with a handful actively seeking to relocate. Melting permafrost is buckling roads into potentially deadly big dipper rollercoasters, as well as threatening to dislodge doses of locked-up mercury. Glaciers near Denali, the tallest mountain in the US, are disappearing faster than at any time in the past 400 years.
The Alaskan government recently warned this bewildering rate of change risks the physical and mental health of its citizens, citing a condition called solastalgia, the distress caused by severe disruption to the environment near home. 
“Alaska is on the frontlines of climate change,” Bill Walker, the state’s governor, warned last year. Walker, an independent, has convened a panel to come up with some sort of climate change strategy by September. 
Somehow, it will have to suggest a way forward that doesn’t rattle its economically important oil and gas industry, which has received staunch support from a Trump administration that has started to dismantle help for those pummeled by rising seas and storms.
For a reliably Republican state, polling shows unusual numbers of Alaskans are concerned about climate change and, at least sometimes, openly fret over its consequences. “People are feeling the impacts of climate change, we hear that on a daily basis,” said Nikoosh Carlo, the governor’s climate adviser. “It’s a non-partisan issue here. For some communities, the next storm could wipe out critical infrastructure.”
The lack of any federal or state plan to deal with the looming climate crisis isn’t causing mass panic in Utqiaġvik, at least.
“We are capable of adapting to any changes,” said Charlie Hopson, a veteran Utqiaġvik whaler. “We’ve been around for thousands of years and we’re going to keep living. We do our own thing here. The government doesn’t know shit. We don’t need them.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/21/alaska-climate-change-winter-way-of-life

Ganopolski et al (2016) in their paper ""Critical insolation-CO2 relation for diagnosing past and future glacial inception"" Nature 534, 19-20, says as follows.
""we suggest that glacial inception was narrowly missed before the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. The missed inception can be accounted for by the combined effect of relatively high late-Holocene CO2 and the low orbital excentricity of the Earth. Additionally our analysis suggests that even in the absence of human perturbations no substantial buildup of icesheets could occur within the next several thousand years and that the current interglacial will probably last for another 50,000 years. However, moderate anthropogenic cumulative CO2 emissions of 1,000 to 1,500 gigatonnes of carbon will postpone the next glacial inception by at least 100,000 years.

Here is a short explanation of Earth's climate history, from James Hansen in 2012.
""Small changes in Earth's orbit that occur over tens to hundreds of thousands of years alter the distribution of sunlight on Earth. When there is more sunlight at high latitudes in summer, ice sheets melt. Shrinking ice sheets make the planet darker, so it absorbs more sunlight and becomes warmer. A warmer ocean releases CO2, just as a warm Coca-Cola does. And more CO2 causes more warming. 
So CO2, methane, and ice sheets were feedbacks that amplified global temperature change causing these ancient climate oscillations to be huge, even though the climate change was initiated by a very weak forcing.
The important point is that these same amplifying feedbacks will occur today. The physics does not change. As Earth warms, now because of extra CO2 we put in the atmosphere, ice will melt, and CO2 and methane will be released by warming ocean and melting permafrost. While we can't say exactly how fast these amplifying feedbacks will occur, it is certain they will occur, unless we stop the warming. 
There is evidence that feedbacks are already beginning. Precise measurements by GRACE, the gravity satellite, reveal that both Greenland and Antarctica are now losing mass, several hundred cubic kilometers per year. And the rate has accelerated since the measurements began nine years ago. Methane is also beginning to escape from the permafrost.""

More than all of it.

A few decades ago, the consensus among climate scientists was that the next glacial period (we are, technically, in an ice age right now, but in an interglacial period of that ice age) might be coming in a few thousand years
BQEND
A few decades ago climate scientists already knew CO2 levels were causing warming.
Certainly without greenhouse gas changes, the next glacial stage might have been inevitable ..... but ......
Glacial inception requires summer temperatures in the northern hemisphere to be low enough for snow to build up year on year, starting mainly on north-facing slopes of mountain ranges.
It also requires CO2 levels to be quite low - in all the previous glacial stages of the Pleistocene ""ice age"", CO2 was under around 230 ppm.
This interesting paper -
""Determining the natural length of the current interglacial"" - Tzedakis et al, 2012
reports that the end of the current interglacial would occur within the next 1500 years, if atmospheric CO2 concentrations did not exceed 240±5 ppmv.
But CO2 was already above 240 ppm before the Industrial Revolution.
This early higher CO2 concentration may be related to the development of agriculture, which disrupted the carbon cycle.
Clearance of forests for fields meant fewer trees, so less CO2 was removed from the air.
Plus other agricultural activities, some producing CH4 (eg rice paddies)
Now with CO2 over 400 ppm, the Earth is heading into conditions not seen for a very long time - way before modern humans were around.
Those conditions are not conducive to glaciation.
So human activity has taken the Earth out of the repeated cycle of glacials and interglacials that has been going on for a couple of million years.', u'recommendation_count': u'7', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1524430251000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'co2 levels', u'effect': u'warming'}], u'author_id': u'2923581', u'in_reply_to': u'114999016', u'id': u'115005443', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'John Samuel', u'text': u'You watch too much Star Wars.

But a water crisis, partly caused by an ongoing drought affecting much of southern Africa, is already reversing progress in this coastal city. An emergency “orange alert”, declared last February by the country’s disaster management council after failed rains, has triggered such strict water rationing across the capital city that the taps are turned off every other day and irrigation is banned.
Unable to afford the private wells, boreholes and extra tanks used by the rich to buffer themselves from the restrictions, Chamanculo’s residents once again find themselves gathering at a single tap. At 9am, a steady stream of mostly women, some with babies strapped to their backs, line up at Pragosa, a Portuguese construction firm, which is providing free water from a private borehole to the community during the emergency for an hour every day. They fill up 25-litre canisters and carefully balance them on their heads, often making repeat trips home and back again.
Helena Metela, 20, a mother of a three-month-old boy, Ali, says it is a struggle but she has no choice. “The construction company is a little bit far from my home,” she says. “It takes time. Maybe an hour.”
With no end to the current water shortage in sight, the municipality is considering bringing back community pumps to deal with the dwindling supply.
Unlike Cape Town, in neighbouring South Africa where the water supply is at breaking point, Maputo has not got to the stage where officials have predicted a “day zero”, when taps are forecast to run dry. But it is clear that without urgent action, Maputo could be the next southern African city to suffer extreme water shortages. Worse still, future projections are for the city to double in size, from 1.7 million people to 3.5million by 2035, sending demand for already scant water resources soaring further.
So pressing is the issue that late last month government departments, water utilities, regulators and NGOs gathered in downtown Maputo for a crisis meeting to discuss possible solutions. At the meeting, held jointly by the Mozambique government and WaterAid, official after official warned that the situation was “critical”.
Nobody present was in any doubt of the role climate change is playing in the water shortages. Meteorologists who talked to the Observer reported shifting rainfall patterns, high temperatures and more extreme weather events in recent years. Predictions are that in Maputo and other coastal cities increased pressure on fresh water supply is set to increase.
Jonathan Farr, a senior policy analyst at Wateraid, said climate change was “eating up the world’s water”, while also making it harder to find a solution. “Things that have worked in the past are no longer enough. Climate change makes everything considerably more serious. Cape Town was something you wouldn’t expect to happen. We are now seeing it potentially in Maputo.”
An hour’s drive west from Maputo is the vast Pequenos Libombos dam, which feeds into the Umbeluzi river, the main source of water supply to Greater Maputo. Completed in 1987, the dam has a capacity of 400 million square metres. But in the last two years, the water level has dropped dramatically. Standing on the bridge above the reservoir, Jaime Timba, the dam’s director, points to a series of yellow guages on the dam’s wall, well above the current water level.
“The water level is too low for the scale,” Timba said “We need to build a new one.” It is only the second time in a decade that the water level has been so depleted. The last time was in 2016, when it fell to 13%. Some water restrictions were enacted then, but they were not sufficient. Meanwhile, everyone prayed for more rain.
In the last four years the Umbeluzi river basin has recorded below average rainfall for the whole basin, while evaporation rates have risen, according to Wateraid. Swathes of land across the region, from South Africa to Zambia, have been hit by high temperatures and low rainfall. Though rainfall in Mozambique has been reasonably good elsewhere, Swaziland in the south-west, whose rivers feed into the Pequenos Libombos dam, has suffered.
Jacinto Laureiro, the mayor of Boane, a town in Greater Maputo, said: “We need to change from thinking about the next 10 years or even 20 years, to thinking long term.”
The current situation, he said, had developed over time, due to population growth, a lack of investment in infrastructure measures to capture water, and because of climate change.
Asked if the situation could deteriorate, he said: “Only God knows.”
Antonieta Ruben, 53, a widow, was sceptical that she would see improvements any time soon.
“I don’t have hope,” said Ruben, who has two sons at university in Maputo and sells chickens to support her family. “This is a normal crisis. They can have promises of getting water but nothing is done.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/22/mozambique-prays-for-rain-water-shortages-hit-poor-maputo-southern-africa-drought

Graphene has been incorporated into traditional concrete production by scientists at the University of Exeter, developing a composite material which is more than twice as strong and four times more water-resistant than existing concretes.
Unlike previous attempts to use nanotechnology in concrete, which have focused on modifying the existing components of cement, the new technique allows a layer of graphene to be suspended in water. 
The method produces a high yield of concrete without defects, which can be used in conjunction with modern manufacturing techniques and could be scaled up, the researchers believe, at a relatively low cost.
The composite could be used directly on building sites, enabling the construction of strong and durable buildings using less concrete and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Using graphene meant the researchers were able to roughly halve the amount of materials used to make concrete.
Its water resistance makes it suitable for construction in areas that are hard to reach for maintenance, while the strength of the composite will make buildings more resilient to future shocks and strains, researchers say. In addition, the technique could be copied in incorporating other nanomaterials into concrete construction in the future, which could pave the way to further innovations in the industry.
Monica Craciun, professor of nanoscience at the University of Exeter’s engineering department, said: “Our cities face a growing pressure from global challenges on pollution, sustainable urbanisation and resilience to catastrophic natural events. This new composite material is an absolute game-changer in terms of reinforcing traditional concrete to meet these needs.”
Graphene is a form of carbon first reliably produced at the University of Manchester by researchers in 2004, work which led to two Nobel prizes. It is made up of a single layer of carbon atoms in a hexagonal lattice. Its structure gives it important physical qualities, including efficient conductance of heat and electricity and unusual strength.
Concrete has been used as a building material since the Romans, some of whose concrete structures still stand today. It is the commonest building material, along with steel, but greenhouse gas emissions from concrete and cement-making remain stubbornly high, in part because of the energy used in their creation but also because the chemical processes required involve the break-up of limestone and release of carbon dioxide.
Cement-making accounts for 6% of global carbon emissions, and manufacturers must make sharp reductions if the Paris climate goals are to be met, according to the Carbon Disclosure Project, in a recent study.
The University of Exeter research, in a paper entitled Ultrahigh Performance nanoengineered Graphene-Concrete Composites for Multifunctional Applications, is published in the journal Advanced Functional Materials, and was funded by the UK’s Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council.
The samples of the composite tested so far all come up to British and European standards, so getting the composite material into use should be possible. Dimitar Dimov, lead author of the study, said: “Finding greener ways to build is a crucial step forward in reducing carbon emissions around the world. This is a crucial step in the right direction to make a more sustainable construction industry.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/23/graphene-a-game-changer-in-making-building-with-concrete-greener

The truth is Snopes is good for debunking outlandish urban myths, but it is biased junk for far too many other things, especially politics, history, and current events. Many professors point out that Snopes and Wiki are not rigorous, unbiased, high-quality, peer-reviewed, reliable sources of legitimate information, which is why they tell students not to use them. Any fact-checker should be willing to verify sources, the methods of how one came to such conclusions, and never take the surface claims of an obviously biased blog as gospel.

Leave the physics alone. Newtons equations on motion and gravity are used for most applications. They are used by space launches, ballistics, aircraft fly by wire systems, oceanography, meteorology etc.Newton breaks down when there is enough gravity, speed or enough precision. Newtonian gravity can be written with General Relativity spacetime curvature (oh dem sexy tensors) applying Christoffel's work but there in lies the dragons of Reimann mannifolds but its flaw is that it contains the idea of an absolute structure to the universe. This is where relativity is superior, it abolishes any absolute frame of reference. Newtonian physics is a special case of General and Special relativity where the speeds and strength of gravity are too low to produce big enough errors in the precision of the instruments being used.

GM launched the EV1 car in 96, only to crush them in 99, honda produced the first 100 mile per gallon production hybrid car in 99 only to role back the mpg in later models. The Bush administration bolstered the failing auto industry with tax free incentives for light goods vehicles and the king cab pick up became the best seller and fuel consumption of the 70s.Certainly Europe's [and especially the UK] investment in wind was positive in the 90s, and 00s, and when you see compare today's offshore giants with the little 400 kW built in the 1990s [and still running- and extended for another 20 years] the improvements are massive. [however NASA built a 3.5 MW turbine in the late 80s so the tech was there].
Wind has come of age- major companies globally are planning on 12 MW- to 15 MW as a basic offshore work horse. These turbines are massed produced and getting cheaper. China built over 200 GW of turbines in the last few years.
Solar installed 75 GW in 2016, and growth rate is huge. I saw a Chinese academic speak on the subject and this is part of the plan- China [apparently] used coal to build its green global dominating energy market. This was always the plan- oil would have its day, coal would get to expensive and too toxic and just as the US took over from the UKs coal driven dominance so China would use clean energy to supersede the oil driven US.
Both Tesla and Nissan threw the gauntlet down to other automakers and the evidence is clear that they are setting the trend.But China is the bigger story- in the UK a couple of EV buses gets into the news- in Chinese cities they order 400 at a time and there are a lot Chinese cities- UK bus companies may um and er about if EV buses are ready- yet they reduce fuel costs by 70% and maintenance costs by 50%
with nuclear the transition is doable and relatively affordable now- in the first instance we should have kickstarted the revolution 20 years ago- in the UK we have a culture of just enough [with the exception if UK military] we do everything to its lower limit which keeps costs down but means roads melt in heat waves, snow and leaves stop trains, trains are just one maintenance away from breaking down etc. In the case of CO2 the govt action on wind and nuclear keep us on track but this is the easy part of the action plan which means the later phases become more expensive and problematic.
20 years ago the UK could have set out an action plan to insulate to high standards all new builds and 80% of existing stock - but it could have also insured that we would not go through a housing stock crisis and unaffordable rents or ownership as we are now.
If it had done that it could get on with the 20 year challenge to get domestic gas heating converted to heat pumps- which we have not started. [the current incentive is wood pellets and heat pumps but only big users like the UK stately homes really benefit- or farmers in N.I.]
The transition is happening- and it is now getting cheaper than using fossil fuels. The West is being complacent - just as the UK car and motorcycle industry woke up to a new Eastern threat in the 1970s and did too little too late so one day we wake up to Chinese buses and cars [the london black cab is Chinese and its newest cab is EV].
Complacency brings down great nations- and globally the same is true for AGW. Dealing with AGW fixes lots of other problems- such as health, housing, affordable living, rising costs, even productivity that is falling in the UK. [because unhappy, stressed, polluted, cold and damp people don't perform well- and business that does not plan and invest in the future don't do well]

Newton is not the ""preferred choice"" of science in terms of equations or otherwise - Einstein (and others) comprehensively disproved Newtons' gravitational theories.
BQENDLeave the physics alone.
Newtons equations on motion and gravity are used for most applications. They are used by space launches, ballistics, aircraft fly by wire systems, oceanography, meteorology etc.
Newton breaks down when there is enough gravity, speed or enough precision. Newtonian gravity can be written with General Relativity spacetime curvature (oh dem sexy tensors) applying Christoffel's work but there in lies the dragons of Reimann mannifolds but its flaw is that it contains the idea of an absolute structure to the universe. This is where relativity is superior, it abolishes any absolute frame of reference. Newtonian physics is a special case of General and Special relativity where the speeds and strength of gravity are too low to produce big enough errors in the precision of the instruments being used.

The current models of elementary particle physics and quantum field theory are all built on quantum mechanics and cannot challenge it.

Newtonian physics does not apply.

In scientific terms this is known as ""a conjecture"", but unfortunately you have forgotten to proceed to the next step, which is called ""providing supporting evidence"".
One characteristic of ""conjectures"" is that they often turn out to be true for small numbers of limited cases, but are not generally true.
Note that exploring the reasons for these discrepancies often results in a much deeper, and more nuanced, understanding of Nature than the majority of observers would have postulated from the original conjecture's ""naive"" viewpoint.
It turns out that a poll of scientists and their religious beliefs was published in Ecklund et al (2016).
From the Abstract :
BQSTART
We uncovered that in most of the national contexts studied, scientists are indeed more secular — in terms of beliefs and practices — than those in their respective general populations, although in four of the regional contexts, over half of scientists see themselves as religious. And surprisingly, scientists do not think science is in conflict with religion. Instead, most see religion and science as operating in separate spheres.
BQEND
From the body of the paper :
BQSTART
The Religion among Scientists in International Context (RASIC) study examined biologists and physicists in eight regional contexts—France, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Taiwan, Turkey, the UK, and the US. 
...
The selection of these eight regions as cases was based primarily on the variation in religiosity of the general population and variation in level of science infrastructure, both of which could have an impact on how scientists understand their own religiosity and how they see the connection between science and religion.
...
Together, the eight regional contexts examined in this study offer a new perspective on the science-religion interface that cannot be revealed by studying any one region alone. We deliberately focused on France, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Taiwan, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States because each exhibits distinctive religious characteristics and contributes a unique perspective on the science-religion relationship.

Now let’s look at how we do this in SR, which is the more general description of such kinematics. Here, we use what is known as the Lorentz transformation.

BQSTART
Here, H is t he Hamiltonian, Q is an operator representing any observable, the square bracket represents the commutator, while the angled bracket represents the average value. These are all the standard notations used in QM.

It is why for someone not trained in physics, the idea that classical mechanics can actually be derived from seemingly a different animal of QM or SR/GR would not even cross his/her mind. Yet, in science/physics, this is quite common. We always show how new ideas and theories will turn into the old, tested, and well-known ideas and theories under the appropriate parameters. It is very seldom that old theories are discarded wholesale.

 ""AbstractWe analyze the evolution of the scientific consensus on anthropogenic global warming (AGW) in the peer-reviewed scientific literature, examining 11 944 climate abstracts from 1991–2011 matching the topics 'global climate change' or 'global warming'. We find that 66.4% of abstracts expressed no position on AGW, 32.6% endorsed AGW, 0.7% rejected AGW and 0.3% were uncertain about the cause of global warming. Among abstracts expressing a position on AGW, 97.1% endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming. In a second phase of this study, we invited authors to rate their own papers. Compared to abstract ratings, a smaller percentage of self-rated papers expressed no position on AGW (35.5%). Among self-rated papers expressing a position on AGW, 97.2% endorsed the consensus. For both abstract ratings and authors' self-ratings, the percentage of endorsements among papers expressing a position on AGW marginally increased over time. Our analysis indicates that the number of papers rejecting the consensus on AGW is a vanishingly small proportion of the published research.""http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024

Newton breaks down when there is enough gravity, speed or enough precision.

The degree of concern amongst those who understand - or at least accept - the science varies considerably. Those who look only at the physics and numbers remain optimistic; those who look at biology and human behaviour much less so
BQEND
This is too simplistic. 
For example - if you go into the ice-sheet community (and we take IPPC as consensus) - you will see a tendency for thinking that IPCC underestimate sea-level change. 
And by simply ask about pure physics (simple stuff) vs ecosystems (really complex stuff) one has to ponder bell-curves describing confidence as well. 
The perceived ""optimism"" of physics is that the global temperature sensitivity is rather well constrained (no it will not be 100 degrees hotter, for example). The question of when a healthy ecosystem start to behave almost like cancer - in starting to self-destruct is way more difficult to pin-point. 
Living things are complex - I know since my father did not die from the physical action of a big rock falling on his head - but from cells going bonkers in his lungs. Now I loose my grandmother as living breathing human being while Alzheimer's is wrecking havoc in her brain - instead of a much more simple problem of calculating the physical havoc a bullet can cause to human welfare. (A west providing against rocks and bullets and things does not really protect against what goes on in our cells - or even in experiences that may cause PTSD in our brains). 
We know that evolution has made the delicate invention of vision several times. And that life as concept has survived bigger disasters than we can make by combining full use of coal - and then blowing up all the nuclear weapons we have in frustration. Life will get by. 
So the question is moral - doing shit with a brain big enough to cause shit on a global level and even write down shit. And how it affects us - watching what we do as new generations are born and have to accept. 
Some days I feel like the biggest risk is that AGW may cause kids to be born into post-traumatic distress. (Heck - there is this big thing going on because plastic has reached Norwegian media - kids are now brought to beaches - to start life by cleaning up) 
It is important to note that science makes us humans, that evolve very slowly, having a brain ache. We become cause - rather than acting from cause. 
And that is rather depressing. 
For other parts of the ecosystem - our burden of responsibly is non-existent.

At the same time, I believe that the majority of climate sceptics are not willfully wishing to damage this precious Earth that we call home. I believe that there are common areas we can all agree on to take meaningful action to protect the Earth’s environment and build a new energy future; even for people who do not understand climate change or climate science.
But with the election of Donald Trump and his ushering in people who are openly hostile to the planet and future generations, my position has been strained (to say the least). We have had more than a year to observe President Trump’s efforts to roll back Obama-era regulations on pollution from coal plants, weaken pollution standards for motor vehicles, become the only country in the world to reject the Paris climate accord, and gut our climate science budget so that we become blind to what is actually happening. 
We have to believe Trump when he says that he thinks climate science is a hoax and we have to expect he will act according to this belief. Under Trump, the USA has become a pariah nation. It hurts me to say this, because I love the USA and what it stands for. But regarding the environment, we are the worst of the worst.
Some people will claim I am “unpatriotic” or “unAmerican” to criticize my country. My response is, I am honest. A patriot is someone who loves their country and wants their country to meet the ideals that are the foundation of that nation. Patriotic means you want your country to be better; you want your country to make a positive impact. I believe that turning a blind eye to your country’s faults is a most deeply unpatriotic act. I want my country to excel, I want my country to lead, I want my country to be a shining light on a hill. If my country fails or falters in that endeavor, I will work tirelessly to correct our path. That, in my mind is patriotism.
President Trump has installed radical science deniers in his administration to obstruct climate science research, to stop development in clean and renewable energy (the economic growth engine of the future), and to attack scientists for doing their jobs. Among Trump’s most harmful acts was to appoint Scott Pruitt to head the EPA. Scott Pruitt does not understand even basic climate science, and he doesn’t comprehend that climate change will be bad for human society. 
But it isn’t just Trump and Pruitt that are a problem. Everyone in the Trump administration seems hell-bent on damaging the planet. Recently, climate change denier Jim Bridenstine was confirmed by Senate Republicans to lead Nasa – one of the two most important climate science organizations in the country. Trump has brought with him a swamp filled with anti-science staff whose goal is to handicap the US and permanently remove us from any leadership role in the world.
To be clear, Trump, Pruitt, the entire administration, and those who support him will inherit a terrible legacy that we will not forget. These people will be known for willfully trying to destroy the planet that we rely on for health and prosperity.
Despite the attacks from the Trump/Pruitt Administration, some scientists have begun to speak out. This speaking out takes courage. I have the luxury of being unbridled in my work. My livelihood does not depend on federal research grants; I have no boss in Washington DC that can threaten me; Scott Pruitt cannot attack me; nor can President Trump. For a scientist like me, speaking out is low-risk. 
But many of my colleagues are not so fortunate. Many of my colleagues, who have dedicated their lives to understanding the Earth’s environment, are employed by Washington. That is, they are able to carry out research by obtaining federal grants. These grants pay for their instruments (satellites, sea level gauges, weather balloons, supercomputers, etc.), their offices, salaries, and so forth. And when these scientists speak out, it is an act of courage and selflessness.
This week, many of these scientists have spoken out. In an open letter, over 600 scientists from the prestigious National Academy of Sciences (America’s best scientists) wrote the following:
In September 2016, over 375 members of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (NAS) signed an Open Letter calling attention to the dangers of human-induced climate change. The letter warned that U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Accord would have negative consequences for the world’s climate system and for U.S. leadership and credibility.
In the intervening 15 months, these negative consequences have become more obvious. Human-caused climate disruption is leading to suffering and economic loss. Suffering and loss are not future hypotheticals. They are happening now. Despite these serious negative consequences, the present Administration has fulfilled its threat to initiate U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Accord. The United States is the only nation in the world that has taken this action. 
The decision to withdraw is symptomatic of a larger problem: The Trump Administration’s denigration of scientific expertise and harassment of scientists. The dismissal of scientific evidence in policy formulation has affected wide areas of the social, biological, environmental and physical sciences. It has been particularly egregious in climate science. A recent instance of this is the intention of the Administration to assemble a “Red Team/Blue Team” to re-litigate all aspects of climate science. Such an exercise seeks to foster the erroneous impression of deep uncertainty concerning the reality and seriousness of anthropogenically driven climate change.
Scientific evidence and research should be an important component of policymaking. We therefore call on the Federal Government to maintain scientific content on publicly accessible websites, to appoint qualified personnel to positions requiring scientific expertise, to cease censorship and intimidation of Government scientists, and to reverse the decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Accord.
My country has withdrawn from the most significant multinational agreement to stop climate change, has attacked scientists funding and censored scientists and threatened them to stay quiet, and has actively enacted measures to encourage pollution both in the US and worldwide.
This is not the USA I know in my heart. This is not the world leader I believe my country to be. This is a pariah nation led by a small number of people who are getting rich at the expense of public and environmental health. 
For those who support these policies – shame. There is no ethical or moral justification to value polluters’ profits more than the health of the planet and the inheritance of future generations. That’s just greed, plain and simple.
For those who voted for Trump and who vote for other deniers of climate change, you can no longer say “I just didn’t know.” Now is the time to acknowledge you were lied to. It is never too late to change course. But it is untenable to say you care about future generations yet still support politicians and policies that lead to future destruction. You have to choose one or the other; there is no middle ground, and we need to quit pretending there is.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/apr/25/americas-best-scientists-stood-up-to-the-trump-administration

Pruitt said opponents of Donald Trump, and the media, had sought to “derail the president’s agenda and priorities” by highlighting the questionable use of taxpayer funds for first-class flights, office furniture and 24-hour personal security, as well as his use of a Washington apartment owned by an energy lobbyist’s wife. 
However, Pruitt did not offer explanations for the numerous revelations and did not deny that he authorized sizable pay increases for two staffers, against the White House’s wishes. “I wasn’t aware of the amount nor was I aware of the PPO [presidential personnel office] process not being respected,” he said, saying the matter was “delegated” to Ryan Jackson, his chief of staff. 
This contradicts a TV interview earlier this month when Pruitt said he had no idea about the raises. Pruitt has also previously falsely claimed that the lobbyist, Steven Hart, had no business before the EPA when he rented his wife’s apartment. 
Pruitt has come under severe pressure over the $50-a-night apartment deal, his spending of more than $100,000 from the public purse on first-class flights in his first year as EPA administrator, ostensibly to evade abuse from fellow passengers, as well as taking a large security detail on trips to Disneyland and the Rose Bowl.
He also oversaw the spending of $43,000 on a soundproof booth for his office, in violation of federal rules, and has reportedly retaliated against staffers who questioned his spending. Pruitt is facing multiple federal government investigations over his conduct, including two different White House inquiries.
There’s a pattern of putting personal and special interests ahead of the American people
Facing the House of Representatives energy and commerce committee, Pruitt departed from his prepared remarks to decry the “distorted” reporting that has exposed his activities. “I have nothing to hide as it relates to how I run the agency in the past 16 months,” he said. “Facts are facts and fiction is fiction. A lie doesn’t become true just because it’s on the front page.”
Pruitt said he was “not afraid to admit there has been a learning process” and vowed to correct any problems within the EPA. But he said that those who have “attacked the EPA and me have done so to derail the president’s agenda and priorities and I won’t let that happen”.
Pruitt declined to apologize but said the ethics scandals have proved a “distraction” to the EPA. He said he had no idea of the $43,000 spent on the soundproof booth and cited security concerns for the first-class travel arrangements, reading out threats to “put a bullet between your eyes” and another that said: “I hope your father dies soon in agony in front of your mother.” This was despite a recent report claiming that Pruitt flew in coach on some flights that were at his own expense.
Committee Democrats poured scorn on Pruitt’s responses and repeatedly called on him to resign, in a combative hearing. “There’s seemingly endless misconduct, a pattern of putting personal and special interests ahead of the American people,” said Paul Tonko, a Democrat from New York. “You’ve abused this position for personal gain. You were never fit for this job.”
Frank Pallone, another Democrat, said Pruitt had used the job to “enrich himself and his corporate friends” with the apparent approval of Trump. “If I were the president I wouldn’t want your help, I’d just get rid of you,” he told Pruitt.
Pruitt has earned Trump’s admiration for his zeal in repealing environmental regulations and dismantling of action on climate change, such as Pruitt’s successful agitation for the US to withdraw from the Paris climate accords. Trump has tweeted that Pruitt is “doing a great job”.
But in recent days the White House has sought to distance itself from the beleaguered EPA chief as the extraordinary number of ethical problems mounted. Sarah Sanders, Trump’s spokeswoman, said on Wednesday that “we expect the EPA administrator to answer” concerns raised by Congress.
Environment groups and Democrats have called for Pruitt’s removal, joined by a small band of Republicans. During the committee hearing, Republicans praised Pruitt’s deregulation agenda but some also raised concerns over his spending. “These issues are too persistent to ignore,” said Greg Walden, an Oregon Republican. 
Others, though, sided strongly with Pruitt. “This is a classic display of innuendo and McCarthyism that works against civility and respect,” said David McKinley, a West Virginia Republican, criticizing Democrats. 
Joe Barton, a Republican representative from Texas, used his time to ask Pruitt if he had rented a “party jet”. Pruitt said he hadn’t. “Well, that’s good,” Barton said.

The Belgium-based company AB InBev says it has developed a technique to generate the gas bubbles that remove unwanted aromas from the mix of grain and water, known as the wort, without resorting to the traditional method of boiling it.
The company conducted four years of tests at an experimental brewery in Leuven, east of Brussels, and then on a larger scale in plants in the UK and elsewhere in Belgium. The method it has developed does not detract from the taste of the finished drink, it says, while using less heat and water.
Bubbles are said to be crucial in determining the taste of a beer. Traditionally, gas bubbles in the early stages of brewing are generated through the natural cooking process, requiring bountiful levels of water and heat. AB InBev says, however, it is able to simulate the effects of boiling the brew.
The new method involves heating the brew to below boiling point and then blowing nitrogen or CO2 into the tank to create bubbles without changing the taste. The company claims that because the beer is brewed at a lower temperature in the early phase, it can also stay fresh for longer. The bubbles found in the finished product are still to be produced in the normal way, typically by the yeast’s digestion of sugars or by pressurisation in the kegging process.
David De Schutter, the company’s research director for Europe, said: “Boiling and these gas bubbles are the sacred formula in the brewing process. Each brewer goes through a boiling process.
“Our innovation is to heat everything up to just below boiling point, which provides 80% energy savings at this point in time. There is a lot less steam released, which allows you to spend less on water. In our case, we managed to go from 5% evaporated water to less than 1%.”
AB InBev claims that when it has adopted the technique in all its breweries around the world it will reduce its global CO2 emissions by 5% a year, equivalent to the energy consumption of 120,000 families.
Studies suggest there will be 80% less evaporation as a result of a 0.5% reduction in water consumption, said to be “the equivalent of 1,200 Olympic swimming pools”.
The company, which hopes all its breweries will adopt the technique within 10 years, is offering to share the patented technology free of charge with smaller brewers. 
A fee would be charged to the company’s larger rivals in the market. AB InBev has vowed to invest the money in further research to reduce its ecological footprint.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/11/worlds-largest-brewer-ab-inbev-develops-greener-bubbles-in-beer

Warming waters have caused the base of ice near the ocean floor around the south pole to shrink by 1,463 square kilometres – an area the size of Greater London – between 2010 and 2016, according to the new study published in Nature Geoscience.
The research by the UK Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling at the University of Leeds suggests climate change is affecting the Antarctic more than previously believed and is likely to prompt global projections of sea-level rise to be revised upward.
Until recently, the Antarctic was seen as relatively stable. Viewed from above, the extent of land and sea ice in the far south has not changed as dramatically as in the far north. 
But the new study found even a small increase in temperature has been enough to cause a loss of five metres every year from the bottom edge of the ice sheet, some of which is more than 2km underwater.
“What’s happening is that Antarctica is being melted away at its base. We can’t see it, because it’s happening below the sea surface,” said Professor Andrew Shepherd, one of the authors of the paper. “The changes mean that very soon the sea-level contribution from Antarctica could outstrip that from Greenland.”
The study measures the Antarctic’s “grounding line” – the bottommost edge of the ice sheet across 16,000km of coastline. This is done by using elevation data from the European Space Agency’s CryoSat-2 and applying Archimedes’s principle of buoyancy, which relates the thickness of floating ice to the height of its surface.
The greatest declines were seen in west Antarctica. At eight of the ice sheet’s 65 biggest glaciers, the speed of retreat was more than five times the rate of deglaciation since the last ice age. Even in east Antarctica, where some scientists – and many climate deniers – had previously believed ice might be increasing based on surface area, glaciers were at best stable and at worst in retreat when underwater ice was taken into account.
“It should give people more cause for concern,” said Shepherd. “Now that we have mapped the whole edge of the ice sheet, it rules out any chance that parts of Antarctica are advancing. We see retreat in more places and stasis elsewhere. The net effect is that the ice sheet overall is retreating. People can’t say ‘you’ve left a stone unturned’. We’ve looked everywhere now.”
The results could prompt an upward revision of sea-level rise projections. 10 years ago, the main driver was Greenland. More recently, the Antarctic’s estimated contribution has been raised by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. But its forecasts were based on measurements from the two main west Antarctic glaciers – Thwaites and Pine Island – a sample that provides an overly narrow and conservative view of what is happening when compared with the new research.
The study’s lead author, Hannes Konrad, said there was now clear evidence that the underwater glacial retreat is happening across the ice sheet. 
“This retreat has had a huge impact on inland glaciers,” he said, “because releasing them from the sea bed removes friction, causing them to speed up and contribute to global sea level rise.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/02/underwater-melting-of-antarctic-ice-far-greater-than-thought-study-finds

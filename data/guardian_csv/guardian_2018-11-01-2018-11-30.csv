Quite! The owners of a house near ours had a healthy oak well over a hundred years old removed so they could put a swimming pool in their back garden a few years back. I don't think it was reported and as far as I know they experienced no repercussions.
On the other hand, we had to deal with a tree in our front garden that was the result of previous owners (council tenants!) allowing the hedge to grow out of control. The boom of a skip lorry damaged one of the main branches which was overhanging the entrance to a garage area for the local houses, but the council tree officer would only allow minimal tree surgery because the girth of the trees in our 'roadside hedge' meant they were protected!
To this day we aren't allowed to have them removed and replaced with the proper hedge they should have been all along.

It absolutely does matter - the processes are absolutely not the same. When species move ranges under non human induced conditions it takes a long long time and happens gradually - allowing evolution to occur. When you dump rats on new zealand the species there cannot cope and evolution cannot keep place so you get (in essence) a localised mass extinction (and increasingly a global one)
I'm not sure where you get the idea that species move from one side of the globe to the other all the time from? That has literally never happened at the sort of speed we are talking about - evolution is painfully slow. Species ranges change really really slowly as well.
Let's take homo sapiens - a species that evolved in east africa and spread out across the Eurasian continent (one of the fastest and most wide ranging species expansions of all time - especially for mammals) this took hundreds of thousands of years and happened slowly and in a geographically coordianted way - now we are dumping snakes on islands hundreds, if not thousands of miles away This is causing a mass extinctio event (along with habitat destruction) and to a lesser extent hunting that is greater tahn anything that has happened in 65 million years. Now that sounds hyperbolic but it actually isn't - the current extinction rate is hundreds of times faster than the background rate. 
You would expect to see one amphibian species (in the entire world) go extinct approximately every 1000 years - we are seeing orders of magnitude more than that. In the case of amphibains the primary cause is the introduction of an invasive non native fungus - the chytrid fungus. This fungus evolved in Africa (probably) where it evolved in tandem with the African clawed frog -t his species was then exported around the world (alongside the fungus which didn't ddo that species any real harm as the clawed frog had evolved a defence against it). Unfortunately this fungus is pretty much 100% lethal to almost every other amphibain species so as the african clawed frog has been exported around the world the fungus has gone with it and bang, there go native species. Worryingly a similar (and related fungus) has now been discovered in salamanders in the Americas - in exactly the same way', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1543261354000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'this', u'effect': u'a mass extinctio event along with habitat destruction'}], u'author_id': u'12031469', u'in_reply_to': u'123023070', u'id': u'123024571', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'uncommodified', u'text': u'It has many benefits beyond climate change.

Chinese,American, Armenian people are all the same species. 
It's being a non native non human species (if that is more accurate) that is important. 
There are many non native species - personally I would (if possible) remove all of them but as that is not feasible we have to focus on the ones that are doing the most damage.

Under the auspices of the Woodland Trust, an area that stretches 120 miles from Hull to Liverpool will be planted with 50 million trees over the next 25 years. In March, the first trees were put in the ground on hills above Bolton, in Greater Manchester, by an “army of planters” composed of local community members, volunteers, funding bodies and MPs.
There is, certainly, an urgent environmental need to get trees back in our landscape. We lost more ancient woods – tens of thousands of them – in the 40 years after the second world war than in the previous 400 years. The UK has only 13% woodland cover, compared with the European average of 37%. Quite apart from being beautiful things, trees – like all vegetation – absorb CO2 from the atmosphere, and the northern forest is intended to help the UK government meet its carbon emissions target by 2050.
Better for biodiversity and the taxpayer would be to allow insects, mammals, the wind and birds to do the tree-planting
But there’s a much more effective way of re-establishing trees in the wider countryside than putting a spade in the ground – and one that has far greater benefits for biodiversity, carbon sequestration and the trees’ health, and that would save us a fortune in financial and environmental costs. And that is natural regeneration – let the trees plant themselves.
The reason this doesn’t happen nowadays is our demonisation of thorny scrub. Hawthorn, blackthorn, dog-rose, gorse and bramble are nature’s barbed wire. These species provide saplings with protection from browsing by deer and rabbits; shelter from the wind; a buffer against drought and excessive rain; and nutrients via mutual mycorrhizal connections underground. Thorny scrub is also one of the most biodiverse habitats – providing a rich source of berries, seeds, nectar, pollen and nuts for small mammals, insects and birds, as well as protection from predators.
But we’ve forgotten about this precious resource in recent times. In the days before plastics and mass manufacture, thorny scrub provided us with charcoal, medicines, dyes, food, fodder, thatching, furniture, gunpowder and tools. Above all, it was valued as a nursery for trees. “The thorn is the mother of the oak” is an ancient forestry saying. Thorny scrub was considered so valuable that a 1768 statute in the New Forest imposed three months’ forced labour and lashes of the whip on anyone found extracting it. Now, however, we consider scrub “wasteland” and eradicate it wherever it appears, and even on nature reserves, volunteers spend weekends“scrub-bashing”.
The modern system of establishing trees relies entirely on humans, and saplings produced in nurseries. Even with a volunteer workforce this is expensive. Ultimately the northern forest is expected to cost £500m. And it is manifestly inefficient. Commercial saplings – bare-root “whips” – are vulnerable, and can easily dry out and die before, or even after, they’re planted. They are not as well connected to the soil as naturally established seedlings, and often lack the appropriate fungal associates. They need to be individually protected by tree guards, almost invariably carbon-intensive polypropylene cylinders tied with plastic ties to treated wooden stakes. Even if the areas to be planted are protected from deer by a perimeter fence, tree guards are poor protection against burrowing rabbits and voles, which cannot be fenced out. Humidity inside the tubes can induce rot and mildews. Using saplings from commercial nurseries also carries a risk of importing disease. Chalara, or ash dieback, was spread into the UK this way.
And anyway, is one enormous plantation what we want for our northern forest? Closed-canopy woodland is remarkably species-poor. Even ancient woodland is not the biodiverse wonderland it is often held to be. Species monitoring in Lady Park Wood in the Forest of Dean and the Mens Nature Reserve in Sussex – considered to be some of our oldest surviving stands of trees – shows a downward trajectory for biodiversity. There may be saproxylic (dead-wood-specialising) fungi and beetles in these densely shaded woods, but there is precious little else. With no sunlight, there’s no birdsong, no thrum of pollinating insects, no wildflowers.
Herein lies the great “forest” misconception. Underpinning the northern forest project is the idea that Britain was originally ubiquitous closed-canopy woodland. Before human impact, it’s said, a squirrel could have run from John o’Groats to Land’s End on the tops of trees. Dense forest tends to be the state we aspire to when aiming for nature restoration. But this is the stuff of fairytales. Many of our shrubs and trees – including hazel, wild apple, wild pear, wild cherry, rowan, dogwood, common privet, Scots pine and oak (that quintessentially English tree) – are light-demanding species that cannot regenerate in closed-canopy conditions. They point to a much more open landscape – a wood-pasture system driven by free-roaming herds of grazing and browsing animals, where trees regenerated out in the open, within thorny scrub. This is the landscape described by Oliver Rackham, our late, great woodland expert, as the “wildwood”. It is the landscape of the New Forest and all the other hunting forests of medieval England – a dynamic mosaic of gigantic open-grown trees and groves of all species and ages, grazing “lawns”, water meadows and thorny scrub. Paradise for wildlife.
Far better for biodiversity and the taxpayer would be to allow small mammals, the wind and birds to do the tree planting for us. A single jay can plant 7,500 acorns in four weeks. Carrying these highly calorific oak nuts in its gullet, six at a time, the jay flies away to bury them a commodious distance from the parent oak tree, often in, or near, protective thorny scrub, as a store for feeding itself through the winter and its young in spring. The acorns that are not recovered by the jay end up developing into saplings.
Rewilding – enabling natural processes to function as they are meant to – allows the jay and all the other seed dispersers to do their job. But this is not something that organisations like the Woodland Trust have embraced with any real enthusiasm. Their fundraising model depends on grant aid, and the messy, competitive, variable responses of nature do not fit within a grant system that requires precise costs, targets and predictability. The appeal of physically digging a hole and planting a tree is also a powerful way of recruiting donors and volunteers. If charities simply left it to nature, a major means of forging those relationships would vanish.
It’s encouraging that in June the government appointed its first “tree champion”, William Worsley, the former president of the Country Landowners Association. As well as protecting existing trees he will spearhead the planting of millions of new ones. But I urge him to rethink how we do this – and to consider areas where we could return to the richer forest systems of old, to the wildwood, a landscape naturally imbued with spirit of place, where the thorn can once again be the “mother of the oak”.

In April last year, the EPA replaced its online climate change section with a holding page that said the content was being updated to “reflect the agency’s new direction under President Donald Trump”.
Information previously found at epa.gov/climatechange made it clear that human activity was warming the planet, resulting in harm to Americans’ health as well as crucial ecosystems on which humans depend.
The “update” page has now given way to a page that simply states: “We want to help you find what you are looking for.” Below, there are links to search other areas of the EPA website, as well as to an archived “snapshot” of the site from the day before Trump became president in January 2017. The switch was observed by the Environmental Data &amp; Governance Initiative, which tracks changes in government websites.
“It’s an embarrassment. It is a ghost page,” said Judith Enck, who was EPA regional administrator during Barack Obama’s presidency. “It’s a bit like Amazon not allowing the public to order books via its website – it’s that fundamental. There’s no other issue at the EPA more important than climate change; it affects air, water, health and whether large parts of the world will survive.”
Scott Pruitt, a climate change skeptic who was Trump’s pick as EPA administrator until he resigned in July amid a long-running ethics scandal, repeatedly questioned basic scientific understanding of climate change while he headed the agency, such as whether carbon dioxide is a primary driver of planetary warming.
The EPA under the Trump administration has attempted to roll back all key measures designed to address climate change, such as limits on pollution from coal plants, rules to prevent methane emissions from oil and gas drilling and tighter fuel efficiency standards for cars. Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist who is now acting EPA administrator, has said “federal regulations are not necessary to drive greenhouse gas reductions”.
A senior EPA official, who asked not to be named, said: “Wheeler has been somewhat meticulously going through the mess Pruitt left behind and I think is finally getting to the place of making some decisions on stuff.” The official added: “I’ve been surprised that we are still even talking about climate change and that there are still people nominally assigned to that beat in the air office.”
Enck said that EPA career staff are “frustrated” and “ashamed” about the new stance on climate change and urged her former colleagues to speak out.
The administration also began taking the ax to climate change language across other government websites in the spring of 2017.
“The EPA website is used by decision and policy makers, not just for high school student assignments,” she said. “The lack of timely, accurate information is part of a much deeper problem that the agency is on the sidelines of the most urgent environment issue of our time.”

A former treasurer and deputy prime minister of Australia thinks that taxes are used to pay for stuff.
So at no stage when Wayne Swan was setting tax rates did he understand why he was doing it?
That's like a surgeon randomly chopping away at a person's body without any idea of what is causing the pain. Of course the difference between the surgeon and a treasurer is the former is working off science whereas the latter is working off whichever economic/political doctrine he's chosen to follow. The treasurer has more in common with a witch doctor.
A country like Australia, which has its own currency, does not raise revenue through taxation. That's not what taxes are for. Taxes have two purposes, Wayne Swan:
a) to remove money from the economy so as to manage inflation; andb) to manage behaviour e.g. reducing smoking or, relevantly, reducing carbon emissions. 
I agree with Wayne Swan that governments need to spend money, for example, to tackle earthquakes.. But governments do not need to fund that through taxation. They simply need to spend money since if they have their own currency then they are the sole source of said currency. 
Other than our incessant greed, politicians total ignorance about how government finances work is the single biggest obstacle to tackling climate change. Particularly since it results in the ludicrous situation where governments are more concerned about deficits than climate change.
Here's a stat I never get tired of quoting - what some countries spent in WW2 dollars:
1. U.S : $296 billion (roughly $4,104 billion dollars today)2. Germany : $272 billion3. Britain : $120 billion4. Soviet Union : $192 billion5. Italy : $94 billion6. Japan : $56 billion.
While the US was spending all of that money on war it spent the equivalent of about $25b on the Marshall Project bringing the finest minds together to split the atom. 
After WW2 the US spent about $ 110b on the Marshall Plan because of a fear of communism taking over Europe and another $109b on the Apollo mission.
If we want to tackle climate change we need this level of spending. Sure, this level of spending will result in governments utilising more resources in the economy (which in reality is the only restriction on government spending) and so this would then lead to reductions in private expenditure and possibly a decline in new iPhones being released every year. I'm not saying there's such a thing as a free lunch.

A Budget surplus isn't the blessing you imagine it to be.To arrive at a surplus, the Federal govt cuts expenditure, withdrawing money from the economy. As it does so, private sector debt grows in mathematical accordance.Soon, smaller businesses close, unemployment rises, recession looms.Can recession be staved off ?Yes, if an already indebted private sector takes on even more debt.See, a Commonwealth surplus is actually a nifty pea-and-thimble trick, by which debt is shifted from the Federal govt. to the private sector.Costello presided over TEN surpluses, a record of economic vandalism unparalleled in Australian history. In doing so, he laid the foundations of private sector indebtedness which still has Australia in the private debt per capita top ten internationally. Nothing to be proud of.So let's be grateful Swannie didn't deliver that surplus. Want a Commonwealth surplus ?Fine.Then expect private sector debt to increase accordingly.

We are not talking here about GHG emissions, but about nuclear waste and to ignore or deny such waste hardly constitutes a respect for the truth.

Nuclear waste is managed. It is not willfully dumped into the environment. Spent nuclear fuel straight out of a reactor is extremely hazardous, but it is safely managed. Show me credible evidence of a single fatality anywhere in the last 50 years due to the management of spent nuclear fuel. I have not been able to find one. In contrast oil and gas pipeline accidents in the US alone have caused over 500 fatalities since the 1980s. There is simply no comparison. And that is the truth.

But if you want to use renewable energy perhaps you could tell us how many accidents or deaths it has caused.

A lot more than nuclear power. The Banqiao Dam Disaster caused the deaths of 171,000 people and made 11 million homeless. It is by far the worst industrial accident ever by a very large margin. Could there be a repeat? Yes there could. The Mosal Dam in Iraq is at risk of failure. Such an event would be catastrophic:
The main scenario analysed in this study, where the dam is 26% destroyed, the level of the lake is at its maximum value of 330m, and most of the lake’s water is allowed to flow out fast, results in a very high wave of water (in places 25m high, mean height around 12m) arriving at Mosul city after 1h40min. The capital Baghdad is reached after about 3.5 days with a max water height of 8m and a mean of around 2m. The simulations suggest that in the above scenario a total of more than 6 million people (close to one sixth of the country’s population) will be affected by floodwaters, with two million of them facing water of more than 2m. Water heights of more than 10m would inundate an area with 270 000 people, most of them in Mosul city and its surroundings, whose lives, houses and infrastructure would risk complete destruction.
No credible nuclear power accident could possibly come anywhere near this. So why aren't you anti-nukes campaigning against big dams?

Regarding ""banging on about renewables""
The tragedy of global warming, is we are the first generation that knows how to make energy sustainably.
In Pennsylvania during the early days of the US there were furnaces and forges powered by charcoal used to make the iron which built the East.
They’d cut down a lot of trees and burn them under ground with low oxygen to make charcoal. When Europeans first came to N America they said that a squirrel could go up a tree on the East Coast and stay in trees without touching ground all the way to the Mississippi River.
They cut down so many of these trees that a crisis developed and the Pennsylvania Government had to step in and tell people they couldn’t cut trees down on their own property. (think about that if you are against government intervention and suspicious of science ‘cause there are crises coming that will require much government intervention).
We were burning our way through whale oil when the discovery of fossil fuels saved the whales, and now we’re burning fossil fuels one million times faster than nature replenishes them which is heating the planet dangerously fast.

After Irma, Maria, Harvey, hurricane Florence left a devastating landscape in the Caribbean. Extreme temperatures across the northern hemisphere have caused devastating fires from Europe to the US. Dozens have been killed in the Philippines after typhoon Mangkhut triggered landslides.
And the worst consequences of climate change are yet to come.
It is a huge challenge for rich countries and for developing nations, a sisyphean task: how to collect enough revenue to respond to major catastrophes, while at the same time trying to lift billions of people out of poverty?
Look at Indonesia. Disasters are a familiar tragedy in the world’s fourth most populous nation, with its thousands of islands across hundreds of miles of ocean. This should make disaster risk planning crucial. It is not the case, as the latest earthquake and tsunami showed. Reports revealed that parts of the tsunami alert system didn’t work. In some areas, there were no sirens at all. The death toll is still climbing.
Indonesia is the largest economy in south-east Asia and is projected to become the fourth largest economy in the world by 2050, behind China, the US and the EU. However, this prediction depends on its capacity to secure sufficient public revenue. It is the only way to finance, for example, the preparation and maintenance of earthquake-resistant buildings and infrastructure and warning systems.
With big companies paying less and less taxes, most governments have the same answer: austerity
Natural disasters tend to worsen economic inequality in already critical situations, such as that in Indonesia. While many have been lifted out of poverty in the past two decades, the gap between the rich and the poor has grown faster than in any other south-east Asian country. The government now has an ambitious medium term strategy to deal with wide wage disparities and dramatically unequal access to infrastructure, education and health services.
Addressing all these challenges requires revenue.
At an average of 17.6% of GDP, tax collection in the Asia-Pacific region is among the lowest in the world, a level regarded by experts as totally insufficient to achieve sustainable development goals. And with big companies paying less and less taxes, most governments have the same answer: austerity.
In the past decade, the average corporate tax rate in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) region has fallen from 30 to 22%, reflecting global trends. While these lower tax rates may attract higher levels of foreign investment, they come at a very high price: less fiscal revenues means less money to construct vital public services and infrastructure, not to mention less money to prepare for the effects of natural disasters.
The only winners in this race to the bottom are multinationals, which end up paying almost no taxes. Vito Tanzi, the former head of the IMF’s Tax Policy Division, has branded such tax-avoiding companies “fiscal termites” for eating away the foundations of tax systems around the world. In his recent book, Termites of the State, Tanzi acknowledges that while no fiscal house is fully insulated from these tax pests, developing countries – especially those with mineral resources – are particularly vulnerable.
Developing economies such as Indonesia rely heavily on corporate income tax bases. The IMF reports that the revenue lost from tax evasion in developing countries is 1.3 times larger, as a share of GDP, than it is in advanced economies.
It’s a tough fight that involves tackling power elites, overcoming deep institutional resistance, pursuing inclusive forms of growth, eliminating unacceptable levels of poverty and building quality health and education systems for all.
But the fight back is underway.
The global debate about the tax dodging behaviour of unscrupulous multinationals is beginning to pay dividends. Civil society campaigning has led to the creation of a template for country by country reporting which could eventually expose the scale of tax avoidance in the region. The Independent Commission for the Reform of International Corporate Taxation (ICRICT), of which I am a member, is putting forward a bold agenda of international tax rules from a perspective of global public interest rather than advancing national corporate interest.
In the last decade Indonesia has made great progress towards its sustainable development goals. What a tragedy it would be therefore if this emerging Asia-Pacific middle class fails to emerge because multinational companies continue to get away with dodging tax and ransacking these nations of their wealth.

Devin Nunes, the committee’s outgoing Republican chairman and a Trump ally, obstructed efforts by Democrats to investigate possible collusion with Russia by Trump’s campaign team, and closed the investigation with leads left unexplored.
Nunes also declined to share information with Mueller.
But Adam Schiff, Nunes’s likely Democratic replacement, has promised to resume the committee’s inquiries and pursue new avenues such as the Trump Organization’s business links to Russia.
The extension of the Republican majority in the Senate, however, may embolden Trump to nominate a harder-line replacement for the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, fired the day after the election, in order to get rid of Mueller and shut down the special counsel’s investigation. If that happens, expect some Democrats to propose rehiring Mueller as an independent counsel to continue his investigation on behalf of the House. Jon Swaine
Now that Democrats have the House, President Trump’s dream of a “big, beautiful wall” will be all the more elusive.
Before the midterms, the outgoing House speaker, Paul Ryan, promised there would be a “big fight” over the border wall immediately after the election. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said this was still the plan on Wednesday morning, but Republicans now go into that fight against an emboldened Democratic party.
By 8 December, Congress must reach a deal on Department of Homeland Security funding, including the wall – a narrow window for Republicans to secure significant wall funding before Democrats take control of the House in January.
House Democrats have also said they will try to restore protections for Dreamers, undocumented immigrants who arrived in the US as children. Voters on both sides of the aisle have expressed broad support for creating a pathway to citizenship for this population and the Trump administration has used them as a bargaining chip since revoking their protections in 2017. Amanda Holpuch
Unless Trump gets re-elected in 2020, it now looks certain his massive tax bill will be his last. That $1.5tn giveaway, Trump’s largest congressional achievement, mainly benefited the very wealthy and corporations and has polled badly with voters, so badly that Republicans barely mentioned it in the run-up to the midterms. He has since promised another tax cut aimed at the middle class.
Now, with Democrats in control of the House, any legislation will be hard to pass.
There are areas of common ground – Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway has already mentioned infrastructure – but given the partisan divide in Washington, striking a deal is going to be difficult.
The picture on trade also becomes more complex as the president’s powers are curtailed. Politicians in China, Europe, Canada, Mexico and elsewhere will all be watching to see how his defeat will affect the trade disputes he has fueled.
Trump can still use executive orders to force through change but the president’s chances of passing meaningful legislation were hobbled on Tuesday. Now he will be buffeted by the larger, outside forces that will decide the US’s economic forces – forces that are beyond his control. Dominic Rushe
Republican efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act (ACA) at a national level are almost guaranteed to halt now that the House is in the hands of the Democrats.
At the state level, Democratic governors-elect in Kansas, Maine and Wisconsin could expand ACA protections that Republican state leaders rejected. And in Idaho, Nebraska and Utah citizens voted to expand access to free or low-cost health coverage to the poor through Medicaid.
Before the election, Nancy Pelosi, who is expected to return to her former role as House speaker, said a legislative priority would be lowering pharmaceutical drug costs – an issue that could have bipartisan support.
And reproductive rights groups have called last night’s results a victory. Federal efforts to limit women’s reproductive rights will be challenged with Democrats in control of the House. And in Michigan, Kansas and New Mexico, the three governors-elect have a record for defending women’s reproductive rights. Amanda Holpuch
Attempts to ramp up action to address climate change faltered, most notably in Washington state where voters rejected a proposal to implement a price on carbon pollution. The plan, which was vigorously opposed by oil and gas interests including BP, would have placed a $15 fee on each ton of CO2 and potentially acted as a springboard for other states to do likewise.
Washington state voters have now rejected carbon pricing on three separate occasions, raising doubts as to whether the concept, backed by many economists as the best way to drive down emissions and avoid disastrous climate change, will gain traction in the US.
Elsewhere, a ballot proposal to require that Arizona get half of its electricity from renewable sources like solar and wind was rejected by voters in the state. In Colorado, the fossil fuel industry spent $40m to successfully fend off an attempt to impose a half-mile buffer between drilling operations and people’s homes. In Florida, however, voters backed a measure to ban oil and gas drilling in state waters. Oliver Milman
Democrats picked up seven governor’s seats by early Wednesday.
The governor races are particularly important because of a once-in-a-decade redistricting process due to begin in 2021. States will be required to redraw congressional districts to make sure each one represents the same number of residents.
That’s where gerrymandering – the process where a party draws often oddly shaped districts to best maximize their voters – can occur.
State legislatures do the redrawing, but it is the state’s governor who has the ability to sign or veto the new congressional map in their state. That means a Democrat governor elected on Tuesday to a four-year term would have the power to prevent Republicans – who have become experts at gerrymandering, most notably in Pennsylvania – from redrawing districts in a way which would benefit them in upcoming elections to the House of Representatives.
Florida was seen as particularly important as the state is expected to gain two congressional seats after the 2020 census. That’s down to a long-term population shift away from the north-east and midwest towards states like Florida and Texas. Unfortunately for Democrats, Andrew Gillum lost on Tuesday.

Why have most of his wonderful programmes been blind to the tsunami of environmental destruction we have unleashed? Some years ago I confronted Alastair Fothergill, series producer of many of Attenborough’s programmes, at a public meeting: “The Earth is in distress: why do you ignore human impacts?” His response: “Our audience does not want to be disturbed.” What about the mess that future generations will be left with? 
In the 1980s I worked at Channel 4 for Fragile Earth, which broadcast some 20 environmental documentaries a year. But as soon as Michael Grade took over as CEO in 1988, he sacked the commissioning editor – advertisers did not like disturbing programmes. And so the global devastation continues largely unreported in TV documentaries.
British TV has also systematically deprived us of information about solutions to the world’s environmental problems. In some countries, major new green industries are flourishing, but viewers in Britain are being left uninformed. We need well-presented programmes helping us to make the right decisions – as consumers, as parents and as voters. Herbert GirardetAuthor and consultant; co-founder, World Future Council
• If David Attenborough is unwilling or unable to offer potential solutions to the world’s environmental crisis, perhaps the Guardian should invite those who may have solutions to offer these in a series of features with global mass-media and social-media partners. Contributors could include people who understand that population can be lowered and welfare improved by global development based on justice and greater power for women: there are many examples of this which expose the intellectual poverty of neo-Malthusians.
It could include the ideas of economists who reject conventional “growth” as the only way forward. It might tap into the “feasible utopia” ideas of red-green media and thinktanks plus the work of academics who lead the search for sustainability. NGOs and unions could have a role, and there would be space for scientists – but not the Tomorrow’s World types who promised cosy technological fixes for all our problems, passifying a bedazzled public.

• The BBC has been guilty of ignoring or dumbing down important information about climate for a long time. Many other organisations that should know better are also guilty of not shouting loud enough about the consequences of global warming: there has been consistent fear among NGOs that frightening people would have adverse effects. They are all complicit in this cover-up.Maureen EvershedDorridge, West Midlands
• I couldn’t agree more with George Monbiot. We are not children; we do not need to be protected from the truth because it may make us uncomfortable. Our planet is on the cusp of a downward spiral leading to monumental disaster unless we all do something very quickly. And yet the BBC appears to be more interested in audience numbers, still determined to make safe, appealing programmes with David Attenborough at the helm. He is in an almost unique position to make a powerful statement about the remaining wonders, which still exist, but will most certainly disappear in the not too distant future.
And with their disappearance our own species will surely not survive. My generation, and David Attenborough, will be long gone when what’s left of the Earth’s future population will be struggling to stay alive on a very bleak, barren and silent planet. Will they look back and be glad that we were entertained?Carol KnightTisbury, Wiltshire
• I sympathise with the concern that George Monbiot expresses. I think there is a problem that people are liable to be put off by all the warnings of the disastrous consequences. It is very difficult to tread the right line between very bad predictions and reassuring us that something can be done. Avoiding single-use plastics is something people can easily aim for and feel that they are preventing a whale from being killed by plastic. I felt sad to see the recent pictures of all the plastic that one whale had ingested. Then I thought of all the creatures that will never be born because of climate change, and that is even more sad.Janet PoliakoffNottingham
• Your excellent article reporting the devastating effects of humans on other animals illustrates how important it is to avoid further increasing our environmental footprint (Annihilation of wildlife a threat to civilisation, scientists warn, 30 October). A policy promoted by the Guardian, and supported by its readers, requires a huge increase in our environmental footprint: reducing greenhouse gas emissions by replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy.
For example, the late David MacKay showed that in order to meet UK energy needs, solar, wind and biomass “farms’ would need to occupy 5%, 10% and 75 % of our available land area, respectively. The required offshore wind turbines would occupy an area equivalent to a 13km thick strip around the entire UK shore. Wave machines would need to stretch across the entire 500km Atlantic coastline.
Can we reduce greenhouse gas emission without increasing our footprint on this planet? Yes, by exploiting the densest form of energy: nuclear. Although feared by the public, nuclear has the best safety record of all forms of energy, and is far safer than fossil fuel. Even the most catastrophic nuclear accidents, such as the ones at Chernobyl and Fukushima, eventually caused very few deaths (43 after Chernobyl and none at Fukushima).If we want to protect other species from humans and avoid catastrophic climate change, we need to shift our focus from renewables and expand nuclear energy.

Global warming is making heatwaves more common and wildlife is being annihilated, and the study may reveal a way in which these two trends are linked. The scientists behind the findings said there could also be some relevance for humans: the sperm counts of western men have halved in the last 40 years.
Researchers studied beetles because their 400,000 species represent about a quarter of all known species. Insect populations are plunging worldwide as temperatures rise, falling by about 80% in 30 years in Puerto Rico’s rainforest and by 75% in German nature reserves.
Insects are such an integral part of life, as pollinators and prey, that scientists say their decline could lead to “ecological Armageddon”. Little is known about the precise causes of the decline, though climate change, habitat destruction and global use of pesticides are considered probable factors.
The research, published in the Nature Communications journal, found that exposing beetles to a five-day heatwave in the laboratory reduced sperm production by three-quarters; females were unaffected.
“Beetles are thought to constitute a quarter of biodiversity, so these results are very important for understanding how species react to climate change,” said Kris Sales, at the University of East Anglia, who led the work.
Other research has shown that heat can damage male reproduction in humans as well as cows, sheep and other mammals.
“There could be relevance for human fertility,” said Prof Matt Gage, co-leader of the UEA research group. “The paradox is that one of the reasons the climate is warming up and we are having more heatwaves is there are too many humans. So maybe this is a leveller.”
Stuart Wigby, of the University of Oxford, who was not involved in the study, said: “Given what we already know about the generality of the sensitivity of sperm to heat, there is every reason to expect that similar effects would be seen in other insects and also in mammals including humans.”
The red flour beetle used in the experiments is a tropical species that thrives at 35C. When exposed to temperatures of 5C and 7C higher, male fertility plummeted. While these were high temperatures, 90 countries had experienced them in recent years, said Gage.
After being exposed to a heatwave, the number of offspring produced by males fell by half. Even more worryingly, harmful effects were inherited by the males they produced – their lives were 20% shorter and they in turn produced fewer offspring.
The most extreme impact was in male beetles exposed to two heatwaves 10 days apart – their offspring production fell by 99%. “It kind of wipes them out,” Gage said.
Sales added: “Insects in nature are likely to experience multiple heatwave events, which could become a problem for population productivity if male reproduction cannot adapt or recover.”
Further experiments are under way to find out whether the beetles can adapt to heat shocks and to examine how other species, such as butterflies, cope with raised temperatures.
The research is among the first of its type on cold-blooded creatures. “There is a big gap, as most of life on Earth is cold-blooded and it is much more directly affected by temperature variations,” Gage said. “We’ve shown that sperm function is an especially sensitive trait when the environment heats up, and in [species] representing a huge amount of global biodiversity.”
How the heat damages the sperm is not fully understood, though the researchers noticed damage to sperm membranes. It is likely that the DNA in the sperm is also damaged, meaning harm can be passed to offspring. Most warm-blooded male animals protect sperm from excessive heat by having testes outside the body, leaving them several degrees cooler.
Wigby said the understanding of factors that reduced male fertility was poor. “So any studies that add to our understanding of the basic mechanisms underlying variation in male fertility is valuable. Showing that the harm can occur in a heatwave-like scenario is new and important, as is the demonstration of transgenerational effects. However, the applicability to the real world is always an issue for lab studies.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/13/heatwaves-wipe-out-male-insect-fertility-beetles-study

Without wanting to be harsh, that may be part of the problem. I've put another comment to this effect, but I just can't see how the article supports the claim that 'the Earth is in a death spiral'. Like other commenters, I'm assuming this means that humanity will be wiped out (not the planet as a whole- that would be crazy). But the article doesn't seem to spell out how or when we will go extinct.
Perhaps it's an issue of scientific knowledge- perhaps if I knew enough, I'd be able to read about (say) a 10 degree rise in temperature and say 'ah, that means there's no chance for any humans to survive'.

BQSTART
First off, no single temperature record from anywhere can prove or disprove global warming, because the temperature is a local record, and one site is not the whole world. One of the lessons drawn from comparing Greenland to Antarctica and many other places is that some of the temperature changes (the ice-age cycling) are very widespread and shared among most records, but other of the temperature changes (sometimes called millennial, or abrupt, or Younger-Dryas-type) are antiphased between Greenland and the south, and still other temperature changes may be unrelated between different places (one anomalously cold year in Greenland does not tell you the temperature anomaly in Australia or Peru).

Earth has a Power crisis, not a Clean energy crisis.
Steam engines have been around since the 1800s and Earths core has been hot since before algae was a thing.Instead of drilling for oil we could drill for thermal vents & energy could be practically free. (Bonus: don’t have to find the heat like you do the oil, just go deeper into the ground until water gets hot enough to spin a turbine.)Or how about making the moon power generators. High & low tides are predictable. Waves are always moving & it’s an actual ocean of kinetic energy waiting to be farmed. Chain a bunch of buoys to a generator or make them crank a lever.Deep out at sea are 100 foot waves and all it would take is a few giant skyscraper sized buoys to crank out steady energy for as long as the moon orbits Earth.If you’re familiar with Rick and Morty you’d be making the moon mash a Gooble Box instead of a microverse of slavery with extra steps.Energy is everywhere and free for the taking; Power on the other hand is why Universal Health Care isn’t treated as a general human right when it literally benefits everyone.Energy solutions can build on themselves if we are willing to sacrifice capitalism for whatever rises from its ashes. 
For instance we could treat cannabis like it’s the new gold.Food, clothing, shelter, air, fuel, fun and more are all rolled up into one family of plants. Naturally it makes sense to keep a lot around. Greed fueling climate improvement with Cannabis as currency!��There will always be a need for fresh water. Distilling seawater could replace coal mining as an industry; Clear is the new Black. With more usable water available & cannabis restrictions removed, everyone can grow their own “money”.Hemp grows fast so there’ll be a lot of it, which is good because we could then burn it to fuel turbines that produce even more renewable energy serving as an intrinsic energy tax.And that’s not even going into Solar, Wind or Hydrogen Fuel Cell solutions. 
With Green as the new Gold and Clear as the new Black, prepping for the future becomes the World’s economy & everyone’s paycheck instead of the cannibalistic capitalism which thrives on tragedy.The focus of the world’s economy should be on enriching humans as a whole instead of pursuing money to collect the most cool points.
Mankind’s problem is not an Energy Crisis, it’s a deliberate Power Shortage.

Your claim that this kind of behaviour has been taught during the last 30 - 40 years is nonsense. 
Replace your aviation scenario with a coach and horses scenario: are you claiming that rich people in the past did not hire or own their own personal carriages to avoid having to travel with others in cramped public coaches?
You might respond that the difference is that today we know that selfish actions have a bad impact on our environment, but i) that is not the point I was responding to; and ii) if you're not living an environmentally neutral lifestyle you are always going to be in the position of a hypocrite if you castigate selfish behaviour by others while causing harm to the environment yourself.
Owning a private jet is nothing more from trying to make your life as comfortable and convenient as possible. You and I do the same when we decide to drive somewhere, or even take a bus, instead of walking or cycling or not going, or when we turn up the heating another notch. Everyone does it.

That is NOT how it is working! Our ruling clique will never ask such a question if there is any risk of YES as an answer. 
Über-wealth does not merely drive greed; it also drives a contempt for even the immediate future. Über-rich may well accept the nemesis of climate change, but they are the ultimate hedonists. They will happily sacrifice 99% of today’s humans and all future generation to their psychopathic fascination with money and power and the women and fast cars that it buys. Hence the extent to which global ruling cliques are turning to authoritarianism to retain their hold on power. Rightist pogroms against refugees are intended to entrench an automatic refusal of any assistance to any afflicted group. Both climate change and refugees are warnings of the need to adapt to survive, but our ruling clique is determined to block us from acting on the message.
Capitalism therefore certainly does not seek to acknowledge let alone resolve the problems of anthropogenic climate change – it is based on exponential waste and the economic and political power arising from capitalist means of production. As is obvious, one aspect of ruling clique propaganda is to deny the problem.

It will take radical action to save us | George Monbiot,article,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/14/earth-death-spiral-radical-action-climate-breakdown,0,"It was a moment of the kind that changes lives. At a press conference held by climate activists Extinction Rebellion last week, two of us journalists pressed the organisers on whether their aims were realistic. They have called, for example, for UK carbon emissions to be reduced to net zero by 2025. Wouldn’t it be better, we asked, to pursue some intermediate aims?
A young woman called Lizia Woolf stepped forward. She hadn’t spoken before, but the passion, grief and fury of her response was utterly compelling. “What is it that you are asking me as a 20-year-old to face and to accept about my future and my life? … This is an emergency. We are facing extinction. When you ask questions like that, what is it you want me to feel?” We had no answer.
Softer aims might be politically realistic, but they are physically unrealistic. Only shifts commensurate with the scale of our existential crises have any prospect of averting them. Hopeless realism, tinkering at the edges of the problem, got us into this mess. It will not get us out.
Public figures talk and act as if environmental change will be linear and gradual. But the Earth’s systems are highly complex, and complex systems do not respond to pressure in linear ways. When these systems interact (because the world’s atmosphere, oceans, land surface and lifeforms do not sit placidly within the boxes that make study more convenient), their reactions to change become highly unpredictable. Small perturbations can ramify wildly. Tipping points are likely to remain invisible until we have passed them. We could see changes of state so abrupt and profound that no continuity can be safely assumed.
Only one of the many life support systems on which we depend – soils, aquifers, rainfall, ice, the pattern of winds and currents, pollinators, biological abundance and diversity – need fail for everything to slide. For example, when Arctic sea ice melts beyond a certain point, the positive feedbacks this triggers (such as darker water absorbing more heat, melting permafrost releasing methane, shifts in the polar vortex) could render runaway climate breakdown unstoppable. When the Younger Dryas period ended 11,600 years ago, temperatures rose 10C within a decade.
I don’t believe such a collapse is yet inevitable, or that a commensurate response is either technically or economically impossible. When the US joined the second world war in 1941, it replaced a civilian economy with a military economy within months. As Jack Doyle records in his book Taken for a Ride, “In one year, General Motors developed, tooled and completely built from scratch 1,000 Avenger and 1,000 Wildcat aircraft … Barely a year after Pontiac received a navy contract to build anti-shipping missiles, the company began delivering the completed product to carrier squadrons around the world.” And this was before advanced information technology made everything faster.
The problem is political. A fascinating analysis by the social science professor Kevin MacKay contends that oligarchy has been a more fundamental cause of the collapse of civilisations than social complexity or energy demand. Control by oligarchs, he argues, thwarts rational decision-making, because the short-term interests of the elite are radically different to the long-term interests of society. This explains why past civilisations have collapsed “despite possessing the cultural and technological know-how needed to resolve their crises”. Economic elites, which benefit from social dysfunction, block the necessary solutions.
The oligarchic control of wealth, politics, media and public discourse explains the comprehensive institutional failure now pushing us towards disaster. Think of Donald Trump and his cabinet of multi-millionaires; the influence of the Koch brothers in funding rightwing organisations; the Murdoch empire and its massive contribution to climate science denial; or the oil and motor companies whose lobbying prevents a faster shift to new technologies.
It is not just governments that have failed to respond, though they have failed spectacularly. Public sector broadcasters have systematically shut down environmental coverage, while allowing the opaquely funded lobbyists that masquerade as thinktanks to shape public discourse and deny what we face. Academics, afraid to upset their funders and colleagues, have bitten their lips.
Even the bodies that claim to be addressing our predicament remain locked within destructive frameworks. Last Wednesday I attended a meeting about environmental breakdown at the Institute for Public Policy Research. Many people in the room seemed to understand that continued economic growth is incompatible with sustaining the Earth’s systems.
As the author Jason Hickel points out, a decoupling of rising GDP from global resource use has not happened and will not happen. While 50bn tonnes of resources used per year is roughly the limit the Earth’s systems can tolerate, the world is already consuming 70bn tonnes. At current rates of economic growth, this will rise to 180bn tonnes by 2050. Maximum resource efficiency, coupled with massive carbon taxes, would reduce this at best to 95bn tonnes: still way beyond environmental limits. Green growth, as members of the institute appear to accept, is physically impossible.
Yet on the same day, the same institute announced a major new economics prize for “ambitious proposals to achieve a step-change improvement in the growth rate”. It wants ideas that will enable economic growth rates in the UK at least to double. The announcement was accompanied by the usual blah about sustainability, but none of the judges of the prize has a discernible record of environmental interest.
Those to whom we look for solutions trundle on as if nothing has changed. As if the accumulating evidence has no purchase on their minds. Decades of institutional failure ensures that only “unrealistic” proposals – the repurposing of economic life, with immediate effect – now have a realistic chance of stopping the planetary death spiral. And only those who stand outside the failed institutions can lead this effort.
Two tasks need to be performed simultaneously: throwing ourselves at the possibility of averting collapse, as Extinction Rebellion is doing, slight though this possibility may appear; and preparing ourselves for the likely failure of these efforts, terrifying as this prospect is. Both tasks require a complete revision of our relationship with the living planet.
Because we cannot save ourselves without contesting oligarchic control, the fight for democracy and justice and the fight against environmental breakdown are one and the same. Do not allow those who have caused this crisis to define the limits of political action. Do not allow those whose magical thinking got us into this mess to tell us what can and cannot be done.

New forests would lock up carbon but also help to limit the more frequent floods expected with global warming.
The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) said land currently used to produce food would need to be converted to woodland, growing crops to produce energy and for new homes to accommodate the growing population. Up to 17% of cropland and 30% of grassland could be converted, the report says.
Protecting and restoring peatland, a huge store of carbon, is also vital, as is ensuring no food waste went to landfill by 2025, but is instead used to generate energy, it adds.
The CCC said that for decades food production had been rewarded with subsidies ahead of other public goods that land could provide, but that Brexit provided an opportunity to reward landowners for helping to fight climate change and its impacts as well as supporting wildlife.
“The incremental changes seen in the past to how we use land is not enough,” said Chris Stark, the CCC chief executive. “There is a window now to have a more radical policy.”
He said intensive farming and global warming were damaging soil and wildlife. “The land is suffering,” Stark said. “We are not saying farmers need to go out of business, we are saying that we need a different approach which is equally [profitable] if government policy supports it.”
The environment secretary, Michael Gove, said in January: “After a transition, we will replace [subsidies for owning land] with a system of public money for public goods.”
The CCC report says the government should increase tree planting from 9,000 hectares (22,239 acres) per year to 20,000ha by 2020, then triple it to 27,000ha by 2030. This would bolster forest cover from 13% of the UK to 19% by 2050. “There are government plans to increase planting rates, but the plans have not been funded and to date the targets have been missed,” Stark said.
The UK population is predicted to increase by 14% to 75 million by 2050, the CCC report says, meaning the land used for towns and cities could rise from 8% to 12%.
The food production lost as fields are converted could be regained with improved efficiency, according to the report, as the best farms already produce double the quantity of food as the worst. The CCC also says healthier government food guidelines could reduce meat and dairy consumption, which produce the most greenhouse gases.
The report also tackles the controversial area of biofuels, including the wood burned in power stations such as Drax in Yorkshire, which produces 6% of the nation’s electricity. “The UK has some of the best rules for biomass sustainability, but there are still some gaps and we would love Drax and others to fill those gaps,” Stark said.
The key issue, he said, was ensuring that imported wood came only from forests where trees were replaced quickly to recapture the carbon dioxide emitted when burned.
Will Gardiner, the Drax chief executive, said: “We are committed to working with the government and stakeholders to go further [on sustainability requirements] – setting the standard for others to follow.”
The CCC report suggests demand for biofuels could increase and more than 1m hectares of UK land could be used for energy crops. They should, therefore, be used for only the most climate-friendly purposes, the report says, with biomass burning in power stations getting subsidies only after 2027 if the emissions are captured and stored underground. Biofuels for vehicles should also be phased out as they go electric and instead used for aeroplanes.
Guy Shrubsole, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “This report is a wake-up call for a complacent government that we must completely transform the way we use land to avoid climate breakdown and make space for nature.”
Tree planting should go far beyond the CCC recommendation to double the UK’s forest cover, he added.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/15/tree-planting-double-uk-climate-change

Prof Terry Hughes was jointly awarded the John Maddox prize on Wednesday for bringing public attention to coral bleaching.
It comes only weeks after his research centre lost government funding for its work.
Known as the “standing up for science prize”, the award acknowledges scientists who promote their research as a matter of public interest and do so in the face of attempts to criticise their work.
Hughes is an internationally renowned coral reef scientist based at the Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies in Townsville, one of the world’s leading research institutes in the field.
Last month, in a Senate estimates hearing, the Australian Research Council revealed the centre had failed to secure new funding and had been unsuccessful in even making its funding shortlist.
Hughes has declined to comment on the funding decision but on Thursday said he was grateful to receive an award “that goes beyond the normal nerdy science medals”.
“It’s about science with a public conscience,” he said. “Clearly the plight of coral reefs through the threat of climate change is resonating with people.
“I suppose I’ve been reasonably forthright in saying Australia’s policies around the Adani mine and our rising emissions are contrary to our obligations under Unesco and counter to our Paris commitments.”
He said Australians had become motivated by science that showed the effects of climate change on the Great Barrier Reef.
“It’s certainly not too late to save the Barrier Reef but we’ve got a narrow window of opportunity,” he said.
The judges of the John Maddox prize noted Hughes had been “tireless and courageous” in his efforts to communicate the research evidence on coral bleaching and tackle the misrepresentation of coral reef and climate science.
“In doing so, he has experienced hostility from politicians, public figures and the Australian tourist industry,” they said.
“In the face of efforts to discredit his research, personal criticism and smears in the media, Terry redoubled his efforts to communicate with the widest possible audience, using diverse means and reaching mainstream media around the world.”
Last month Labor’s science spokesman, Kim Carr, said the Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies had missed out on funding after “political intervention” because of Hughes’s public criticism of the government’s reef policy.

I did say that we can still stop the worst of it.
I also pointed out that humanity has been complacent for the last three decades and more. This was the window for making changes that could have actually minimised the harm from global warming. It's a simple fact that the window of time has closed for getting out of the situation with only modest consequence, and the window remaining for moderate-but-survivable consequence is about to slam shut.
My own kids are pre-teen. It will be 2030 before they're young adults. It'll be even longer before they have the type of influence in society, beyond a vote in an election, that might see substantial change. If humanity is still following a business-as-usual path by then, my kids' generation will only be able to pick up the pieces of the society that was enjoyed by my generation and the generations preceding.
It's not defeatist to point these things out. It's a realistic assessment, and it's a desperately needed context because there's a propestity by many to think that there's a possibility that our children will be able to fix it all for us and for the planet. This is a dangerous notion to foster because it only serves to postpone ever further the action that is overdue.
The truth is that there's little that they'll be able to do if we - us, the responsible adults alive and in charge today - don't start immediately - and I mean IMMEDIATELY - to properly and drastically address the mess that we've made. We have to fact this reality if we're going to motivate ourselves to stop sitting on our hands and watch the catastrophy unfold in slow motion.

Low-income households are bearing the brunt of Australia's air pollution problem, which is responsible for an estimated 3,000 premature deaths every year, according to a new report. 
For the first time, air pollution levels have been mapped by postcode in a report titled 'The Dirty Truth' by the Australian Conservation Foundation.
It shows more than 90 per cent of polluting facilities are located in low to middle-income suburbs.

Air pollution is a climate issue and a class issue in Australia. Poorer Australians who live around mines or refineries or in the shadows of coal-fired power stations are unfairly bearing the burden of pollution that is a by-product of the goods and services all Australians use,...

The above link has a map on it with the suburbs.
And for the children in the La Trobe Valley they have Ricky Muir running for them on behalf of the Shooters Party...that will be worth a protest or two.
April 2018:
Latrobe Valley coal-fired power station emissions increased by 37 per cent in 12 months, according to the latest National Pollutant Inventory released by the federal government.
The data showed Loy Yang B mercury emissions jumped by 116 per cent and Yallourn's rose by 53 per cent.
Power generation is responsible for almost all air pollution in the Latrobe Valley, accounting for 99 per cent of sulphur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen and 97.4 per cent of fine particle emissions.
Dr Whelan said Latrobe Valley power stations would not be allowed to operate in countries like Europe, Japan and the USA which have tighter emissions regulations.
""It's one thing to count emissions but another thing to control emissions. We want to see a significant decline in pollution,"" Dr Whelan said.
""We know this is possible by installing equipment that power stations in other parts of the world are obliged to install to capture pollutants before they are emitted.""
Dr Whelan also called on the Commonwealth to provide full access to ongoing data, instead of waiting for the states to provide it every 12 months.
He said the data was invaluable in the Latrobe Valley, where the community had very limited access to air pollution monitoring. He called on the EPA to provide immediate access to all data.

the eu can be likened to some distant galaxy, somewhere we are travelling to in our generational spaceship where, we hope there will be a habitable planet, similar to our own.

No, the EU is our closest neighbour, and a known entity that we are still currently a part of. Your analogy makes more sense if you replace ""the eu"" with ""brexit"".

however we will not see it or even arrive near it, but hopefully, our offspring will.

This more aptly describes the hopeful ""maybe in fifty years"" estimation from Jacob Rees-Mogg, referring to the time it might take to see a 'benefit' of leaving the EU and heading on our journey into deep space with no known plan or destination.

although there will be problems to overcome, the new arrivals will only have stumps for legs and arms, perhaps an oversized head with a smaller torso. appendages that will change because in deep space they are not needed so, they will disappear.

Not unlikely. The EU is a proven model of collaborative strength and endurance:
""It is the future for society, as the world of nation-states is coming to an end – as did the city-states of old. It is an example that other world regions will be likely to follow when it is understood that mutuality does not subtract from member states their inheritance as nations, their culture, language and parliaments or assemblies. It is an organisation of a continent of nation-states into a mutually supporting union, whereby the member nations willingly gave up those elements that had led to conflict for the benefits of security, common standards, trading, legal and human rights, transport and movement networks, aid for depressed industries and post-industrial areas. As a result it has been the only stable, multi-nation community on earth. ""

Ernesto Araújo – until recently a mid-ranking official who blogs about the “criminalisation” of red meat, oil and heterosexual sex – will become the top diplomat of South America’s biggest nation, representing 200 million people and the greatest and most biodiverse forest on Earth, the Amazon.
His appointment, confirmed by Bolsonaro on Wednesday, is likely to send a chill through the global climate movement.
Brazil was where the international community first came together in 1992 to discuss reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Its diplomats have played a crucial role in bridging the gap between rich and poor nations, particularly during the forging of the Paris agreement in 2015.
But when the new government takes power in January, the foreign ministry that leads that work will be headed by a man who claims climate science is merely “dogma”.
In his blog, Araújo states his goal is to “help Brazil and the world liberate themselves from globalist ideology”, which he sees as anti-Christian.
The 51-year-old diplomat – who has never served as an overseas ambassador – claims unnamed leftist politicians have hijacked environmentalism to serve as a tool for global domination.
“This dogma has been used to justify increasing the regulatory power of states over the economy and the power of international institutions on the nation states and their populations, as well as to stifle economic growth in democratic capitalist countries and to promote the growth of China,” he wrote in a post last month.
In another, he claimed the centre-left Workers party in Brazil was “criminalising sex and reproduction, saying that all heterosexual intercourse is rape and every baby is a risk to the planet as it will increase carbon emissions”. He then went on to accuse the party of criminalising red meat, oil, air conditioners and Disney movies.
The incendiary rhetoric echoes that of Bolsonaro, who won last month’s presidential election with about 57.7m votes. The former army captain has since moved to put in place one of the world’s most far-right administrations and promised to align Brazil more closely to Trump and the US.
Climate negotiation experts said the appointment was sad for Brazil and the world – though they held out hope that the new foreign minister will be more pragmatic when he comes to represent his country.
“Brazil has played a very significant role for the Paris agreement. It would be really bad for the country’s image if he brings with him his ideology,” said Carlos Rittl, the executive secretary of the Brazilian Climate Observatory.
He said climate was the one area where Brazil could proudly boast to be a global leader, and urged the new foreign minister and president not to isolate the country in this field.
“Bolsonaro is not Trump. Brazil is not the United States. We don’t have the same cards,” he said. “If Brazil becomes a pariah on the global climate agenda, it would be extremely bad for our business, especially agribusiness. When they go to Europe to negotiate a deal, climate safeguards will be on the table. ”
The risk of losing soya and beef sales in Europe is thought to be why Bolsonaro has backtracked on threats to quit the Paris agreement and merge the agriculture and environment ministries.
But he remains intent on opening up the Amazon to the farmers, miners and construction companies that supported his campaign.
His pick as agriculture minister is the head of the farming lobby, Tereza Cristina Dias, who conservationists have nicknamed the “Muse of Poison” due to her enthusiastic support for relaxing controls on agro-toxins.
She and her colleagues are said to be gutting the responsibilities of the environment ministry before its new head is appointed. The environment institution is likely to be so subservient that insiders joke there will soon be two agriculture ministries in Brazil.
The slim hope now for climate advocates is that the powerful agribusiness lobby will come to realise that the rain for their crops depends on a healthy Amazon and stable global environment. More than 80% of Brazil’s municipalities have experienced drought in the past five years, which scientists have linked to deforestation.
But loggers are not waiting. The latest deforestation figures showed a sharp rise in deforestation during the election campaign, suggesting protections for nature and indigenous land are already weakening.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/15/brazil-foreign-minister-ernesto-araujo-climate-change-marxist-plot

The US and Australia are only slightly behind with both pushing the global temperature rise dangerously over 4C above pre-industrial levels says the paper, while even the EU, which is usually seen as a climate leader, is on course to more than double the 1.5C that scientists say is a moderately safe level of heating.
The study, published on Friday in the journal Nature Communications, assesses the relationship between each nation’s ambition to cut emissions and the temperature rise that would result if the world followed their example.
The aim of the paper is to inform climate negotiators as they begin a two-year process of ratcheting up climate commitments, which currently fall far short of the 1.5-to-2C goal set in France three years ago.
The related website also serves as a guide to how nations are sharing the burden of responding to the greatest environmental threat humankind has ever faced.
Among the major economies, the study shows India is leading the way with a target that is only slightly off course for 2C. Less developed countries are generally more ambitious, in part because they have fewer factories, power plants and cars, which means they have lower emissions to rein in.
On the opposite side of the spectrum are the industrial powerhouse China and major energy exporters who are doing almost nothing to limit carbon dioxide emissions. These include Saudi Arabia (oil), Russia (gas) and Canada, which is drawing vast quantities of dirty oil from tar sands. Fossil fuel lobbies in these countries are so powerful that government climate pledges are very weak, setting the world on course for more than 5C of heating by the end of the century.
Only slightly better are the group of countries that are pushing the planet beyond 4C. Among them are the US, which has huge emissions from energy, industry and agriculture somewhat offset by promises of modest cuts and more renewables. Australia, which remains heavily dependent on coal exports, is also in this category.
The wealthy shopping societies of Europe fare slightly better – largely because emissions on products are calculated at the source of manufacture rather than the point of consumption – but the authors of the paper say their actions lag behind their promises to set a positive example.
“It is interesting is to see how far out some countries are, even those that are considered leaders in the climate mitigation narrative,” said the study’s author, Yann Robiou du Pont of Melbourne University.
The study is likely to be controversial. Under the Paris agreement, there is no top-down consensus on what is a fair share of responsibility. Instead each nation sets its own bottom-up targets according to a number of different factors, including political will, level of industrialisation, ability to pay, population size, historical responsibility for emissions. Almost every government, the authors say, selects an interpretation of equity that serves their own interests and allows them to achieve a relative gain on other nations.
To get around these differing concepts of fairness, the paper assesses each nation by the least stringent standards they set themselves and then extrapolates this to the world. In doing so, the authors say they can “operationalise disagreements”.
Taking account of the different interpretations, they say the world needs to commit to a virtual 1.4C target in order to achieve a 2C goal. They hope their equity metric can be used in next month’s UN climate talks in Katowice and in climate litigation cases.
The authors said the study could in future be extended to the subnational level, such as individual US states. They also note that a few key sectors are currently omitted, including land-use change (which is fundamental in rapidly deforesting nations such as Brazil, Argentina and Indonesia), international shipping and aviation.
Although the study highlights the huge gap between political will and scientific alarm, Robiou du Pont said it should inspire rather than dispirit people.
“The positive outcome of this study is that we have a metric to assess the ratcheting up of ambition. Civil society, experts and decision-makers can use this to hold their governments accountable, and possibly undertake climate litigation cases as happened recently in the Netherlands,” he said. “This metric translates the lack of ambition on a global scale to a national scale. If we look at the goal of trying to avoid damage to the Earth, then I am pessimistic as this is already happening. But this should be a motivation to ratchet up ambition and avoid global warming as much and as rapidly as possible. Every fraction of a degree will have a big impact.”
Commenting on the study, other academics said it could be used by anyone to show how climate action can be navigated in a world in which each country ranks itself based on what they consider to be fair.
“This paper provides a means for countries to check how their contribution might be perceived by other countries and thus judge whether they are perceived as a climate leader or laggard,” said Joeri Rogelj of Imperial College London.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/16/climate-change-champions-still-pursuing-devastating-policies-new-study-reveals

A large number of member states fear that the UK could enjoy an economic advantage after Brexit if it were able to diverge from European laws and regulations, and they want to use their leverage now to force a commitment from future British governments.
The demand by Emmanuel Macron for the UK to be tied into the EU’s Paris 2030 targets was just one of a series of interventions made by member states during recent meetings with Michel Barnier and his negotiating team.
While a UK withdrawal agreement dealing with citizens’ rights, the £39bn financial settlement and the Irish border have been agreed in principle, the political declaration on the future relationship is yet to be finalised. A seven-page declaration published last week is set to become a much heavier document after member states made a series of interventions in meetings with the European commission for additional text. One EU diplomat said: “It’s a Christmas tree and all the member states are putting their baubles on it.”
Olly Robbins, Downing Street’s Brexit adviser, was in Brussels this weekend for meetings with the commission. On Sunday, ambassadors for the 27 member states are to meet Barnier to discuss the text. Negotiations will have to be completed when ministers for the 27 meet on Monday, with a draft due to be made public on Tuesday.
Downing Street is hopeful that the political declaration can be a “sweetener” to the withdrawal agreement, which has faced a storm of protest in Britain.
On Saturday, Commons leader Andrea Leadsom insisted there was “more to be done” before a special European council meeting on Sunday 25 November to get “the best possible deal for the UK”.
But the extra demands on the UK are likely to be unwelcome to Brexiters, who fear that the government is allowing the UK to be permanently sucked into the EU’s regulatory orbit.
While the UK is a leading light among the EU member states on climate change, the French government is concerned that in a post-Brexit world there will be calls within Britain to undercut the rest of the continent.
The EU has been steadily ratcheting up its targets as part of the 2015 Paris climate change accord, and France wants the UK to be bound to them.
Last week the European parliament adopted energy-savings targets of 32.5% and a renewable energy uplift of 32% by 2030. That will put the bloc on course to cut emissions by 45% from 1990 levels by 2030.
The most politically sensitive demand from the EU is likely, however, to concern the trade-off the bloc wants to make between access for the European fishing fleet to British waters and the wider trade deal.
It is understood that a clause will be included in the political declaration making a link between British companies having access to the European market, and maintaining the “existing reciprocal access to fishing waters and resources”.
The EU wants a deal on access to UK waters by July 2020, with the UK being tied to making its “best endeavour” to get an agreement, or British exporters will face a loss of access to its market for their own goods.
A number of member states are also championing more positive language in the political declaration on the future trading relationship.
One diplomat from a European country on the western fringe of the EU said: “The relationship as sketched out in the political declaration doesn’t do enough for us. It doesn’t protect the supply lines and we should aim higher, and lock ourselves in to achieve more.”
Andrew Duff, a former MEP, and visiting fellow at the European Policy Centre thinktank, said: “The political declaration needs to do two things – corral the 27 behind a settled course of action leading to an unprecedented association agreement with the UK, and secondly to commit the British prime minister – and if possible her successor – in that same direction.
“It can’t be too loose, therefore, but also can’t be so tightly drafted that it pre-empts the association agreement negotiations. It’s the first chance for the EU 27 to plot the future of Europe without the Brits – an important moment, therefore.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/17/france-wants-uk-climate-pledge-brexit-trade-deal

I wasn’t alone. In fact, Lambeth wasn’t the only obstructed London bridge: thousands of people of diverse backgrounds and ages occupied five central London bridges for most of 17 November: Southwark, Blackfriars, Waterloo, Westminster and Lambeth. I believe that at least 80 other people were arrested.
Climate is increasingly becoming one of the key subjects for artists as they hold their mirror up to society
I am adding my support to Extinction Rebellion – a relatively new activist movement aimed at waking up the political system to the truth about the way that humans are responsible for a dramatic change in the world’s ecosystem. The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) published its latest reports in October, which state that human activity is “likely” to push the average global surface temperature above 1.5C between the years 2030 and 2052.
I’m planning on being around for both of these dates, but the problem seems to be that the warmer the planet gets, the faster the pace of climatic changes such as melting ice caps. This changes sea levels and currents, and results in less heat reflection from the lovely white caps – so the temperature goes up. This new heat releases the proverbial “methane dragon” currently partially trapped under the (melting) tundra ice. More frequent climate disasters are already happening across the globe, and these seem set to only increase.
The international art world, to which I’m attached, requires the traffic of heavy art objects all over the globe – the cultural ebb and flow of images and ideas certainly has a huge carbon footprint. So I guess direct action is needed in this area too. And climate is increasingly becoming one of the key subjects for artists as they hold their mirrors up to society.
We can get together to solve this, and every person has a moral imperative to be a part of the movement. Having myself arrested was like laying down a marker; an action that enables a quiet but resonant solidarity with those who want to see our government and the media wake up to the incontrovertible evidence that humans do have to deal with the issue of their effect on the climate … and can this start to happen ASAP, please?

Yep, I love wasting my time. When the various stories about today's address by Bill Shorten surfaced a couple of days ago, I wondered (and commented here) about how long it would take for the likes of Angus to start frothing at the mouth and claim the sky will fall. I thought we'd hear something tomorrow, but Taylor has gone of half-cocked a little earlier than that.
This arse wipe has already claimed that the coalition will more than likely block any move by Labor to instigate the policy that his own party came up with and then dumped when the usual suspects started making threats.

...Meantime, Energy Minister Angus Taylor has hinted the Coalition may block a future Shorten government from resurrecting the government's stalled National Energy Guarantee, which aimed to reduce emissions from the energy sector and ensure power reliability and affordability...

The shadow cabinet on Wednesday took the decision to stick with the Neg developed by Malcolm Turnbull and Josh Frydenberg, with an emissions reduction target for electricity of 45% by 2030, in an attempt to see whether the Liberals could be persuaded to vote for their own mechanism post-election.
In the event Bill Shorten wins the next federal election, and the Liberals continue to reject the Neg, Labor plans to manage the transition to low-emissions energy with a policy instrument such as contracts-for-difference, or something similar.
Guardian Australia understands the plan agreed by shadow cabinet includes a industry policy framework to ensure renewables are rolled out in appropriate locations, consistent with an objective of achieving 50% renewables in the electricity grid by 2030, but also with an eye to ensuring grid security and reliability.
The policy is also expected to include measures to improve energy efficiency, and a transition plan for coal communities, given Labor’s higher emissions reduction target will drive a faster shift away from coal-fired power.
While Wednesday’s shadow cabinet deliberation concerned the energy policy offering for the looming federal election, the opposition has previously flagged taking measures beyond the electricity sector to reverse the trend of rising emissions in evidence since the repeal of the carbon price.
Emissions have been falling in Australia’s electricity sector, but rising in other sectors of the economy.
In an interview with Guardian Australia in August the shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, said the opposition was considering some form of emissions trading to drive abatement for liable entities – big polluters emitting more than 25,000 tonnes of carbon a year – and also mandatory vehicle emissions standards to curb rising pollution in the transport sector.
Shorten is expected to outline the key elements of Labor’s new energy plan in a speech on Thursday.
Shorten told reporters in Sydney Labor still wanted a bipartisan outcome on energy, but the Coalition could not take the process hostage. “We will work with the Coalition, but we won’t wait for them,” he said.
The Coalition during this term in office has been unable to agree on a policy that involves an emissions reduction component, and the acrimonious internal dispute over the Neg was a factor in the conservative-led coup against Turnbull in August.
Scott Morrison has junked the emissions reduction component of the Neg, which was set at 26%, and the government, which is in the middle of its own energy policy revamp, will campaign against Labor’s higher target.
But Shorten noted on Wednesday it would be hard for the Coalition to argue against the Neg “when they spent the best part of a year saying it was the best thing since sliced bread”.
Labor is persisting with the mechanism because it views the Neg as the last chance of securing a bipartisan position on energy policy, which is what most stakeholders say they want in order to create investment certainty to allow investment in multimillion-dollar assets with operating lives of several decades.
But it is also prepared to pursue plan B. The opposition has not fully resolved the instrument to guide the renewables rollout, but favours using contracts-for-difference – a derivative-like tool that hedges for price risk. The mechanism often works by allowing generators to be paid the difference between a strike price and a reference price.
New research, meanwhile, from the progressive thinktank the Australia Institute says boosting renewables would lead to significant job creation. It says between 7,300 to 12,500 jobs a year would be needed for the operation and maintenance of electricity generation, which matches the number of workers currently employed in the coal-fired power sector.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/nov/21/labor-to-keep-national-energy-guarantee-in-bid-for-climate-truce

Carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide are now far above pre-industrial levels, with no sign of a reversal of the upward trend, a World Meteorological Organization report says.
“The last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was 3-5m years ago, when the temperature was 2-3C warmer and sea level was 10-20 metres higher than now,” said the WMO secretary general, Petteri Taalas.
“The science is clear. Without rapid cuts in CO2 and other greenhouse gases, climate change will have increasingly destructive and irreversible impacts on life on Earth. The window of opportunity for action is almost closed.”
Levels of CO2 rose to a global average of 405.5 parts per million in the atmosphere in 2017 – almost 50% higher than before the industrial revolution.
Levels of methane, a potent greenhouse gas responsible for about 17% of global warming are now 2.5 times higher than pre-industrial times owing to emissions from cattle, rice paddies and leaks from oil and gas wells.
Nitrous oxide, which also warms the planet and destroys the Earth’s protective ozone layer, is now over 20% higher than pre-industrial levels. About 40% of N2O comes from human activities including soil degradation, fertiliser use and industry.
The WMO also highlighted the discovery of illicit production of CFC-11, a banned chemical that also both warms the planet and destroys ozone. Investigations indicate that at least some of the production is in China.
In October the world’s scientists said global warming of even 1.5C would have severe consequences for humanity. International climate agreements had for two decades set 2C as a limit.
“Every fraction of a degree of global warming matters, and so does every part per million of greenhouse gases,” said the WMO deputy secretary general, Elena Manaenkova. “CO2 remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years and in the oceans for even longer. There is currently no magic wand to remove all the excess CO2 from the atmosphere.”
Prof Corinne Le Quéré, of the University of East Anglia, said she was not surprised by the new record levels of greenhouse gases. “But I am very concerned that all three gases most responsible for climate change are rising upwards unabated. It seems the urgency and extent of the actions needed to address climate change have not sunk in.
“Low-carbon technologies like wind, solar, and electric transport need to become mainstream, with old-fashioned polluting fossils pushed out rapidly.”
Efforts to cut emissions are increasing and on Wednesday the UN’s climate change body published a report on the commitments made in 2018. It found 9,000 cities in 128 countries were taking action, along with 240 states and regions in 40 countries and more than 6,000 businesses in 120 countries.
Patricia Espinosa, head of the UN framework convention on climate change, said: “On one hand, greenhouse gas emissions have yet to peak and countries struggle to maintain the concentrated attention and effort needed for a successful response to climate change. On the other hand, climate action is occurring, it is increasing and there is a will to do more. I highlight this because falling into despair and hopelessness is a danger equal to complacency, none of which we can afford.”• This article was corrected on 22 November 2018. An earlier version said that at an average of 405.5 parts per million CO2 levels in recent times were two-and-a-half times higher than before the industrial revolution, and that methane levels were 3.5 times higher. Nitrous oxide levels were said to be at more than double pre-industrial levels.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/22/climate-heating-greenhouse-gases-at-record-levels-says-un

About 50 activists from Extinction Rebellion, a direct action group that has been coordinating a campaign of civil disobedience which has brought areas of the capital to a standstill in recent weeks, risked arrest by standing defiantly in roads in front of queueing traffic.
An estimated 1,000 more demonstrators, many clad in black clothing, massed on the green in Parliament Square for what organisers labelled a “memorial service” to mourn the loss of life on the planet.
Many waved banners emblazoned with slogans including “System change, not climate change” and “Rebel for life” as they listened to speeches.
One older woman superglued her hands to a railing outside Buckingham Palace in protest. Scotland Yard confirmed that 14 protesters had been arrested for criminal damage during the day.
Campaigners said the protest, named “Rebellion Day 2”, aimed to highlight “the government’s failure to recognise and act on the ecological and climate emergency”. It follows similar events last weekend, when 82 people were arrested following staged sit-ins on five bridges crossing the Thames.
Among the campaigners blocking four roads entering Parliament Square on Saturday was Nicki Myers, 45, from Cambridge. Myers, who uses a wheelchair and suffers from the lung condition pulmonary fibrosis and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, said she was prepared to be arrested in the attempt to raise awareness about the environment.
Sitting in front of traffic and clutching a banner with the slogan “Rebel for life cos we can’t breathe”, she said: “I’m mostly here for my granddaughter, Isabel. I’m terrified about of the prospect of society breakdown in her lifetime. I want the government to tell the truth and do something.”
She said she was ready to be arrested to bring about a change in policy “if that’s what it takes”, adding: “I’ve never done anything like this before. It’s quite scary.”
Lying down in the road nearby with his head resting on a backpack, 82-year-old protester Phil Kingston said he too was prepared to be arrested in the name of raising awareness for the environment. The pensioner, a retired university lecturer, said he had been arrested three times during Extinction Rebellion demonstrations in the past fortnight.
“I have four grandchildren and nothing is more important to me than their security,” he said. “And that security is being eroded all the time by an economy that is pumping fossil fuels in the air when already we are heading for disaster. I’m not accepting it. I don’t mind going to prison.”
A young woman called Zappi, who did not wish to give her second name, also said she was willing to be arrested despite acknowledging the potential for it to harm her future prospects. The student, holding one end of a large sign reading, “Tell the truth”, said: “I feel like getting arrested is very small compared to the fact that potentially we could destroy our planet.”
Helen, 43, travelled from Ipswich with her four-year-old daughter, Lucy, to join the demonstration for the day. Sitting on a blanket in Parliament Square, the court transcriber said: “The truth is that the world is collapsing environmentally. The state of the world has become serious. The government seem almost insane in the way they are completely ignoring it. I’d like to see them treating it like it’s an emergency.”
A second world war memorial in Whitehall, honouring the work of women during the conflict, was graffitied during the protest. Other campaigners later rubbed off the spray-painted message, which read “MOTHER”. Scotland Yard confirmed that a suspect had been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage in relation to the graffiti.
The 6.7-metre (22ft) bronze sculpture, which cost £1.3m, was unveiled by the Queen in 2005 to pay tribute to the millions of women who contributed to the war effort.
After spotting the graffitied war memorial, campaigner Catherine Jones rushed to a local shop to buy nail polish remover and cotton pads to clean it off. The hospital worker, who helps run arts activities for patients, told the Guardian she did not want the graffiti to detract from the message of the day.
Jones, who brought her one-year-old daughter, Louise, to the demonstration, added that she did not agree with the graffiti. “I just don’t like it. It’s not helpful,” she said. “I think the day should be remembered by the performing element of it, which I thought was phenomenal. The message is strong. Yes, we are going to disrupt the traffic and yes, we are meant to get people a little bit annoyed at it.”
Activists were also spotted daubing graffiti on the road outside Downing Street.
During the protest, campaigners carried a mock coffin in a funeral-style procession and took part in a mass sit-down protest for around 10 minutes outside the gates of Downing Street, chanting: “Climate justice, when do we want it? Now.” Several protesters also lay down in front of the gates.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/24/environmental-protesters-block-access-to-parliament-square-extinction-rebellion

I learnt that this was something humans had created. I was told to turn off the lights to save energy and recycle paper to save resources.
I remember thinking it was very strange that we were capable of changing the entire face of the Earth and the precious thin layer of atmosphere that makes it our home.
Because if we were capable of doing this, then why weren’t we hearing about it everywhere? As soon as you turned on the television, why wasn’t the climate crisis the first thing you heard about? Headlines, radio programmes, newspapers, you would never hear about anything else, as if there was a world war going on.
Yet our leaders never talked about it.
If burning fossil fuels threatened our very existence, then how could we continue to burn them? Why were there no restrictions? Why wasn’t it illegal to do this? Why wasn’t anyone talking about the dangerous climate change we have already locked in? And what about the fact that up to 200 species are going extinct every single day?
I have Aspergers syndrome so, for me, most things are black or white. I look at the people in power and wonder how they have made things so complicated. I hear people saying that climate change is an existential threat, yet I watch as people carry on like nothing is happening.
We can no longer save the world by playing by the rules because the rules have to be changed
We can no longer save the world by playing by the rules because the rules have to be changed.
Countries like Sweden need to start reducing our emissions by at least 15 per cent every year if we consider the aspect of equality or climate justice – a principle that is clearly stated everywhere in the Paris Agreement. And that is just so we can stay below 2 degrees, which we now know will still create misery for so many people and ecosystems around the world.
For Australia – given its even larger carbon footprint – that percentage is likely to be higher still. Now the Secretary General of the United Nations argues that we should aim for 1.5 degrees. Change on a scale we’ve never imagined.
If I live to be 100, I will be alive in 2103. Adults often don’t think beyond the year 2050. But by then, I will, in the best case, not have lived half of my life. What we do or don’t do right now will affect my entire life and the lives of my friends, our children and their grandchildren.
When school started in August this year, I decided enough was enough. Sweden had just experienced its hottest summer ever. The election was coming up. No one was talking about climate change as an actual consequence of our way of life.
So I decided to walk out of school and sit on the ground outside the Swedish parliament to demand our politicians treat climate change for what it is: the biggest issue we have ever faced.
Because if climate change has to stop, then we must stop it. It is black and white. There are no grey areas when it comes to survival. Either we continue as a civilisation or we don’t. One way or another, we have to change. Countries like mine and Australia must start reducing our emissions dramatically if we believe in equality and climate justice.
But instead of talking about this, all our politicians go on about is economic growth, energy prices and shareholder value. What value is there in a future where hundreds of millions of people suffer?
According to the Swedish Uppsala University, countries like Sweden and Australia must get down to zero emissions within six to 12 years so that people in poorer countries can have a decent future and build some of the infrastructure that we already enjoy. How can we expect countries such as India or Nigeria to care about the climate crisis if we, who already have everything, are not living up to our commitments?
Australia is the world’s biggest exporter of coal, one of the leading causes of climate change. Your politicians want to help Adani build one of the biggest coal mines in the world. Right now, there are no policies to change this. There are no rules to keep coal in the ground.
And it has to start today. As a student, one way I can push for urgent change is to go on strike from school. I’ll be sitting outside the Swedish parliament every Friday from now until my country is in line with the Paris agreement.
I urge other students to join me: Sit outside your parliament or local government wherever you are and demand that they get on track to keep the world below 1.5 degrees.
Some say I should be in school. But why should any young person be made to study for a future when no one is doing enough to save that future? What is the point of learning facts when the most important facts given by the finest scientists are ignored by our politicians?
We are running out of time. Failure means disaster. The changes required are enormous and we must all contribute to the solutions, especially those of us in rich countries like Australia.
The adults have failed us. And since most of them, including the press and the politicians, keep ignoring the situation, we must take action into our own hands, starting today.

It warns that rising temperatures are already harming America and will cause huge damage globally. 
Climate change will exacerbate wildfires and droughts, causing particulate pollution from smoke and windblown dust and increasing smog that forms in higher temperatures.
Worldwide, 5.5 billion people, or 75% of the population, live in places that don’t meet the World Health Organization standard for limiting particulate pollution, according to research by the University of Chicago.
Air pollution shortens lives. In areas with the worst air, including in the Indian capital Delhi, people could live up to seven and a half years longer with less pollution.
Aside from early deaths, air pollution also causes breathing and heart problems and worsens asthma.
“In the last few years, we’ve seen enormous spikes in episodes where wildfires contribute to pollution,” said Janice Nolen, assistant vice-president of national policy for the American Lung Association. “It doesn’t have to be a continuous problem every day to be unhealthy. It can be that a spike happens for a few days of difficult breathing that shorten lives.”
Rising temperatures and increased carbon dioxide levels will also make plant-based allergies worse by lengthening the pollen season and increasing the amount of pollen made by plants.
Beyond air pollution, climate change is a threat to human health via extreme heat, reduced food and water quality, and population displacement.
Depending on action taken to slow climate change, an additional 3,900 to 9,300 across 49 large cities in the US are predicted to die each year from extremely hot or cold days by the last two decades of this century, the report finds.
Infectious agents will also spread wider with migrating mosquitoes and ticks.
“Often people, when they’re affected by climate change, are affected by it in multiple ways,” Nolen said. “You’re affected by air quality, you’re affected by heat, you can be affected by a variety of things from allergens being increased, from mold from flooding, not to mention just stress.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/26/climate-change-report-trump-air-pollution

The last El Niño event ended in 2016 and helped make that year the hottest ever recorded by adding to the heating caused by humanity’s carbon emissions. The 2019 event is not currently forecast to be as strong as in 2016.
El Niño events occur naturally every few years and stem from abnormally high ocean temperatures in the eastern Pacific. They have a major influence on weather around the globe, bringing droughts to normally damp places, such as parts of Australia, and floods to normally drier regions, such as in South America. The high temperatures also cause major bleaching on coral reefs.
“The forecast El Niño is not expected to be as powerful as the event in 2015-2016,” said Maxx Dilley, the director of WMO’s climate prediction and adaptation branch. “Even so, it can still significantly affect rainfall and temperature patterns in many regions, with important consequences to agriculture and food security, and for management of water resources and public health. It may also combine with long-term climate change to boost 2019 global temperatures.”
Forecasters in the US have already warned of an imminent El Niño. Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology said in October that a dry, hot summer was very likely, with increased risk of heatwaves and bushfires and no relief for already drought-stricken farmers. There is evidence that climate change is making the effects of El Niño more severe.
The heat boost from El Niño helped 2016 to be the hottest year ever recorded. The following year, 2017, was ranked equal second, but was the hottest for a year without an El Niño. Scientists expect 2018, which saw climate-related disasters around the globe, to be the fourth hottest on record.
Billions of tonnes of carbon emissions are continuing and greenhouse gases are at record concentrations, meaning their heating effect is stronger than ever. But whether a new El Niño will help make 2019 a new record remains to be seen.
“The developing El Niño conditions are likely to contribute to warmer global average temperature in 2019 – it is a little too early to say whether or not it will be a record year,” said Tim Stockdale, at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.
In any case, human-caused global warming has resulted in 17 of the 18 hottest years recorded since 1850 occurring between 2000 and 2017. Scientific analyses have shown that many extreme weather events have been made more severe or more likely by climate change.
The WMO analysis estimated the chance of a fully-fledged El Niño event between December 2018 and February 2019 at 75-80%, with a 60% chance of it continuing to April 2019. A strong El Niño sees western Pacific sea surface temperatures reaching at least 1.5C more than average. Current model predictions for the imminent El Niño range from 0.8C to 1.2C above average.

Hundreds of students lined up outside Parliament House on Wednesday wanting to speak to Scott Morrison and government ministers about taking emergency action against climate change.
On Tuesday, the Senate approved a motion to support the students in their decision to strike from school and hold a series of planned national protests.
Students across the country plan to leave school this week, with protests in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Hobart scheduled for Friday.
On Wednesday it was the turn of Canberra students, who waited in the rain outside parliament and met with Labor, Greens and crossbench MPs, including the federal Greens leader, Richard Di Natale.

On Monday Morrison said in question time that the students “should go to school”, in response to a question from Greens MP Adam Bandt.
“These brave and courageous kids are joining young people around the world who are angry at the failure of governments,” Bandt asked. “Will you meet with and listen to these kids?”
The prime minister replied that climate change was “a very real and serious issue” but that “kids should go to school”.
“We don’t support our schools being turned into parliaments,” he said. “What we want is more learning in schools and less activism.”
But a day later, the Senate narrowly voted to approve a motion from Greens senators Jordon Steele-John and Mehreen Faruqi that showed support for the striking students.
On Wednesday, Steele-John, Labor MPs Ged Kearney and Julie Owens, and Centre Alliance MP Rebehka Sharkie also met the students to hear their concerns.

Over and over again all we heard was that Trump was silencing climate scientists.

Yes he has, his administration removing web pages, muzzling scientists from talking to the press etc etc.

Now when he releases their report, he's trying to hide something.

Once again you miss the point of an article.
The government agencies were obliged to release the report.
Trump's administration the when, and they have made it blatantly clear they tried to sneak out the bad news when the public's attention was elsewhere because the conclusions did not fit their partisan ideological denial of the entire subject.
A weak argument, in support of someone who hires weak lawyers for more than a decade. ;-)

That global warming’s effects are here | Ken Kimmell and Brenda Ekwurzel,article,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/29/trump-national-climate-report-climate-change-global-warming-science,0,"Talk about cognitive dissonance. Just two days before 13 federal agencies released a report laying out the devastating human and economic toll that climate change already is taking in the United States, Donald Trump tweeted: “Whatever happened to global warming?” The tweet was based on a spurt of cold weather in the north-east, never mind that the rest of the world was experiencing higher than normal temperatures.
The administration was so concerned about what the report, called the National Climate Assessment (NCA), would reveal – including the fact that the president’s thinking on climate change is hopelessly flawed – that it chose to release it on Black Friday, hoping no one would pay attention. A member of Trump’s transition team, Steven Milloy, was candid about this strategy, saying: “Do it on a day when nobody cares, and hope it gets swept away by the next day’s news.” Fortunately for the Earth and its residents, news coverage about the report continued over the weekend and into the following week.
So, what was Trump trying to hide? The fact that global warming’s effects are here and now. When western state residents say that recent wildfires are unlike anything they’ve experienced before, there’s a reason for that. Climate change doubled the area burned by wildfires across the west between 1984 and 2015, relative to what would have burned without warming, according to the report.
And when coastal residents say that decades ago, they weren’t splashing through flooded streets on sunny days, there’s a reason for that, too. Sea level rise has increased the frequency of high tide flooding by a factor of five to 10 since the 1960s for some communities. US residents (and, of course, people all over the world), are now being forced to cope with dangerously high temperatures, rising seas, deadly wildfires, torrential rainfalls and devastating hurricanes. If carbon emissions continue unabated, life will become much more difficult.
By the end of the century annual losses in some sectors are projected to exceed $100bn and surpass the gross domestic product of many states, according to the NCA. However, we can avoid these damages by embarking on the lower emissions scenario, reducing costs by nearly 50% in the labor sector and nearly 60% in the extreme heat mortality sector.
While the report doesn’t offer policy recommendations, its findings certainly make the case that the administration must stop rolling back the climate policies the previous administration put in place, including standards requiring vehicles to go farther on a gallon of gas and rules that would limit carbon emissions from power plants. The report will also make it much harder for the Trump administration to defend these rollbacks in court: judges don’t like it when policymakers ignore authoritative science.
Though Trump has stalled progress at the federal level, he doesn’t control what states, cities and the private sector do. All have stepped up to fill the void left by the Trump administration’s abdication. For example, states across the country are implementing policies that curtail global warming emissions, either out of concern over climate change or because the policies make economic sense. California is leading the pack with a recently passed law targeting that the state’s electricity come from carbon-free sources by 2045. Texas, with its steady winds and large open spaces, is ranked number one in wind energy generation in the US, generating more wind energy than all but five countries. State leaders there had the foresight to invest more than $7bn in transmission infrastructure to connect those open areas to population centers. And sunny North Carolina is powering half a million homes with solar thanks to state incentives, renewable portfolio requirements, investments by utilities and solar energy purchases by large in-state firms such as Apple and Ikea.
The midterm elections bode well for continued progress at the state level. In New Mexico, Maine, Colorado, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin, gubernatorial candidates who pledged to advance science-based clean energy and climate action won their races. Even in Washington DC there are signs that the pendulum has begun to swing back, with voters deciding to end one-party rule in Congress. The House of Representatives’ new leadership plans to hold hearings on the president’s efforts to dismantle climate rules and young voters who have mobilized around climate issues plan to hold Congress’s feet to the fire, pushing Democrats to make climate legislation a priority this year.
The lesson for Trump and his supporters is that you can only ignore science for so long – eventually it catches up to you. And people around the country are realizing that we are now deep into it and climate impacts will only get worse without action. State and private sector action is helpful; national action is essential. Let’s just hope that enough federal decision-makers get the message soon. The NCA makes it clear that time is the most precious commodity of all; we are running out of it.

The people’s seat initiative, which launched on Wednesday, will give citizens around the world the opportunity to send their messages to leaders via social media, using the hashtag #TakeYourSeat. These views and information from opinion polling will then form the basis of Attenborough’s speech to leaders.
“We all know climate change is a global problem – and for that it requires a global solution,” said Attenborough. “This is an opportunity for people from across the globe, regardless of their nationality or circumstances, to be part of the most important discussion of this century; the unprecedented action needed to reach the Paris agreement targets.”
“I encourage everyone to take their seats and to add their voice so that the ‘people’s address’ truly represents a mix of voices from across the world,” he said.
The world’s governments are meeting in Poland to negotiate how to implement the Paris agreement on climate change, secured in 2015. They will also discuss how to increase global action to meet its goals to curb global warming.
The summit follows a warning in October from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that urgent and dramatic action across the whole of the economy and society is needed to cut emissions and prevent dangerous climate change.
The people’s address will also trigger the launch of the Facebook Messenger “ActNow” bot on the United Nations’ central Facebook account. This is intended to make it easier for people to understand the actions they can take personally in the fight against climate change by making recommendations, such as taking public transport and eating less meat. The number of actions will be tracked to highlight the impact collective action could make.
“The challenge to humanity that climate change represents is of such epic proportions that only through collective global action will we have a chance to combat it successfully,” said Michael Moller, director-general of the United Nations Office at Geneva, who first suggested the new initiatives.
“Every single human being on our severely stressed planet has to take responsibility,” he said. “If we don’t, we all fail with catastrophic consequences. The people’s seat initiative provides the impulse for seriously ramping up global solidarity, especially among the young who, at the end of the day, are the ones who will have to deal with the mess we have left them with.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/21/sir-david-attenborough-to-speak-for-the-people-at-un-climate-summit

Brandon Laforest, a marine biologist with the World Wildlife Fund, and guide Titus Allooloo were working on a project monitoring the effect of marine traffic on the region’s narwhal population when they spotted the pair of large whales just outside Pond Inlet, a community at the northern tip of Baffin Island in September.
Video of the incident, released at the end of October, captures the second known sighting of sperm whales in the region. In 2014, hunters from Pond Inlet spotted them in the area.
At first, Allooloo and Laforest thought the dark shapes in the water were killer whales – another species that has become a frequent visitor to the waters as temperatures creep up. But the distinct shape of the dorsal fin surprised Allooloo – a veteran hunter.
“They’re not known by us, we don’t know too much about them,” Allooloo told the CBC.
While a number of whales species thrive year-round in the Arctic, including beluga, bowhead and narwhal, the physiology of a sperm whale makes it difficult for them to navigate colder waters.
Their heads and upper parts of the body are soft and contain an oily fat – long prized by whalers – that turns waxy in cold waters. Their bodies – which can weigh as much as 125,000lb (56,700kg) – are also ineffective at breaking through ice.
While they don’t represent a threat to the ecosystem, there are worries sperm whale could become trapped as winter approaches.
“Inexperienced whales exploiting a northern habitat may not know to leave early enough before the sea ice forms,” Laforest told the CBC.
The vast area of the Arctic waters – estimated by Canadian researchers to measure 5.5m sq miles - makes it difficult for scientists to effectively track changes in the ecosystem, including the arrival of previously unreported species.
Baseline datasets are also rare, making trend gathering difficult. Increasingly, researchers are working with Inuit communities, which have a long oral history of species in the region.
In recent years, killer whales, or orcas, have also become more frequent in a number, taking advantage of longer ice-free seasons. The whales, which feast on resident narwhal, have even started changing narwhal behaviour, according to a 2017 report by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.
“I think the narwhal are scared to death,” report co-author Steve Ferguson told the Canadian Press. “Watching your brother or sister or mother get killed and eaten by a killer whale would cause a little post-traumatic stress in most of us.”
A recent presentation by the department also highlighted a spike in chum salmon populations the western Arctic – in numbers far greater than previously recorded.
Warming temperatures have also prompted interest in the potential for expanded commercial fishing in the Arctic. In response, nine countries have agreed to ban fishing in the region until a more thorough study of the ecosystem can be completed.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/05/sperm-whales-canadian-arctic

Exactly how many people in the UK have eliminated animal products including dairy and honey from their diets is uncertain. One recent survey suggested there could be as many as 3.5 million vegans in the UK. The Vegan Society offers the much lower figure of 600,000 vegans, which still represents a fourfold increase in four years. But either way, and combined with a big increase in vegetarians and occasional meat-eaters (otherwise known as “flexitarians”), a huge shift in eating habits is under way. This week’s annual food and drink report by the supermarket Waitrose says around a third of people have either cut down on or stopped eating meat altogether.
There is more than one explanation for this change in behaviour. More than half of those surveyed by Waitrose said animal welfare was their motivation for changing their diet. The intensive farming and slaughter of livestock has long aroused feelings of regret and distaste in many people who do not object on principle to eating meat. Such feelings, along with concerns around health and sustainability, have led to rising demand for organic and free-range products among those who can afford them. The growing trend towards giving up meat altogether suggests either that the moral objections have spread, that other factors than animal welfare are in play – or, most likely, some combination of both.
These other factors are health and the environment. Expert advice on diet has long focused on a balanced intake of nutrients, and eating more fruit and vegetables and less sugar and fat. There is no simple answer to the question of whether it is healthier to be a carnivore or not. But over the past few years what was once suspected has become official: cured and processed meats can cause bowel cancer, and are classified by the World Health Organization as a group-one carcinogen, alongside tobacco and asbestos. Little wonder, then, that health-conscious people are giving up BLTs.
While the health case for vegetarian and vegan diets is inward-looking, the environmental arguments point urgently outwards and forwards in time. Last month a major international study concluded that huge reductions in meat-eating are essential, especially in the western countries that eat most of it, since food production is a big contributor to global warming as well as deforestation, water shortages and pollution from fertilisers. This was one of the main arguments for veganism made by the freelance journalist Selene Nelson in an article this week, after her exchange of emails with Waitrose Food magazine editor William Sitwell led to his resignation.
Mr Sitwell had responded to her pitch for a vegan series featuring recipes and tips with a reply that joked he might instead commission a series about “killing vegans” to “expose their hypocrisy”. Since Waitrose is currently promoting new vegan lines, it was unimpressed when these comments ended up in the press. What might have been laughed off in a note to a colleague was poorly judged as a response to a freelancer’s pitch for paid work.
Had he thought better of his rudeness and sent a follow-up email, the story might have had a different ending. Vegans, as has been pointed out by Mr Sitwell’s defenders, are not a minority it is a crime to insult. What they are, to those who would rather ignore the peril of rising carbon emissions, is an irritation. To others who share their concerns, they offer a challenge – even an inspiration.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/01/the-guardian-view-on-vegans-a-dietary-challenge

The first study of climate extremes in the UK by the government agency shows the longer-term trend behind this summer’s prolonged spell of high temperatures and the weakening of winter frosts.
In line with numerous other research papers on the rise in global temperatures, it also highlights how weather patterns are being pushed off a normal path as a result of human emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
Until now the annual UK Climate Report has focused on monthly and yearly statistics, but a new supplement adds a series of indices on extreme weather.
Mark McCarthy, the manager of the National Climate Information Centre, said: “Monthly, seasonal and annual climate data provide a valuable record of the changing climate in the UK. However, these average figures have a tendency to mask extreme weather and climate events. So in our latest report we have focussed on those measures which record weather extremes.”
The new report shows that warm spells – when the maximum temperature is above the 90th percentile for the time of year – are becoming much more prolonged. From 1961 to 1990, the average longest warm spell each year was 5.3 days. From 2008 to 2017 this more than doubled to 13.2 days. This year, which is not included in these statistics, was even longer at 17 days.
The south-east has seen an especially striking increase over the same period, up from an average of 6.1 days to 18.3 days.
Tropical nights – when minimum nighttime temperatures remain above 20C – are being measured for the first time. They were almost unheard of until a couple of decades ago. Even the famous hot summer of 1976 never saw any of these nights, which are particularly gruelling for the elderly and infirm because they provide no respite from the heat. Since 1995 they have started to be recorded in London, Kent, the Isle of Wight and even occasionally in Wales and the north-east. 
McCarthy said tropical nights were still very rare but he expected them to occur more frequently in the future. “With projections in climate suggesting warmer temperatures, it is useful to have this metric in place so that future changes can be monitored.”
McCarthy said he was most surprised that extremes of hot and cold were changing at different speeds. While the temperature on the hottest day of the year has risen roughly in line with the average annual rate of warming since 1961, the coldest day has warmed at twice that rate. In the 30 years until 1990, the bitterest winter night in the UK averaged -8.5C. From 2008 to 2017 it was -6.8C.
Parents who walk their children to school in the depths of winter may also have noticed there is less ice on the path than during their own childhoods. This is confirmed by the metric of “icing days”, which shows that the average number of days each year with freezing temperatures has fallen from 4.8 to 3.2. In the south-east last year there was not a single day averaging below 0C.
The weather is becoming a little wetter and more dreary. The maximum daily deluge each year has risen by 17% from 64mm to 75mm, while the longest wet spell has increased from an average of 12.4 days to 12.9 days.
The longest dry spell has become shorter, falling from 20.5 days with less than 1mm of rain to 18 days, though this year has brought such severe droughts that many farmers have had poor harvests. Many have already had to feed their winter food stocks to their animals and face increased costs as a result. In August the government was forced to relax rules on how much groundwater farmers were allowed to use after agriculture bodies warned continued dry weather could lead to food shortages and increased prices.
Last month the UN’s top climate body warned that unless global temperature rises are held to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the world is likely to face catastrophic impacts from climate change, with flooding, droughts and extreme heat all more prevalent. Governments will meet in Poland in December for the latest round of negotiations over how to implement and strengthen the recommendations of the 2015 Paris agreement.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/nov/02/uk-heatwaves-lasting-twice-as-long-as-50-years-ago-met-office

General assumption that base-load demand can only be supplied by base-load power stations (for example, coal in Australia and nuclear in France) is simply wrong. Not that truth matters to the fossil-fuel obsessed.
A 2013 report by an Australian Renewable Energy Agency research team found non-renewables baseload - baseload fuelled by non-renewables - to be unnecessary. Baseload is necessary, yes, but such as is required does not need to be fossil-fuelled. Appalling! 
That model's thousands of computer simulations used actual hourly NEM (National Electricity Market) data on electricity demand, wind and solar power for 2010. It found that generating systems comprising a mix of different commercially available renewable energy technologies, located on geographically dispersed sites, do not need fossil-fuelled base-load power stations to achieve the same reliability as fossil-fuelled systems. Obviously the structure will need to reflect today's, but the principle is the same.
Carbon emissions from the electricity sector can be reduced to zero. All that is required is the will to overcome the damage done by the fossil-fuel industry’s agents of influence. 
A proper mix of renewable energy technologies in the computer model (which by definition has no fossil-fuelled base-load power stations) would easily supply base-load demand in the real world. Optimal mix comprises wind 50-60%; solar PV 15-20%; concentrated solar thermal with 15 hours of thermal storage 15-20%; any small remainder being supplied by existing hydro and gas turbines burning renewable gases or liquids.

*consults oracle*
OK, so there's roughly nine million households in Australia. It costs around $35,000 retail to go off grid with top quality components, installed, with storage. Smoosh those two numbers together and you get $315B. It's a big number. With a bulk discount and wholesale prices, plus a bit of legislative leverage we could knock two thirds off that price. So about $100B. A large part of which would be labor.
So. Our welfare spend is about $50B a year. Which means we could permanently* solve household emissions with a one-off outlay of the equivalent of two years' welfare spend. Also a big number. But not an inconceivable one.
Then we factor in the 800,000 people who are on unemployment benefits. They're already forced to work for the dole, but it's mostly meaningless busy work. Putting them to work on a transformative infrastructure project would be significantly more useful and fulfilling. Even factoring in the cost of training we'd still be able to knock a massive chunk off our $100B bill. 
So we could conceivably do this for $50B or $75B. Big numbers, but not so big that the 20 richest people in Australia couldn't put it together in a whip around. Not so big that a dozen of the world's richest corporations couldn't get it done on a global scale. With widespread adoption of electric vehicles plus some large scale on-demand generation for heavy industry we'd be close to solving the problem. Fair dinkum.
And all without destroying capitalism, more's the pity. It seems odd that those who stand to lose the most from capitalism's collapse are doing their best to perpetuate its most heinous idiocies.

Now, safely outside political life, he looks on with bemusement about where the climate and energy debate has washed up.
On Tuesday, Combet launched a new report by the Industrial Relations Research Centre at the University of New South Wales investigating how countries such as Australia can achieve a fair transition for coal workers displaced as the economy decarbonises.
It got a bit lost in the wash of the week – let’s face it, it’s hard for substance to compete with the rolling spectacle of political dysfunction – but it’s an interesting bit of analysis funded by the CFMEU’s mining and energy division.
In 2011 Combet had to fight almost everyone in the country to get the clean energy package legislated. Business was hostile. The energy sector was hostile. Barnaby Joyce was screeching apocalyptically about $100 lamb roasts.
But while Combet’s experience was everyone shouting at him for doing something, we’ve now come full circle. Now, all the shouting is about the current government doing nothing.
Business and energy retailers are on the frontline of increasingly frantic calls for policy certainty. The Gillard government would have killed for the conditions the Coalition has blown away over the last three years with reckless abandon.
In any case, Combet ventured out this week about the future of coal. He insists the outlook is clear. If the world, and specifically Australia, is to do what is necessary to contain warming at 2C, then almost all coal-fired power will be gone by 2040. “That’s only 22 years away,” he tells Guardian Australia. “The energy companies get it. This is very much front of mind for the asset holders, and they want rational policy. They aren’t fighting it anymore. They don’t want stranded assets.”
A hands off approach has left many retrenched workers and their communities with very difficult transition problems
He says the energy market is going to transition “whether or not we’ve got Scott Morrison at the helm” and government owes it to people who will be materially affected in the transition to play it straight.
“Workers in coal power stations need to know the truth. You really have to tell people the truth about structural change when it’s coming – you can’t be populist about it”.
Earlier this year I asked the resources minister Matt Canavan whether he felt an obligation to help Australian communities face up to the inevitability of a carbon-constrained future. He responded as if I’d committed a thought crime.
Labor, for its part, is putting a package of measures together. It’s likely to include a new statutory authority to oversee the transition and the programs intended to ameliorate it; specific industrial relations arrangements to ensure workers are managed through the process; and programs to drive economic diversification.
Labor took a policy on coal transition to the last federal election, but it has to be re-engineered in some respects to take into account lessons learned from the closure of the Hazelwood plant, and also to reference the requirements of the reliability obligation in the national energy guarantee.
Scott Morrison dumped the emissions reduction component of the Neg – it was a casualty of the Liberal leadership implosion – but Labor is likely to keep the policy with its own tweaks. A Labor Neg will have a higher emissions reduction target than the 26% proposed by Malcolm Turnbull, which will drive coal closure, but the reliability obligation (which requires retailers to provide sufficient quantities of dispatchable power to the grid) could mean that some coal persists in the system in a reserve capacity.
Labor’s objective is to land the policy before the party convenes in Adelaide in mid-December for its national conference.
The government’s new energy minister, Angus Taylor, is pushing in the opposite direction. Taylor is a bright bloke, with a lot of expertise in energy, which makes some of the positions he is pursuing hard to comprehend.
While the science says the energy sector has to transition, and quickly, Taylor is digging in for coal. He’s signalled he wants to extend the life of existing plants and achieve new investment in generation by offering government support, including the possible indemnification of new coal-fired power from future carbon risk, which transfers the risk of these projects from private proponents to taxpayers.
Taylor will also meet with the energy companies in Sydney next week to waggle his finger censoriously at them over their pricing behaviour. Now, why? Because he needs an outcome on that before voters go to the polls next year, because Morrison, in the spirit of handing on a poisoned chalice, has dubbed him the minister for getting power prices down.
Power prices are high, and it would be terrific if they were lower. Ministers should stick up for the interests of consumers, that’s a given, but we also need ministers to think about interests that extend further than the next six months – something this government has become incapable of doing, which is what happens when the sum of your mistakes forces you to live minute to minute, without much care for whether anything connects to anything else, or whether things make sense.
As the chairman of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, investment banker and company director Steven Skala, noted this week, the transition is on in the energy market. It can’t be reversed. Business has moved. The financial markets have moved. “The question now is not one of direction, but of pace,” he said.
Unlike some disruptions, which present too quickly for governments to ameliorate the effects, we can see this one coming. We are living through the first phase of it.
When it comes to Australia’s 8,000 coal workers and the communities that depend on those workers spending their incomes locally, governments can either pretend they can hold back the future, indulging inane, virtue signalling with Alan Jones about “fair dinkum” power while letting real people be crunched in the transformation, or they can act to make the shift as just as possible.
The report Combet launched this week warns that a hands off approach has left many retrenched workers and their communities with very difficult transition problems.
“Because of lack of subsequent support, some problems – like intergenerational unemployment, poverty and poor physical and psychological health – continue and worsen with time, becoming entrenched and systemic,” it says. “These people, their families and communities have been left to carry the main costs of structural adjustment. This represents a very unfair transition.”
So here’s a thought.
Instead of “fair dinkum” power, perhaps we could contemplate some “fair dinkum” action?",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/nov/03/instead-of-fair-dinkum-power-how-about-some-fair-dinkum-action-on-climate-change

They’ve been inspired by 15-year-old Greta Thunberg, a Swedish student who has been sitting outside the parliament in central Stockholm to draw attention to the fears younger generations hold about the global climate crisis and the failure of countries to take urgent action.
Fourteen-year-old Milou Albrecht, a year 8 student at Castlemaine Steiner school in Victoria, her classmate Harriet O’Shea Carre, and 11-year-old Callum Bridgefoot from Castlemaine North primary school, started by protesting last week outside of the offices of their local representatives, the Labor MP Lisa Chester and the Nationals deputy leader, Bridget McKenzie. They’ve been joined by 50 students from local schools and are planning weekly events.
And what began as a small local protest is growing into a nationwide movement. Students in Melbourne, Sydney, Canberra, Perth, Hobart, the Whitsundays, Lismore, the Gold Coast, Albury-Wodonga and the Sunshine Coast are planning to walk out of classes this month.
Similar plans are being explored in other regional areas including Coffs Harbour, Cairns, Townsville and the southern highlands of New South Wales. Hundreds of students have indicated they want to attend protests outside state parliaments in the capital cities on 28, 29 and 30 November.
The idea for the strikes came from the Castlemaine students, who contacted the Australian Youth Climate Coalition for help.
They have had assistance from the coalition and their parents with contacting media, building a website and spreading the word about the strikes through their social networks.
“We think it’s important because it’s a huge problem,” Milou said. “The Earth is already too hot, with droughts in winter in NSW and the coral reef is dying.”
She said students were speaking to Greta in Sweden each week. “I would like our politicians to acknowledge climate change is an emergency and take the necessary steps in order to have a sustainable world,” she said.
A 14-year-old Fort Street high school student, Jean Hinchliffe, is organising the Sydney walkout on 30 November. She said there was a template letter students who were worried about taking time off class could give to their teachers.
“We’ve got involved because at this stage we can’t vote, we’re not politicians and we want to make a difference,” she said. “We can’t stand around waiting.
“I think it’s because climate change is scary seeing that it’s our future. This is a fact and not to be debated.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/nov/07/australian-students-plan-school-strikes-to-protest-against-climate-inaction

These are the assessments of the member for Hughes, Craig Kelly, who is part of a Tony Abbott-led speaking campaign to pull the Liberal party back from the centre.
The Guardian has obtained a tape of a presentation by Kelly at the right-aligned Mosman branch of the Liberal party in September that outlines in detail his climate scepticism.
Abbott himself was meant to be the star billing but was unable to attend, leaving Kelly and New South Wales senator Jim Molan to occupy centre stage, after running a gauntlet of about 100 demonstrators who turned up to protest against the Liberal party’s lack of policy on climate change.
Kelly’s PowerPoint presentation veered between mocking “the lefties” and arguing that there was no need to tackle climate change because its impact had been grossly overblown.
“Here we are in Paris, France,” he said of his first slide. “A whole lot of lefties here celebrating the Paris agreement, the achievement of the day.”
Kelly then said the debate about global warming was about trying to get “better weather, and that people wanted to dial down the CO2 knob.
“It’s CO2 we are talking about: it’s what turns water into soda water, its what makes chardonnay into champagne,” he said derisively, before claiming that the consensus view among the world’s scientists that the planet was warming was wrong.
Kelly said that “30 years ago, the temperature was the same globally about where it was today” – even though the Bureau of Meteorology and other international agencies estimate the planet has already warmed more than 1 degree in the past century.
“The reality is we live in a time where our generation has never ever been as safe from the climate because of fossil fuels, concrete and steel,” Kelly said. “The climate was always dangerous. We didn’t make it dangerous.”
He also claimed “coral bleaching was a centuries-old problem, science tells us” and that warnings about the polar icecaps were not borne out. While he acknowledged there had been some shrinking in the Arctic, he said this year the north-west passage had been closed owing to ice.
Kelly, who was a furniture salesman before he entered parliament, also cited a study that said Tuvalu was growing not sinking. The peer-reviewed study shows the island’s land mass has grown owing to sedimention and reef growth, but Kelly ignored part of the same study that said climate change remained the single biggest threat to the low-lying Pacific islands and their future.
As for Australia’s Paris target, Kelly said it was “the most onerous of any nation in the world because of our high rates of population growth”, and the Labor party planned to wreck the economy with its proposal to set a target of 45% reduction by 2030.
The chief scientist, Alan Finkel, had said Australia on its own could not change the world’s climate, Kelly said.
Now that “the US was out” of the Paris agreement, and “China and India weren’t doing anything”, Australia had “an escape clause” and it should use it.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/nov/09/craig-kelly-mocks-climate-change-exaggeration-in-presentation-to-liberal-party-members

Not long after taking office in March 2017, the new secretary started flying a special flag, adorned with the agency’s bison seal, above the interior department’s elegant New Deal-era headquarters. At a cost of more than $2,000, he also commissioned commemorative coins emblazoned with his name to hand out to visitors and staff. He replaced the doors in his office to the tune of more than $130,000, and installed a hunting-themed arcade game in the department’s cafeteria.
Yet to some longtime civil servants working at interior headquarters, this flashy behavior was merely a distraction from graver concerns.
“There was a lot of eye-rolling and embarrassment about the flag and the horse and all of the ridiculousness,” said a former senior employee who left last year and requested anonymity for fear of retaliation. For some, the dominant emotional tenor at the time was “fear and anxiety” as Zinke and his team ushered in “dramatic change” at the interior department.
“All the new administration was interested in was their checklist for dismantling regulations and weakening environmental and land use protections,” said the former staffer. “Instead of asking why a senator or lobbyist or CEO was asking for a special favor and whether or not it was allowed under the law, this administration wanted to know why the special favor wasn’t already done and which deep state employee was standing in the way.”
I have have seen different administrations from both sides of the aisle … but this is the worst
Despite his public persona as a folksy Montanan with a Boy Scout’s penchant for pennants and horses, Zinke has taken shrewd and aggressive steps to transform from the inside a department whose 70,000 employees manage the country’s treasured national parks and its endangered species, in addition to overseeing vast energy and mineral deposits on at least 500m acres of public land.
During Zinke’s first months in office, he reassigned at least 25 senior officials at the department, a move that led some of the affected staff to question whether they were being punished for past work on subjects such as climate change, and which prompted at least one high-profile resignation. He publicly questioned the allegiance of other of his newly inherited employees, saying he had “30% of the crew that’s not loyal to the flag”.
Most importantly, Zinke rapidly installed a slew of conservative operatives and industry sympathizers in key positions throughout the agency. Because these senior advisers, counselors and other appointees are rarely subject to Senate approval, few people know their names. They nevertheless wield immense power and are responsible for much of the day-to-day work at the interior department.
Hundreds of pages of correspondence and calendars reviewed by the Guardian and Pacific Standard show how Zinke and his top aides have favored corporate and conservative calls to prioritize resource extraction at the expense of conservation, while consistently delivering on industry desires – despite sometimes running afoul of conflict of interest rules.
The interior department responded to only one of multiple inquiries made to it, saying through a spokesperson that “the Department has addressed these questions to you and other reporters on multiple occasions. Our position remains unchanged.”
Zinke is now facing a swirl of misconduct allegations, and Trump has said he would make a decision on his future at the department as soon as this week. But whatever Zinke’s fate, he has stocked the department with a slate of committed conservative appointees who will continue to remake the agency in the image of the Trump administration.
“They are undermining the department’s mission at every turn,” said one current high-level civil servant, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. “I have been here a pretty long time and seen different administrations from both sides of the aisle,” the civil servant added, “but this is the worst I have ever seen.”
During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump made no secret of his ambition to exploit the American landscape. “A Trump administration will develop an American first energy plan,” he said in a 2016 speech before the North Dakota Petroleum Council. “American energy dominance will be declared a strategic, economic and foreign policy goal of the United States.”
The US controls enormous publicly owned energy resources, from the underwater oil wells of the Gulf of Mexico to the gas fields of North Dakota and the uranium deposits of Arizona. The interior department is the agency that decides who can drill and mine these riches.
Zinke has styled himself, at least superficially, after Theodore Roosevelt, the progressive-era president who helped create America’s modern conservation system. But Zinke has veered sharply from Roosevelt’s legacy.
Where Roosevelt created the nation’s first national monuments, Zinke drastically reduced the size of Bears Ears national monument and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monument in Utah last year in what amounted to the largest rollback of protected public lands in American history.
More broadly, over the last fiscal year, the department has sought to lease a stunning 12.8m acres of publicly-owned oil and gas parcels to private companies.
And while Roosevelt railed against powerful special interests, Zinke has a cozy relationship with industry groups. The monument reductions occurred after Zinke was pressured by conservative groups such as the Koch brothers-affiliated Americans for Prosperity and energy companies such as the uranium firm Energy Fuels Inc. In fact, during Zinke’s first 18 months in office he met repeatedly with oil and gas industry organizations that have collectively given him more than $110,000 in political contributions over the course of his career, according to a report from the Western Values Project.
Zinke’s top deputies also have a close relationship with extractive industries. During their first year and a half on the job, just seven of Zinke’s high-level political appointees collectively participated in at least 280 meetings, calls or gatherings with fossil fuel corporations, mining companies or related advocacy groups, according to calendars obtained via public records requests and analyzed by the Guardian and Pacific Standard. Meetings with conservative ideological organizations, agricultural and timber groups, and corporate lobbying and law firms also appeared regularly on the officials’ calendars.
These extractive interests had more than twice as much access as conservation NGOs, which obtained at least 115 meetings and calls with the seven officials within the same timeframe.
At a private energy summit that took place in Washington DC last December, a Zinke appointee named Timothy Williams articulated the department’s pro-industry agenda, according to documentation of his remarks reported here for the first time.
Williams dismissively characterized the approach taken by the administration of Barack Obama: “Anything you want to do on public land, they want to see what the carbon footprint is and what the social cost is.” Under Zinke, “we’re not looking at this”, he said. The new administration was instead focused on “economic impacts”. It was bent on changing “the mindset of the bureaucrats”.
From the very beginning, however, Zinke’s interior appointees appear to have violated Trump’s own ethics directives intended to “drain the swamp”.
According to rules put in place by the Trump administration, officials are supposed to be prohibited for a period of two years from the date of their appointment from having meetings with former employers, with few exceptions, and interior department guidelines recommend that officials take steps to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest when performing their official duties.
Williams, for instance, previously worked for Americans for Prosperity (AFP), a Koch brothers-funded organization committed to combating government regulations of all kinds, including environmental protections. But soon after joining the department as the deputy director of the office of intergovernmental and external affairs, his office contacted AFP to hold a meeting, according to records obtained by the investigative group Documented. “Happy to meet to discuss partnering on shared priorities,” Chrissy Harbin, then the AFP vice-president, replied in an email.
In another case, the political appointee Douglas Domenech met twice in April 2017 with representatives of his former employer, the Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF), another Koch-linked conservative foundation. According to his work calendar, the subject of the meeting was a pair of active lawsuits the organization had filed against agencies within the interior department concerning endangered species and property rights – the meetings appear to be a glaring conflict of interest. Little more than six months after its meetings with Domenech, TPPF had what it described as a “major win” when it settled one of those lawsuits.
There are “express prohibitions” on such meetings in the White House’s own ethics pledge, said Virginia Canter, the chief ethics counsel at the non-partisan Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics. “These high-level officials are supposed to be setting the tone for the entire department and this shows a complete disregard for the ethics rules put in place by the administration.”
The Guardian and Pacific Standard have uncovered several instances in which interior department leadership has coordinated closely with industry-aligned groups on crucial legal and regulatory decisions, with profound consequences for efforts to combat climate change, wildlife management and other matters.
Zinke’s department plays a major role in the regulation of methane which, for the first 20 years after it is introduced into the atmosphere, is over 80 times more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide. The interior department under Barack Obama moved to clamp down on a principal source of domestic methane pollution – the wasteful leaking, venting and flaring of methane by oil and gas companies. In late 2016, just before Obama left office, the interior department finalized a new federal regulation that required oil and gas drillers operating on public land to take stringent steps to detect and capture methane waste.
Influential oil and gas industry trade groups like the Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA) were opposed to the measure, and sued in late 2016 to block what it considered a “regulatory onslaught on American producers”. During the first months of the Trump administration, Republicans led an industry-backed effort to repeal the methane rule using the Congressional Review Act, a law that enables Congress and the president to roll back recently issued regulations.
It seems clear that the methane rule rollback was a foregone conclusion from day one
The repeal effort soon ran into trouble, however, when Senate Democrats and a handful of Republicans, including Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, publicly came out against it in the spring of 2017.
Emails reveal how the interior department and oil industry coordinated a response. 
“Really?” wrote interior official Micah Chambers, in a frustrated March 2017 note to Ryan Ullman, the IPAA’s director of government relations, upon learning of Graham’s opposition.
“I’m disappointed to put it very politely,” Ullman responded. Ullman asked whether the department would wheel out Zinke to make the case for getting rid of the regulation.
Graham did not change his mind about the methane rule and the Senate ultimately voted against repealing the regulation. Zinke’s department soon took matters into its own hands. The department tried twice in 2017 to block methane regulation by itself, but both times it was stymied by legal challenges from environmentalist groups and state governments.
A political appointee named Katharine MacGregor helped lead the department’s handling of the issue. Her calendar shows several meetings with fossil-fuel industry groups in the summer and fall of 2017, including one about methane just a few hours before an internal interior department meeting on the same subject.
In September this year, MacGregor announced that the department had decided to rewrite the rule entirely, rather than merely block it. The revision effectively rolled it back.
Chase Huntley, the energy and climate program director at The Wilderness Society, said his organization held several meetings with top interior officials, and it became apparent to him that their minds were already made up: the gutting of the methane rule was a preordained outcome.
“It seems clear that the methane rule rollback, while arbitrary, was a foregone conclusion from day one of this administration,” he said. It was rooted “in a philosophical and policy allegiance to the industry’s best interests”.
Extractive industries also seem to have had a hand in the department’s implementation of the Endangered Species Act, which is regarded as one of the strongest environmental laws in the world but is the bane of some industry groups because it limits development in sensitive habitat.
The interior department energy counselor, Vincent DeVito, for instance, appears to have helped delay Endangered Species Act protections last year for an imperiled freshwater mussel species in Texas at the behest of oil and gas interests. In mid 2017, the government relations director for the Independent Petroleum Association of America wrote in an email to DeVito: “We really hope that you can intervene before this species gets listed next month.”
When the species’ listing was delayed, the Guardian and Pacific Standard have learned from records, the IPAA sent DeVito an email with the words: “THANK YOU!” DeVito has since left the department to work for an oil and gas company.
The department has taken a controversial stance, too, on sage grouse, a chicken-size bird that dwells among the sprawling sagebrush plains of the American west. Even the slightest disturbance can drive the animal from its breeding and nesting grounds, and populations have plummeted in recent decades as oil and gas drilling, mining and other development has fractured its habitat.
In 2015, the Obama administration unveiled protection plans for the species, including a proposal to prohibit new mining on 10m acres of federal land in the hope of avoiding disturbance. But after Trump’s election, the mining industry suddenly found itself with committed sympathizers within the interior development.
A striking email chain reviewed by the Guardian and Pacific Standard reveals that a mining industry advocate helped edit the wording of legislative language intended to block funding for these sage grouse conservation efforts.
In one message from spring 2017, a Republican staffer with the Congressional Western Caucus named Jeff Small described producing the proposed text “after much discussion” with Laura Skaer, the executive director of the influential American Exploration and Mining Association (AEMA). He sent an email to top officials at the interior department to run the legislative language past them too.
Kathleen Benedetto, a senior adviser at the department, replied: “It will need to be modified.” That very day, a modified version of the language was suggested to a house committee by the Republican congressman Paul Gosar. (A spokesperson for Gosar said that “it is common for us to solicit feedback from outside experts and impacted stakeholders”.)
The Republican-led Congress ultimately failed to block funding for the proposed mining prohibition, however, and Zinke’s department once again took matters into its own hands. In June 2017, Zinke established a broad internal review of the Obama-era sage grouse conservation plans, naming Benedetto, previously the co-founder of the Women’s Mining Coalition, as “co-lead” of the effort.
Over the course of the next four months, Benedetto’s calendar shows she had at least 16 meetings or calls with mining groups. In October 2017, the Bureau of Land Management, which Benedetto helps oversee, announced that the 10m acres would no longer be out of bounds for mining.
The AEMA celebrated the victory, saying the interior department “has done the right thing by ending this epic federal land grab”.
Since taking office, Zinke and his department have been subject to no fewer than 15 federal investigations. The interior department’s office of inspector general is investigating his involvement in a Montana land deal with the chairman of the oil services company Halliburton. It is also looking into his role in blocking the development of a proposed casino involving two Native American tribes in Connecticut. In late October, the Washington Post reported that the inspector general’s office referred one of its inquiries to the justice department for further investigation, though it did not specify which one.
The secretary’s pro-fossil-fuel agenda, his team’s conflict of interests problems, and his own personal conduct are likely to draw intense scrutiny from Democrats once they take control of the House in January 2019. Already, congressman Raúl Grijalva of Arizona, who will probably take the reins as the chair of the House natural resources committee next year, has vowed to call Zinke before the committee in order to interrogate him about his “failures and scandals”. Whether Zinke sticks around at the department is an open question, though many press reports indicate that he is preparing to step down from office.
His political appointees, nevertheless, will probably remain. But they too acknowledge that they have a short timeframe in which to finish their work of fulfilling Trump’s energy dominance agenda.
At the private Washington DC energy summit back in December, Timothy Williams admitted as much to his audience of conservative operatives and fossil-fuel advocates.
“Obviously we are not going as fast as everybody wants, but at some point there will be an administration in here, an administration that is not friendly to your values, to you guys,” he said.
“So bear with us,” he added later. “You guys should know that if you have any questions or any problems you feel free to contact me. That is my job. To work with industry.”

But the energy minister, Angus Taylor, has claimed Australia doesn’t need a carbon price as emissions levels are coming down – a position at odds with the government’s official emissions data and independent modelling.
He also claimed the companies would benefit economically from putting a higher price on carbon – but has not put forward any evidence to support that claim.
“There is almost no other country in the world that has the credentials of Australia in reducing carbon emissions,” Taylor told ABC radio on Wednesday. “We are bringing emissions down, and we’re doing extremely well.”
The latest government data showed overall greenhouse gas emissions climbed 1.3%, to their highest quarterly levels in eight years.
Woodside Petroleum had been an outspoken opponent of carbon pricing under Julia Gillard’s former Labor government.
However, its current chief, Coleman, says investors are increasingly concerned about the company’s sustainability measures, and the issue should be dealt with through an appropriate global approach.
“We need a price on carbon. We need to ensure the most effective energy gets into the system,” he told the ABC on Tuesday evening.
“We don’t want to have perversive outcomes where lowest-cost energy suppliers are competing against renewables, and we end up in a situation where we’ve invested a lot in renewables but in fact see no benefit from a carbon point of view.”
Industries such as shipping need to be incentivised to transition to cleaner energy, he added.
“If you believe in the science or not really doesn’t matter,” Coleman said. “By the time the science is proven, it will be too late to act. So it’s prudent to act today.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/14/woodside-petroleum-joins-bhp-and-rio-tinto-to-call-for-carbon-price

The 25-year-old, whose YouTube channel has 4 million subscribers, spoke to the Guardian as he helped hold a 68-metre banner over the side of Westminster Bridge with the words: “Climate change: we’re fucked”.
Harries, who has made a number of films about environmental destruction, said he was willing to use his social media influence to inspire his followers to take action over the climate.
He said: “As a young person growing up in London I feel scared for the state of my future [and] overwhelmed by the news about climate change, and I feel like our government is simply ignoring the problem.
“It’s worth noting I don’t want to be here, but I feel that it’s my duty as a young person to make our voices heard and to force our governments to listen because, ultimately, it’s our future that’s at stake.”
He added: “Climate change is a global issue and it’s up to all of us to stand up to be heard. I think we have gone past the point of turning off our lightbulbs or having shorter showers. This is an existential threat. Young people should be angry and should be demanding change from their leaders.
“For far too long leaders have avoided action on climate change because they have banked on the fact that young people don’t understand. We are here today to tell them that we do understand the issues, and we are scared.”
Harries spoke at the beginning of a new day of action by the Extinction Rebellion group, which is orchestrating a week of events planned to bring London to a standstill. They say they have 500 activists who have signed up to be arrested.

Seven protesters were held outside Downing Street after spraypainting messages on the walls beside the gates, gluing themselves to fencing and lying on the ground holding food containers reading “food shortages are coming”.
Seven more were arrested outside the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) after a group ran up to Nobel House, Westminster, and spraypainted the walls with messages including the extinction symbol and “climate breakdown = extinction”.

He said: “If we carry on like we are now, my grandchildren have no future, absolutely no future. This is the last-ditch attempt, it’s too late to try anything else.”
A second protester, facing police who arrived minutes later, said: “You don’t have to waste your time with CCTV because we’re not running away and we’ve got paint on our hands.”

High-resolution climate simulations of 15 tropical cyclones in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans found that warming in the ocean and atmosphere increased rainfall by between 5% and 10%, although wind speeds remained largely unchanged.
This situation is set to worsen under future anticipated warming, however. Researchers found that if little is done to constrain greenhouse gas emissions and the world warms by 3C to 4C this century then hurricane rainfall could increase by a third, while wind speeds would be boosted by as much as 25 knots.
“Climate change has exacerbated rainfall and is set to enhance the wind speed,” said Christina Patricola, who undertook the study with her Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory colleague Michael Wehner. “My hope is that this information can be used to improve our resilience to the kinds of extreme weather events we are going to have in the future.”
The research, published in the journal Nature, used climate models to see how factors such as air and ocean temperatures have influenced hurricanes. Projections into the future were then made, based upon various levels of planetary warming.
The findings suggest that enormously destructive storms have already been bolstered by climate change and similar events in the future are on course to be cataclysmic.
In a world where temperatures were 3C warmer on average, Hurricane Katrina, which resulted in nearly 2,000 deaths when levees breached near New Orleans in 2005, would’ve been even worse, with around 25% more rainfall. Cyclone Yasi, which hit Australia in 2011, would have had around a third more rain, while the deluge during Gafilo, a huge storm that killed more than 300 people in Madagascar in 2004, would have been 40% more intense.
Jennifer Francis, a hurricane expert at Rutgers University, said: “This study adds exclamation points to the already clear message that we must slow global warming by conserving energy and switching from fossil to renewable fuels while preparing for more extreme weather to come.”
Hurricanes, or cyclones as they are known in the Pacific region, draw their strength from warmth in the upper layers of the ocean, while their rainfall is influenced by the amount of moisture in the atmosphere. Climate change, driven by human activity, is creating more favorable conditions for stronger hurricanes, with recent research finding that storms are intensifying more rapidly than they were 30 years ago.
Last year was the costliest hurricane season on record for the US, with $306.2bn in damage caused by a trio of category four storms – Harvey, Irma and Maria – which, respectively, drowned parts of Houston, rattled most of Florida, and decimated Puerto Rico. Two further major storms this year, Michael and Florence, caused widespread damage and dozens of deaths in Florida and North Carolina.
“Five or 10% more rain can make a big difference, the carrying capacity of stormwater systems in a town or city can be breached with that amount of extra rainfall,” said James Elsner, an atmospheric scientist at Florida State university.
Elsner said the study follows previous findings showing the climate change “fingerprint” on hurricanes. “There’s still discussion over the size of the affect but it’s clear,” he said. “We need to connect the dots after storms more than we have in the past. We know climate change is having an affect, the only real question is how much.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/14/climate-change-hurricanes-study-global-warming

Flora and fauna often recover quite quickly from one-off events but when these occur more frequently, there tends to be a shift in the relative abundance of species that are better or worse adapted to the new prevailing conditions. Rare species can become common, because the climate now suits them better, and common species that are now less well adapted can decline. And when species that are worst affected decline, other opportunists take their place – notably invasive species introduced through agriculture or horticulture. This is one of a number of ways in which ecological changes occur.
And so the species composition of landscape changes. Whether the change is for the worse, or is just ‘different’ is an interesting question. Because our flora and fauna are so well documented by naturalists, perhaps more so than in any other country, we are conditioned to think of it with what might be considered a ‘museum curator mindset’, with some golden age, perhaps just prior to the industrial revolution, as the datum point against which everything is measured. But, of course, our countryside and its flora and fauna has changed ever since the retreating glaciers left a landscape of bare rock. The big difference now, compared with previous periods of climate change, is the catastrophic, all pervasive effect of human activity, particularly intensive agriculture, on species abundance. 
It seems to me that, for naturalists in general and perhaps Country Diarists in particular, we live in very interesting times and that observing and documenting the ‘here and now’ might be something that will be valued by future generations.

A rapid thaw after late heavy snowfall, followed by torrential rain, had left a pair of great-crested grebes piling up water weeds in a desperate attempt to keep their nest site above rising flood water.
Today, after the driest summer I can remember, a third of what was 66 acres of deep water is still mud. The sluggish beck meanders through the sediment towards a shallow lake, its rate of flow akin to replenishing an empty swimming pool using an egg cup. It will take many weeks of heavy rain to recharge the groundwater in the surrounding fells to the point where a refilled reservoir will cascade over the dam wall spillway again.
Tunstall reservoir, built in 1879 to store drinking water, is now relegated to the role of maintaining summer water flow in the River Wear, three miles downstream at Wolsingham. It has been stocked with rainbow trout and all summer they have become concentrated in a shrinking volume of water. I counted 12 fishermen this morning: only one was using a rod and line; six were cormorants and five were herons, taking full advantage of such easy feeding opportunities. The idiom “shooting fish in a barrel” came to mind.
I walked home through Backstone Bank wood, ancient oak woodland on the eastern flank of the reservoir, across a wooden bridge over another stream, where the trickle of water barely disturbed the autumn leaves that spun down into its rocky bed.
The morning’s climate change news had been of a Met Office report describing a pattern of wetter winters and longer, drier summers. The reservoir’s water level has sometimes been low in the past, but it seems likely that this year’s exceptional weather experience will become the new normal. I’ve known this secluded valley for most of my life, with its farms, fellsides, wetlands and woodlands, all interlinked. There is now a sense of urgency in appreciating the here and now, before too much changes too fast.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/15/country-diary-dry-summer-fish-exposed-tunstall-valley-weardale

I was in the middle of an inferno, and when the firestorms hit it was like a fiery tornado, with roofs being blown off houses. At that moment fire trucks wouldn't have helped but would have been of assistance half an hour later when some houses were not yet on fire but starting to ignite, and people needed to be transported to hospitals.
A catastrophic fire may need to be treated like a tornado or a bombing raid. While it is possible under these conditions, with much luck, to save a well-built, landscaped and well-prepared house with well-set up and well-protected water supply, I wouldn't risk it again. Having the breathing equipment, which the firefighter in photo has, would have been very useful though. 
Public awareness is crucial. At least the messages are much better than 10 years ago, and more emphasis is put on saving lives.

Pity that our fantastic fire-fighting fails some days. So far, more people have died from fires in Victoria than in California. California has 6 times the population of Victoria. 
Between 1932 and 2017, death toll in California was around 70, in Victoria 450.
In terms of death toll rather than the area burned, Black Saturday fires of 2009 with 173 people dead have been the worst in the last 150 years of history of Australia.

What cannot be challenged is that the conditions in which fires are occurring are changing - humidity is lower, temperatures higher, and vegetation drier so no matter how well equipped and trained our firefighters, every year the challenge to put out fires increases.', u'recommendation_count': u'2', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1542331925000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'100748378', u'in_reply_to': u'122608382', u'id': u'122611111', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'James Lord', u'text': u'I was a professional (paid) public land firefighter in Victoria for 10 years, as well as a volunteer CFA in my local town. I specialised in remote helicopter operations, so I have certain thoughts on how this job should be done.
1) Climate change is real. We burnt one third of the Alpine Ash areas on two separate occasions between 2003 and 2009, including large areas of regen (juvenile regrowth). Ash trees can't survive any fire before 50 years of age, and so thousands of hectares had to be reseeded by humans. To my mind, if this pattern of fire was normal, the Ash species would never have become established in Victoria.
2) Helicopters are extremely expensive to operate, and of very limited use on extreme days. The are often grounded during the worst fire weather, and even when they are allowed to fly, waterbombing is literally like pissing into the wind. However, on medium-sized fires, with moderate winds, they can literally save a $500,000 house (or someone's life) with a single water drop. There's no doubt that each individual helicopter pays for itself each and every summer. However, this cost/benefit heavily relies on good coordination at a statewide level, and doesn't really scale up with more aircraft on call. You could have had 1000 machines waiting at Essendon airport on Black Saturday, but it wouldn't have saved Marysville, in my opinion. 
3) The public need to change their expectations of fire crews. Nobody expects the government to prevent earthquakes or droughts... but somehow fires are meant to be ""stoppable"". They aren't - when you have a big one get going, the best you can do is buy enough time to move people and assets out of the way. Don't build your home within 50m of any trees. Put water sprays on your roof. Have a plan. Don't complain about drift smoke during autumn burning activities. 
4) Forget about the US - Victoria has already lost its key firefighting partnership: logging crews. In alpine areas, these guys were already on the scene, with trucks and bulldozers and fit men who knew the mountains, and they had a strong incentive to put out fires quickly before they became big. Logging needs to be responsible and environmentally sound, but back in the day most access roads into the national park were maintained by loggers. These are now overgrown, and consequently we can't access remote lightening strikes and put them out while they are small.
5) Ridiculous OHS rules have destroyed our ability to get onto the ground. Most Vic Government firefighting decision makers are now too scared to send people into the forest to fight small fires. We now sit back and wait for them to come out into the open... where they are much bigger, and close to people's houses. We need to back our people, and accept that you can't fight fires wrapped in cotton wool. For all of these reasons, I consider the question of asset sharing between US and Australia as peripheral. There are much more important (and cheaper) ways to improve our capabilities right here on the ground. The social will is lacking.

At least 50 people have lost their lives in California’s deadliest wildfires, which continue to rage. Fire authorities and scientists say climate change has made the conditions worse.
In July the US requested help from Australia and New Zealand, which sent 188 personnel to help fight the blazes. That group has now returned.
For about 20 years, Australia and the US have exchanged personnel and equipment during major fires. But there are fears that, as climate change drives more severe blazes and lengthens fire seasons, those arrangements could be strained. 
A fleet of aircraft, including six adapted helicopters and two Hercules water bombers, are also shared – spending the Australian winter fighting fires in the northern hemisphere before being contracted to fight bushfires in Australia’s summer months.
“It’s an issue for us,” said Stuart Ellis, the chief executive at the Australasian Fire and Emergency Service Authorities Council – the group responsible for coordinating with other countries to share firefighting personnel and equipment.
The problem had “arisen in discussions between ourselves and the US”, he said. “In the US there’s less and less talk of a ‘fire season’ and more a consideration that fire impacts them all through the year.”
The arrangement to contract and share the specialist aircraft, which supplement a fleet owned by Australian authorities, had “worked well for many years”. “There’s no question [the aircraft] make a very positive contribution [to fighting fires],” Ellis said.
But he said the arrangement “could be challenged in the future and we are considering alternatives – whether that’s using more local aircraft or sourcing others”.
I think there’s no other plausible explanation than climate change
This year’s deployment of 188 Australian and New Zealand firefighters followed a group of 240 who crossed the Pacific in 2017.
Most of the Australian team is made up of “incident management specialists” – staff trained in a common system used to coordinate and deploy firefighting units.
“In California there are about 4,500 firefighters deployed or available and, at the height of the fires in the western US, there were about 29,000,” Ellis said. “Where we can help is that they tend to have large numbers of firefighters but they run out of incident management specialists.”
Ellis has been in the US and Canada during recent deployments and said the intensity of this year’s fires and the conditions that fed them were “unprecedented”.
“I think there’s no other plausible explanation than climate change,” he said. “It’s not up to the fire services to say what the cause of that is, but the issue of climate change is one we are applying our minds to because it can have an impact on our resources.”
Dr Richard Thornton, the chief executive of the Melbourne-based Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre, said there was already an overlap in the times spent fighting major fires in the US and Australia.
“We are now seeing regular fires in the United States – and in California – running into November, and there were fires last year in December that led to mudslides and deaths. In Australia, it appears there’s more fires occurring outside of what we would call the fire season. Clearly then, there’s already an overlap.”
The Bureau of Meteorology says Australia’s bushfire season has lengthened, and increasing temperatures and drier conditions have increased the risk of blazes.
Thornton said the sorts of conditions that led to catastrophic fire events such as the 2009 Black Saturday fires were “becoming more likely due to climate change”.
The lengthening of fire seasons also meant there was less time to carry out controlled burning, he said.
He called the loss of life in the California fires “truly tragic” and said there were important lessons to be learned for other parts of the world, including Australia.
“We have a lot of people living in that rural-urban interface,” he said. “Some people have lived there for a long time and others have moved there, and we see urban planning schemes that open up those areas for new dwellings.
“Then we see very high fuel loads close to those populated areas and changes in demographics, with more vulnerable people there, or getting older there.
“Combined with all that, we see conditions for fires occurring more frequently. There’s an increase in the risk, an increase in the exposure to the risk and all that leads to a challenge that countries need to grapple with.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/nov/16/longer-fire-seasons-threaten-to-disrupt-us-australia-firefighting-cooperation

Turk, who was among 82 people arrested during a coordinated occupation of five bridges in the capital, said the pressure to force governments to act to reduce climate change was “the new future”.
He was among scores of people arrested for the obstruction of a public highway on Lambeth Bridge on Saturday in a mass protest to force governments to take action on climate change. He was held for several hours and released later the same day.
Turk, one of the generation of young British artists who became art superstars in the mid-90s, said he had no regrets about taking part in one of the biggest acts of mass civil disobedience for decades, organised by activists known as Extinction Rebellion. 
“It seems like everyone is in an odd sense of denial about climate change,” said Turk. “I was in a quandary about what I could do. I felt taking part was a way of putting my name down and doing something for the environment. It was an incredibly peaceful demonstration and I think we put down some kind of marker. The message is really very slow to get through to people, but it will come to us all, we will all have to deal with the impact of this climate emergency.
“I hope this kind of action has caught the public imagination. It is the new future.”
The civil disobedience in London was matched by other demonstrations elsewhere in the UK, including in Cambridge. The organisers, Extinction Rebellion, want to force governments to treat the threats of climate breakdown and extinction as a crisis.
Five bridges in London, Waterloo, Westminster, Lambeth, Southwark and Blackfriars were occupied for several hours. Organisers said between 4,000 to 6,000 people attended the demonstration.
Extinction Rebellion went public with its message at the end of October. Its growth is a sign that it has caught the public imagination and is offering people the chance to make their voices heard about the need to act to stop global warming, said Tiana Jacout, one of the organisers.
“To get 4,000 plus people on the streets after such a short time is extraordinary,” said Jacout. “We are saying we don’t need to sit back and watch the slow car crash of humanity. We can do something about it. That has sparked something in people.”
The Metropolitan Police said 85 people were arrested on Saturday across the demonstration. That figure was later reduced due to duplicating reports made by officers.
In the past two weeks more than 60 people have been arrested for taking part in acts of civil disobedience organised by Extinction Rebellion, ranging from gluing themselves to government buildings to blocking major roads in the capital.
 Extinction Rebellion cites the civil rights movement, suffragettes and Mahatma Gandhi as inspirations for its campaigns.
The group is calling on the government to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025 and establish a “citizens’ assembly” to devise an emergency plan of action similar to that seen during the second world war.
Organisers say they also hope the campaign of “respectful disruption” will change the debate around climate breakdown and signal to those in power the present course of action will lead to disaster.
The world’s leading climate change scientists have warned there is only 12 years for global warming to be kept to a maximum of 1.5C, beyond which even half a degree will significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people.
The authors of the landmark report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released last month said urgent and unprecedented changes were needed to reach the target.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/18/artist-gavin-turk-arrested-in-london-climate-change-protest

An investigation by the Guardian has found that the trust – which aims to “nurse the environment back to health” – has more than £30m of investments in oil, gas and mining companies, including BP and Shell, held indirectly via a portfolio fund.
The trust has vowed to decrease its own use of fossil fuels across its estates in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in response to climate change, aiming to generate 50% of its energy from renewable sources by 2020.
Hilary McGrady, the director-general of the trust, which has more than five million members and 61,000 volunteers, has previously said: “We are playing our part by ensuring we reduce our dependency on fossil fuels and at every property we are constantly looking at ways to seek out energy efficiencies.”
A 2015 report by the trust warned: “It is abundantly clear to us from across the breadth of places we look after that the impacts of climate change are already increasing, and are a worrying threat to the fragile and venerable places of natural and historic importance that we care for.”
The trust also opposes fracking, not allowing it on its 248,000 hectares of land, “because natural gas is a fossil gas”. However, it has millions of pounds invested through the fund in BP and Shell, both of which have fracking operations. In July, BP invested $10.5bn buying US shale assets from the mining company BHP Billiton.
Fracking, which involves drilling into the earth before a high-pressure water mixture is used to break shale rock and release oil or gas, is highly controversial because of concerns over its environmental impact.
Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP for Brighton Pavilion, has urged the trust to divest from fossil fuels. She said: “It’s disappointing to see a charity so dedicated to protecting our natural heritage undermining its good work with significant support for dirty fossil fuels. We are living through climate breakdown and ecological collapse – every organisation with money to invest must stop funding environmental destruction.
“I’ve been working to persuade parliament to stop investing MPs’ pensions in fossil fuels for years, so I understand this is an uphill battle – but environmental charities should be leading the way. The National Trust must urgently set out a clear path to divesting these funds and supporting firms that make a positive contribution to society instead.”
Mary Creagh, the Labour MP for Wakefield who chairs the environmental audit select committee, said: “Members of the National Trust will be shocked to learn about the scale of the charity’s investments in fossil fuels. My committee has highlighted the financial risks from climate change, and called on large companies to report on their exposure to climate risk.
“National Trust must ‘green check’ its investments, and invest in the low-carbon and sustainable technologies of tomorrow.”
The trust’s 2018 accounts show that it has £166.7m invested in Legal &amp; General Investment Management’s CAF UK Equitrack Fund, up from £164.9m in 2017. As of July, the fund invested 8.89% of its portfolio in Royal Dutch Shell shares and 4.47% in BP.
In addition, the fund has holdings in mining firms including 1.93% of the portfolio in Rio Tinto, 1.53% in Glencore and 1.44% in BHP Billiton. With at least 18.2% of the fund’s portfolio invested in oil, gas and mining firms, it means the trust indirectly invests in them to the tune of £30.3m.
In 2010, BP was responsible for the worst environmental disaster in US history when the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico exploded, killing 11 people. A US judge ruled that BP was “grossly negligent” in the lead-up to the spill, in which an estimated 4.9m barrels of oil leaked into the Gulf. Earlier this year it was reported that BP was nearing the end of paying out $65bn (£50.6bn) in compensation.
The trust looks after 780 miles of coastline, and more than 500 historic sites including houses, castles, ancient monuments, gardens, parks and nature reserves, as well as the land.
It has an investment pool of £1.3bn, meaning the Legal &amp; General fund accounts for roughly 13% of the total. In 2015, the charity said it was reviewing its investments in fossil fuels.
A National Trust spokesman said: “It’s important to clarify we do not invest in the ‘fossil fuels and mining’ companies, but in the CAF UK Equitrack Fund, which is a UK equity index tracking fund run for charities.
“We adopt a policy of not investing directly in companies which derive more than 10% of their turnover from the extraction of thermal coal or oil from oil sands. We also engage with companies to improve their environmental performance and see our role as one of actively influencing behaviour and driving environmental improvements.”

The leftovers of fish processed for food and mixed with other organic waste will be used to generate biogas, which will then be liquefied and used in place of fossil fuels by the expedition cruise line Hurtigruten.
Heavy fossil fuels used by ocean-going transport are an increasing problem as they are even more polluting than fuels for land-based vehicles, emitting sulphur and other contaminants. The fuels contribute to air pollution as well as to climate change. Converting vessels to use biogas will cut down on pollutants and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Hurtigruten operates a fleet of 17 ships, and by 2021 aims to have converted at least six of its vessels to use biogas, liquefied natural gas – a fossil fuel, but cleaner than many alternatives – and large battery packs, capable of storing energy produced from renewable sources.
The 125-year-old company, based in Norway, is also banning single-use plastics in an effort to be more environmentally sustainable. It operates cruises in the Arctic and Antarctic, both highly sensitive environments.
Biogas can be generated from most forms of organic waste by speeding up and harnessing the natural decomposition process to capture the methane produced. Organic waste is produced by all food industries but is frequently disposed of in landfill, where it contributes to greenhouse gas emissions as it decomposes.
Shipping has come under increasing scrutiny as many vessels use heavy fuel oil, which is cheap but would be banned on land for its polluting qualities. The daily greenhouse gas emissions from the world’s largest cruise liners can be as great as those of a million cars on the road.
Battery power is also a promising technology for ocean-going transport, but building batteries powerful enough has been a problem to date. Advances in battery manufacture are making it possible to install batteries big enough to last a voyage.
Hurtigruten is currently building three new hybrid-powered cruise ships in Norway, to be delivered in the next three years.
Daniel Skjeldam, the chief executive of Hurtigruten, said: “Norway is a large shipping nation, but fishery and forestry are also large sectors. They create jobs and produce income, but they also produce a lot of waste products. The steady access to high volumes of organic waste gives the Nordic countries a unique position on the biogas market. We are pushing for more innovation, more investment. I believe we have just seen the beginning of what in a few years will be a huge sector.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/19/dead-fish-to-power-cruise-ships-norwegian-biogas

sodium cyanide .....gold extraction and processing
methanol .....building products, paints and resins, pigments and dyes, carpeting, adhesives, agricultural chemicals, biodiesel and agents for the treatment of sewage and waste water
peroxide cleaning products, paper pulp, mining and food and textile manufacturing.

 Polyethylene......bags and films for food storage, retailing and wrapping.....agricultural and irrigation piping, water tanks.......films and wrapping for animal fodder and grain storage.......rigid containers for food storage.......industrial reticulation applications in mining and gas production and the commercial use of watergathering lines in the unconventional gas sector
Ethylene oxide polyols for foam insulation for appliances such as refrigerators and freezers, shoe soles, adhesives, automotive applications, textiles, bedding and furniture.glycol for antifreeze, resins and polyester fibresurface wetters for agricultural applications
Natural gas has no real alternative as a feedstock in making the chemicals that are used in the industries described above. They often require gas to be supplied continuously for efficient production processes.
High temperature uses of gas:
Natural gas can heat rapidly and efficiently and it has low emissions compared to other hydrocarbon fuels and grid electricity. That makes it the fuel of choice for industrial applications requiring high temperatures or high-pressure steam.
One key application is in the high-temperature furnaces required to hygienically dispose of medical waste and associated biohazards. These furnaces require consistent and reliable delivery of high temperatures and this is achieved by using gas.
Without cheap and available natural gas all the above industries would close. And move overseas where gas was available.

The irony is that the latest HELE coal plants being designed in China and Japan have emissions as low as gas plants.
BQEND
You evidence for this is what? 
As far as I know the best coal plants currently achieve a thermal efficiency of just under 45% with an emissions intensity > 700 g CO2 /kWh. CCGT gas comes in at about 450 g/kWh. That's quite a difference.
There's little chance of any coal plant producing lower emissions than CCGT gas without CCS and that's another ball game in terms of cost and viability.
 IEA Clean Coal Centre: High Efficiency Low Emissions: The first way forward for clean coal technology
The other problem with coal plants is the high upfront cost - they are capital intensive compared to CCGT gas. That means a couple of things:
1. It will take a long time to pay off the capital cost and a good deal of resistance will be put up to any moves to early retirement.
2. They tend to need to be run at a higher capacity factor than NG plants to b e profitable.

Indeed. Renewables have very little to offer for high quality industrial heat (except perhaps burning more trees).
Small modular reactors or micro reactors will be able to do the heat - and at a cost comparable to gas at North American prices ie cheap according to Terrestrial Energy (and others).
Australia must remove the prohibition on nuclear power ASAP. All options must be on the table so that they can be properly considered.

Energy companies have proposed four LNG import terminals for the east coast to ensure gas supply and ease high prices. The imported natural gas would effectively replace the two-thirds of gas sold overseas from export plants in Queensland.
One of the most advanced is proposed by AGL Energy, which wants to park a floating plant in Victoria’s Western Port Bay and connect it to the state’s gas network via a high-pressure pipeline.
In an email to conservation group Environment Victoria seen by Guardian Australia, AGL said it could lead to a 20% increase in emissions compared with the same amount of gas extracted and used in Australia due to additional production, processing and transport of the LNG. Some of that increase would be counted as part of Australia’s emissions, and some in the country where the gas originated. 
AGL said the project was critical to cutting emissions from the energy system as it would lead to coal plants, with higher emissions, being replaced by new renewable energy projects firmed by flexible gas plants that could be called on when required.
“A marginal increase in the carbon intensity of the gas used to firm up new renewable energy projects does not materially impact the significant carbon savings achieved by replacing retiring coal plants in this way,” AGL senior manager for project engagement, Kelly Parkinson, said.
There’s no scenario where [importing gas is] in the public interest or a good outcome for the environment.
But Environment Victoria chief executive, Mark Wakeham, said the idea Australia needed to import gas to have a clean energy transition was ridiculous and outdated. He said the rise of renewable energy meant the country was already burning eight terawatt hours’ less gas to generate electricity than five years ago. Several coal-fired power plants having closed in that time.
“There’s no doubt companies like AGL might be able to make some money importing gas, but there’s no scenario where that’s in the public interest or a good outcome for the environment,” Wakeham said.
The dispute calls into question the idea that gas should be considered “cleaner” energy, the descriptor used by the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (Appea), which represents the LNG industry.
In a recent submission to the Climate Change Authority, Appea said emissions from LNG were on average about half those from coal across its full life cycle, which includes extraction, processing, shipping, piping and burning for energy. An accompanying graphic suggested they were 39% lower.
Opponents to gas industry expansion, including Environment Victoria, said further investment in the fossil fuel made little sense on environmental or economic grounds as it was more expensive than genuinely clean alternatives – solar or wind energy backed by batteries or pumped hydroelectricity.
They said Australia could meet current domestic gas needs at electricity plants, for heating and cooking and as a feedstock for some industrial processes from existing developments, if there was a domestic reservation policy that limited the proportion sold to Japan and China.
AGL’s proposal for a floating storage and regasification plant at Crib Point to operate from 2021 is before the Victorian government, which last month said it would have to undergo a full environmental effects inquiry. Some ministers have expressed support for the project.
The company said it would make gas supply more certain, reduce the urgency to open more gas fields and put downward pressure on wholesale prices by increasing competition. 
Analysts at Macquarie Bank disagree on the last point, finding importing LNG would not lower prices in Victoria and NSW due to the additional cost of processing and new infrastructure. But they said it seemed inevitable at least one terminal would be built to meet demand.
The other relatively advanced proposal for an LNG import terminal is by Australian Industrial Energy at Port Kembla. Proposals by ExxonMobil in Gippsland and Venice Energy in Port Adelaide are at an earlier stage.
Australia’s LNG industry has expanded rapidly since 2012 to be the world’s second largest. It is expected its value will reach $48bn and it will be responsible for 7% of national emissions by 2020, effectively wiping out the emissions saved from the renewable energy target. Gas bills on Australia’s east coast have skyrocketed as the export industry sucked up most of the available gas to sell at higher prices on international markets.
Victoria uses 36% of the gas on the east coast, more than any other state. The state government is considering AGL’s proposal to import gas but has blocked further onshore gas exploration and development.
It has a moratorium on conventional onshore gas exploration until 2020 and an outright ban on unconventional gas projects that involve fracking. With the state facing an election on Saturday, premier Daniel Andrews last week pledged to put the fracking ban in the state’s constitution if re-elected.

The charity Transparency International has condemned six countries, including the UK and the US, for opposing moves to open the International Maritime Organization to public scrutiny and hampering moves to combat climate change.
The IMO regulates global shipping and is coordinating a ban on high-sulphur shipping fuel by 2020.
The Guardian reported this month that the IMO has allowed what critics call an “emissions cheat” system to be installed onboard ships to dodge the clean fuel regulations. But the system is likely to lead to pollutants being dumped at sea instead of stored in facilities on land, according to critics.
The IMO set up a working group to tackle accusations earlier this year from Transparency International that it is secretive and disproportionately influenced by the private shipping industry and an unequal influence of certain member states.
Transparency International said it was concerned that moves by the UK, the US, the Cook Islands, Marshall Islands, Panama and the United Arab Emirates could hamper reform at the UN agency and damage moves to tackle climate change and clean up the shipping industry.
Last month these countries criticised moves to make the UN agency more transparent. They said “further expansion of access to information” about the agency “could lead to outside influence”, according to Transparency International.
Rueben Lifuka, the vice-chair of Transparency International, said: “Unfortunately the IMO is far too susceptible to disproportionate influence from private interests and certain member states, meaning that there could be obstacles to meeting the targets for emissions reduction set earlier this year.
“The agency needs to move towards a more open and transparent way of operating, with greater opportunities for public scrutiny and civil society engagement. The stakes are too high for the entire planet for the IMO to continue to operate as a closed shop.”
A spokesperson for the IMO said it would decide the terms of reference for the working group on Monday. The working group would then meet and discuss the issues referred to it, reporting back to the IMO council by Friday.
In April 2018, the IMO’s parine environment protection committee set a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from shipping by at least 50% by 2050 compared with 2008, consistent with the goals of the Paris agreement.
The global shipping fleet is rushing to meet the 2020 IMO deadline to reduce air pollution by forcing vessels to use cleaner fuel with a lower sulphur content of 0.5%, compared with 3.5% as currently used.
The move comes after growing concerns about the health impacts of shipping emissions. A report in Nature this year said 400,000 premature deaths a year are caused by emissions from dirty shipping fuel, which also account for 14m childhood asthma cases per year.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/20/international-maritime-organization-transparency-international

On Saturday I risked further detention by illegally occupying Lambeth Bridge, along with hundreds of others, as part of Extinction Rebellion’s campaign of mass civil disobedience (Report, 19 November). Why?
Scientists warn that the sixth mass extinction is now under way, that the survival of human civilisation itself is threatened, and that we have only a few short years in which to act. The UN also warns that we have just 12 years to avoid catastrophic climate change. The science is clear – we’re heading for an existential crisis.
Until last week I was an ordinary, law-abiding citizen. I’ve tried to drive change through all the normal channels – making lifestyle changes, lobbying politicians, being active in the Green party, and even standing for election. These things are crucial, and I’ll continue to do them, but they’re no longer enough. I now believe that non-violent direct action and mass civil disobedience are both necessary and urgent. I’ve become a law-breaker. I’ll continue to get arrested and I’ll go to prison if I must.
When my beautiful, innocent little niece grows up, enthralled as she is by the natural world, I can’t face her, knowing that I sat back passively and allowed its destruction. Along with thousands of others I’m now willing to sacrifice my freedom in an attempt to draw attention to this emergency, and to force our government to act immediately and radically.Gwen HarrisonKendal, Cumbria
• Climate change experts are doing all they can to keep our somnolent world leaders supplied with industrial quantities of strong black coffee. As you report, on its current trajectory, the planet will overshoot the 1.5C target set by the IPCC (Russia, Canada and China threaten to warm world by 5C, 17 November).
The common denominator of mass extinctions is rapid change. It’s not the rise in average global temperature that is of concern, or the level of atmospheric carbon dioxide. It’s the rate at which these things are changing, in a sliver of time so infinitesimally small, on a geological timescale, it is virtually unquantifiable.
If scientists’ worst fears are realised, and the 5C-6C barrier is breached, humanity will kickstart a runaway mass extinction event that could dwarf even the “mother of mass extinctions” about at the end of the Permian, 250m years ago, when virtually all life on Earth was snuffed out.
Have you smelt that coffee yet? Good. Now that I have your full attention, read on. There’s still time. Just about. So lobby your MP, sign online petitions calling for climate change action, donate to environmental pressure groups, and take part in protests. Above all, think carefully about which political party will get your vote. We can do this thing, people. We can save the world. What are you waiting for? Why are you still reading this? Let’s roll.Sue TytlerThurston, Suffolk

We still need fossil fuels at the moment (sadly). Until methods of storing electricity have moved on, we will always need a source of power we can switch on quickly (unlike nuclear) and that works even when the sun isn't shining and the air and sea is calm. This will be even more important as more people move to electric cars which are likely to be charged overnight.
I'm sure not all the money given is for any kind of altruistic reason, as the article indicates, much of it will be helping to teach the next generation of engineers but some of it may well be being used to help develop the technologies of the future, whether that's cleaning up air from cars or battery technology. I don't know people in these companies personally but if they're not looking towards a post oil and gas future, they're very daft despite the assertions in this article.
Just because a company gives money for research, doesn't mean it influences attitudes. I had a short summer project funded by BNFL once, it was to create a system to alert if radioactive caesium was in waste water. Did that make me pro nuclear power? No. This article claims a funding and voting link but while I don't know the fossil fuel companies, I do know academics. To a person, all academics I know are obstinate in their opinions and not easily swayed by money or other temptations. You have to be a very senior academic to earn a good wage and if they wanted the cash they'd be better directly working for the oil company. Academics take joy in forming their own opinions, especially in science and engineering.
There is a worrying tendency in universities of late with undergraduates trying to shut down discussion, remove things they don't agree with etc. Perhaps my generation is more pragmatic.

The Grantham Research Institute, who often produce (some) informative data on decarbonisation etc, recently published a report highlighting which countries are likely to meet their NDCs (Nationally Determined Contributions), in line with the Paris Agreement. 
They found that only 16 countries met these targets.
BQSTART
The study ‘Aligning national and international climate targets’ was released by the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment and the ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy, both at the London School of Economics and Political Science, and the World Resources Institute.
BQEND
Now, the problem is not the report, but the results of the report. Its just another way of obscuring obvious facts - for example; the countries are: Algeria, Canada, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Indonesia, Japan, FYR Macedonia, Malaysia, Montenegro, Norway, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Samoa, Singapore and Tonga.
So, I can tell you straight away that 40% of petroleum imports to the US come from Canada; and 37% of natural gas imports to the EU come from Norway. So this is a lie; they might be doing other things but the fact that they are major fossil fuel producers does not lend much credibility to the argument. I mean, its like saying Saudia Arabia is one of the 16 countries in the world aligned with the Paris Agreement. Its just not true. 
So I did a quick check, and this what it says:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Main comment:
this sentence makes me despair:
""professors (profs.) who were vocal against divestment often received funding from the oil and gas industry"".
I guess to break it down, the profs. have families and see it as their duty to provide for those families, thus justifying their behaviour to themselves. however, perhaps it highlights that profs. aren't paid enough to meet their needs. And, maybe we need to keep the following in mind:
""Among academics, attitudes are conflicted. James Dyke, a visiting environmental sciences academic at Southampton University, is a staunch advocate of the need for radical action to slow down climate change. Yet he acknowledges the defences of fossil fuel relationships that some colleagues offer. These companies are aware of the significance of climate change, but the global economy would collapse if they stopped producing overnight. Equally, they plug serious gaps in research funding, without which some departments would be forced to close.""
Nevertheless, it does seem, from this article that it is the multinationals who are the most devious in our global community:
""Hope sees the support for universities from fossil fuel companies as part of a deliberate strategy to soften their image. “They are trying to become an integral part of the economics of higher education as a means to encourage a favourable tax environment, and ensure ongoing local and national government support for the industry,” he says. “All despite the UK’s climate commitments.”
However, this paragraph brings more hope:
“Universities should ideally be places to work with those companies to allow them to transform,” Dyke says. “Walking away and taking the moral high ground – ‘we won’t take your money’ - means cutting off what could be a critical player in the required transition.”
Ah, now someone's thinking - good.
Also, I am starting to believe that the car manufacturers are more culpable than the oil producers, if we have to have a scale of culpability. after all, it is the actual burning of the oil that produces the CO2, if we want to be exact.
In conclusion, though, one can see that this problem is a bit like a waterwheel in a river, all the conditions are in place for that said 'problem' to keep going around in circles. I am loathe and scared to say it, for fear of being labelled a 'troublemaker', but shouldn't it be the 'over-arching' government that 'detangles' our economy, in order to ensure that it is working according to our current values and requirements?

They were holding elephants on sticks, or “oilophants”, to represent the elephant in the room at the discussion: Imperial’s links with the fossil fuel industry. “Within two minutes we had security guards coming round saying ‘you can’t hand out flyers here, you can’t have this sign. Move along, you’ve made your point,’” Pratt says.
Pratt is the leader of Divest Imperial, a group set up to pressure the university to eliminate financial investments in fossil fuel companies from its endowment fund, and reduce its reliance on research funding from the fossil fuel industry. Although their protests are not always shut down, the recent event wasn’t her only experience of being asked to stop flyering in a public part of campus. “It’s a stark example of how Imperial is run as a business, and how it’s trying to control its image,” she says.
Imperial ranks in the bottom tier of People &amp; Planet’s annual sustainability ranking for universities. In response to the poor performance, it produced a report aimed at understanding what had gone wrong. Of the staff and students surveyed for their views, 98% felt the university should be doing more on sustainability and climate change.
Pratt sees any concern about the links as window dressing, given that in reality the university “is almost like an extension of the [fossil fuel] industry”. Imperial is proud of its relationships with fossil fuel companies, from which it receives valuable research funding and funded professorships, as well as input into degree programmes that produce the next generation of oil and gas engineers.
In addition to questioning Imperial’s relationships with the industry, Pratt is troubled by their access to students and the campus. Fossil fuel companies make regular appearances at careers fairs, and some courses have mandatory field trips sponsored by the oil and gas sector. “They have an almost ubiquitous presence on campus,” she says. “You hear students repeating industry lines back to you: ‘we’re going to need fossil fuels for x amount of years, it’s important to have an energy mix.’”
Imperial is not alone, though its strength in science means it’s considered to have some of the deepest links with the industry. Cambridge University received an estimated £1.9m – or 0.4% of its total funding – from oil and gas companies in 2016, according to research by the Zero Carbon Cambridge campaign group. Other universities, including Aberdeen, Oxford, Warwick and Sheffield, are known to have similar ties.
Can universities justify these relationships? Imperial says it works with industrial partners to find “solutions to the world’s need for energy”, alongside research aimed at reducing the environmental impact of fossil fuels – through carbon capture and storage, for example, or battery technology and solar cells. It defends its investments as enabling its endowment to better invest in research and education.
But the fossil fuel industry is under increasing pressure following a recent UN report, which criticised its efforts to limit climate breakdown. The report warns that the world needs a 45% cut to carbon pollution by 2030 to limit the temperature rise to 1.5C. Recent protests by climate activists in London have ramped up in its wake.
Chris Saltmarsh, a co-director at People &amp; Planet, says that although fossil fuel divestment has been the most successful student environmental campaign, there is growing concern about universities’ wider links with the fossil fuel industry. “Students are saying these companies need to be challenged – do they deserve any space on our campuses at all?” he says. “We don’t think it’s right for universities to be profiting from or investing in companies driving the climate crisis.”
Part of the reason the movement hasn’t gained the same traction as divestment, in Saltmarsh’s view, is that fossil fuel relationships can be hard to map, and are in some cases “deliberately opaque”. 
“It would take a policy shift on a governmental or supra-governmental level to outlaw fossil fuel companies from research partnerships,” he says. “We would argue that all public research institutions and any other companies investing in research for the public good shouldn’t be associating themselves with fossil fuel. Any relationship is either profiting them directly or bulking up their reputation so that they can continue to extract.”
The picture is similar in the US, where Ben Franta, a PhD student at Stanford University, is working on a study mapping how much research is funded by the oil and gas industry. He believes there has been an “invisible colonisation of academia” by fossil fuel companies. “I think that most people are still largely unaware of the pervasiveness of oil industry funding in academia, especially for climate and energy research,” he says. “The full picture of the ubiquity of this funding is not really known yet.”
Like Pratt, Franta cut his teeth in the divestment movement. It was only when he observed that professors who were vocal against divestment often received funding from the oil and gas industry that he realised how insidious these relationships can be. He sees it as only a matter of time before campaigns start to target research funding and the visibility of oil and gas companies on campus.
“One of the amazing things about this whole story is that all this has happened without anyone really knowing about it,” Franta says. “When most people hear about this situation they’re pretty shocked by it. They think: ‘this doesn’t make sense – it’s like tobacco funding health research, there’s a clear conflict of interest here.’”
Among academics, attitudes are conflicted. James Dyke, a visiting environmental sciences academic at Southampton University, is a staunch advocate of the need for radical action to slow down climate change. Yet he acknowledges the defences of fossil fuel relationships that some colleagues offer. These companies are aware of the significance of climate change, but the global economy would collapse if they stopped producing overnight. Equally, they plug serious gaps in research funding, without which some departments would be forced to close.
“Universities should ideally be places to work with those companies to allow them to transform,” Dyke says. “Walking away and taking the moral high ground – ‘we won’t take your money’ - means cutting off what could be a critical player in the required transition.”
The problem is that fossil fuel companies aren’t working towards the transition to a lower carbon economy in any meaningful way. According to Mat Hope, editor of environmental investigative journalism website DeSmog, much of the money from the oil and gas industry goes towards funding research that will help companies continue to operate in the North Sea region for many more years – by drilling in deeper and more treacherous waters, for example. “This is despite climate scientists explicitly stating that the industry will have to be rapidly shut down,” he says.
Hope sees the support for universities from fossil fuel companies as part of a deliberate strategy to soften their image. “They are trying to become an integral part of the economics of higher education as a means to encourage a favourable tax environment, and ensure ongoing local and national government support for the industry,” he says. “All despite the UK’s climate commitments.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/nov/22/its-like-tobacco-funding-health-research-should-universities-take-money-from-fossil-fuel

Do have any thoughts on what can be offered to the electorate that might induce them to vote for ""Climate friendly"" policies?
BQEND
I regret that there is nothing in my view that will get the electorate to vote for what will in effect be a reduction in the standard of living. This is because our culture is designed around entitlement: learn your lessons, study hard, get a degree in something or other qualifications (and commit to the concomitant debt), get a job, work even harder...and your rewards will be the things you can own.
So it is that our civilisation is based on this premise, where personal status and success are measured by material gain, and failure is measured against a metric of those things we can't afford. The problem isn't really political, which simply reflects the desires (and fears) of the electorate, but a value system and sense of entitlement based on materialism. (It is also this system that leads us inexorably to unequal distribution of wealth, to political corruption, and to the disillusionment of an electorate who are constantly betrayed by those they elect).
And coming back to your question, there is only one stimulus that will catalyse broad public support, and that is undeniable catastrophe. We will wait until the shit and the fan are inextricably entwined, by which time it will be too late to save this current civilisation from its self-destructive urges. 
Bearing in mind that the greatest, and most positive, changes to this civilisation have taken place after cataclysmic events - two world wars - the utter failure of this civilisation may be the only way to clear the ground for something better to be built, albeit on rather less land than we used to have, and with rather less people since climate change will certainly solve the population problem, just in the most ugly and violent way.', u'recommendation_count': u'3', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1543218285000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'our culture is designed around entitlement learn your lessons', u'effect': u'this is'}], u'author_id': u'2947466', u'in_reply_to': u'122982917', u'id': u'122991496', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'rockyrex', u'text': u'Cars etc have a life cycle - as long as all new cars built after around 2030 don't run on fossil fuels (which is very likely) the old ICE engine cars will fade away.

Climate models published since 1973
BQEND
I'm not interested in projections made in 1973, I'm interested in what climate models have done lately. Here's what recent peer-reviewed research has to say on observed vs. climate modeled troposphere temperatures:
Comparing modeled to observed trends over the past 60 years using a persistence‐robust variance estimator shows that all models warm more rapidly than observations and in the majority of individual cases the discrepancy is statistically significant. We argue that this provides informative evidence against the major hypothesis in most current climate models.

BQEND
I don't think it's ever going to get that warm. My reasoning is that the climate models are currently estimating a warming rate (even with the help of hindcasting for much of it) which is too hot, hence their projections of future temperature are likewise too hot.
I can't get into the FAOSTAT database for some reason, so I can't demonstrate that crop yields are increasing in the Sahel, but I have researched them at the other side (west) of Africa and in countries like Mali, Senegal and Burkina Faso and if there's an impact of drought on crop yields over the last 30 years, you can't see it in the trend which is up for pretty much all crops.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1543163190000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'3638543', u'in_reply_to': u'122968624', u'id': u'122968900', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'ID2310987', u'text': u'You are like a stuck record.

Climate models published since 1973 have generally been quite skillful in projecting future warming. While some were too low and some too high, they all show outcomes reasonably close to what has actually occurred, especially when discrepancies between predicted and actual CO2 concentrations and other climate forcings are taken into account.

On Friday evening, residents of Cockermouth watched in disbelief and horror as floodwater once again returned to the streets of the Cumbrian town. 
They hoped they had seen the back of the unwelcomed intruder that devastated hundreds of homes and businesses in 2009. They hoped the construction in 2013 of a £4.4m scheme - including the UK's first self-closing flood barriers - would have prevented such scenes from being repeated in their lifetime.
It did not. Why?
""The defences worked but the amount of rain, and the water in the river, overtopped them,"" explained Environment Agency director of flood and coastal risk, Alison Baptiste.
""Whenever we build defences, we build them to a certain height but that does not mean that will prevent flooding because you can always get water levels higher than that, in which case it will go over the top.""
That is what has happened in Cockermouth, Carlisle and Keswick, she told BBC News.
Ms Baptiste explained the height of a flood defence was determined by a number of factors: ""We aim to provide the best possible protection for a community that can be justified technically and economically and actually fits within the community.

Simply put, their reasons for not wanting to do what is deemed necessary are utterly irrelevant.Science isn't democratic - nature does not care about ideology.

The political will of any democracy is a mirror of the supposed desires of the electorate. It's an obvious connection - give people what they want (or be seen to try) and they might just vote for you again. 
It's ironic how much we read about the gig economy, when the tenure of those we elect to run the country is limited to the short time between elections. Not much job security there, and if we wonder why the political class seem so wedded to short-termism in pretty much every sphere of governance, perhaps their imminent demise at the hands of a fickle, angry and disillusioned electorate might have something to do with it.
Politicians in democratic countries cannot do what's required because if they did, they would simply lose their jobs at the next election. I used to use the fuel riots in the UK as an example of public dissent, but with the recent riots in France over the same issue, it seems clear how the public would react to the kind of drastic measures we now need to avert catastrophe. It's a horrid paradox: for every year that passes, the measures needed become ever more drastic, and therefore ever more unpalatable to an electorate already feeling betrayed and disenfranchised.

I cannot speak for ""kent31"", but I personally agree that- CO2 is a greenhouse gas- the warming since ""pre-industrial"" times is on the order of 1°C (0.8°C is closer to ""since 1910 / since the beginning of the 20th century"" ...)- the IPCC's ""likely range"" for ECS is 1.5°C to 4.5°C (as it was for the Charney report in 1979)
One translation of the logical fallacy originally known as non sequitur is ""that does not follow"".
Look at the ""(probably underestimated) predictions"" being made in the ATL article, and compare them with your ""basic science / fundamental physics"" statements above.

This summer when the temperature (in Paris) was about to go above 35°C for a few days we were inundated with the now standard ""Alert canicule !"" adverts on the TV exhorting people to keep an eye on their elderly neighbours, with news programs after the temperatures had actually gone above 35°C leading with visits to old people's homes showing care workers ""persuading"" retirees to drink water ""even though you're not feeling thirsty, love"".
Assuming that people will fail to react to an additional 132,000 deaths per year, ON AVERAGE, EVERY SINGLE YEAR, and simply continue with ""business as usual"" shows an extremely cynical vision of the human condition on your part.

So if MPs want money - and without the bother of keep having to campaign every four or five years to keep their jobs - there are far better options than parliament. 
If you want to 'get real' then consider the value to MPs of power and influence, both of which can be traded for money at any time - but only while they remain MPs. Once out of power, they are also 'out of the loop'.
And the idea that MPs will regard a one-off payment of £30K as sufficient recompense for losing a job whose salary starts at £77K a year is pretty stupid, particularly as most of those at the top of the greasy pole, and who make the policy and legislative decisions (or fail to, as I suggest in my first post), make in excess of £100K a year. 
Of course, the more power you have, the more influence you can peddle, which is why reading the Members register of interests is so...er...interesting. And it is simply a fact that losing your seat in also means losing a great deal of influence, prestige and opportunity. But more's the point, the principle reason MPs are so beholden to a fickle electorate is so the party of choice can continue to run the country.

Massive internal displacement in the context of drought and food insecurity continues across Somalia. From November 2016 to December 2017, 892 000 drought-related displacements were recorded by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). In the Horn of Africa, the failure of the 2016 rainy season was followed by a harsh January–February 2017 dry season, and a poor March-to-May rainy season. In Somalia, as of June 2017, more than half of the cropland was affected by drought, and herds had reduced by 40–60% since December 2016 due to increased mortality and distress sales, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization and World Food Programme.
Floods affected the agricultural sector, especially in Asian countries. Heavy rains in May 2017 triggered severe flooding and landslides in south-western areas of Sri Lanka. The negative impact of floods on crop production further aggravated the food security conditions in the country already stricken by drought, according to FAO and WFP.

https://www.citizensassembly.ie/en/How-the-State-can-make-Ireland-a-leader-in-tackling-climate-change/
Their recommendations are now being addressed by the Joint Committee on Climate Action, which is hearing evidence from experts and secretary generals. For example, recent experts have included Peter Stott, Valerie Masson-Delmotte, Sonia Seneviratne and Pierre-Marie Aubert (the last 3 were specifically addressing the findings of the IPCC Special Report on 1.5C):

For the UK the warnings are about serious coastal flooding, with a five-fold increase in damage. Heavier rain will cause three times as many people to be affected by river flooding. Apart from the obvious disruption caused by floods, fires and other extreme events the economic consequences are also severe, with a 10 to 15% loss in productivity as it is impossible to work in extreme heat.

To help homes and businesses plan for the future, the results set out a range of possible outcomes over the next century based on different rates of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. The high emission scenario shows:Summer temperatures could be up to 5.4 °C hotter by 2070, while winters could be up to 4.2 °C warmer The chance of a summer as hot as 2018 is around 50 % by 2050 Sea levels in London could rise by up to 1.15 metres by 2100 Average summer rainfall could decrease by up to 47 % by 2070, while there could be up to 35 % more precipitation in winter.

In blocking roads and bridges, protesters have brought a momentary stop to the pump and snarl of city motorists – and annoyed any number of drivers in the process. In doing so, not only does the group signal a willingness to shut down cities to hammer home the scale of the crisis but draws attention to cities’ addiction to petrol. The rationale for this kind of action – and I’ve blocked many a road in my time – is that the situation is so serious that peaceful obstruction is necessary to bring wider attention and demand change, inconvenience be damned.
Are motorists the right target? The preference still given to the car in transport policy is ultimately incompatible with tackling climate change: in a world committed to limiting climate catastrophe, we will need a renewed, cheap and efficient public transport network. But the rationale for road and bridge blocking doesn’t come from a desire to shift this debate. Rather, XR’s tactics are twofold: one, to draw on the repertoire developed by direct action and social justice movements throughout the last century to make political and media impact; two, by a willingness to face legal repercussions for taking action, demonstrate the seriousness of the crisis and build a movement.
The climate movement is not unfamiliar with these tactics. Activists associated with groups such as Plane Stupid or the Camp for Climate Action have taken dramatic actions against the aviation industry or fossil fuel producers – including occupying and temporarily shutting down coal-powered stations, and facing down the legal repercussions that followed. Given just 100 companies are responsible for 71% of global emissions, perhaps a strategy focused on those companies – their buildings, their plants, their delivery networks – would function better to rally the greater public behind the movement: such actions need both to communicate why an action is being taken, across the media, as well as being willing to actually put bodies and reputations on the line.
There are wider political questions that the movement ought to consider, too. Many of the icons of non-violent protest cited by protesters – Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks – were successful not simply because of the moral gravity of their protest but because their protests were rooted in a wider story of grievance, with clear stories of injustice, moral rationale for their acts of refusal, and deeply linked to their own communities.
There is no more profound grievance than the survival of the planetary ecosystem but activists can also overlook the important truth that climate change is, above all, ordinary. It will affect the single mother trying to feed her kids on a tight budget, the nurse who worries all day at work, distracted, about potential house flooding, hotter summers and colder winters will kill the elderly, poor and vulnerable – as well as destabilise nation states and destroy the oceans. To build a resistance across society, the problem must be rooted in the life of ordinary people as much as a willingness to martyr oneself for the cause.
Leaving aside the inevitable detritus of social movements – the eccentric meditators and people with curious hair – XR’s biggest failing is not its urgency, nor taking things too seriously, but conversely not taking the crisis seriously enough. This is clearest in the nascent movement’s unwillingness to formulate targeted political demands and absence of a political strategy. If we accept that we have a very limited time to bring emissions under control, then we must also accept that the vehicles for that enormous transformation will be those that already exist, however imperfectly. That includes national legislatures, international bodies and political parties.
The movement’s laudable but vague three aims – that government and press tell the truth; to bring emissions to zero; that a democratic assembly oversees the process – remind me of the classic problem of politics. That is, knowing where you want to end up, but without any middle steps, failing to understand how to get there.
Participation in the climate movement convinced me that action on the scale needed can be taken only on the state level. In Britain, in the timescale needed, that will require engagement with the only viable political force – the Labour party – capable of tackling climate change, alongside hard-nosed direct action against the hydrocarbon industry. This would mean developing a clear offer to the trade unions, many of whose regressive positions on the environment are rooted in a fear of job loss and impoverishment, as well as pushing the party to flesh out its currently vague and scanty climate commitments, and insisting on fossil divestment in public procurement. The Labour party’s branch and constituency structure offers a vehicle to make climate a part of every campaign, on every doorstep in Britain.
Such a proposal will be uncomfortable for many protesters, who rightly look at Labour’s record on climate with scepticism verging on disgust. But, as Extinction Rebellion might themselves say, the situation is too urgent to do anything else.

“I’ve seen it, I’ve read some of it, and it’s fine,” he said outside the White House on Monday. “I don’t believe it.”
The report, called the National Climate Assessment, was quietly released the day after Thanksgiving. Also last Friday, the government slipped out another environment internal report with bad news about emissions from oil and gas drilling on federal lands.
The Trump administration has tried to downplay the dire findings of the consensus analysis, which concludes climate change could cost the US economy hundreds of billions of dollars and thousands of lives each year in future. A White House spokeswoman said the assessment was “based on the most extreme scenario”, although the report explores the differences in the impacts of climate change based on pollution levels and other factors.
“With continued growth in emissions at historic rates, annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century – more than the current gross domestic product (GDP) of many US states,” the report says.
Regional economies and industries that depend on natural resources and a favorable climate, including agriculture, tourism and fisheries, will suffer, the report finds. As other countries see even worse impacts than the US, Americans will feel the burden through import and export prices and in businesses that have overseas supply chains.
The report puts a dollar figure on the economic damages from unmitigated climate change. If greenhouse gas pollution from power plants and cars continues to rise through the 21st century, the US could then see $155bn a year in damages to labor and $118bn a year in damages to coastal property.
Lives lost to extreme heat and cold could cost another $141bn a year and the consequences from worsened air quality could equal $26bn a year.
Curbing globe-heating pollution would significantly reduce those costs, but the Trump administration has consistently reversed government efforts to slow climate change.
The Trump administration also published another report on climate change on Friday, laying out that oil and gas produced from drilling on public land accounted for almost a quarter of carbon dioxide pollution in the US between 2004 and 2015. The information from the US Geological Survey, in the first such report, was requested in 2016 under Barack Obama’s administration.Trump officials have since moved to make it easier for companies to drill on federal land and rescinded standards for the globe-warming methane released by oil and gas operations.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/26/trump-national-climate-assessment-dont-believe

Turning the soggy landscape that covers much of Ireland’s midlands into a fuel source had been a great national project, an ambitious undertaking launched by the republic’s founding fathers in the 1930s. Draining and cutting hundreds of thousands of hectares of turf on an industrial scale generated desperately needed jobs and reduced dependence on oil imports for almost a century.
So there was some nostalgia last month when Bord na Móna, the peat-harvesting company, announced it was closing 17 of its “active bogs” and would close the remaining 45 within seven years. Nostalgia but also acceptance, given the growing awareness that harvesting peat emits greenhouse gases that worsen climate change, requiring a shift to renewable energy. “Decarbonisation is the biggest challenge facing this planet,” said Tom Donnellan, the company’s chief executive.
The announcement followed promises by the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, to make Ireland a global leader in protecting the planet, backed by a €22bn (£19.5bn) government plan for climate action. A progressive force on social issues, Ireland would also become a beacon for the environment.
The problem, according to environmentalists and academics, is that it is all hot air. Renouncing bog harvesting, they say, is too little, too late – a false solace because the ravaged peatlands will continue to emit greenhouse gases. And the government’s climate leadership pledge, they say, does not cancel out a dismal environmental record that has left Ireland potentially facing up to €600m in fines for missing emissions targets.
John Sweeney, a climate expert and geography professor at Maynooth University, said: “Climate change requires long-term thinking but the political cycle is much shorter and that of economically vested interest groups is shorter still.”
Peatlands, formed by the accumulation of decayed vegetation, help regulate the climate by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing carbon within the peat. As fuel, it is more damaging than coal, generating less energy when burned while producing higher carbon emissions. Depending on how it is calculated, the peat industry contributes between 3m and 6m of the 62m tonnes of greenhouse gases that Ireland emits each year.
Bord na Móna appears to be morphing from climate villain to climate champion. Its annual peat harvest is forecast to tumble: from 3m tonnes in 2015 to an estimated 2m in 2020 and less than 1m by 2025. Its power plant in Edenderry, County Offaly, still burns peat, but relies increasingly on biomass. During the 2017-18 financial year renewable energy, including wind and solar, accounted for more than 60% of the company’s power generation.
Pat Sammon, a spokesman at the company’s headquarters in Newbridge, County Kildare, on the edge of the 370 sq miles of the Bog of Allen, said: “We’re heading to a new era because the main business of the company had been extracting peat and that’s falling away now.”
But environmental experts are unimpressed. “It’s a bit of a smokescreen. It’s all revenue-driven,” said Florence Renou-Wilson, a research scientist and peatland expert at University College Dublin. Bord na Móna was closing bogs that were exhausted and no longer profitable, she said. “They’re all done and dusted.”
The company was seeking new markets for peat in horticulture, she said, and, worse, it seldom “re-wet” used bogs, so the ravaged land continued to emit greenhouse gases. “They’ve just been leaving them abandoned.”
Harvested peatlands – Bord na Móna’s as well as those developed by private operators – produce about 2.6m tonnes of “fugitive” emissions a year. Rehabilitation could make many of the bogs carbon neutral or even carbon sinks. Catherine O’Connell, the head of the Irish Peatland Conservation Council, said Bord na Móna’s decarbonisation talk was spin. “It’s genius what they’ve done. They’ve come out of this looking green. But they’re miners – they remove the living surface of the bog and dig down. Death by a thousand cuts.”
As an environmental policy goal, ending the cutting and burning of peat should have been “low-hanging fruit”, said Tony Lowes, the director of the group Friends of the Irish Environment. “But we have struggled to truly bring it under control because of its emotional attachment and cultural heritage.”
Environmentalists say this fits a pattern of state authorities ducking climate commitments. Ireland emits 13 tonnes of greenhouse gases per person a year, the third-highest level in the EU. The UK emits eight tonnes per person.
Under EU commitments, by 2020 Ireland is supposed to cut emissions by 20% from 1990 levels. The target for 2030 is 40%. Ireland is on track to exceed the first target by 16m tonnes and the latter by 50m tonnes, triggering fines estimated to range from €230m to €600m.
Last month, David Boyd, a UN special rapporteur on human rights, said Dublin’s failure to tackle climate change breached human rights. He made the comments in a legal submission to support a court case brought by Friends of the Irish Environment, accusing the government of “knowingly contributing to dangerous levels of climate change”.
Earlier this year, Varadkar raised expectations of a rise in carbon tax, widely seen as a basic, vital step to curbing emissions. But last month’s budget left it unchanged at €20 a tonne.
Critics said the government flunked climate commitments for fear of a voter backlash, a pattern set when it backed a dramatic surge in dairy and beef farming, pleasing rural voters and business interests but derailing emission goals.
Richard Bruton, the minister for climate action and environment, acknowledged last week that Ireland was “far off course” and announced a plan to make every department responsive to climate change.

On The Daily Show, the host spoke about the report, which states that climate change has already been having an effect on the US and is set to worsen over the next few decades.
He showed a news report which focused on the potential loss of life but also underlined the economic effects.

“I love how America always thinks about everything in economic terms,” he said. “Like even when they’re talking about the end of the world they’re like: ‘Climate change is going to kill everybody and that’s gonna cost us like a billion dollars.’”
When asked about the report, Trump said it was “fine” but he didn’t believe it.
“How can one man possess all the stupidity of mankind?” Noah asked. “It’s like they edited his genes to give him superhuman stupidity.”
CNN brought on Rick Santorum to talk about the report and he claimed that the reason scientists continue to discuss the dangers of climate change is because they’re after money and need to sustain their lifestyles. “We should have known when we saw them balling in those Gucci lab coats,” Noah joked.
He also showed clips from a panel on NBC in which one of the talking heads admitted that she wasn’t a scientist so she didn’t really know what she was talking about. “Once you say ‘I’m not a scientist’ then why is anyone listening to your scientific opinion?” he asked.
Noah criticised the networks for bringing on climate change deniers and warned of the dangers. “Why does the news keep bringing on non-scientists to argue against science?” he said.

There was also news that Nasa successfully landed a spacecraft on Mars as well as talk from Elon Musk that he was hoping to travel to the planet but warned that for any prospective colonists there were many dangers, including death.
“Are you looking to not have fun and then suffocate to death? Come to Mars!” Noah joked.
He continued: “It’s nice that Elon Musk is so upfront about the details. But you gotta admit, it would have been kinda funny if Elon Musk waited until they landed on Mars to be like: ‘Oh I forgot to mention, you are my space slaves now get to work building my base!’”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/nov/27/trevor-noah-trump-climate-change

New taxes on fossil fuels, investment in clean technology and much stronger government policies to bring down emissions are likely to be necessary. Governments must also stop subsidising fossil fuels, directly and indirectly, the UN said.
Gunnar Luderer, one of the authors of the UN report and senior scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, said: “There is still a tremendous gap between words and deeds, between the targets agreed by governments and the measures to achieve these goals.
“Only a rapid turnaround here can help. Emissions must be reduced by a quarter by 2030 [to keep warming to no more than 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial levels] and for 1.5C emissions would have to be halved.”
In all, a tripling of effort may be needed to keep warming to less than 2C, meeting scientific advice on avoiding the most dangerous effects of climate change.
Greenhouse gas emissions continued their long-term rise last year, according to the UN, but they could be brought under control. There are promising signs, such as investment from the private sector in renewable energy and other technologies to cut carbon, but these are currently insufficient to meet scientific advice.
Joyce Msuya, deputy executive director of UN Environment, said: “The science is clear: for all the ambitious climate action we’ve seen, governments need to move faster and with greater urgency. We’re feeding this fire, while the means to extinguish it are within reach.”
Global emissions have reached what the UN has called “historic levels” of 53.5 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, and are showing no signs of peaking, despite a levelling off in the past decade.
The report came a day after Donald Trump said he did not believe his own administration’s latest report warning about the dire risk of inaction on climate change.
Last month, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned of the dire effects of allowing global warming to reach 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The world has a little over a decade to bring down greenhouse gas emissions before such dangerous levels of warming become inevitable.
Only 57 countries, representing 60% of global greenhouse gas emissions, are on track to cause their emissions to peak before 2030. If emissions are allowed to rise beyond that, the IPCC has said countries are likely to breach the 1.5C limit, which will trigger sea-level rises, droughts, floods and other extreme weather events.
On Monday, the biggest review of climate change in the UK for a decade found that flooding was likely to become more severe and summers could become more than 5C hotter within 50 years.
The UN’s warning comes before key talks in Poland next month, when governments will meet to discuss how to implement the commitments made in Paris in 2015. According to the Paris agreement, the first global pact to bind both developed and developing countries to a specific temperature goal, governments must do all they can to stop warming reaching 2C above pre-industrial levels, with an aspiration to limit warming to no more than 1.5C.
Jian Liu, the chief scientist at UN Environment, said some of the necessary policies were clear and available, if there was political will to implement them. “When governments embrace fiscal policy measures to subsidise low-carbon alternatives and tax fossil fuels, they can stimulate the right investments in the energy sector and significantly reduce carbon emissions. If all fossil fuel subsidies were phased out, global carbon emissions could be reduced by up to 10% by 2030.”
Carbon pricing is one way of achieving this, but has run into difficulties as taxes are often unpopular and schemes to reduce carbon through emissions trading are often contested by businesses and other interests.
Greenhouse gas emissions stalled soon after the global financial crisis of a decade ago, then quickly resumed their rise, to the consternation of climate experts. For three years before 2017 they fell once again, but last year there was an increase. Emissions are expected to rise further this year, pointing to an emissions gap between what countries promised in Paris and what their policies are delivering.
Another problem is that infrastructure such as buildings, transport networks and energy generation that is built now to rely on fossil fuels will in effect lock in future emissions for the lifetime in which that infrastructure operates, usually up to 50 years.
Changing the way we construct infrastructure is therefore essential, but many companies and governments still rely on old measures of economic performance and old ways of generating energy and constructing buildings.
Jennifer Morgan, the executive director of Greenpeace International, said: “The window of opportunity is starting to close and if we fail to act now the opportunity will be gone. Failure to act will lock in catastrophic global warming that will change the planet irrevocably and condemn millions to suffering. What are governments waiting for?”
Stephanie Pfeifer, the chief executive of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, said some businesses were taking action. “Investors understand the opportunity presented by the move to a low-carbon economy. The right signals from government will help to unlock low-carbon investment from the private sector.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/27/world-triple-efforts-climate-change-un-global-warming

In recent weeks, the worst wildfires in California history have wiped entire towns off the map and killed scores of people. The recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warning of mass wildfires, superstorms, food shortages and dying coral reefs by 2040 was a cry for immediate action.
But as climate change is happening in real time, the practice of climate science –collecting data, observing and analyzing the Earth’s systems and communicating those findings to decision-makers and the public – has never been at greater risk. That’s why I am in Brussels this week speaking to European Union parliamentarians on the unprecedented threats facing the global understanding of climate change as a result of the Trump administration’s hostility to climate science, and discussing what European countries can and should do in response.
Even though the need for high-quality reliable scientific data on the causes and effects of climate change has never been higher, the politicization of climate science in the United States has reached regrettable new lows. The Trump administration has twice now issued budget proposals that sought to dramatically reduce funding for or outright eliminate the collection and analysis of data about Earth’s atmosphere, oceans and geological, biological and energy systems. All told, across all 13 US federal agencies that play a role in federal climate and energy data and science programs, the Trump administration’s budgets would have yielded cuts of 13.2 to 16.8%, according to an analysis released in June by the Center for American Progress.
The Trump administration’s proposed budget cuts – and their other efforts to interfere with the practice of science – matter because the United States has long been the world’s pre-eminent source for climate and energy data and analysis. The US government’s role in making this data publicly available at no cost further enables users around the globe to advance their own understanding of climate change, which is critical to reducing risk and saving lives. In every aspect of research and analysis of the Earth and its climate, immense, detailed data sets undergird the decisions of leaders in government, the military and business, and the actions of farmers, ranchers, engineers and planners around the world.
So far, Congress has responded to the Trump administration’s provocative budget requests by acting on a bipartisan basis to restore and even increase funding for many vital climate science programs. But the care that appropriators have shown for science, and particularly for climate and energy data and research, can only go so far. Political appointees in the Trump administration retain a great degree of discretion which they can exercise over how these appropriated funds are actually spent.
For example, Nasa’s Carbon Monitoring System, which enabled observation and analysis of global carbon sinks and sources, saw its $10m budget eliminated because a single line item fell through the cracks in the appropriations process and administration officials seized the opportunity to cut the program.
Outside advisory boards of experts who helped translate federal climate science into usable information for state and local policymakers and businesses have seen those longstanding councils disbanded with little notice.
It's little wonder that the US government’s leading career atmospheric and oceanic scientists are leaving in frustration
Of highest consequence to the international scientific community, the Trump administration has dramatically cut or altogether ceased funding to the IPCC, the World Meteorological Organization’s Global Climate Observation System (GCOS), and other United Nations climate research bodies.
These and other budget cuts and policy changes are taking place against a backdrop of troubling stories of scientists being sidelined within their agencies, prohibited from traveling or presenting their findings, or seeing the public-facing resources they helped write erased from government websites. It’s little wonder that the US government’s leading career atmospheric and oceanic scientists, with decades of experience, are leaving in frustration with an administration that ignores their work.
Scientists and policymakers in Europe and the United States alike need to stay alert to signs of political interference in climate and energy data collection that will limit our capacity to understand and respond to the warming planet, whether that interference occurs in the United States or elsewhere.

The designer hopes the charter will “ring some alarm bells” while making a business case for sustainable fashion, setting out a path for collective action to enable low-carbon production methods to be scaled up, improving economic viability. Other signatories to the charter, which will be launched in Katowice on 10 December, have yet to be announced but are known to include several major fast fashion brands. The charter has been initiated by the UN climate change secretariat. Waste, pollution, deforestation, toxicity in manufacture and carbon-fuelled supply chains combine to make fashion one of the most environmentally damaging industries, and reform is essential if the goals agreed in the Paris climate agreement are to be met.There are signs consumers are driving a move towards responsible consumption. A report by the fashion search website Lyst, which tracked more than 100m searches over the past year, shows a 47% rise in searches that combine style and ethics, such as “vegan leather” and “organic cotton”.“We really don’t have long now, to change things. But I honestly believe it’s doable – I couldn’t do what I do if I didn’t believe that,” said McCartney. “There is so much guilt and fear attached to talking about sustainability and that’s not helpful. What is essential is for the big players in the industry to come along with me, because that changes the price point.”
Support for the charter has so far come largely from high street brands. “Fast fashion is responsible for the lion’s share of environmental impact, so they are the most important element in effecting real change,” said McCartney.
But Thursday’s announcement doubles as a recruitment drive for the luxury industry. Between 30 and 40 chief executives of international high fashion brands will be in the audience when McCartney unveils the charter at Voices, an annual fashion industry conference staged by Imran Amed’s Business of Fashion website. “It’s a captive audience of industry leaders,” said Amed. “And that presents an opportunity to convince them to come onboard.” Convincing industry decision-makers to prioritise sustainability is “not about peer pressure, it’s about making them excited”, said McCartney. “Who wants to talk about this season’s colour or the next It bag? The sustainability conversation is really the only one that I am interested in having. Prospects for lab-grown alternatives to leather are the kind of topics I find sexy now.”
Facing a trend from younger consumers to spend money on experiences rather than clothes, the fashion industry has been resistant to regulations that would make fabric production more expensive. An ethically produced velvet that McCartney hopes to use for next season’s party dresses is priced at £100 a metre because a lack of demand means it is produced in tiny quantities. “There is a reason the fashion industry clings to old-fashioned ways of doing things – it is cheaper and it is easier,” said McCartney. “We can only fix this mess if we work together.”
Sustainability is not immune to trends, and the buzzword in environmental fashion is soil. “We know about the rainforest and about the ocean, but we also need to talk about soil and regenerative agriculture,” said McCartney. Mass production of cotton, the most widely produced fabric on earth, is inflicting huge damage on soil biodiversity.McCartney will be preceded on stage at the conference by the keynote speaker, Christopher Wylie. The Cambridge Analytica whistleblower will address the growing power of big technology companies, and how the fashion industry interacts with them.
Wylie, who studied for a PhD in fashion trend forecasting at the London School of Economics, told the Observer he drew an analogy between fashion and politics for Steve Bannon, telling him: “Trump is like a pair of Uggs, or Crocs, basically. So how do you get from people thinking ‘Ugh. Totally ugly’, to the moment when everyone is wearing them?”
On Friday, David Pemsel, the chief executive of Guardian Media Group, and John Ridding, the chief executive of the Financial Times, will address digital disruption and new media audiences.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/nov/29/stella-mccartney-to-launch-un-charter-sustainable-fashion

Nearly two-thirds of Republicans, 64%, now think climate change is happening, compared to 49% three years ago. And more of the general population, 78% compared to 70% three years ago, acknowledge climate change.
But many people still don’t agree with the consensus science that shows humans are the dominant cause of climate change. Only 29% of people say climate change is more from human activity than natural changes in the environment or some mix of the two.
Monmouth pollster Patrick Murray said he thinks climate-fueled disasters, including the wildfires in California, “have convinced folks that something is going on”. But Republicans tend to be less likely to acknowledge that humans are causing the problem.
He said the conclusion for American political candidates is that “the worse the effects of climate change become the more likely people are to believe in it, which is not a very good thing if you’re trying to stop it”.
The results come as Donald Trump and his key environment officials have been discounting a multi-agency report laying out the wide-scale and immediate risks climate change poses to the country.
Trump said he doesn’t believe the findings and the top appointees at the environmental protection agency and interior department have questioned the assessment too, saying it focuses on the worst-case scenario. The report investigates what will happen if greenhouse gases from power plants and cars continue to rise through the century in a business-as-usual scenario, but it also warns of serious consequences even if the world manages to rein in pollution sooner.
The administration has also been actively rescinding environment and climate regulations and trying to expand fossil fuel use that causes rising temperatures.
Trump’s position and his efforts are not in line with public opinion, according to the poll. A large majority of Americans support action by the US government to slow climate change. The poll did not, however, ask people about their support of specific strategies that could include increased costs for consumers.

With the US absent, Europe distracted and Brazil tilting away from global cooperation, the onus has shifted towards Beijing, the diplomats said after two weeks of slow-moving talks on how to maintain the natural infrastructure on which humanity depends.
China will host the next high-level negotiations, in 2020, which will be the most important in more than 10 years. This is the deadline for nations to agree on fresh global targets for the protection and management of forests, rivers, oceans, pollinators and other wildlife.
Conservationists hope this “new deal for nature and people” becomes as much of a priority as the Paris climate accord and helps to reverse the current wave of extinction, which is at the highest rate the world has seen since the age of the dinosaurs.
Over the coming two years, China should champion the cause of nature as France championed the cause of climate in the run-up to the Paris deal in 2016, urged the diplomats.
“China is very important. It can be a great leader,” said Hesiquio Benítez Díaz, Mexico’s director general of international cooperation, who helped organise the previous global biodiversity conference. “We’re reaching the point of no return for many species. It’s really bad, but people don’t see this issue.”
Rather than leaving biodiversity on the fringes, where it has until now been dealt with mostly by politically weak environment ministers and NGOs, he hoped Beijing would use its clout to ensure the subject was high on the agenda of G8 and G20 summits and to press for participation by heads of state in 2020. They also want the issue to be taken up by communities, companies and individuals.
This message was echoed by the executive secretary of the biodiversity convention. “We tell China that the biodiversity agenda needs a lot of championing,” said Cristiana Paşca Palmer. “They were instrumental in the success of Paris and they can play a very important role.”
Until recently, China’s dire pollution problems and woeful record on wildlife conservation meant it would have been an unlikely champion of nature. However, under President Xi Jinping perceptions have started to shift. The government has promoted the concept of “ecological civilisation”, established hundreds of environmental courts and played a positive role in global climate talks.
At the conference, Beijing sent mixed messages. It initially ignored a proposal to get involved in preparations with Mexico (the previous host) and Egypt (the host this year), and it remained low-key in Sharm el-Sheikh over the past two weeks of talks. “We were very nervous about their silence,” confided one foreign diplomat.
But those familiar with the Chinese delegation said this reflected a difference of approach. Rather than set ambitious public goals, they said the country preferred to set expectations low and work at a higher level behind the scenes. “They are really determined to succeed, but they don’t know how to do it,” said another source.
A shift in pace and priorities is essential. Delegate after delegate in Sharm el-Sheikh warned of risks to food production and human wellbeing from the loss of corals, forests and the 60% loss of biodiversity since 1972.
There was recognition that the current global management plan has been a failure: among the 20 Aichi biodiversity targets, only one – on the creation of protected areas – is measurably close to being met. Highlighting the low priority that even the host government put on nature, a shop near the conference centre was openly selling an illegal lion hide for $1,500 (£1,170).
This convention established a process to draw-up a “Post 2020 Road Map” with more forceful and effective goals. But the political winds are even less favourable than in 2010. Brazil, which played an important role eight years ago, will soon have a far-right government and its diplomats spent much of the time on niggling issues that could have an impact on exploitation of its world-leading biodiversity. At one point the conference spent 35 minutes debating whether to be “concerned” or “deeply concerned” about the impact of climate change.
A row broke out between developing and developed nations over how to share the economic benefits from genetic sequencing information. Tense negotiations were also needed to set new guidelines for gene drive technology, which can be used to eradicate entire species. Governments stopped short of imposing a moratorium, but built in strong precautions by insisting that no research be allowed without risk assessment , risk management and the consent of any communities who might be affected by the release of modified organisms.
Crucially, the delegates struggled to identify what kind of target should be set. There was widespread agreement that biodiversity needed a single measurable headline goal – equivalent to the 1.5-2C (2.7-3.6F) in climate negotiations. But there is, as yet, no single metric that can cover the complex interaction of life on Earth. Instead, discussions centred on setting either zero net loss of natural habitat or a broad goal to “bend the curve”, which means reverse biodiversity loss worldwide through a series of bottom-up national commitments and wider demarcations of nature reserves, protected areas and traditional or indigenous community land.
Pooven Moodley, the executive director of the NGO Natural Justice, said the conference had seen progress in terms of greater recognition of the need for improved environmental rights and more land tenure for indigenous groups. But he said overall the negotiations had failed to take into account the urgency of the crisis. “It does feel like rearranging the deckchairs as the Titanic sinks,” he said.
Frustrations were also expressed by Ruth Davis, the deputy director of global programmes at the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. “I am used to the UN – its ups and downs – but it’s still disorienting listening to hours of wrangling over single words in obscure documents in empty rooms when this is supposed – quite literally – to be about a plan to save life on Earth,” she tweeted.
Despite occasional grumbles, delegates said the situation would be worse without the convention, which at least obliges governments to assess biodiversity and report every four years (with the exception of the US, which is the only nation that does not take part). Protected areas – the one concrete target from 2010 – have expanded substantially in the past eight years. Conservation efforts have also helped to pull a few species including whales and mountain gorillas back from the brink of extinction.
Pasça Palmer, the UN head of biodiversity, said she too wanted more urgency, but she remained optimistic that a deal could be done in 2020. “The best possible outcome would be to have a clear recognition that biodiversity is infrastructure affecting life and development. We have to govern in a holistic way, not just one species. And we need to make it clear in people’s minds that without it, we won’t have a healthy planet.”
China will have its work cut out.

On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah joked that the Russia investigation “is like a sale at a used Honda dealership. It never ends.”
He spoke about Manafort “double-flipping” after agreeing to comply with Robert Mueller and then reportedly reporting back to Trump with the details of what had been happening.
“It’s like when your friend takes a test in the second period then at recess he tells you what to expect when you go in for the test, although I bet even with the answers, Trump could still mess it up,” Noah joked.
After a White House report that warned of extreme effects of climate change, Trump has remained opposed to the findings. “Like the climate, his arguments are getting worse,” he joked.
In a rambling answer Trump claimed that as someone with such high intelligence, he found the report hard to believe especially as water and air were at a record clean. “Clearly the president doesn’t believe in the science and the English,” Noah said.
Ivanka Trump has also been under fire for using a personal account to send White House emails. In an interview with ABC she defended the usage, saying that she wasn’t sending important work emails.
“I actually believe her when she says she wasn’t using her private account for important work emails because in order to have important work emails, you have to do important work,” he said.
He continued: “Her inbox is probably just Goop newsletters and thousands of unopened emails from Eric.”
On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert also spoke about Manafort. “He’s afraid to rat on the Russians because he has a lifelong dream of continuing to live,” he said. “He’s got this bucket list of not ending up in a series of buckets.”
He also referenced the exclusive findings from the Guardian on Manafort’s meeting with Julian Assange. “If this is true then this means the world’s palest man met the world’s shadiest man,” he said.

We will explore the key findings each day this week.
Donald Trump doesn’t believe his own government’s major report on climate change – which the administration tried to bury over the Thanksgiving break. It warns that rising temperatures are already harming America and will cause huge damage globally.
US coastal communities are already bearing the brunt of rising seas and more extreme weather made worse by climate change, as was evident with the vicious 2017 hurricane season.
Sea-level rise could reshape the country’s population distribution, resulting in 13.1 million people who might need to migrate by 2100 if the oceans are 6ft higher (which is actually 2ft lower than the most extreme scenario estimated). That will be expensive. Already, the federal government spent $48m to resettle a tribe in Louisiana.
The US is losing more than 80,000 acres of coastal wetlands per year, mostly in the Gulf of Mexico. By 2100, the US is likely to lose an additional 16% of wetlands.
The wetlands are valuable ecosystems that protect humans from storms, reduce erosion from waves, enhance water quality and support fisheries and recreation. They also are sinks for the carbon dioxide from power plants, cars and industry that causes climate change. As they are degraded, they will not be able to soak up as much CO2.
The National Climate Assessment raises tough questions about whether people will retreat, accommodate or protect against harsher storms and disappearing land. Helping people adapt to climate change along the coast is a difficult political proposition, as some property owners can afford to modify their homes or move while others cannot.
Coastal cities – including Boston, New York, Miami, San Francisco, New Orleans and Los Angeles – are already spending to adapt to sea-level rise and more frequent flooding. But the resources they are allocating are not enough to meet future threats, the report notes.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/29/climate-report-trump-tried-to-bury-rising-seas-coastal-residents

I respectively disagree. We are all bearing the increases in global surface temperature. Right now. The C02 parts per million count is going up year over year at an extreme rate of increase - currently about 2-3 parts per year.

As my first piece of street art it was hardly earth-shattering but was a tiny part of something that contributed, by May 1970, to a major student strike in which thousands of high-school students in Sydney and Melbourne took to the streets to protest the war in the lead-up to the moratoriums of that year.
It was a distant war insofar as it was in an obscure part of south-east Asia, but one with immediate consequences for those high-school students. If nothing else, some students — or their brothers — faced conscription and potential death on the Mekong Delta or the jungles of Nui Dat; let alone complicity in a colonial war that was leading to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocent people.
A response of Liberal-Country party governments at the time was to suspend students who participated in anti-Vietnam war activities. Indeed, the then Victorian premier, Henry Bolte, threatened to expel students and prevent them from completing their high-school certificates. I was lucky in New South Wales, only being suspended for two days for daring to display a Vietnam moratorium sticker on my school bag — others were suspended for longer or indeed expelled.
And so the response to recent high-school activism over climate change by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has an uncanny echo five decades on.
There’s a different set of initials now: LNP. But the message is the same. High-school students should shut up, knuckle down, and stay away from the real world of political discussion – in this case the issue of climate change and campaigns to shift government action/inaction on the issue.
We shouldn’t be listening to young people who nevertheless will have to bear the consequences of climate change – that “listening” is bitterly opposed by our prime minister.
He told parliament they should stay in the classroom rather than thinking about things that “can be dealt with outside of school”.
Really?
“Each day I send my kids to school and I know other members’ kids should also go to school but we do not support our schools being turned into parliaments,” Morrison said in parliament.
“What we want is more learning in schools and less activism in schools.
“We are committed to all of these things [climate change action] but I will tell you what we are also committed to — kids should go to school.”
Learning? Activism? Going to school?
You don’t get it, prime minister. Your government urges young people to take up Stem subjects — yet rejects them out of hand when they take those learnings into life in confronting climate change.
Perhaps it is the politicians that should go back to school and do a bit of learning.
And all power to those high-school students who will be putting their hands up on climate change. History is on your side.

And it will.

No, it might (though I personally doubt this).
The Duvat paper provides evidence that just because SLR occurs doesn't automatically mean that low-lying islands / coral reefs etc. ""will"" disappear by the year 2100.
Remember that during the last glacial-to-interglacial transition SLR of at least 1 metre (100 cm) per century occurred, and corals worldwide did not go extinct as a result.

BQSTART
This review first confirms that over the past decades to century, atoll islands exhibited no widespread sign of physical destabilization by sea-level rise. The global sample considered in this paper, which includes 30 atolls and 709 islands, reveals that atolls did not lose land area, and that 73.1% of islands were stable in land area, including most settled islands, while 15.5% of islands increased and 11.4% decreased in size. Atoll and island areal stability can therefore be considered as a global trend. Importantly, islands located in ocean regions affected by rapid sea-level rise showed neither contraction nor marked shoreline retreat, which indicates that they may not be affected yet by the presumably negative, that is, erosive, impact of sea-level rise.

As I like to remind myself of - the problem with AGW is not that we know the trajectories of things. That we know sensitivity is around 3 degrees give and take. 
The problem is that we continue with our multi generation experiment with a deep understanding of what knowledge we lack. 
If we humans could simulate reality (or just climate) perfectly, we could determine the number of fossil carbon molecules we can burn and be A-OK perfectly. But sadly we do not have perfect knowledge. And the bracketed answers science do give seems to be too scary to watch. 
The scariest thing at present is that the entire world throw dizes with the physics of reality - to protect the ""science"" of economics and profit. 
It is like falling out of an aircraft and look at the sensors. The sensors all read 1G. Then we reach terminal velocity and celebrate because our speed has stabilized. So there is absolutely nothing to worry about. Because according to myth, someone is going to give us all a parachute just before we have the thoughts of the improbably falling whale, penned by Douglas Adams: 
""I’m quite dizzy with anticipation …
Or is it the wind?
There really is a lot of that now isn’t it?

I wonder if it will be friends with me?
And the rest, after a sudden wet thud, was silence"". 
It is worrying that we humans now have decided that ""terminal velocity"" proves that all is fine - to the point that a skydiver would not keep the spread-eagle position - but instead take a diving arrow position to speed it up a bit. Because if we can speed it up it will ""uh.... It may reverse at some time"".

Ocean temperature likely controls Antarctic Ice Sheet mass, according to the glaciologist Richard Alley.
It's -50 degrees C on parts of Antarctica, warm it up to -45 and who cares? But it is at the melting point at the coast where the floating and thinning ice shelves provide less and less friction constraining ice sheet flow.
An increase of just 1 degree C destroyed the ice shelf constraining the flow of the Jakobshavn Isbræ Glacier on Greenland and such an increase is a big insult to an ice shelf almost anywhere on the planet.
The Antarctic Peninsula has lost 8-10 ice shelves over the last 25-30 years. When the Larsen B ice shelf broke up there over a 5 week period in 2002 the glaciers behind sped up by a factor of 6 to 8 and are still flowing at that accelerated rate today because the cork was removed.
If we sped up all of Antarctica’s glaciers by a factor of 6.5 we’d have 4m per century sea level rise, roughly what occurred for four centuries 14,600 years ago.

“The well used to be the centre of our village,” Mya Htay says, grasping the side of a cement water well. But it no longer holds fresh water.
For the people of Khindan, the well is symbolic of their losing battle with the sea.
Ten years ago, the town noticed erosion of the beachfront. Five years later, the well was swallowed by the sea.
“Because of the storm surges, my old house was destroyed. The sand deposits just fell away,” says Mya Htay. Two kilometres of the village coast have been affected by accelerated erosion.
Two weeks ago, the UN jolted the world with the message that we have 12 years to limit climate catastrophe. Its report urged action to cut carbon emissions to avoid the atmosphere warming by a disastrous 3C. In countries such as Myanmar, even a modest rise could be the tipping point for a new conflict over water and a new wave of climate refugees.
Worldwide, Myanmar is the second most vulnerable country to extreme weather events. The effects are widespread: in the dry zone, home to nearly a third of Myanmar’s total population, temperatures are projected to rise by up to 3C after 2040. In the Irrawaddy delta, in the south – where people are still rebuilding after the country’s worst natural disaster, Cyclone Nargis, which displaced 2.4 million people – the mid-level projection for sea-level rise is up to 40cm by 2050.
A sea level rise of roughly 13cm by 2020 may sound less alarming than the rate in the Republic of Kiribati, a group of Pacific islands that at risk of being totally erased this century. But climate consultant Sonia Leonard, who is working in Mon state with environmental organisation Alarm, points out that in low-lying floodplains where more than 140,000 people live, this increase will result in permanently flooded areas and a loss of productive agriculture land.
People in Khindan have had to migrate from their homes several times. They have moved back as far as they can go on vacant land. “Now they’re literally just waiting for their houses to fall into the sea,” says Leonard, who is mapping vulnerable communities likely to be displaced by climate change.
This year more than 150,000 people across Myanmar were displaced by flooding. What was once consistent rainfall has been replaced by a more intense monsoon, causing flash-flooding.
“We feel like hermit crabs, we do not have a place to live,” says Khin Ohn Myint, her voice wavering as she looks at the bones of her house in the sea.
What’s most striking is that this year has been par for the course in terms of abnormal monsoon periods and natural disasters. 
“If this is just a normal year, with a large storm surge that has been slowly intensifying each year, what happens when a big cyclone hits again?” asks Leonard.
In Khindan, the population visible on the streets consists mostly of elderly people and young children. Village elder Aung Shein’s situation is typical: “My children have had to go across the border [into Thailand] to look for work, so we are looking after their children,” he says.
As people lose their land, experience a drop in crop productivity and struggle with declining water availability, many in Myanmar’s rural or coastal areas are migrating to the cities. Outmigration is also high, with more than 4 million Myanmar migrants working in Thailand alone.
The new government has started to provide financial aid of 20,000 kyat (£9.65) for each household affected by natural disasters, but even officials concede this isn’t much for people who lose their houses or land. 
Shashank Mishra of the Myanmar Climate Change Alliance believes access to water could spark conflict in the future. He points to the dry zone, where people have already been forced to leave their homes due to lack of water or an increase in temperature. “The total monsoon period has already decreased from 144 days per year in 1998 to 125 days,” Mishra explains.
The number of extremely hot days is projected to increase from one day a month to between four and 17 by 2041, adds Mishra, which will also cause serious health problems.
Ten years after Cyclone Nargis, some villages have received new cement tanks to hold fresh water, but there remains a pressing need for better adaptation planning.
Leaning over a map of the Irrawaddy delta, field officer Win Naing explains: “We have built two storm shelters here in these central villages, and we are trying to build more mangroves to shelter village coastlines.”
But if another intense cyclone hits – and since the 80s, cyclones in the Bay of Bengal have increased in number, often developing into hurricane-force storms – taking shelter in a multipurpose shelter may not be enough.
One expert who has worked in Bangladesh advocates a “land bank”, for the government to earmark vacant land that can be allocated to future climate-displaced people. Setting aside parcels of land, which vulnerable communities can move, to is a concrete solution in a rights-based approach that aims to prevent land conflict.
Scott Leckie of Displacement Solutions in Australia warns: “In most places in the developing world they [climate migrants] will end up landless, migrating from rural areas and ending up in slums in the cities with severe increased poverty, if there is no assistance.”
U Hla Maung Thein, from the environment and conservation ministry, says the government is trying to work towards the goals set in the Paris agreement. “We have initiated plans such as a fish adaptation project, and for a community forest in Hinthada in the Ayeyarwady division and Chauk in the Magway region.”
Climate activists welcome the government’s pledges, but say implementation must be quicker.

Stiglitz is an interesting figure because he has been able to bring his own expertise to ordinary people via journalism. His is a critical mind and he is not restricted by partisan bickering. He understands the basics of political economy in the tradition informed by Adam Smith and Karl Marx. His basic argument is that a society where the money is sequestered in the pockets and hidey holes of oligarchs like the Trumps, is one doomed to stagnation as the money is taken out of circulation.

If you make the system all and only about ""the poor"" - as Stiglitz and his fellow-travellers would - you will inevitably destroy the processes that create the wealth that sustains the poor.
If you believe in a ""sharing"" society - of work, of income, of wealth - then all that happens is a massive, if not total transfer, of power to those who ordain, who control, the sharing.
There is not a single instance of a socialist country raising up its poor. All the evidence is that such countries lose their energy, their innovators, and decline into life limiting, depressing, monotone social and economic failure.
On the other hand, there is undeniable evidence that the opposite is true, that countries that do not fetter free enterprise do very well for their people.

money will always rule
BQEND Well, the corrupting influence of money on politics is arguably worst in USA, then other English-speaking developed nations (UK, Australia, Canada) as equal-second. But in each of these countries, judges are rarely found to be accepting bribes. With judges, they get paid a good salary and a great pension. The rules are that, were they to accept money for a judgement, they'd put at risk all of: their reputation, their salary, their pension and decades of incarceration. But judges only 'interpret' the laws. Why don't we apply the same 'ethics' to those who 'make' the laws - that they would lose that same 'everything', if they took money or a benefit from anyone. Australia already pays political parties 2/3rds of the costs of running an election campaign (based on c$3 per primary vote at prior election), so why not increase this to 100%, then outlaw all other sources of funds. Amazingly, the carpet-baggers would leave the 'profession' and you would get back to publicly-spirited people doing it for the public good. Analysis in the US has already proven that 90% of Congressional votes are in favour of the top few percent, and almost none are for the benefit of the bottom 50%. Similarly, it is clear in Australia that 80-90% of the populace wants positive action on climate change, but the ruling government (albeit minority government) wants to do nothing, because their biggest financial backers all have links to the fossil fuel industries.

Yes, this is a common view, and it seems, at first glance, to make perfect sense. It does this only if the current assumptions of mainstream economics are accepted as true. 
The very same assumptions which produced the slaughterhouse of the 1900's and the GFC, and if you believe even mainstream economists, the coming crash.
If we replace those assumptions with better ones, perhaps it's not such a zero-sum game after all.
Take wages. Neoliberalism has it that wages are drawn from Capital. Maybe in year one. For a successful business, it's clear that wages are generated by intelligently trained and deployed working-citizens and available in the increased value of work-products. After work is done. Along with a healthy surplus due to division of labour and other productivity multipliers which ultimately underpin the value of the currency. Yet widespread unemployment is a problem.
How about Land. Neoliberalism says Land is Capital(wealth reserved to make more wealth). Land is not Capital, nor is it Money. Capital provides productivity tools to production. Residential uses of land are necessary for production, and non-residential uses of land are necessary for living. Yet monopoly owners of commercial land get all the increases in property values and attendant rents as civilisation progresses.
Clearly Land(aka nature), Wealth(what you want/need), and Money are three entirely different categories of ""thing"". Neoliberalism conflates them, not to create a more efficient system, or a better world, but to pull the wool over our eyes for the benefit of intergeneration rent-takers, to the catastrophic detriment of the working-citizen and the living world s/he depends on.
As Henry George says in Progress and Poverty, ch17 - ""The Problem Explained"":
BQSTART
Three things unite in production: land, labor, and capital. Three parties divide the output: landowner, laborer, and capitalist. If the laborer and capitalist get no more as production increases, it is a necessary inference that the landowner takes the gain. 
The facts agree with this inference. Neither wages nor interest keep step with material progress. Yet rising rents and land values invariably accompany advancement. Indeed, they are the mark of progress! Increasing rent explains why wages and interest do not increase. The same cause that gives more to the land owner also denies it to the laborer and capitalist.
BQEND
By muddling up the very language of production, Neoliberalism has made it difficult to think about economics without arriving at the conclusion that there are just too many people. And that's scary. It's also wrong. By misdirecting our attention from the deeper underlying cause of our problems, a more constructive treatment is forestalled. We can still fix this.
The answer is to understand precisely how economics was derailed from economic democracy to extractive, growth-addicted madness, how your ""civilisation-dividend"" was stolen from you well before your birth, and the simple remedies required to restore it. In the process inverting the wealth pyramid to value nature as the source of all usable wealth and the working-citizen as its creator:

As the source of all wealth, the new economics places the living world at the top of the pyramid and a premium on use of natural opportunities. 
As the harvesters and shapers of wealth, working-citizens will be relieved of all tax burdens and those who can sustainably employ the most productive power from the least land will entirely pay for civilisation through an annual levy on the value of natural opportunities. Those who want work shall have it, and those who want to do other things shall do that too.
The entire incentive structure will be reversed, with vast areas of land returned to public ownership as do-nothing rentiers go belly-up, leaving previously locked-up land and massive revenues to fund the transformation of civilisation into what we know must be possible: Humans devising new ways of thinking, living, doing in harmony with the living world which inspires us to do anything in the first place...

""The fact that I have a right to X does not, in itself, guarantee that I have a right to defend X""
BQEND
No, of course it does. If I have a right to X, I do have a right to defend it. That are utterly tied up together. If I cannot defend my life, I don't really have a right to it, as anyone could potentially take it away from me without any opposition at all. Or its like saying I have a right to free speech but as soon as someone tells me to shut up, I must.

""There is, for example, no inconsistency at all in saying that everyone has the right to free medical care whilst denying that anyone has the right to threaten a doctor with a gun if they refuse to provide that healthcare.""
BQEND
I am afraid this is totally wrong. It is totally inconsistent. If you are saying that everyone has a right to free medical care, then you are precisely saying that someone does indeed have the right to threaten a doctor with a gun for refusing to provide it. To get to the real heart of the matter, lets boil it down to a situation where it is just you, your significant other and one doctor on a desert island - wider society does not exist. If your wife gets sick and free healthcare is a right, you would be well within your rights to threaten the life of the doctor with violence if he or she wanted to refuse treatment. The doctor is essentially your slave, when free healthcare is a right.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1541495898000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'13835441', u'in_reply_to': u'122187790', u'id': u'122221218', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Pushers11', u'text': u'BQSTART

Stiglitz's analysis of the very strong evidence of economic inequality is rather superficial. He should have focused on the structure of capitalism and its inherent dynamic that leads inequality. 
Capital, in its structural conflict with Labor, necessarily derives its gains at the expense of Labor.
It's on account of Capital's need to gain profits that it constantly seeks to skew political and social decisions in its favor--by way of facilitating laws and regulations. The U.S. Congress comprises of individuals who are paid of by Big Capital to skew the political and social landscape in its favour. 
Individuals who run for Congress and other political positions in the U.S. are bankrolled by Big Capital to ensure that profits are maximized. Cheap labor flows from impoverished areas, together with easy Capital outsourcing to cheap labor areas are what cause the massive accumulation of Capitalist wealth and the wage stagnation on Labor's side that has led to the widening gap between Capital and Labor both in the U.S. and worldwide.

I wonder if ""adjusted for inflation"" really tells the tale about the quality of life for those with little income.

“We were a very different country 40 years ago,” he says. “The downhill slide has been pretty fast. America, I think, should be an important warning to other countries not to take for granted their institutions. I worry that things in the United States could get much worse.”
Joseph Stiglitz is coming to Australia next week. The renowned economist and Columbia University professor has been awarded the 2018 Sydney peace prize for leading one of the defining public policy discussions of our age – the crisis caused by economic inequality.
Stiglitz is credited with pioneering the concept of the “1 per cent”, the idea that the upper 1% of Americans have accumulated so much political power and wealth in recent decades – through voter suppression, gerrymandering, and the corrupting influence of money – that the country’s economy has suffered, and its democracy has been undermined.
In 2011, barely two years into Barack Obama’s first presidential term, he warned the political upheavals then roiling countries including Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, Yemen and Bahrain could one day be visited upon the US, but in an American way. Later that year, the Occupy Wall Street protest emerged in Manhattan’s financial district.
Most Americans want a higher minimum wage, they want gun control, they want access to healthcare … yet our democracy can’t deliver it
His 2012 bestselling book The Price of Inequality explained in detail how America had been growing apart, at an increasingly rapid rate. He argued forcefully that the severe inequality in the US was a choice of the country’s leaders: a consequence of their policies, laws and regulations.
This month he plotted in Scientific American how inequality had worsened so much over the last 40 years that US democracy was imperilled.
“Whereas the income share of the top 0.1% has more than quadrupled and that of the top 1% has almost doubled, that of the bottom 90% has declined,” he wrote.
“Wages at the bottom, adjusted for inflation, are about the same as they were some 60 years ago. Wealth is even less equally distributed, with just three Americans having as much as the bottom 50%.”
“As more of our citizens come to understand why the fruits of economic progress have been so unequally shared, there is a real danger that they will become open to a demagogue blaming the country’s problems on others and making false promises of rectifying ‘a rigged system’.
“We are already experiencing a foretaste of what might happen. It could get much worse.”
Stiglitz tells Guardian Australia, in the lead-up to his trip to Australia, that this country has a lot to learn from America.
“One of the reasons I wrote [The Price of Inequality] is almost as a warning to other countries,” he says.
“Some of the forces attacking what I would call the social order … those who are shortsighted and in the 1%, know that what they want is contrary to what would evolve in a functioning democracy.
“Most Americans want a higher minimum wage, they want gun control, they want access to healthcare, they want stronger financial regulation – the polling on some of these issues is, you know, 75% or more – and yet our democracy can’t deliver it.
“Those on the other side have to undermine democracy if they’re going to thwart the will of such a large majority, so they undermine it by disenfranchisement and disempowerment.”
Stiglitz says the vision of policymakers in the aftermath of the second world war was to draw together a community that had fought together, to help society become more equal. In the 1960s that was reinforced with demands for racial and social and gender justice, to break down further the forces that had long-divided society.
“It was a continuation if you looked at it in a grand historical [perspective] where we’d gotten rid of feudalism and hereditary privilege and we were moving step by step to a greater system of social justice,” he says. “That was our vision, with the civil rights movement.”
The magnitude of the dysfunction [on climate change] is unbelievable
But the election of Donald Trump as president, and a Republican push to further undermine economic equality, mean the old social contract is being further undermined.
“Now we have Trump – a misogynist, a racist, a bigot – as president and openly espousing these things, and we have the majority of the Republican party voting for a tax bill that increases inequality and leads more people to have no insurance coverage. It’s further undermining the social contract and [the old] vision.”
Stiglitz says he plans to talk about all of these things in Australia, including the problem of climate change – which he says presents the strongest critique of the capitalist system.
“It reminds one of Jared Diamond’s story of collapse on Easter Island where they cut down the last tree and there they were, unable to paddle to any other island and they’d destroyed their future,” he says.
“We’re doing the same. The magnitude of the dysfunction is unbelievable. And what’s remarkable about it is, some of the work I’ve done has shown the cost to our society of dealing with this is minuscule, at most 2% of GDP, whereas the cost of not dealing with it could be horrendous.”
He says any view of a well-managed society would be “why not deal with the threat of climate change?”
“Particularly because the way you’d do it would actually stimulate the economy.”
Prof Joseph Stiglitz will be in Australia to receive the Sydney peace prize. He will be awarded the prize at the City of Sydney peace prize lecture on 15 November, and speak at the National Press Club in Canberra on 14 November and at the Athenaeum Theatre in Melbourne on 19 November",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/05/joseph-stiglitz-america-should-be-a-warning-to-other-countries

David Attenborough is a personal hero of mine but I can't help agreeing with what you have written. I cannot help but feel that the response BTL to any article you could write about the environment and the destruction of the natural world would be met with the same sort of negativity as is seen here, even if this is the Guardian.
I've thought for a long time that both that the natural world is for the most part done for, with the human race not far behind. It's such a shame.
Every so often you see a new scientific study showing the incredible decline in species around the world due to the impact of man, and even when these studies receive the attention they should in the media, it seems to barely cause a ripple with people as a whole. You'd think the news that humanity has wiped out 60% of animal species worldwide since 1970 would light a fire under enough people for some sort of change to made, but in fact it's pretty much forgotten within a week.
Let's be honest, we're not there as a species yet. People are to selfish and self involved to care about each other, never mind some wildlife on the other side of the world. We will willingly oversee our destruction of the natural world while ignorantly shrugging our shoulders asking ""well, what could we have done about it"", conveniently forgetting the many, many warnings we have had.

It is more serious still when the BBC does it, and yet worse when the presenter is “the most trusted man in Britain”. But, as his latest interview with the Observer reveals, David Attenborough sticks to his line that fully representing environmental issues is a “turn-off”.
His new series, Dynasties, will mention the pressures affecting wildlife, but Attenborough makes it clear that it will play them down. To do otherwise, he suggests, would be “proselytising” and “alarmist”. His series will be “a great relief from the political landscape which otherwise dominates our thoughts”. In light of the astonishing rate of collapse of the animal populations he features, alongside most of the rest of the world’s living systems – and when broadcasting as a whole has disgracefully failed to represent such truths – I don’t think such escapism is appropriate or justifiable.
It is not proselytising or alarmist to tell us the raw truth about what is happening to the world, however much it might discomfit us. Nor do I believe that revealing the marvels of nature automatically translates into environmental action, as the executive producer of Dynasties claims. I’ve come to believe it can have the opposite effect.
For many years, wildlife film-making has presented a pristine living world. It has created an impression of security and abundance, even in places afflicted by cascading ecological collapse. The cameras reassure us that there are vast tracts of wilderness in which wildlife continues to thrive. They cultivate complacency, not action.
You cannot do such a thing passively. Wildlife film-makers I know tell me that the effort to portray what looks like an untouched ecosystem becomes harder every year. They have to choose their camera angles ever more carefully to exclude the evidence of destruction, travel further to find the Edens they depict. They know – and many feel deeply uncomfortable about it – that they are telling a false story, creating a fairytale world that persuades us all is well, in the midst of an existential crisis. While many people, thanks in large part to David Attenborough, are now quite well informed about wildlife, we remain astonishingly ignorant about what is happening to it.
What makes Attenborough’s comments particularly odd is that they come just a year after the final episode of his Blue Planet II series triggered a massive effort to reduce plastic pollution. Though the programme made a complete dog’s breakfast of the issue, the response demonstrated a vast public appetite for information about the environmental crisis, and an urgent desire to act on it.
Since 1985, when I worked in the department that has made most of his programmes, I have pressed the BBC to reveal environmental realities, often with dismal results. In 1995 I spent several months with a producer, developing a novel and imaginative proposal for an environmental series. The producer returned from his meeting with the channel controller in a state of shock. “He just looked at the title and asked ‘Is this environment?’ I said yes. He said, ‘I’ve spent two years trying to get environment off this fucking channel. Why the fuck are you bringing me environment?’”
I later discovered that this response was typical. The controllers weren’t indifferent. They were actively hostile. If you ask me whether the BBC or ExxonMobil has done more to frustrate environmental action in this country, I would say the BBC.
We all knew that only one person had the power to break this dam. For decades David Attenborough, a former channel controller widely seen as the living embodiment of the BBC, has been able to make any programme he wants. So where, we kept asking, was he? At last, in 2000, he presented an environmental series: State of the Planet.
It was an interesting and watchable series, but it left us with nowhere to go and nothing to do. Only in the last few seconds of the final episode was there a hint that structural forces might be at play: “Real success can only come if there’s a change in our societies, in our economics and in our politics.” But what change? What economics? What politics? He had given us no clues.
To make matters worse, it was sandwiched between further programmes of his about the wonders of nature, which created a strong impression of robust planetary health. He might have been describing two different worlds. Six years later he made another environmental series, The Truth About Climate Change. And this, in my view, was a total disaster.
It told us nothing about the driving forces behind climate breakdown. The only mention of fossil fuel companies was as part of the solution: “The people who extract fossil fuels like oil and gas have now come up with a way to put carbon dioxide back underground.” Apart from the general “we”, the only distinct force identified as responsible was the “1.3 billion Chinese”. That a large proportion of Chinese emissions are caused by manufacturing goods the west buys was not mentioned. The series immediately triggered a new form of climate denial: I was bombarded with people telling me there was no point in taking action in Britain because the Chinese were killing the planet.
If Attenborough’s environmentalism has a coherent theme, it is shifting the blame from powerful forces on to either society in general or the poor and weak. Sometimes it becomes pretty dark. In 2013 he told the Telegraph “What are all these famines in Ethiopia? What are they about? They’re about too many people for too little land … We say, get the United Nations to send them bags of flour. That’s barmy.”
There had not been a famine in Ethiopia for 28 years, and the last one was caused not by an absolute food shortage but by civil war and government policies. His suggestion that food relief is counter-productive suggests he has read nothing on the subject since Thomas Malthus’s essay in 1798. But, cruel and ignorant as these comments were, they were more or less cost-free. By contrast, you do not remain a national treasure by upsetting powerful vested interests: look at the flak the outspoken wildlife and environmental presenter Chris Packham attracts for standing up to the hunting lobby.
I have always been entranced by Attenborough’s wildlife programmes, but astonished by his consistent failure to mount a coherent, truthful and effective defence of the living world he loves. His revelation of the wonders of nature has been a great public service. But withholding the knowledge we need to defend it is, I believe, a grave disservice.

ClientEarth, which has repeatedly defeated the government in court over its air pollution strategy, has submitted an objection to the planning inspectorate over Drax Group’s proposed 3.6GW plant in North Yorkshire.
The intervention is the first by the lawyers against a gas project in the UK. Sam Hunter Jones, a lawyer at the group, said it had acted because the Drax scheme marked a tipping point in the amount of new gas planned by energy firms in the UK.
The UK has already given planning approval for 15GW-worth of large-scale gas plants, including at Eggborough, which is not far from the Drax site. Adding the Drax project would take the total to about 18GW, three times the 6GW of new gas the government estimates the country will need up to 2035.
Hunter Jones said: “The UK government claims to be a climate leader, yet if major energy projects such as this from Drax are granted planning consent, the UK will risk carbon lock-in that would seriously undermine its ability to meet its climate change commitments.”
The planning inspectorate is expected to make its recommendations to the government next spring, with ministers to decide later in the year.
ClientEarth believes it has grounds for success under national policy statements that planners have to consider, which say such a major project’s impact must not outweigh its benefits. The group’s written submission said approval risked making the UK’s future decarbonisation significantly more difficult and expensive.
Drax said future energy scenarios in the UK indicated the country would need more gas plants in the future to fill in the gaps around wind and solar power. The company also said that building the gas project would enable it to turn off its two remaining coal units in 2023, two years before the government’s coal phase-out deadline of 2025.
Andy Koss, Drax Power’s CEO, said: “Our Repower project will deliver cost-effective, high-efficiency, flexible gas power to the grid. By reusing some of our existing infrastructure, including the grid connection and cooling towers, the development will be cost-effective and very competitive.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/11/drax-uk-gas-power-station-environmental-objection-climate

Like many teachers I have used Attenborough’s wonderful productions to enthuse my pupils with a love of science and a deep appreciation of our living planet. No living person has educated more children and adults than he. And with education comes the knowledge and understanding necessary to debate the survival of life on Earth calmly and rationally.
One of Attenborough’s great strengths is his refusal to be evangelical or politically correct (there are enough of those about). He talks the language of Darwin and evolution but doesn’t preach atheism or secularism. He has shown us virtually every ecosystem on the planet but, having armed us with the knowledge, leaves it up to us, and especially the environmentalists, what to do with it. Stan LabovitchWindsor
• I agree with much of what George Monbiot has to say, but I found his criticism of David Attenborough harsh and unjustified (Attenborough has betrayed the living world he loves, 7 November). Attenborough’s much-acclaimed wildlife programmes can have left most viewers in little doubt about his deep concerns over the damage being done to the environment, and made a significant contribution to public awareness of the problems.
Some years ago, I happened to be at the north pole base camp for expeditions and other activities at the same time as the Frozen Planet team. I was struck by the care and time they were taking to find the right conditions for Attenborough to stand at the pole in order to do a piece to camera expressing his worries about global warming. This was not somebody trying to brush the issue under the carpet. Paddy ClarkChiddingfold, Surrey

Among the G20 nations 15 reported a rise in emissions last year, according to the most comprehensive stock-take to date of progress towards the goals of the Paris climate agreement.
The paper, by the global partnership Climate Transparency, found 82% of energy in these countries still being provided by coal, oil and gas, a factor which has relied on an increase of about 50% in subsidies over the past 10 years to compete with increasingly cheap wind, solar and other renewable energy sources.
The G20 nations spent $147bn (£114bn) on subsidies in 2016, although they pledged to phase them out more than 10 years ago.
Governments have said they will change, but on current commitments the world is on course for a 3.2C rise in average global temperatures, more than double the lower Paris threshold of 1.5C, which scientists have said represents the last chance to save coral reefs, the Arctic ecosystem and the wellbeing of hundreds of millions of people at risk of increased drought, flooding and forest fires.
“The gap is still very big,” said Jan Burck, one of the authors of the report. “The G20 is not moving fast enough.”
Comparing the goals and policies of different countries, the paper found that only India was on course to stay below the upper limit set by the Paris agreement of 2C, while the worst offenders – Russia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey – would take the world beyond 4C.
China, the world’s biggest emitter, stabilised its releases of carbon for a couple of years by reducing dependency on coal, but this positive trend slipped last year. Indonesia, Brazil and Argentina have promised to cut deforestation but the destruction rate of forests shows no sign of reversing.
Britain has made the fastest transition, with a 7.7% decline in the use of fossil fuels between 2012 and 2015, but the report warned that this could stall in the years ahead because the government had cut support for feed-in tariffs, energy efficiency and zero-carbon homes.
The authors said political pressures in the G20 countries, with more subsidies for fossil fuels, were working against effective climate action.
“There is a huge fight by the fossil fuel industry against cheap renewables. The old economy is well organised and they have put huge lobbying pressure on governments to spend tax money to subsidise the old world,” Burck said.
These political pressures are likely to intensify as governments are called upon to extend emissions cuts to the transport and agriculture sectors. The report said G20 emissions needed to start declining in the next two years and halve by 2030 if the world were to avoid more than 1.5C of warming, though not one country in the group had set a credible target to do this.
The UN climate talks in Katowice, Poland, in December –the COP24 conference – will start a two-year process for governments to deliver on their commitments to reduce emissions. Although there are national leaders hostile to tackling climate change, such as in the US and Brazil, there is still hope they will be open to taking their share of the responsibility.
Christiana Figueres, former executive secretary of the UN framework convention on climate change, said: “Global emissions need to peak in 2020. The Brown-to-Green report provides us with an independent stock-take on where we stand now. This is valuable information for countries when they declare their contribution in 2020.”
• This article was amended on 14 November 2018. An earlier version included figures from the report that were corrected after publication, when it said that fossil fuel subsidies in G20 countries have doubled between 2007 and 2016, from $75bn (£58bn) to $147bn (£114bn). The two figures were not comparable, because the 2007 figure did not include data for all G20 countries included in the 2016 figure. The increase over the past 10 years is about 50%, not double. In addition, an earlier version misspelled Jan Burck’s last name as Buerck.

Now he would like to see the industry he says is responsible pay for the damage.
On Wednesday, associations representing California crab fishermen like Beardon filed suit against 30 fossil fuel companies seeking to make the companies pay for the harm global warming has caused to California’s fisheries. The suit demands that petroleum interests finance the changes that will be needed to sustain the crab fishing industry in the future.
“We just about can’t make a living fishing crabs any more,” said Beardon, who has seen the earnings he can make with his 35ft crab boat, Stormy II, cut in half in recent years because of the effects of ocean warming. “I’d like to see the industry that caused this take responsibility for that.”
The lawsuit, filed in California state superior court by the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen’s Associations, is the first legal action by a private industry group seeking to hold the fossil fuel companies responsible for major losses attributed to global warming. It seeks unspecified damages from defendants including Chevron, ExxonMobil and BP. The suit also names 27 other petroleum companies.
“We’re taking a stand for the captains and crew, their families and the business owners that support the fleet,” said Noah Oppenheim, the association’s executive director. “The fossil fuel companies named in our lawsuit knowingly caused harm, and they need to be held accountable.”
The suit follows a slew of legal actions filed in the last 18 months by government agencies, including the cities of New York City and San Francisco and the state of Rhode Island, claiming that the petroleum industry has long known about the devastating effects their products cause to the climate but has done little to stop them.
In June, a federal court judge threw out two suits from the cities of San Francisco and Oakland. Judge William Alsup of the US district court for the northern district of California wrote in his ruling that while he accepted the science behind global warming, “the problem deserves a solution on a more vast scale than can be supplied by a district judge or jury in a public nuisance case”. He also cited the benefits that have come from petroleum products.
Early this month, the US supreme court refused to stop a lawsuit brought by a group of children and young adults, which seeks to force the US government to do something about climate change. Another federal court recently paused the case after the Trump administration requested a temporary stay.
The fishermen’s suit raises the question of who should have to bear the costs of financing the major adaptions that industry – and society – will have to make to survive global warming.
“Defendants have known for nearly 50 years that greenhouse gas pollution from their fossil fuel products has a significant impact on Earth’s climate, including a warming of the oceans,” reads the suit. Yet “defendants concealed the dangers, sought to undermine public support for greenhouse gas regulation, and engaged in massive campaigns to promote the ever-increasing use of their products at ever greater volumes”.
Chevron, which has a major refinery in the San Francisco Bay Area, did not immediately return calls from the Guardian. But R Hewitt Pate, Chevron’s vice-president and general counsel, called for cooperation, not blame, after the dismissal of the San Francisco and Oakland cases in June.
“Tackling the difficult international policy issues of climate change requires honest and constructive discussion,” he said. “Using lawsuits to vilify the men and women who provide the energy we all need is neither honest nor constructive.”
Starting in 2015, crab fishermen have had to contend with dramatically shortened fishing seasons because the warming of ocean waters has caused huge algal blooms along the Pacific coast. The blooms were blamed for causing a buildup of a neurotoxin, domoic acid, in the crab population, making the crabs potentially poisonous to eat.
The start of the 2015 crab season, usually in November, had to be pushed back until the following March. The season was shortened in 2016 and 2017 as well. This year, the crab season will be allowed to open as usual, on Thursday, but one section of the northern California coastline will be closed for fishing.
The unpredictable and dramatically shortened seasons have taken a huge toll on the fleet of small fishing boats that usually supply a bounty of fresh Dungeness crab for the state’s restaurants and holiday tables.
“For some of these fishermen, losing a season means having to sell the boat. And many of them did,” said Oppenheim of the disastrous 2015-16 season. “We’re talking about families having to go to the bread line.”
In releasing the suit, the fishing association called for the petroleum companies to fund studies that will help crab fishermen survive ocean warming and suggested that money could be used to study new ways of making crab fishing viable, such as keeping crabs in holding tanks so that they could expel toxic acids.
Beardon, who fishes for Dungeness out of Crescent City, California, said he has had to go to work as a logging truck driver during the summer months in order to sustain his family crabbing business.
“The last three years have been really hard,” said Beardon, “Our community came together and held a fish fry to help our crew members.

A retired oil industry engineer and manager, Bray is now a volunteer with the Citizens Climate Lobby. The grassroots group wants Congress to pass legislation to limit the greenhouse gas pollution that’s heating up the planet. And when Bray introduces himself to a staffer or lawmaker in Washington DC, his career is the first thing he brings up.
In the 1990s, while still in the industry, he sent a letter to then president George HW Bush calling for higher energy prices, which would slow consumption, he told them.
“People thought I was totally off the reservation,” Bray joked during a team lunch with other former oil workers during a trip to the US capital this week.
Now ExxonMobil is one of a number of major oil companies backing a tax on carbon pollution, he notes.
Citizens Climate Lobby aims to meet with every legislator twice a year and check back with them in between.
Many of its members are progressive and are now hoping to see more buy-in from newly elected Democrats as the party took the majority in the House in the midterm elections earlier this month. But Bray displays a Conservative Caucus ribbon on his nametag at meetings.
At training sessions for hundreds this week, volunteers from around the country learned how to talk to policymakers and people in their communities even if they don’t have similar political beliefs or backgrounds.
In one hotel conference hall, newcomers were taught to discuss specific impacts, including changing landscapes, extreme weather and lost crops.
Larry Peranich, a volunteer from San Diego and another member of the Conservative Caucus, told the room how his house was damaged in a wildfire in 2003.
“The problem is lately bigger and bigger. I have a knot in my stomach, I know what people are going through,” Peranich said, referring to the killer fires that are decimating California communities.
After those stories, Citizens Climate Lobby members are supposed to pivot to optimism and proposed solutions.
“We don’t want to dangle people off that cliff without giving them hope,” said Brett Cease, volunteer education and engagement coordinator.
In another meeting room, volunteers discussed “what works with Republicans”. Peter Thomas, from San Diego, practiced his pitch for taxing carbon and returning it to people “on an equitable basis”, language that might resonate with Democrats or Republicans.
Session leaders explained how to use storytelling to connect on a personal level. They played a humorous video of author Kurt Vonnegut describing narrative arcs that appeal to people.
The next day, volunteers put their training into practice at offices on Capitol Hill.
Bray, who was matched with Republican offices, had mixed results. One staffer had a firm grasp of the climate change problem but said the office couldn’t support any pricing mechanism because it would interfere with free markets. A second lawmaker who was retiring and denies the science that shows climate change is manmade agreed to the meeting and engaged in a long discussion but declined to give the volunteers advice about how to move forward.
But, “fundamental to Citizens Climate Lobby is we want to talk with everyone”, Bray said.
His “Team Oil” sometimes shares information with lawmakers about how the fossil fuel industry thinks about climate change. They have a number of liaisons to specific companies. On meetings via phone they also collaborate on white papers that delve into the technical and engineering questions involved in limiting greenhouse gas pollution.
Citizens Climate Lobby has outlined a specific proposal that members pitch. The group wants the government to institute a carbon fee and dividend program, to tax pollution and return the money collected from industry to consumers to offset costs. Other advocates – from liberal, conservative and non-partisan organizations – are offering similar plans, but most Republicans oppose climate legislation and Democratic leaders also don’t have a strategy in place for a comprehensive solution.
Regardless of their views, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are more likely to meet with their own constituents on climate change than with Washington-based advocates.
Will Koren, who founded the New Orleans chapter of Citizens Climate Lobby, had meetings with staffers for five of the six members of the Louisiana delegation.
Climate change is particularly thorny in Louisiana, which is sinking and also facing sea-level rise, tougher hurricanes and worse flooding because of rising temperatures, but is also reliant on the oil industry.
“It’s tough for anybody to come forward,” Koren said. Some of the lawmakers reject manmade climate change but others agree it’s a concern and “get stuck in the politics”, he said.
Koren, who works as a sales consultant in the restaurant industry in New Orleans, started the chapter there after his sister’s home flooded in a freak rain event in Baton Rouge in 2016.
“There is no stopping what’s happening. If I didn’t have this outlet, I don’t know if I’d be functional,” Koren said. “I know I’ll be gutting more houses. I know all my friends might have to move. But what else do you do?”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/15/citizens-climate-lobby-grassroots-group-oil-worker-legislation

Speaking at a Guardian Live event, at Central Hall in London, he said he was deeply disturbed at how issues such as climate change, cyber wars and the future of the oceans were not ballot box issues, admitting it was hard to translate these issues into an acceptable set of choices for voters.
In the discussion with the Observer’s chief political commentator, Andrew Rawnsley, Kerry said: “We are heading for catastrophe unless we respond to some life-threatening challenges very rapidly. We have a climate-denying president that pulls us out of the the Paris climate change agreement at a time when literally every day matters.
“Europe is already crushed under this transformation that is taking place due to migration. In Germany Angela Merkel is weakened. Italian politics is significantly impacted.
“Well, imagine what happens if water dries up and you cannot produce food in northern Africa. Imagine what happens if Nigeria hits its alleged 500 million people by the middle of the century … you are going to have hordes of people in the northern part of the Mediterranean knocking on the door. I am telling you. If you don’t believe me, just go read the literature.”
The former secretary of state for the Obama administration reminded his audience that climate change scientists had just warned that historically unprecedented steps were needed to prevent an extra 0.5C (0.9F) increase.
He pointed to the fires in California and the repeated intensive storms – Harvey, Irma and Maria – that cost the US $265bn last year.
Kerry said Harvey dropped as much water on the Houston, Texas, area in five days as goes over Niagara Falls in an entire year. Irma, he said, had the first recorded, sustained winds of over 185 mph for 24 hours.
He said the Green Climate Fund set up in Paris was supposed to have $100bn, but it only had $6bn, making it very difficult for poorer countries to make the right energy decisions. China and India, he said, were still on course to build a wave of coal-fired stations. “We should not be building a single coal fired plant anywhere on the planet,” he added.
Kerry insisted the doors to the G20 summit in Argentina later this year should be locked until the fund was replenished. At the same time, he said, the private sector had to come up with the transformative breakthroughs but all voters have to make “damn sure” that politicians will take the issue seriously.
He also made an impassioned defence for the EU, saying the institution had been set up initially to prevent war, but Europe was now seeing old demons return in the form of antisemitism and racism.
Kerry, insisting he did not want to interfere in the UK elections, reminded his audience that before the 2016 referendum he and president Obama had called for the UK to stay in the EU. “To the best of my knowledge [Obama] has not changed view,” he said.
He added: “I do not think this is the moment for the EU to start falling apart.”
Kerry also defended the Iran nuclear deal that he signed in 2015, but that has been torn up by Donald Trump. He said the “deal is the tightest, most stringent, most accountable, transparent nuclear arms agreement on the planet”.
Under the deal, if the Iranians had tried to make a bomb “we would know immediately because we have radio transmission seals on centrifuges and stockpiles. We have a right to trace, from cradle to grave, every piece of uranium”.
He described the US midterm election results as encouraging and said the Democrats should be preparing for the 2020 election. He refused to identify his chosen presidential candidate, saying he was not convinced he had identified that person yet. But he said the essential element of any ideal successful candidate “will above all be authenticity”.

Speaking at the Australia Bar Association’s annual conference in Sydney on Friday night, Turnbull, the guest of honour at the event, said a climate-sceptic group within his own party held the line that “if you don’t do what we want, we will blow the show up,” the Australian reported.
“And that is essentially what you’ve seen — and so the problem is that everybody loses”.
Turnbull, who was replaced as prime minister by Scott Morrison in August and subsequently retired from politics, was asked at the event about his personal commitment to act on climate change. He famously crossed the floor in opposition to vote with Labor in support of an emissions trading scheme, but as prime minister led a government with little resolve to reduce emissions.
“The truth is … the Liberal Party and the Coalition is not capable of dealing with climate change,” Turnbull told the conference.
“It is just a fact I regret to say. It is like a third rail. We have at the present time in the Coalition, a group of, a constituency, that is the best way to describe it, who believe we should get out of [the Paris Agreement], that climate change is a fraud, the more you have the better, and are literally on another plane.
“They are not prepared to play ball with everybody else.”
Turnbull has previously conceded that any policy on climate change would be extremely difficult for the Liberal-National Coalition because it was treated as an ideological matter within the party.
“The emissions issue and climate policy issues have the same problem within the Coalition of ... bitterly entrenched views that are actually sort of more ideological views than views based,” he had said while being forced out as prime minister.
During an appearance on the ABC’s Q&amp;A program this month, he described his removal from the prime ministership as an act of unexplained madness, and accused leading conservatives of “blowing up” the government.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/nov/17/turnbull-says-climate-change-has-become-a-third-rail-for-liberal-party

There are exceptions. Keith Kahn-Harris’s book Denial: The Unspeakable Truth ought be compulsory reading for every university student of English, history and moral philosophy. He seems an academic who has definitely not bitten his lip, but sought to penetrate a fog of lies perpetuated by denialists: those who shout down and treat with contempt the historians and scientists who have sought the truth and presented us with their findings.
Climate change denialists dredge up countless explanations for floods and fires. Donald Trump blames “poor forest management” for the conflagrations in California that have killed many people.
Monbiot and Kahn-Harris ought to be on the reading lists of all of us who seek to understand truths about the planet that we share with fellow human beings, animals and plants.Penelope MaclachlanLondon

From 8am on Wednesday groups of protesters coordinated by the group Extinction Rebellion walked on to roads in Westminster, Tower Bridge, Elephant and Castle, and Earl’s Court, blocking traffic for several minutes at a time in a plan to bring gridlock to the city.
The Metropolitan police said that protests could continue until Saturday and advised against driving into the city. The Met also warned people that attempting to drive through the demonstrations was “very dangerous and illegal”.
On the 22-24 Nov, there will be protests across London that may result in delays to your journey. We advise not to travel by car or motorbike. If you do drive into London please note attempting to drive through protestors in the road is very dangerous and illegal
A spokesperson for Transport for London said Wednesday’s protests had caused serious disruption to traffic and buses. The action was met by an ambivalent response from some members of the public on their way to work, but others said they backed the demonstrations.
The protests are part of a campaign of mass civil disobedience organised by Extinction Rebellion, which wants to force governments to treat the threats of climate change and species extinction as a crisis.
As traffic began to back up around London, the group sent a letter to the business secretary, Greg Clark, outlining their demands. “We are writing to let you know that we intend to continue our support for rebellion against the UK government,” their letter said.
“We would like to meet with you at your earliest convenience to work out ways in which you can exercise your responsibility as secretary of state to protect the ecosystems and people of this country.”
Ronan McNern, a protest organiser and a signatory to the letter, said the plan was to cause as much disruption as possible with the smallest numbers.
“The lights go red, they go into and sit down in the road, wait seven minutes,” he said. “If anybody needs to get past, we’ll let them through. Come off after seven minutes, take a break, let the angry drivers at the front go, then the light goes red and you go on again.
“This is about causing economic disruption by slowing things down, bringing things to a gridlock. This is an experiment, really. I think that’s the most important word.”
The Guardian met one group of about 35 protesters by the statue of Nelson Mandela at Parliament Square at 7am, then followed the group as they walked to the south end of Lambeth Bridge, the site of one of central London’s busiest junctions.
Just before 8am they walked out into the road, chanting and carrying banners and placards. Traffic was soon backed up far down Albert Embankment, Lambeth Palace Road and Lambeth Road, as motorists found the way over the Thames blocked.
Cars sounded their horns and one driver got out to remonstrate with police monitoring the protesters. Officers told him to be patient. Another passerby, who asked police why they could not clear the roadblock, was told the activists had a right to protest. “You’re part of the problem and all,” he shouted back at them.
Demonstrators then moved on to Vauxhall Bridge and then Victoria Street, where they continued their rolling blockades. They allowed cyclists and emergency vehicles with blue lights to go past.
At one point the comedian Jim Davidson became caught up in the demonstration and got out of his car to remonstrate with police for not forcing the protesters to move.

James Page, 46, a decorator who stopped to watch a blockade close to Victoria, said he “couldn’t give a damn” about climate change. “It [the climate] all balances out,” he said. “It’s shown from time it balances itself out. It’s not something I would be bothered about anyway.”
At Elephant and Castle, a major junction linking south London to the City financial district, protesters’ numbers were bolstered after lunch by the arrival of several dozen students from the nearby London College of Communication.

One student, Renee, 18, who declined to give her surname, said the protest was “incredibly impactful”.
“It’s supporting issues that are very prevalent nowadays that people should know about. I don’t know if it’s the right way to do protest, but at the end of the day it has an effect.”
Her friend, Ekene, 18, worried that the methods might alienate people, “so then obviously when they see the cause, they are going to associate it with anger. So I’m not sure if it’s the best way.” Nonetheless, both said they would join the next Extinction Rebellion protest, planned for Saturday.

Dr Larch Maxey, who was helping to coordinate the Elephant and Castle protest, said: “These students have just heard about it and jumped in, and this is what our movement is doing.
“I’ve been on marches for decades about this. We’ve had massive marches and they’ve just been ignored. But you cannot ignore people shutting down the city.”
As in Westminster, police facilitated the protest and tried to assuage the anger of motorists.
Howard Rees, an organiser, said the actions had been a success. “Quite a lot of extra people have joined over the course of the day, because they’ve seen what’s going on on social media. We’ve got more people on board, and hopefully they will come along tomorrow.”
A spokesperson for Transport for London initially said there had been significant disruption during rush hour, but later retreated from that assessment.
“The demonstrators were blocking traffic, causing delays to roads and buses in the areas of protest,” the spokesperson said. “The delays are now clearing.”
McNern added: “Three weeks ago no one knew the name Extinction Rebellion, then there was the declaration [of rebellion], there was the week of action, there was 6,000 people [on the bridges through central London on Saturday].”
On Saturday, 82 protesters were arrested after occupying Southwark, Blackfriars, Waterloo, Westminster and Lambeth bridges, in one of the biggest acts of peaceful civil disobedience seen in the UK in decades.
In the previous two weeks, police arrested more than 60 activists for taking part in acts of civil disobedience, ranging from gluing themselves to government buildings to blocking roads. Many activists were arrested more than once.
McNern said all the activists were willing to be arrested. “So it’s very different from when you are dealing with people who are scared of being arrested.”
He said the group had told the police of their plans and they were willing to abandon any blockade that hampered the movement of emergency vehicles.
Organisers say they hope the campaign of “respectful disruption” will change the debate around climate change and signal to those in power that the present course of action will lead to disaster.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/21/swarming-sit-down-protests-aim-to-disrupt-london-traffic

The delayed formation of sea ice during autumn has worried biologists, who fear a first “extirpation event” – the local extinction of a species – may be approaching faster than forecast for the most affected populations.
The waters around Svalbard, an archipelago between Norway and the North Pole, have a little over half the average area of ice for this time of year. According to the Norwegian Ice Service, the 172,291 sq km (66,522 sq m) of ice on 14 November was the lowest for this time of year since records began in 1967.
October also saw a huge departure from previous trends, particularly in the Barents Sea, which had freakishly warm weather in February and August. Scientists say these shifts, which are caused by the manmade heating of the globe, are disrupting the behaviour of species that depend on thick winter ice, such as narwhals, seals, belugas and polar bears.
“We’re restructuring a whole ecosystem. Sea ice is to the Arctic what soil is to the forest. Without sea ice we’ll still have an ecosystem but it won’t include polar bears &amp; many other species,” tweeted the scientist Andrew Derocher, who has studied the bears for 35 years.
“It’s sounds like a broken record, reporting record-breaking low sea ice cover in Svalbard. This area has warmed dramatically in recent years. Polar bears here may be the first extirpation event,” he wrote, though he noted that so far the problem was restricted to habitat loss.
One of 19 polar bear populations in the Arctic, Svalbard has close to 2,500 individual bears. This number has been stable for the past 15 years, but pressures are growing.
Because of the delay in ice formation, bears have to wait longer to hunt for seals, which means they are missing out on an autumn feeding season that is important for them to build up fat.
A recent study showed bears survived previous warm periods by gorging on beached whales, but this was unlikely to be enough to cope with the current pace of climate change.
Although there has been some ice formation in recent days, it was still the second lowest on record on Thursday.
The most immediate concern is for pregnant females, who normally travel across the ice at this time to make maternity dens on Hopen and other islands that are important for reproduction, said Jon Aars of the Norwegian Polar Institute.
“Unless sea ice forms within the next few weeks, pregnant females will have to swim,” he said, noting this uses five times as much energy and runs down fat reserves that are important for producing milk and raising cubs.
Previous research in other Arctic regions have shown that pregnant females declined in weight and litter sizes went down from 1.8 to 1.6 between 1993 and 2017.
Aars said if current climate trends continued bears would struggle, although it was hard to say when the tipping point would be.
“In 2000, we didn’t foresee that Svalbard would be ice-free at this time of the year,” he said. “If this continues, there’ll be a threshold where it will be hard for the bears to reproduce. Things can happen fast. I’m not optimistic about whether the bears will survive. If the sea ice disappears, then so will the bears.”
An ice-free Arctic is forecast by about 2040.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/23/slow-arctic-freeze-raises-risk-of-polar-bear-extinction-say-scientists

Former ministers Damian Green, Oliver Letwin and Anna Soubry are among the signatories of the letter to the prime minister, which said that a stronger long-term goal would cut energy bills and improve air quality.
The UK is committed to cut emissions by 80% by 2050. But the government recently asked its climate advisers to consider whether a deeper cut is needed in the light of a landmark UN report on the risks posed by global warming.
Simon Clarke, the Brexiter Tory MP who organised the letter, said: “By setting a net-zero target before 2050 we can ensure the UK is at the forefront of the zero-carbon technological revolution whilst cementing our status as a global climate leader.”
More than 160 MPs have signed the plea to May, including from Labour, the SNP, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Green party. Organisers hope to get 100 Tory MPs signed up by the time the government’s advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, reports back next spring.
Meeting a goal of net-zero emissions before 2050 would require far-reaching changes beyond those already under way in energy, buildings and transport.
But the letter’s signatories argue it would put the UK “at the forefront of the race for investment in clean industries”, and build on a history of “British ingenuity” in science and engineering.
The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, used his conference speech in September to commit the party to a target of net-zero emissions by the middle of the century. The letter calls for the goal to be met before 2050 but there is no agreed date – WWF said this week that 2045 was possible.
The intervention comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the Climate Change Act receiving royal assent on Monday, the same day the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is due to publish a major report on how global warming will affect the UK.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/23/tory-mps-demand-net-zero-carbon-emissions-by-2050-theresa-may-climate-change

This is where your Wrexit hubris gets the better of you. Why would anyone be interested in being allied with a mid-size nation that throws a tantrum every time it does not get its way and whose history in the parts of the world it manhandled means that those parts will either be extremely pragmatic in their dealings with you (Theresa May got a bit of a snub in India, didn't she?) or simply will not have anything to do with you? This teary-eyed sentimentality about your greatness is a figment of your imagination. This no longer is the world we live in. 
The EU does not have much of a foreign policy to speak of and, like many others in Brussels, tends to specialise in producing bland individuals who have an extreme aptitude in delivering bland platitudes. Mogherini, anyone? Or any of the other Eurocrats? I'm no fan of Juncker, nor of his - apparently - anointed successor. Wrong people sending the wrong signals about where the Union is heading. Quick reminder: Wrexit addresses none of these issues. 
On one level this blandness is reassuring, I guess, on another it's a lamentable lack of vision. Some of the EU member states (most notably: France) still have to shed their part of the colonial hubris deadweight. EU ""development"" policy was pretty much sub-contracted out to France and concentrated mainly on Africa for that reason. The EU Army, if it ever comes to pass, will most likely be modeled on the kind of rapid intervention forces that have already been in action in (among others) central Africa. I can pretty much guarantee you that there will not be a grand standing Europe Army. But Merkel is correct when she says that a Trump-led America cannot be trusted as a loyal ally. That is far ad away the most important the reason for the increased clamouring for more integrated European military efforts.

Only 10 years earlier, there would have been no need to dragoon civilian vessels. It was successful, but should not have been necessary. Nevertheless, it allowed Thatcher and the Tories to bask in jingoism and the 'Falklands Factor' for the next couple of elections, and entered national mythology in the same way as Britain standing alone in 1940. It shouldn't have. Thirdly, it tends to be forgotten that the US almost chose to support the other side.

I agree, but a low-tax, worker-exploiting, migrant-driven (i.e. Tory wet-dream) economy is not the only stable model out there. It's just the one to which the British ruling class are traditionally accustomed, a legacy of the days of empire and colonisation. 
The Single Market creates the opportunity for the steady flow of low-cost goods and labour, which creates wealth and resources to create wealth. In the UK most of that wealth and resource comes through London. This will automatically create widening gaps between rich and poor, urban and rural, cosmopolitan and parochial, foreign and native, unless there are active and ongoing policies to narrow those gaps. But it's up to the UK Government, not the EU, to implement those policies, and to distribute those benefits more evenly across the country. 
And it's not as if the British are incapable of thinking up glorious, radical and successful alternative infrastructures : the Westminster system of parliamentary democracy, the NHS, even the Single Market itself (Thatcher's idea goddamit!).

The situation is less paradoxical than it sounds, because Brexit is a project based on an assertion of what the country does not want to be – a member of the EU – without a clear articulation of what it should be instead. That omission will be felt keenly, but not discussed, at Sunday’s extraordinary summit, where Theresa May and the 27 other European heads of government are expected to agree the broad outlines of a future partnership. But this “deal” will not answer the existential question that Brexit raises: if Britain’s influence in the world is no longer to be deployed as part of a European project, how will it be felt?
The leave campaign did not recognise that as a legitimate question because Eurosceptics always saw “Brussels” as a hostile force and a drain on the sovereign power of a nation state. Brexit, in that view, offered enhanced status as “Global Britain”. That fantasy, like so many of the leaver pledges, has been dismantled by events. The dynamics of a 27-to-one negotiation have demonstrated how a continental bloc asserts power greater than the sum of its parts and greater than any one European country can wield alone. Power in the world is not simply a matter of autonomy to sign trade deals. EU membership has been an axiom of British foreign and security policy well beyond the arena of economic cooperation. To jettison that arrangement would have been risky at any point in recent decades. With Donald Trump in the White House, the timing is exquisitely poor. Mr Trump has started a trade war with China that looks like the prologue to a long confrontation between superpowers. Traditionally, a US president would look to Europe for strategic alliance under such circumstances, but Mr Trump has also picked trade fights with Brussels and heaped scorn on the EU.
Britain does not have to pick a side in this volatile environment but it will have to express priorities. The national interest will often demand alignment with our continental neighbours. That is a fact of culture, history, geography and realpolitik. Historians will look back and wonder how it was that Britain could make such consequential decisions about its role in the world without them featuring in domestic debate. The parochialism of cabinet rows has crowded out strategic challenges. Urgent, global issues are scarcely discussed: climate change; the potential uses and abuses of artificial intelligence and genomics; large-scale population migrations. These are forces that will reshape human society, and it is hard to see how a medium-sized, albeit rich, nation can grapple with them alone.
The most influential actors will be those that can operate on continental scale – China, the US, India, the EU. Such gigantism requires political deftness and skill to navigate. There will be questions about how much freedom ought to be devolved within such superpowers. Once a key player in such debates, we will be a bystander. Britain is recusing itself from that level of influence, downgrading its clout in the world. That might be what many voters want, or at least a price they are willing to pay for Brexit. It is difficult to know, when the question has never been put in those terms. This weekend’s meeting in Brussels is all about Britain and what Mrs May has negotiated. There needs to be more focus on the question of what future British prime ministers will be able to achieve after Mrs May has surrendered the UK’s seat at the summit table.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/23/the-guardian-view-on-foreign-policy-thinking-small-when-the-rest-are-going-big

Sweden’s then deputy prime minister remained enigmatic as the picture went viral and she was asked whether she had been “trolling” the US president. “It is up to the observer to interpret the photo,” she was quoted as saying. “We are a feminist government, which shows in this photo.”
The image made headlines around the world and, nearly two years on, is still what Lövin is best known for internationally. But the Swedish Green party leader and minister for international development is no mere social media politician. During her party’s historic first period in government she relentlessly pushed through an exhausting list of more than 50 policies, including a flight tax, the so-called Swedish Proposal, which tripled the price of EU emissions credits, and the carbon law she was signing in the picture that went viral.
Lövin is one of the leading figures in what she says is a resurgence in environmentally conscious politics across the continent. “There is a green wave going on in Europe, in Germany, Luxembourg and Belgium, and in Finland as well,” she says. “I’m convinced that green parties offer a positive vision, and also the willingness to take on the huge challenges that we see in the world right now.”
The slogan on her Twitter profile, “The climate can’t wait”, sums up the Lövin approach.
“We’ve been very focused on results, and many of these issues have beenfundamental, long-term policies,” she says, sitting in her office in Sweden’s foreign ministry.
“To work seriously on changing policies and setting long-term targets, and forming majorities and doing agreements with other parties, those things don’t pay off very easily in PR strategies.”
It’s the same single-mindedness she as shown ever since bursting into public life 10 years ago following the 2007 publication of Silent Seas – The Fish Race to the Bottom, a rigorously researched, dramatic exposé of the crisis in global fisheries.
“It totally changed my life,” she says of the book, published when she was 44. “But what really changed my life was the decision to write the book. I felt such a huge anxiety and anger about what we’re doing to our planet, and specifically when I understood the issue of overfishing – because we’re actually destroying our oceans with our eyes open.” I decided ... I will try to write about this topic, and then at least I’ve tried’.”
The book was a sensation, winning Sweden’s two main journalism prizes, and launching a process which saw Lövin sent to Brussels as an MEP by the Green party with a single mission: to push through reform of fisheries policies. When I ask if she succeeded, she laughs. “Quite modestly I have to say ‘yes’. I was there for five years and we managed to get a majority in the European parliament to ban shark finning, overfishing and discarding fish, and to bring in a new common fisheries policy that sets the target that we must have sustainable fish stocks by 2020.”
There’s a section in the book when she considers rescuing a dogfish, still alive at a fish auction, and releasing it into the sea. But she bristles when I ask if she sees herself as an eco-warrior. “No, no, no. Never. For me, it was extremely important to really do the research and see the facts,” she says.
“I see the environmental challenges that we have now, they are existential. It’s that serious. It’s not just being like an image, that you’re an eco-warrior or whatever. This is really happening now.”
That is why, when the Swedish Green party formed a coalition with the Social Democrats in 2014, Lövin took the next step and joined the national government, first as minister for international development cooperation, then, when her colleague Åsa Romson resigned, as deputy prime minister and climate minister. “It was tough for me personally,” she says. “But I felt if I don’t do this, I might regret for the rest of my life I didn’t try to do something about the problems I saw.”
Government has also been a bruising experience for the party, particularly at the end of 2015 and the start of 2016, when a dramatic tightening of immigration policy was followed by a failure to stop Vattenfall, the state power company,selling, rather than shutting down, its German coal mines. “One of the mistakes we made … was maybe to say that we would succeed in certain issues where it wasn’t possible, and that has haunted us,” she says, of the coal debacle.
As a result, the party lost roughly half of its 20,000 members, and then, in September’s election, a third of its seats. The party says, however, it always knew that power would come at a heavy price, and had aimed only to stay above the 4% threshold needed to keep its place in parliament.
I see the environmental challenges that we have now, they are existential. It’s that serious.
“It’s been a long-term strategy for the Swedish Greens to come into government and really take responsibility,” says Lövin. “We managed to do that and not be destroyed in the process.”
The Greens may yet have a role in the future Swedish government. Coalition talks have failed to lead anywhere and, last week, Annie Lööf, the leader of the minority Centre party, failed to form a government, the second such doomed attempt. Lövin believes her party is now in a strong position and could find a place in coalitions dominated by the centre-right Alliance bloc or the Social Democrats, whose leader, Stefan Löfven, was on Friday announced as the next person to be put forward to parliament as prime minister.
“It’s difficult to exclude any possibility at this point,” she says. “The Green party has been mentioned now as a very interesting partner for the more liberal rightwing parties, and of course we’re also included in what most people think would be a Social Democratic or more centre government.”
While some other party leaders have spent the last two months locked in coalition talks, Lövin has instead been busy serving as a minister in the transitional government, leading preparations for next month’s Katowice Climate Change Conference.
“I hope to be there,” she says. “I’m very concerned, actually, because with the Paris Agreement, everyone was very happy that we got to get an agreement, but now the logic of the climate negotiations is back to where it was before Paris, with the poor counties, including China and India, blaming the richer countries for what’s happening.”
Lövin’s press secretary then chips in to warn her that it’s time for her next appointment, but she has one more thing she wants to say. “I think one of the most important things for all democracies around the world to contemplate is how we are going to develop and protect democracy when voters are so impatient and learn their news from social media, which can be very biased.”
A viral tweet such as hers may get through to hundreds of thousands of people with a simple message about how wrong it is for a White House full of men to sign orders that affect women’s bodies and lives. It cannot, however, communicate more complicated, nuanced information.
“The understanding of long processes, which is, very necessary if you are going to have a democracy, not a dictatorship, is very low,” she says.
“I think just staying on very superficial messages and going with a populist movement is totally the opposite of what a green party should be.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/24/isabella-lovin-trolled-trump-swedish-minister-climate-change-mission-fishing-ban

The warning came as a Met Office report found Britain would experience much wetter winters and summers as much as 5C hotter as a result of climate change. This year’s heatwave is likely to become the new normal by mid-century, but the wettest days are now on average seeing 17% more rainfall than in the recent past, bringing a much heightened risk of flash flooding.
Announcing the biggest review of climate change in Britain for nearly a decade, the environment secretary, Michael Gove,said flooding was one of the key ways in which changes would become manifest in the UK.
• Summers in the UK for the last decade have been on average 20% wetter than the 1961-1990 average
• Total rainfall from extremely wet days has increased by about 17% in the last decade, showing that extreme weather – which can lead to flash flooding – is growing more common
• The mean sea level around the UK has risen by about 16% since the start of the 20th century, and sea level rises could reach 1.15m by 2100
• By 2070, summers could be 5.4C hotter, and winters 4.2C warmer
• The chance of a summer as hot as 2018 was only about 5% in the 1990s but is now a 10-20% probability, rising to a 50% probability by mid-century
• The average temperature in the UK for the past decade has been 0.3C warmer than the 1981-2010 average, and 0.8C warmer than the 1961-1990 average
• Nine of the 10 warmest years on record in the UK have occurred since 2002
• The average hottest day of the year in the last decade has been on average 0.1C hotter than the 1981-2010 average, and 0.8C warmer than the 1961-1990 average of 26C
• Sea level rise is likely to be greater in the south than the north, with London expected to be in the range of 0.29-0.7m by the end of the century if greenhouse gas emissions are kept low, but 0.53-1.15m if emissions are high. Edinburgh is likely to experience a rise of only 0.08-0.49m in a low-emissions scenario, and 0.3-0.9m if emissions are high
The projections are available online through the Met Office, and next year a more detailed assessment will be issued showing the risks of climate change at a more local level, comparable to those used for weather forecasting and providing information on events such as localised heavy rainfall, which can result in flash floods and surface water floods
“It will not always be possible to prevent every flood,” he told an audience of Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) stakeholders. “We cannot build defences to protect every single building or reinforce every retreating coastline. We will be looking at ways we can encourage every local area to strive for greater overall resilience that takes into account all the different levers from land-use planning to better water storage upstream, and tackles both flood prevention and response.”
Defra is spending £2.6bn on flood defences between 2015 and 2021, and aims to protect 300,000 homes from flooding by that date. The Met Office said the UK could expect warmer and wetter winters as a result of climate change.
The Environment Agency is preparing for 4C of warming in planning the UK’s flood defences, though the Paris agreement aims to limit warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels. Even in the lowest-emission scenario presented by the report, average annual temperatures are expected to be up to 2.3C higher by the end of the century.
The chance of seeing a summer as hot as 2018 was less than 5% in the 1990s, but already that risk is between 10% and 20%, and by mid-century will be 50%, according to the projections. But while summers grow hotter, they will also be wetter in some places, with the average summer now 20% wetter than the average between 1961 and 1990.
Gove said: “We need our communities and infrastructure to be better prepared for floods and coastal change, so that they recover more quickly from the damage and disruption and, where necessary, to help people and communities move out of harm’s way.”
New flood protection measures will include natural defences such as planting trees, restoring heathland and installing “leaky dams”, as well as in some cases allowing water to breach sea walls to create new wetland habitats for birds.
Next year, Defra will publish a long-term policy statement on flooding and coastal erosion and the Environment Agency will issue a new 50-year flood strategy, which Gove said should “explore new philosophies”, going beyond traditional flood defences such as sea and river walls and other “hard” barriers.
Flooding
Defra is to publish a long-term policy statement on flooding next year, while the Environment Agency will issue a new 50-year strategy at the same time. These are likely to include measures far beyond traditional flood management, which relies on “hard” defences such as seawalls and river barriers, and focus on soft defences such as restoring wetlands, planting trees, providing more natural spaces for water storage and moving people away from the worst affected areas.
Water supply
This week, Defra will publish a new draft national policy statement containing measures to make it easier for water companies to construct new reservoirs and water infrastructure. There will also be a new target for water companies to halve leakage from their pipes by 2050.
Agriculture
The agriculture bill currently before parliament will reward farmers who reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help to adapt their land to a changing climate. Next year, Defra will start developing a new emissions reduction plan for agriculture, including ways to reform fertiliser use, which produces greenhouse gas emissions and ammonia, a key contributor to air pollution.
Nature
A new England Peat Strategy will be published next year setting out how to restore peatlands. A new task force is to be set up to accompany the strategy.
A new English Tree Strategy will set out how to accelerate tree planting. From 2024, farmers will be rewarded for woodland creation through the environmental land management contracts set out in the agriculture bill.
Waste and resources
Defra will develop a new resources and waste strategy, setting out measures to improve the use of resources, increasing re-use and recycling, minimising waste and creating a more circular economy. Food waste will be a priority, with more councils encouraged to collect food waste separately and send it to anaerobic digestion plants to create biogas for domestic heating. A new £15 fund will redistribute surplus food to charities.
International
The UK will ensure its international aid supports work dealing with climate change and biodiversity loss, and share expertise with developing countries to help them adapt to the effects of warming. A new £13m fund will target mangrove restoration, particularly in small island states such as Jamaica, and countries hit by deforestation, such as Colombia. The UK will also participate in the new Global Commission on Adaptation, chaired by Ban Ki-moon, and will push for a new international agreement on biodiversity at a key conference in China in 2020.
Gove said the new data in the UK Climate Projections report, compiled by Defra and the Met Office, would help communities and businesses to protect themselves better from the increasing flood risk.
In a wide-ranging speech, the secretary of state also promised new domestic policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, using resources more efficiently and tackling waste, planting more trees and restoring peatlands.
Next year an England Peat Strategy will be published, setting out how the condition of the country’s peatlands – only 13% of which are in near natural condition – will be improved. A new taskforce will also be set up, involving farmers, conservationists and academics.
Farmers will be central to many parts of the climate strategy, with Gove promising reforms around how fertilisers are used and a new emissions reduction plan for agriculture, at the same time as encouraging farmers to grow more food. Farmers would be supported by the government in reducing the emissions from their land and activities, Gove said, but he did not specify what form this support would take.
New water supply infrastructure will also be needed, and Gove raised the possibility of new reservoirs, which could prove controversial in some areas. This week, the government will lay before parliament a new draft national policy statement that will set out measures to make it easier for water companies to build reservoirs and water transfer infrastructure.
Water companies have set out proposals for more than £50bn of investment between 2020 and 2025, which are now under scrutiny by Ofwat to ensure they represent value for money for the public.
Gove made it clear that his ambitions for tackling climate change were also international. “We are a world leader in supporting international development, both financially and through technical assistance,” he said, noting that the UK was the world’s third-largest aid donor.
“Climate change and other interrelated environmental impacts are exacerbating poverty and erasing, or increasing the fragility of, development gains, and the crisis facing our natural world is growing,” he said. “Protecting and restoring nature is essential for securing genuinely sustainable development. That is why we need to ensure that our funding for international development supports work to deal with climate change and biodiversity loss.”
He pointed to £6bn of funding earmarked for the period 2016 to 2020 to help developing countries curb their greenhouse gas emissions and build resilience to the impacts of climate change. “Between now and 2020 it is also critical that we better connect the international climate negotiations with those focused on nature and biodiversity,” he said. “It is impossible to meet climate mitigation and climate adaptation objectives without the natural environment, and we can’t save nature without tackling climate change.”
UN talks on how to implement the Paris agreement will take place next month in Poland but progress may be made difficult by the withdrawal of the US and the anti-Paris stance taken by Brazil’s new president, Jair Bolsonaro.
Campaigners urged the government to do more. Emi Murphy of Friends of the Earth said: “Climate change will have a devastating impact on the UK with more extreme weather, rising sea levels and scorching summers – so why isn’t the government doing far more to tackle this crisis? Ministers must develop an urgent action plan to develop a zero-carbon future – and strengthen the Climate Change Act to ensure this is achieved.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/26/uk-flooding-threat-people-moved-michael-gove-climate-change

Rignot: It’s a little bit shattering to say, “hey this is it”, even for the scientists looking at it. It’s kind of a big step to say “I think this place is falling apart”. 
Interviewer: How do we communicate this to the public?
Rignot: I don’t know, but we're not doing a good job at that. I think most of the scientists are not trained for that, so they've been taken by surprise, they don't know how to deal with that very well.
I'm trying to learn. I talk to people from digital media to ask them how do we reach the people? The feedback I get right now is, “you guys really suck at it, you're not doing it right, I can tell that you're not trained to do this. The message is not passing.”
You know you talk about these things like [monotone voice] ‘business as usual, this glacier is falling apart. West Antarctica is going to be in an irreversible state of retreat’, and the people who listen to that may not click, they feel like, ‘well he doesn't seem so shattered by this, so why should I worry about it?’ We should be a little bit more vocal and direct about these things. You have some how to take your scientist hat off and take a different hat to communicate that.
You cannot communicate to the public the same way you communicate to your colleagues. It has to be a different level of communication.

He ended up spending decades applying this technique to more and more examples of similar sedimentary successions - the process works because a beetle wing-case is usually sufficient to identify a species, and the species have not changed much in a long time.
Any given collection of species taken together indicates a very precise temperature.
His discovery tells us that the Earth's climates are not necessarily stable.
These rapid climate events were confirmed a few decades later by ice cores from the Greenland ice sheet..... the events he discovered had a number of natural causes.
Not long before he died in 2011, Prof Coope said that people are messing with a trigger that causes climate change, and the consequences are likely to be 'ferocious'.

What must we do to prevent serial disasters becoming existential catastrophe
BQENDCatastrophes (natural or engineered) are now much coveted by the ruling elites. That's is called 'The Shock Doctrine'. Of course natural disasters are preferable since production cost are far less than the engineered ones and there is no need to mount dodgy investigations and/or offer ridiculous explanations.
Here is one example, many are familiar with:
After the original shock of the disastrous flooding of New Orleans in 2005 ...
BQSTART
- Next came the “ economic shock therapy”: using the window of opportunity opened up by the first shock to push through a rapid-fire attack on the city’s public services and spaces, most notably it’s homes, schools and hospitals. 
-Now we see that as residents of New Orleans try to resist these attacks, they are being met with a third shock: the shock of the police baton and the Taser gun, used on the bodies of protestors outside New Orleans City Hall yesterday.

It confirms that we are witnessing a shift in the functioning of the Earth system as a whole, a shift to a new state that is unsympathetic to the continued flourishing of human life.
A changing climate is only one feature of a warming globe. Human activity has bounced the Earth into a state that has no equivalent in its 4.5 billion year history.
The Earth’s new trajectory as it spins into the future has led scientists to tell us we have entered a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene. We have crossed a threshold and the geological clock cannot be turned back. The disruption we have caused is increasingly unpredictable and uncontrollable, and it has no endpoint.
There are, therefore, two questions humankind must face. What must we do to prevent serial disasters becoming existential catastrophe? And how can we make our social and economic systems flexible enough to cope with the new dispensation?
There are several reasons an international agreement has proven so hard. The leading one is sabotage by climate science deniers. Can it be countered? Climate science denial was invented and propagated mainly in the United States by the fossil fuel industry in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The challenge is no longer how to use information to change people’s minds. The challenge is how to change a culture
Activists know how to thwart an industry lobbying campaign. But then something calamitous happened – rejecting climate science became caught up in the culture war. The Tea Party and Fox News were largely responsible for the shift. Before then, even a conservative like Sarah Palin accepted the science and called for action. But after 2009, rejecting climate science became a badge of political identity for conservatives.
From that point onwards, facts no longer mattered.
So the challenge is no longer how to use information to change people’s minds. The challenge is how to change a culture. No one knows how to do that.
Last week Donald Trump, who calls climate science a hoax, visited a California devastated by wildfires. When asked whether his visit would change his mind about climate change he said “No”. What else could he say? The journalist was asking him if he would change who he was.
Yet it’s too easy to blame the world’s slowness to act on crazy American deniers. Because, in a way, we are all climate science deniers.
The full truth of what humans have done is almost impossible to take in. To fully embrace the message of the climate scientists means giving up the deepest presupposition of modernity – the idea of progress. Relinquishing our belief in progress means we must let go of the future, because we have been taught from infancy that the future is progress.
In our minds, replacing the old future defined by progress with a new future defined by endless struggle requires a period of grieving. Not many people have the stomach for that.
While most people in most countries accept the truth of climate science, they don’t accept its implications. What can be done to change that?
When it comes to communicating the science’s message to the public, there is no magic potion to be found. A lot has been tried and some of it works reasonably well, up to a point. The scientists must keep doing their research and putting it out. Accusing them of alarmism is a calculated political slander; in truth, they have consistently been too cautious in their warnings, especially in IPCC reports.
Yet the meaning of their reports has not sunk in. It’s clear that an Earth warmer by four degrees – and after the unwinding of the 2015 Paris agreement that is the path we have returned to – will impose enormous stresses on all societies.
In poorer countries, it will lead to mass migrations, many deaths and violent conflict. The effects in wealthy countries will depend on who holds power and how they govern. Disasters, food shortages and waves of immigration will magnify resentment against the rich, who will be attempting to insulate themselves from the turmoil around them.
But they too depend on the infrastructure of urban life – electricity and water supply, sewerage and waste disposal, transport systems for food and so on. And they can’t insulate themselves from social upheaval.
Some communities will learn to adapt more effectively. Smaller, cooperative communities will be best placed to adapt themselves to endure the troubles.
But however humans live or die on the new Earth we have made, we are approaching the endpoint of modernity and must accept that it is finally true that man is the environment of man.

The foreign ministry announced the reversal in a message to Patrícia Espinosa, executive secretary of the UN Convention on Climate Change, according to the O Globo news website.
Two months after winning the bid to host the COP25 conference in 2019, the note said Brazil would withdraw its offer to stage the event due to the transition in government and budget restrictions, the paper said.
The decision is a blow to global efforts to prevent dangerous levels of global warming. Brazil, which is home to the the world’s biggest rainforest, the Amazon, has been an important player in international climate talks. Its sudden weakening of support comes just days before the opening of this year’s climate talks in Katowice, Poland.
The Climate Observatory NGO said Brazil had abdicated its role in one of the areas where it was most needed by the world and its own people.
“By ignoring the climate agenda, the federal government also fails to protect the population, hit by a growing number of extreme weather events. These, unfortunately, do not cease to occur just because some doubt their causes,” the group said in a statement.
“It is not the first and certainly will not be the last bad news of Jair Bolsonaro for that area.”
The broken promise is in line with the anti-globalist rhetoric of the far-right former army captain, who was elected president in October and will take power in January. He threatened to quit the Paris climate agreement, then subsequently backtracked, but has made no secret of his desire to open up the Amazon to mining, farming and dam building.
He has also aligned himself closely to Donald Trump. Earlier this month he choose a new foreign minister who claims “climate alarmism” is part of a cultural Marxist plot and who said the United Nations has no language for “love, faith and patriotism”.
The shift has been abrupt. Just two months ago – shortly before the election – the foreign ministry said Brazil’s offer to host the COP25 talks “confirms the country’s leadership role in sustainable development issues” and “reflects the consensus of Brazilian society on the importance and the urgency of actions that contribute to the fight against climate change”, according to the O Globo news website.

Average temperatures around the world so far this year were nearly 1C (1.8F) above pre-industrial levels. Extreme weather has affected all continents, while the melting of sea ice and glaciers and rises in sea levels continue. The past four years have been the hottest on record, and the 20 warmest have occurred in the past 22 years.
The warming trend is unmistakeable and shows we are running out of time to tackle climate change, according to the World Meteorological Organization, which on Thursday published its provisional statement on the State of the Climate in 2018. The WMO warned that, on current trends, warming could reach 3C to 5C by the end of this century.
“These are more than just numbers,” said Elena Manaenkova, the WMO deputy secretary general. “Every fraction of a degree of warming makes a difference to human health and access to food and fresh water, to the extinction of animals and plants, to the survival of coral reefs and marine life.”
The world has committed to keeping warming to no more than 2C above such levels, with an aspiration to limit rises to 1.5C, which the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has said will cause the dieback of coral reefs, sea-level rises and extreme weather in many regions.
Greenhouse gas levels were also recently found to be at record levels, and a UN report this week said the world must triple its emissions reduction efforts to stay within 2C – and to stay within 1.5C, those efforts needed to be five times greater.
The IPCC found that continued rises in greenhouse gas emissions over the next 12 years could result in a breaching of the 1.5C limit.
On Monday, the Met Office said summer temperatures in the UK could be 5C hotter by 2070, making this year’s heatwave the norm for the future, while winters could get much wetter. London could become increasingly vulnerable to storms and flooding owing to sea-level rises, with the water level in the capital likely to rise by 1.15 metres by the end of the century.
The WMO found the extent of Arctic sea ice in 2018 was much lower than normal, with the maximum in March the third lowest on record and the September minimum the sixth lowest.
The oceans have been absorbing record or near-record amounts of heat at certain periods. The year started with a weak La Niña event but by October there were signs of a return to El Niño conditions, which can raise global temperatures further.
There were a greater number of violent storms than usual, including 70 tropical cyclones in the northern hemisphere, compared with the long-term average of 53. Storms brought devastation to the Mariana Islands, the Philippines, Vietnam, the Korean peninsula and Tonga, while hurricanes Florence and Michael caused substantial damage in the US.
Wildfires raged in Greece, Canada, California and other areas, while floods devastated Kerala in India and displaced more than 1.4 million people. Japan also experienced serious flooding, as did east Africa.
Petteri Taalas, the secretary general of the WMO, a leading authority on climate change, said: “We are not on track to meet climate targets and rein in temperature increases. If we exploit all known fossil fuel resources, the temperature rise will be considerably higher.
“We are the first generation to fully understand climate change and the last generation to be able to do something about it.”
Manaenkova added that every effort to reduce greenhouse gases and the impacts of climate change was worthwhile. “Every bit matters,” she said, citing the harm done by temperature rises to every aspect of life, including economic productivity, food security, glacier melt and water supplies, and the future of low-lying islands and coastal communities.
Jens Mattias Clausen, Greenpeace’s head of delegation at the UN climate change conference (COP24) in Poland, said: “The evidence, if we needed any more, continues to stack up. The record-high heatwaves, record-low Arctic sea ice, above average tropical cyclones and deadly wildfires are an alarm bell impossible to ignore. We’re in the midst of a climate crisis and this meteorological report spells out the worsening threat in startling clarity. It’s no longer our future that is in peril; our today is at risk.
“The recent IPCC report also showed that we still have hope. We have 12 years to move the needle and any leader who comes to COP24 unprepared to step up and take action needs to read the WMO report and understand it’s time to stop talking and start acting on climate – while we still have the chance.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/29/four-years-hottest-record-climate-change

The government scrapped a £1bn carbon capture and storage (CCS) competition in 2015, with the then-chancellor George Osborne saying it was too costly. Earlier efforts had also collapsed.
But on Wednesday the energy minister, Claire Perry, will signal the government’s renewed interest in the technology, including plans to repurpose fossil fuel infrastructure, such as reusing old gas pipelines to transport the carbon.
A new £20m dedicated fund will help build carbon capture equipment at industrial sites, which comes on top of an existing £100m pot. The hope is for a pilot facility in the mid-2020s, followed by full-scale ones in the 2030s.
Previously the focus was on capturing and storing emissions from a coal or gas power station, but the rise of renewables has made that goal less pressing.
This time round the priority is on capturing the carbon produced by heavy industry, such as chemicals plants and oil refineries, with the carbon then either stored or sold for use elsewhere in industrial processes.
Stuart Haszeldine, professor of carbon capture and storage at the University of Edinburgh, welcomed what he called a “sensible reboot” that would put “rocket boosters” under trials.
Looking beyond just capturing carbon from power plants would help, he said. “This is much more probable [to succeed] than the previous attempts, because the capture of CO2 is spread across numerous different types of industry.”
But he warned that companies would want reassurances, having been burned by previous government schemes that have seen firms write off investments worth hundreds of millions of pounds.
Carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) is seen by experts as a vital technology for tackling climate change, and reducing emissions in hard-to-treat polluting industries.
Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, said: “Without CCUS as part of the solution, reaching our international climate goals is practically impossible.”
The economist is speaking along with Perry at a CCUS summit on Wednesday in Edinburgh, joined by business leaders including BP’s chief executive, Bob Dudley.
While the aspiration for a CCUS facility in the mid-2020s is new, industry will have to wait until next year before officials publish the action plan to get the plant built.
The government said it had received interest from industrial centres in Scotland, south Wales, Humberside, Merseyside and Teesside.
One project, to capture carbon at a gas terminal north of Aberdeen, will enjoy an immediate £175,000 of government investment, to be matched by the Scottish government – and with the European commission providing funding too.
Drax Group, which runs the UK’s biggest power station, recently began work on a £400,000 trial to capture the carbon from one of its biomass-fired units.
The company has not yet confirmed who would buy the carbon, but has said it is in talks with the drinks industry, which was hit by a shortage of carbon dioxide earlier this year.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/28/carbon-capture-and-storage-gets-20m-sensible-reboot

“I woke up at 6am, looked out my window and realised we had a big problem. It was absolutely overwhelming.”
The sight that greeted her that morning was a gargantuan tide of sargassum – a type of ocean seaweed that had swept in overnight. At sea, sargassum is an essential habitat for some marine life, but when it reaches land it rots, sucking up oxygen from the water and emitting hydrogen sulphide gas, which smells like rotten eggs.
It has washed up in the Caribbean in unusually large amounts since 2011, but this year the largest volumes ever have appeared on shores from Barbados to Mexico, with piles several feet deep stretching for miles, and dozens of metres out to sea.
It has had a significant effect on the tourism on which much of the region depends – the sight and smell left beaches highly unattractive, and swimming was impossible. On land, the gas rapidly destroyed nearby electric units, such as TVs; eroded metals and even affected human health, with people living near inundated areas complaining of headaches, nausea and skin irritation.
Marine life was also affected; across the region, there have been reports of fish, turtles, dolphins and other creatures succumbing to the piles of rotting algae.
While oceanographers are uncertain of its causes, they think global warming could be a factor, and coastal communities could be due even worse sargassum inundations in the future.
“This is a major issue for many island countries,” says James Franks, senior research scientist at the Gulf Coast Research Laboratory at the University of Southern Mississippi. “We don’t fully understand it … there are many unknowns.”
It is believed the sargassum has benefited from increased nutrients in the sea – perhaps from mineral-rich dust blown from Africa, Franks says. Others believe fertiliser runoff from industrial farming in the Americas may be to blame. Warmer waters would also encourage plant growth.
“I imagine global warming is part of the problem,” says Amy Siuda, a sargassum specialist at Eckerd College, Florida. “We’re experiencing changes in currents that certainly can be related to warming of the atmosphere.”
Changes in wind patterns – potentially caused by a warming climate – mean sargassum might have been moved from areas where it has usually stayed, with winds and currents bringing it further south than normal, Siuda says.
She adds: “Ocean currents are the results of winds, changes in winds are the results of solar heating and changes in atmosphere and circulation. Ultimately, we can change circulation patterns by warming our atmosphere.”
Regardless of the causes, sargassum is being taken so seriously that governments across the Caribbean have initiated emergency programmes to deal with the issue.
Belize, a tiny nation in Central America, is highly dependent on tourism, and sargassum is the “biggest concern” of all to the trade, says Hall.
Hall says the authorities are “doing a good job” and are preparing the funding needed for expensive and complicated clear-up operations. Nonetheless, some hotels have reported cancellations during the slow season. The impact during high season could be devastating, say numerous locals employed in tourism.
Hall stresses that hotels are taking firm steps to deal with the issue – such as preparing booms to keep the tides of sargassum out at sea – and they remain optimistic for the region’s future. But she admits some sargassum control methods employed in the nearby Yucatan peninsula of Mexico – which is much better-resourced – have not worked.
In the northern Belizean island of Ambergris Caye, there was a mass fish die-out. The sargassum is “wiping out a generation” of the area’s young sea creatures, says Kirah Castillo, technical manager of the Hol Chan marine reserve just off the island.
Months-old juvenile creatures such as lobster and conch migrate to nursery areas of mangrove and seagrass and are believed to have been suffocated by sargassum. “Whatever juveniles came in will have died,” Castillo says. The effects are likely to be felt in two to three years’ time, when the creatures would be due to enter the fishery, she says.
These creatures are hard to see and the phenomenon has not been measured, Castillo says, but “we know from the biology of these animals that it is happening and will have an effect on the ecosystem. That’s a major concern for us.”
The complex suspected causes of the sargassum problem mean it could worsen, with little prospect of a preventive solution.
“Everyone now recognises this is a critical issue and may be long-term,” says Franks. Siuda agrees: “If the inundations increase in frequency, they could potentially last all year long without a break, maybe in larger amounts.”
It represents a new challenge coastal communities will have to adapt to.
“You couldn’t stop the waves. You could just see it coming and coming,” says Hall in her hotel office. “It’s a difficult thing, to feel powerless.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/16/caribbean-swamped-by-seaweed-that-smells-like-rotten-eggs

After failing to get conservatives on board to limit planet-warming gases through legislation or regulation, Democratic leaders in Washington are now wary of wading into another tough political fight, despite an intensifying environmental crisis.
If Democrats win back the House in Tuesday’s midterm elections, their strategy is to hold oversight hearings on Donald Trump’s environmental rollbacks and pursue more incremental and popular measures, according to close observers and a senior Democratic aide.
Environmental advocates hoping progressive politicians will lead efforts to save the planet may be shocked to learn there’s no wide-ranging strategy or headline-grabbing legislation waiting to be unveiled – even if Democrats take the White House in 2020.
The party’s efforts as currently planned won’t be enough to spur the rapid transformation in how society operates that leading scientists say is needed to spare humanity from the worst of rising temperatures, extreme weather and massive societal and economic disruptions.
But few in the party – or the big environmental groups that traditionally support it – are prepared to admit this outright.
“Obviously, a transformative government response to climate is clearly needed based on what we’re seeing from science. We have about 10 years left to really be doing something, but it’s hard [for us] to do because the Republican party is largely in denial on this,” said Congressman John Delaney, a Maryland Democrat running for president in 2020.
Congressman Ted Deutch, the Florida Democrat and cofounder of the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus in the House, said he’s not “rosy eyed” that Democrats in the majority could get Republicans to reverse their stances on the environment and climate.
“But I’m also not a cynic,” Deutch said. “I don’t reject the possibility of a major piece of legislation, and I think it’s possible to put together a bipartisan bill.”
Democrats have a decent chance of winning a majority in the House of Representatives in the 6 November midterm elections this year, while the Republicans are predicted to keep control of the Senate.
A senior Democratic aide familiar with the party’s policy blueprints was resigned to the situation. The aide said it doesn’t make sense for the House to work on legislation that Republicans in the Senate will never take up. The source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the issue is politically sensitive, said Democrats will instead try to encourage infrastructure projects to prepare communities for climate change and invest in green power.The source said “increasing public awareness will be a huge part of an eventual solution” and that Democrats hope to lay that groundwork. But the current leadership isn’t considering anything like the contentious cap on greenhouse gases that Democrats pushed for in 2009 or a tax on industry for carbon pollution.
The aide said Republicans have “demonized” attempts to slow climate change, making the issue politically intractable. That is despite almost daily reports of melting glaciers, dying wildlife and worsening storms in the US and across the globe.Democrats don’t only fear futile battles over legislation with Republicans. They also are wary of turning moderate Americans against the party if climate solutions raise the cost of living.
George David Banks, a former Trump White House energy and climate adviser, said Democrats aren’t planning any major legislation because they are “still dealing with the fallout from the failure of Waxman-Markey”.
Democrats have twice tried and failed to take major steps on climate change. In 2009 when they controlled Congress and the White House, the House passed the controversial “Waxman-Markey” proposal to cap greenhouse gases, but the Senate never took it up following a massive lobbying campaign against it that included ads warning of higher gasoline prices. After that defeat, the Environmental Protection Agency in 2015 finalized a rule for power companies to burn less coal. But the supreme court halted it and Trump’s administration is in the process of rolling it back.
Progressive environmental advocates say Democratic leaders, including Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, aren’t thinking big enough now.
“What I worry about is that Pelosi is going to get bogged down with oversight and is going to introduce a bunch of small-bore tax credit bills,” said RL Miller, the cofounder of the grassroots-focused advocacy group Climate Hawks Vote.
Miller cautioned that while smaller federal efforts and states’ work to limit climate pollution are good, the US will still need to make big changes across every sector of its economy.
Polling shows that while a majority of Americans care about climate change, few rank the environment as the most important problem.
“What I expect Democrats to do is not what I hope Democrats would do,” she said.
While 72% of voters backing Democrats see climate change as a “very big” problem, only 11% of those supporting Republicans do, according to the Pew Research Center, making any consensus extremely difficult. 
But Sarah Hunt, the cofounder of the Joseph Rainey Center for Public Policy, who works with conservatives on climate efforts, said Democrats should offer an “alternative vision”, even if they don’t think it would succeed with Trump in the White House.
Elan Strait, the World Wildlife Fund’s US climate campaigns director, argued the action just isn’t in Washington.
“There’s no cigar back room where people are hammering out a climate deal because that’s not where the movement is right now … the movement really is at the city and state level,” he said, despite reports that local action isn’t enough.
The carbon tax method, to charge businesses and their customers for greenhouse gas pollution, recently won a Nobel prize but currently has limited support in Washington, despite multiple proposals from some Democrats and Republicans.
For now, the US policies under discussion do not come close to matching what science requires.
Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University, said she is “not aware of any comprehensive plan that would accomplish what the US needs to do” to meet the commitments it made to other countries in the Paris climate agreement, which is meant to keep warming to 2C but is not on track to succeed.
“I want to see action, and so far there has been precious little of it,” Hayhoe said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/31/climate-change-democrats-house-midterms-pollution-plan

I’m not sure why flying always gets the top spot for things that we have to give up.
BQEND
There are a few reasons for this:1) Each flight is a significant proportion of a person's annual emissions. Cutting out a flight is the single biggest change most people can make. Annual emissions in the UK are around 7 tonnes per person. A flight to New York adds over 1 tonne. Long haul (e.g. to Australia) can consume more than a whole year's emissions for one person.
Globally we want emissions per person to reduce to about 1 tonne. So flying every year is pretty much out.
2) There are low-carbon tech-fixes for most emissions, but not for flying (yet). e.g. generating electricity from low-carbon alternatives instead of fossil fuel cuts emissions by 90%+. There are electric solutions for land transport, but not (really) for flying. Since there is no tech fix, the only option is changing behaviour: Flying less.
3) Cutting flying is an easy change for most people to make.

The solution is to re-invent the economy, to re-invent the money supply and to use our collective determination to make people-centred environmentally-friendly low-energy-consuming non-material-productive work profitable, the profitability meaning both that the work will be done and also that this humanised economy can grow. This is using a new type of capitalism to defeat the blind, destructive just-for-profits capitalism. 
This requires changing our mindsets rather than civil disobedience.
Let me illustrate this humanised economy. The citizens in a territory decide that caring for terminally ill people until they die is a very important job because this could be the lot of old age for everyone. They decide that part of their money supply will come via people doing this work. These carers will be deemed to generate X plus Y money. The X is their salary. The Y is the profit, a monetary expresssion of the social wealth created by this work. This Y is used to create more jobs in accordance with the parameters mentioned in the first paragraph, and these jobs, too, will generate Y.

As much as system failure is inherent in energy and food systems, it is inherent in the financial and money systems through which resource allocation is mediated. Specifically, the debt obligations that are a call on future resource use present a rigidity that undermines any rational strategic action to use resources more prudently. This reflects the inability of markets to value future systemic risks correctly. Recognising the limitations of capitalism and creating alternative systems and institutions with the capacity to define strategic constraints, is extremely difficult within the existing political systems. Given this complexity and intractability there can be no expectation that the existing systems are capable of the reform needed to become stable and sustainable. Indeed, institutions such as central banks, that impose stability on unstable financial systems can be seen as postponing the crisis, effectively turning off the alarm system. In the resulting unreality, we are seeing the emergence of phoney political leaders, focused on phoney issues and phoney solutions. The use of direct action to precipitate fundamental systemic reform, presupposes that the systems capable of delivering reform exist. They don't. This puts us into a genuinely pre-revolutionary environment, where a revolution destroys the existing systems in order to start a reform process. The processes of revolutionary destruction and reconstruction are invariably violent and unpredictable. It is hard to envisage that such forces will be unleashed until the consequences of inaction are seen to be much worse. When that time comes, the leaders of the revolution will be drawn from the ranks of those that take direct action. When the revolution comes it will unleash terrors that will make the French and Russian revolutions be consigned to a quiet period of history. It will be insane and horrific, with enforced cultural change of a sort never seen. When, in the more distant future, historians reflect on why the revolution was so extreme and so violent, they will point the finger at all the forces of conservatism, in the media, in politics, in business and particularly in finance, that so determinedly worked to change nothing in the face of enormous evidence that change was inevitable.

Do dark warnings about the world that awaits us if we do not curtail carbon emissions and protect forests and oceans motivate people to act, or scare them off? Are apocalyptic visions such as that in Cormac McCarthy’s novel The Road what we need to open our minds, or an inducement to give up trying?
Opinion is divided, as events of the past week have illustrated. In advance of his latest wildlife television series, Dynasties, David Attenborough said at the weekend that too many warnings about endangered species are a “real turn-off”. A few days earlier, the activist group Extinction Rebellion launched a campaign of civil disobedience by demanding a zero-carbon economy by 2025. Writing in advance of a protest in London that saw 15 people arrested, Green MEP Molly Scott Cato said she and others have been driven to break the law after spending years ringing alarm bells and being ignored.
Influenced by thinkers including Charles Eisenstein and Erica Chenoweth, whose ideas about peaceful protest have also been taken up by opponents of President Trump, and with a commitment to grassroots organising that is similar to 350.org (the anti-fossil-fuel organisation launched in the US by Bill McKibben in 2007), Extinction Rebellion aims to foment a mass movement that will change history. Elected politicians, goes the argument, have failed, as have businesses and other organisations including environmental charities. Carbon emissions and biodiversity loss are out of control. The “unimaginable horrors” of unchecked warming and habitat destruction mean more radical tactics are called for – and morally justified by the dangers, in the eyes of protesters.
While the current focus on the extinction crisis is novel, and a contrast to more familiar warnings about emissions, the notion that environmental activism encompasses lawbreaking is not new. The Green party of England and Wales approves of civil disobedience in the statement of underlying principles known as its “philosophical basis”. Greenpeace has engaged in nonviolent direct action alongside the traditional NGO tools of lobbying and petitions since the 1970s. Activists have used occupations and blockades as techniques in protests against road-building, airports and coal-fired power stations. They have also mounted protests against sponsorship by oil companies in museums. Most recently, attempts to frack in Lancashire have been disrupted by protesters, three of whom were freed from prison last month after successfully appealing against sentences that judges found to be “manifestly excessive”.
The heightened language of emergency and breakdown employed by this new grouping will not appeal to everyone. Nor is it intended to. It is rational to be sceptical about whether the protesters will achieve their aims. But on the basis of the most recent warnings about rising temperatures and species decline, and chancellor Philip Hammond’s failure to mention climate change at all in last week’s budget, it is not rational to deny that they are justified in rebelling against the government’s inaction. Their sense of urgency is welcome.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/04/the-guardian-view-on-environmental-activism-new-energy-is-welcome

A majority of Washington state voters in the midterm elections rejected a measure, known as Initiative 1631, that would have put a $15 fee on each ton of carbon dioxide emitted in the state, with the funds used to bolster various renewable energy projects.
It is the third time an attempt to implement carbon pricing has been thwarted in Washington, a progressive state in the Pacific north-west with just one, soon-to-close coal power plant and a glut of hydroelectricity. The glaring ballot failure threatens prospects of moving quickly enough to avert disastrous climate change.
“It’s a setback because nothing really happens at a federal level until it happens in the states – just look at gay marriage,” said Heidi Peltier, an expert in low-carbon policy at the University of Massachusetts. “If we are going to have a carbon tax nationally, we need to have enough states doing it. Washington state had a chance to be one of the leaders.”
Carbon pricing has been backed by a broad range of economists as the most efficient way of driving down emissions, with the European Union and, more recently, Canada, embracing the idea. A recent UN report, which warned of dire consequences if planetary warming isn’t urgently curbed, suggested a fee much higher than $15 a ton.
Initiative 1631, which followed a similar ballot measure that failed two years ago, aimed to raise $2.2bn over five years and help Washington slash its greenhouse gas emissions by a quarter by 2025. 
However, voters rejected the initiative because “they understood it was a flawed initiative that would have raised consumer costs substantially while doing very little to meet carbon reduction goals in the state”, according to Catherine Reheis-Boyd, president of the Western States Petroleum Association, which spearheaded the no vote. Oil giant BP and others spent $30m opposing carbon pricing.
Environmentalists vowed to persevere. “While we still believe that a carbon fee would be a helpful solution, we can and must do more to find and adopt other creative solutions to slow global warming,” said Bruce Speight, director of Environment Washington.
A spokesman for the yes on the 1631 campaign said the group hadn’t conceded defeat yet. 
“The oil industry spent the most money in our state’s history and were willing to lie to voters about their support and mislead them on the facts,” he said.
The Washington vote was just one green-tinged measure rejected by voters. In Colorado, the fossil fuel industry spent more than $40m to help defeat a proposal requiring oil and gas wells to be half a mile from homes, schools and waterways.
Meanwhile, Arizona voters said no to Proposition 127, which would have mandated the state obtain half its energy needs from renewable sources such as wind and solar by 2030. 
Climate activists enjoyed a win in Florida, however, with voters backing a ban on all offshore drilling for oil and gas in state waters. 
There was further encouragement for environmentalists at the prospect of a Democrat-held House of Representatives probing the activity of the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Interior, as well as the election of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Deb Haaland and Ilhan Omar – all House Democrats who favour a transition to 100% renewable energy. The current Democratic leadership is not, however, understood to have large-scale plans to tackle the climate change crisis.
And the midterms highlighted the ongoing clout of the fossil fuel industry and the vast gulf between the current slow pace of emissions reduction and the action that scientists say is required to stave off the worst impacts of heatwaves, flooding, extreme weather and losses of animal species.
“Environmentalists still have a challenge in their messaging, there’s still the impression that carbon pricing or regulations will make everything more expensive,” said Peltier. “Oil, gas and coal can put a lot of money into ballot initiatives they see as detrimental to their future and put out information on climate change that isn’t real. There’s a real disparity there.”
Environmental advocates at a post-election press conference in Washington DC, largely claimed victory as Democrats won back the House and many governors pledged to phase out fossil fuels, but they acknowledged they are still in an uphill battle. “We didn’t win everywhere, and we know that,” said Wendy Wendlandt, senior vice-president for the Environment America Action Fund. “I think that’s on us as the environmental community to figure out how to connect the concern we know exists with environmental voters at the ballot box.”
“It is true that we have been able to make progress over the last couple years,” said the Sierra Club executive director, Mike Brune, noting environmental successes. “But it is also true that we are in a fight. We are in a bitter fight, a divisive fight.” Tom Steyer, the California billionaire whose group financed the Arizona renewable power measure, said Democrats can’t wait for Republicans to come to the table as the science shows a need for immediate action. “If we want to succeed by 2030, it is completely unclear to me that there are Republicans that are willing to compromise on this,” Steyer said.

As shown above warming has contributed to the drought by decreasing snowpack and increasing the need for water. In a warmer world drought have increase in severity and rate of onset increasing the length of the fire season.

It's okay if just Norway(to pick a country well along the conversion pathway) converts to e-cars, it's not OK if the rest of the planet does it. It's walking/cycling or its enviormental collapse, ecars play no part. Similarly the the nuclear vanguard promoting fusion, or the every popular Thorium that waxes and wanes out of favour as a non-solution, or even the fervet hopeful with fusion. As ever, scale is ignored. So few explore the only obvious solution, emit and consume less, 70%-80% less, why ?

If, in the wake of last month’s horrifying UN report on global warming, you’ve been asking yourself this question, take some solace (or at least solidarity) from the knowledge that you’re not alone. Jonathan Franzen has been grappling with it for years, and as the final-countdown title of his new volume of essays suggests, his despair at the state of the planet and our absolute inability (“political, psychological, ethical, economic”) to save it is, if anything, deepening. “I don’t have any hope that we can stop the change from coming,” he says bluntly at the conclusion of his opening essay, and nothing in the following pages suggests he is anywhere close to changing his mind.
But by refusing to hope for the impossible, Franzen, improbably, manages to produce a volume that feels, if not hopeful, then at least not hopeless. There’s nothing he can do – there’s probably nothing any of us can do – to avert or even alleviate the coming catastrophe. But for now, he’s here and he’s alive, and over the course of these essays he offers us a series of partial, tentative answers to the question he poses himself at the beginning: “How do we find meaning in our actions when the world seems to be coming to an end?”
This is not a collection that wastes time attempting to persuade us of the reality of the climate crisis; frankly, we’re way past that. “Drastic planetary overheating,” Franzen assures us, “is a done deal” – and by the way, we need to revise significantly upward our definition of what “drastic” means. The notional two-degree figure widely cited by politicians as the upper limit of what we, and the planet, could possibly accommodate is a line we’re on course to gallop past in just a few years’ time. By 2100, we may well be looking at a five or six-degree temperature rise, and even then there’s a possibility we’re being lowballed. “The scientist who confidently predicts a five-degree warming by the end of the century,” Franzen suggests, towards the end of the collection, “might tell you in private, over beers, that she really expects it to be nine.” It’s a body blow moment in a book that declines to pull its punches, and Franzen acknowledges that many of his readers – “the people for whom the prospect of a hot, calamity-filled future is unbearably sad and frightening” – might be “forgiven for not wanting to think about it”. But over the course of these essays, he succeeds in demonstrating that resignation brings with it a curious intellectual freedom. His acknowledgment that the macro problem is beyond him allows him to start thinking more creatively about micro solutions: what can be achieved here, now, today.
Naturally, there’s another way to read his position. Viewed through the other end of the telescope, Franzen’s acceptance of the coming crisis could be seen as an abdication of responsibility: resignation in terms of action, rather than comprehension; a ducking of the issue that’s just a left-liberal version of the US president’s fatuous claim that the climate will “change back”. It’s an accusation to which Franzen is acutely sensitive, not least because it has been levelled at him before. In the collection’s opening piece, “The Essay in Dark Times”, published as “Is it too Late to Save the World?”, what begins as a fascinating consideration of the role of the essay at a moment of objective peril evolves, via a circuitous route that takes in quitting smoking, birdwatching in Ghana and Trump’s election, into a critical rereading of another essay (“Save What You Love”, also collected here) that he wrote for the New Yorker, some two-and-a-half years earlier. That one was triggered by his fury at the actions of the National Audubon Society, the US’s foremost organisation for bird conservation.
Franzen’s passion for birdwatching is almost as well known as his novels, so to say the Audubon Society was an unlikely target is an understatement. But it was precisely “as a bird-lover” that it attracted his ire. In 2014, the Society had, “with much fanfare”, thrown all its resources into the climate change fight, declaring that global warming was “the number-one threat to the birds of North America”. There’s no question that climate change poses an existential threat in the medium-term, however, “in 2014, the most serious threats to American birds were habitat loss and outdoor cats”. In Franzen’s view, the society’s position was both “narrowly dishonest” and potentially harmful, in that it might discourage people “from tackling solvable environmental problems in the here and now”. He said as much in his essay, was duly denounced as a “climate-change denier”, and retreated in a mixture of shame and regret on the one hand, and injured self-justification on the other. The irony, of course, was that he wasn’t attempting to deny climate change at all: “In fact, I’m such a climate-science accepter that I don’t even bother having hope for the ice caps.” Rather, he was denying that our current piecemeal, unserious attempts to mitigate it will have any consequential effect, and arguing that therefore we might better expend our efforts on conservation projects whose benefits “are immediate and tangible”.
Where Franzen perfectly strikes the balance between form, content and voice you know you’re in the presence of a master
It’s a complex position, both to articulate and to accept. But it is not, in the years since he first set it out, one that he has backed away from, because it represents the only hope he has left, and the central hope of this collection: that facing the future “honestly, however painful this may be, is better than denying it”. Rather, as these essays show, the conclusion he has come to is that it’s not his position that’s lacking, but his ability to put it across in a way that readers can accept. It’s a challenge to him as a writer: to think harder; to write more clearly and with more sympathy. It’s a question of what the essay, as a form and specifically in his hands, can do.
And it’s a challenge to which he rises. This isn’t a flawless collection: there are uneven moments, and occasional longueurs. There are also – and I say this as a bird-lover – a whole lot of birds. They are the animating spirits of the collection, flitting and rustling through the essays, and Franzen ably makes the case both for their hold over him and their symbolic significance (“If you could see every bird in the world, you’d see the whole world”). But as the pages turn and the feathers pile up, it becomes harder and harder to keep the murres, taikos and storm petrels straight in your head – or, finally, to invest too deeply in the differences. Yet there are essays in which the balance between form, content and voice is perfectly struck, and when you reach one of those, it’s clear that you’re in the presence of a master. The opening essay, in which the idea of the essay itself is held up to the light, is a thing of supple, compelling intelligence, and by placing “Save What You Love”, his piece on the Audubon Society, after his retrospective analysis of its weaknesses, he effectively contextualises it, and allows us to read it for what it is: a teasing-out of complex arguments that refuses to reach for satisfying but reductive conclusions.
Then there’s the title essay, which comes fittingly at the collection’s close, brings together all of its strands (climate change, humanity, thinking, writing, birds), and is simply a delight. In it, Franzen weaves together, lightly but tightly, two narrative threads: his expedition on a cruise ship to Antarctica, and the life of his uncle Walt, whose unlooked-for bequest paid for the trip. The timelines diverge wildly (the trip takes a couple of weeks; Walt lived to a ripe old age) but by combining them, Franzen expertly shows how they speak to each other. They’re both stories about death: Walt, we learn, “lost his daughter” (in a car crash in her 20s), “his war buddies, his wife, and my mother” before mortality caught up with him; the Antarctic is both a death zone, the literal and metaphorical end of the world, and, thanks to climate change, dying itself. But read on, and we find that the real resonance between the two tales is the urgent case they make for the worth and beauty of life. Walt survived his tragedies, kept faith with the world, and “never stopped improvising”; in Antarctica, Franzen comes face to face with a king penguin in the wild, and finds that it “seemed to me, in itself, sufficient reason not only to have made the journey; it seemed reason enough to have been born on this planet”. It’s the work of a writer at the top of his game – limber and lovely, delivering deep insights with delicacy and grace – and it poignantly makes the only case for climate action that has any chance of succeeding: that there is so much worth living for. “Even in a world of dying,” Franzen concludes, “new loves continue to be born.”

One protester climbed above the revolving doors of the main entrance of the building in Westminster and wrote “frack off” in black spray paint, and another sprayed the extinction symbol in red on windows facing traffic on Victoria Street.
A spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion, the group that coordinated the demonstration, said their members used spray chalk, which washes off.
During the day, protesters superglued themselves to card-entry gates inside the staff entrance to the building, and lay down outside in Victoria Street blocking westbound traffic. 
The protest is intended to be the first in a series continuing throughout the week and culminating with a mass civil disobedience action on Saturday, which activists are calling “rebellion day”.

Dozens of protesters had locked themselves together outside the doors of the BEIS building and others glued themselves to glass.
At another entrance, protesters from the group Christian Climate Action could be seen through windows to have entered the lobby of the building and locked themselves to fittings.
Bell Selkie, 48, from Wales, sitting glued by her left hand to the door of BEIS, said the effects of climate change were becoming obvious.

“The IPCC report in October gave us six to 12 years, and this is known to be a conservative report. If we don’t respond with a war-style effort now we are all fucked, all of us. My heart is breaking and I’ve got to do something, and I’m putting my life on hold,” she said.
Some protesters wore high-visibility vests and patches with the words “conscientious protector”. Asked what that meant, one demonstrator, who preferred not to be named, said: “I have a conscience and I’ve never done anything like this before; I have to do something. We have to protect the environment because if we don’t, all the other problems, all the other causes that exist, are pointless. Everything else is pointless.”
The Green party peer Jenny Jones came to witness the demonstration after seeing news of it on social media from her office in the House of Lords. She said she backed non-violent direct action.
“If we’re not bold then we won’t have a usable planet in the next few decades,” she said. “The fact is we need action, we need it fast. This government has dragged its feet long enough. Whether it’s solar subsidies, making windfarms difficult or even actually supporting things like fracking, this government has actually gone in the wrong direction almost every time. So let’s hope they listen.”
Contacts from inside the building said announcements had been made over the internal public address system that entrances and exits were blocked and no one was able to enter or leave the department.
In a statement, Extinction Rebellion said: “The UK government, specifically BEIS, is promoting fracking – meeting with fracking companies more than 30 times in the last three years, compared to zero times with anti-fracking groups – despite massive local opposition.
“From Preston New Road (665 days now and counting) in Lancashire, to Kirby Misperton in North Yorkshire, to Horse Hill in Surrey, communities are coming together to fight against fracking.” ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/12/climate-activists-glue-hands-to-uk-government-building-in-new-protest

By mid-century greenhouse gas emissions would be slashed by 90% from 1990 levels under Spain’s draft climate change and energy transition law.
To do this, the country’s social democratic government is committing to installing at least 3,000MW of wind and solar power capacity every year in the next 10 years ahead.
New licences for fossil fuel drills, hydrocarbon exploitation and fracking wells, will be banned, and a fifth of the state budget will be reserved for measures that can mitigate climate change. This money will ratchet upwards from 2025.
Christiana Figueres, a former executive secretary of the UN’s framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC), hailed the draft Spanish law as “an excellent example of the Paris agreement”. She added: “It sets a long-term goal, provides incentives on scaling up emissions technologies and cares about a good transition for the workforce.”
Under the plan, “just transition” contracts will be drawn up, similar to the £220m package announced in October, that will shut most Spanish coalmines in return for a suite of early retirement schemes, re-skilling in clean energy jobs, and environmental restoration. These deals will be partly financed by auction returns from the sale of emissions rights.
The government has already scrapped a controversial “sun tax” that halted Spain’s booming renewables sector earlier this decade, and the new law will also mandate a 35% electricity share for green energy by 2030.
James Watson, chief executive of the SolarPower Europe trade association, said the law was “a wake-up call to the rest of the world”.
Energy efficiency will also be improved by 35% within 11 years, and government and public sector authorities will be able to lease only buildings that have almost zero energy consumption.
Laurence Tubiana, chief executive of the European Climate Foundation, and former French climate envoy who helped draft the Paris accord, described the agreement as groundbreaking and inspirational. “By planning on going carbon neutral, Spain shows that the battle against climate change is deadly serious, that they are ready to step up and plan to reap the rewards of decarbonisation,” she said.
However, the government’s hold on power is fragile. With just a quarter of parliamentary seats it will depend on the more leftwing Podemos and liberal Ciudadanos parties to pass the climate plan.
No dates were included in the legislation for phaseouts of coal or nuclear energy, and a ban on new cars with petrol or diesel engines was delayed until 2040.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/13/spain-plans-switch-100-renewable-electricity-2050

The draft report was prepared by the Nunavut government, and consists of submissions from Inuit community groups across Canada’s northernmost territory. Public consultations are set to start on Tuesday before the government unveils the final report later in the year.
“Inuit believe there are now so many bears that public safety has become a major concern,” said one section of the report, according to the Canadian Press. “Public safety concerns, combined with the effects of polar bears on other species, suggest that in many Nunavut communities, the polar bear may have exceeded the coexistence threshold.”
The renewed focus on polar bears comes after a tragic summer for the region: two people were killed by bears in separate attacks, including father Aaron Gibbons, who died protecting his children.
Researchers agree that polar bears represent a growing threat to Inuit communities, but say that is because climate change has pushed them closer to human settlements – not because the bear population is growing.
“There seems to be a divergence between scientists and Inuit on the threat that climate change poses to this species,” said Andrew Derocher, a polar bear researcher at the University of Alberta.
Scientists and conservation groups have warned that a warming climate has reduced sea ice and the availability of prey, pushing bears on to the mainland – and closer to humans.
But Inuit argue their own observations are often ignored, and the new report highlights a growing tension between scientific research and Inuit knowledge based on from thousands of years of living in the region.
“We know what we are doing, and western science and modelling has become too dominant,” wrote the Kitikmeot regional wildlife board as part of its submission to the report.
“Our knowledge, is not the same as thousands of years ago. If your life depended on it, you’d better know what the ice condition is,” said Gabriel Nirlungayuk, an Inuk hunter of Rankin Inlet. “Our knowledge has always evolved.”
Aerial surveys are often used by scientists to determine the population health of bears. But Nirlungayuk said that some of the best hunting conditions for polar bears are during stormy, foggy weather that grounds aircraft – when bears can sneak up closer to their prey. 
The polar bear hunt remains a critical and lucrative component of life in the northern communities. Hunters can receive as much as $10,000 for pelts, with residents parcelling up and sharing the meat for food. Canada has long resisted legislation that would terminate the harvest.
While Inuit and scientists disagree on the population of the bears, they both foresee problems in the future.
Derocher worries bears will continue to show up in communities, drawn in by numerous attractants – putting both humans and bears in harm’s way.
“We’ve been saying this for years: we’re going to have a lot more problem bears. And if we don’t get on top of it, we’re going to see a lot more issues coming down the road,” he said.
Nirlungayuk agrees. “We want to enjoy being out on the land with our families. But today, people need to carry a rifle all the time just to enjoy the great outdoors.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/13/polar-bear-numbers-canadian-arctic-inuit-controversial-report

Researchers found that violent crime is almost always more prevalent when temperatures are warmer in the winter months. The trend was especially strong when winters were mild in regions that usually have fierce winters, like the north-east and midwest.
The study has implications for how America reacts to climate change as the promise of a warming climate could therefore lead to rising crime levels.
Researchers compared crime and climate data from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting program and the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, covering 16,000 cities across the north-east, south-east, south central, west and midwest regions for the study published in GeoHealth.
The crime data covered the years 1979 to 2016.
“The relationship between climate, human interaction and crime that we’ve unveiled is something that will have an impact on people’s wellbeing,” said Ryan Harp, the lead author of the study and a doctoral candidate in the department of atmospheric and oceanic sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder.
The explanation is simple enough: warmer temperatures mean more people are out and about, creating the opportunity for crime.
In technical terms, three elements needed for a crime to occur – a motivated offender, a suitable target and the absence of a guardian such as a police officer – are more likely to come together when the weather is decent.
The link between warmer temperatures and crime all but disappears during the summer months, the study found. That finding cast doubt on an alternative theory, known as the temperature aggression hypothesis, which holds that heat causes stress which makes people more likely to commit crimes.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/13/climate-change-crime-rates-warmer-winters

Thanks To Reduced Solar Activity, We Could Be Heading For A Mini Ice Age In 2030

Even if a grand solar minimum occurred (itself a big ""if""), it would cause no more than 0.3C of cooling. As we're currently warming at 0.2C per decade, that merely offsets at best 15 years of warming.
And it would only temporary - when the solar minimum subsided, warming would accelerate again.

Chevron’s Gorgon LNG development in the Pilbara is considered a landmark development in carbon capture and storage, a long-promised technology to limit emissions from fossil fuels.
Under its agreement with the Western Australian government, the energy giant is required to capture 80% of emissions from an underwater gas field over a five-year period and inject them into a reservoir 2km under Barrow Island. The Minerals Council of Australia chief executive, Tania Constable, last month told ABC the project demonstrated that carbon capture and storage was “coming through very strongly”.
But nearly two years after the start of LNG production from the Gorgon gas field, emissions storage is yet to begin.
A Chevron spokeswoman said technical issues were identified in the commissioning of the storage project and modifications were under way. She said it was expected underground injection would begin by March.
The company said between 3.4m and 4m tonnes of carbon dioxide would be buried each year. It was estimated it would cut Gorgon’s total emissions – counting both fugitive emissions from gas wells and those released during production, when the gas is compressed into liquid form for export – by about 40%. The $2.5bn project is backed by $60m in federal government funding.
A new report has questioned whether the company expects the project to work. The analysis by research group the Australia Institute said Chevron has also applied – and been granted approval – to emit an average of 8.7m tonnes a year to 2020 under the government’s “safeguard mechanism”, part of the Tony Abbott-era Direct Action climate policy.
It said if the injection project does work Gorgon’s emissions would fall from between 8.5m and 10m tonnes to between 5.1m and 6m tonnes a year. The institute’s climate and energy program director, Richie Merzian, said by granting it a higher emissions limit the government was allowing Chevron to plan for the carbon storage project to fail.
Federal government data shows increased LNG production was the main reason national emissions rose by 6.8m tonnes in the year to March. The Australia Institute report suggests the delay at Gorgon’s carbon injection project played a central role, causing emissions equal to half that increase.
“Rather than holding Chevron to account, the Morrison government is giving it as much leniency as it possibly can,” Merzian said.
“It’s another example of the government’s inaction on climate change. If the government isn’t going to address LNG emissions, which is one of Australia’s fastest-growing sectors, then Australia has no hope of meeting its Paris target.”
LNG production in Australia has tripled since 2012, doubled in the two years to 2017 and is expected to grow another 18% this year. The related growth in emissions is projected to effectively wipe out carbon pollution avoided through the 23% renewable energy target.
The LNG industry is covered by the safeguard mechanism, which grants big industrial sites generous pollution limits, known as baselines. The baseline at Gorgon is drawn from Chevron’s projections of how much will be emitted in its biggest production year in the first five years of operation. The company can emit up to that baseline for free, but will have to buy carbon credits to offset any emissions above it. The baseline is expressed as 25m  tonnes over the three years to June 2020.
Merzian said the mechanism was next to useless while companies could nominate their own baseline. “It’s like allowing a taxpayer to nominate how much tax they want to pay,” he said.
Based on the cost of carbon credits under the government’s emissions reduction fund, Merzian estimates it would cost Chevron up to $52m a year if it was required to offset the pollution it had agreed to sequester but that is currently being released into the atmosphere.
Neither Chevron nor the federal environment minister, Melissa Price, answered directly when asked if Gorgon’s baseline implied the carbon storage project would not work.
A Chevron spokeswoman said the company had applied for a baseline in accordance with strict regulations overseen by the Clean Energy Regulator, a government agency.
A spokesman for Price said the baseline was calculated based on an audited forecast of emissions intensity and production at full capacity. “Businesses must manage their emissions and keep to [their] limit,” he said.
Price’s spokesman said LNG exports played a role in international emissions reduction efforts by providing a relatively low-emitting fuel source for electricity.
In WA, the Environment Protection Authority is investigating the agreement between the state and the company in light of the delay, including when the five-year period in which it has to bury 80% of fugitive emissions officially started.
After a tour of the Gorgon site in October, state environment minister, Stephen Dawson, was quoted in the West Australian saying he would give the company the “benefit of the doubt” that it would overcome the technical issues the storage project was facing.
The EPA is expected to report back by April. Dawson said it should be clear by then if the carbon injection project would work and whether Chevron could meet the target.
“Discussions will then need to commence on how Chevron can offset the portion not able to be sequestered,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/14/half-of-australias-emissions-increase-linked-to-was-gorgon-lng-plant

Nuclear is the single largest source of low-carbon electricity in the US. But a third of nuclear plants are unprofitable or scheduled to close, risking a rise in greenhouse gas emissions if they are replaced by coal or natural gas, a major Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) report has found.
US emissions could increase by as much as 6% if struggling plants are shuttered early, the report warns. This scenario has put pressure on many environmental groups to re-evaluate their intrinsic opposition to nuclear energy as a dangerous blight that must be eradicated.
“We are running out of time to make the emissions reductions needed to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis,” said Steve Clemmer, director of energy research for the UCS climate and energy program. “Losing a low-carbon source of electricity like nuclear power is going to make decarbonization even harder than it already is. Nuclear has risks, it’s not a perfect technology, but there have to be trade-offs.”
The US, like the rest of the world, faces a steep challenge to avoid the worst ravages of heatwaves, drought, extreme weather and flooding. The IPCC report states emissions must reach net zero by 2050 to avoid the most punishing climate change impacts, whereas the Trump administration is currently dismantling every major policy aimed at lowering emissions in the US.
The US has an ageing fleet of nearly 100 reactors at 60 nuclear plants, with many nearing the ends of their expected lifetimes. Five plants have shut down since 2013, with a further five set to shutter over the next eight years.
In total, a third of US nuclear power plants are set to close down or are unprofitable largely due to a major shift to cheaper natural gas. As nuclear provides more than half of the US’s low-carbon energy, this situation “raises serious concerns about our ability to achieve the deep cuts in carbon emissions needed to limit the worst impacts of climate change”, the UCS report states.
Replacements for nuclear will vary across the country. The huge Diablo Canyon plant in California, for example, will probably spawn a surge in renewable energy when it shuts in 2025. But in other states, such as Ohio and Pennsylvania, weak clean energy policies and the abundance of natural gas mean the closure of nuclear plants will probably raise emissions.
“Renewables can fill a lot of the gap but it’s a timing issue,” Clemmer said. “Over a long timeframe we can ramp up renewables and phase out coal, gas and nuclear generation but we don’t have that time. We have to cut half of all emissions by 2030, according to the IPCC. We can’t physically ramp up renewables fast enough.”
Anti-nuclear campaigning has been a foundational shibboleth for groups such as Greenpeace, which has pointed to disasters such as Chernobyl in 1986 and Fukushima in 2011 as evidence that the sector should be shut down.
While the UCS have never been militant opponents of nuclear power, Clemmer said “we are getting a bit more vocal” about the benefits of keeping plants open as the scale of the climate crisis has become clearer.
Many opponents remain implacable, however.
“Nuclear reactors are a bad bet for a climate strategy,” said Dr Gregory Jaczko, who was chairman of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission during the Obama administration. “The Union of Concerned Scientist models don’t reflect the reality of the United States electricity market. Renewables are getting cheaper faster than expected and are in some cases the least expensive source of electricity.”
Jaczko said new nuclear is a “financial boondoggle”, with investments better placed in solar or wind. “Employing nuclear for climate change is like Dorothy seeking the Wizard of Oz to get home,” he added. “It’s an expensive enticing mirage.”
Clemmer said he agreed that new nuclear plants are enormously expensive but said there was a case for the US government to invest around $814m a year to keep existing unprofitable plants online, given the cleaner energy they provide. “Environmental groups may come round to this, but I’m just not sure,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/14/closing-nuclear-plants-risks-rise-in-greenhouse-gas-emissions-report-warns

The motion put forward by Green party councillor Carla Denyer and passed on Tuesday means the city has the most ambitious emissions targets of the UK’s core cities group – with radical policy implications in the coming years.
The move was triggered by a UN report last month which said the world has just 12 years left to avoid catastrophic climate breakdown.
Denyer said: “This is a fantastic day for Bristol and I’m delighted the council will be bringing forward its target for making the city carbon neutral by 2030.
She said the UN report made it clear that “time to preserve Earth as we know it is running out”.
“We can’t wait for the UN or national governments to negotiate when we have just 12 years to act – we have to show how it’s done and commit to ambitious action at the level of cities, which we did this evening.”
The target is much more radical than the UK government’s national target of an 80% reduction in emissions by 2050 and comes amid growing concern about interlinked ecological crisis, from climate breakdown to extinction.
In a sign of the growing frustration about lack of action, thousands of people are expected to take part in civil disobedience in the UK this weekend as part of the Extinction Rebellion campaign.
Denyer said that the Bristol declaration could see a focus on renewable electricity, carbon neutral buildings, congestion charges and investment in clean transport infrastructure.
It could also have far-reaching implications for big-ticket projects like the proposed expansion of Bristol airport.
“It will mean viewing all policy decisions through their impact on greenhouse gas emissions,” she added.
Denyer said that although there would be changes for residents, they would lead to wider benefits.
“It should be possible to achieve while maintaining the same or even improved quality of life, because changes that reduce carbon dioxide emissions often also address inequality, public health, air quality, etc.
“For example, encouraging active travel and public transport – that would reduce congestion as well as improving health outcomes by reducing air pollution and increasing uptake of cycling and walking.”
The move was inspired by US cities such as Berkeley and Hoboken, and the global C40 cities which have all set ambitious emissions targets.
Jonathan Bartley, the co-leader of the Green party, said Bristol’s decision – which won cross-party support on the council – had set “a gold standard on climate action”.
“With the UN warning we have just 12 years to limit climate catastrophe this is the common-sense policymaking we need to face the future.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/nov/14/bristol-plans-to-become-carbon-neutral-by-2030

Abstract We used a database capturing large wildfires (> 405 ha) in the western U.S. to document regional trends in fire occurrence, total fire area, fire size, and day of year of ignition for 1984–2011. Over the western U.S. and in a majority of ecoregions, we found significant, increasing trends in the number of large fires and/or total large fire area per year. Trends were most significant for southern and mountain ecoregions, coinciding with trends toward increased drought severity. For all ecoregions combined, the number of large fires increased at a rate of seven fires per year, while total fire area increased at a rate of 355 km2 per year. Continuing changes in climate, invasive species, and consequences of past fire management, added to the impacts of larger, more frequent fires, will drive further disruptions to fire regimes of the western U.S. and other fire‐prone regions of the world.

Beginning in the mid-1980s, forest wildfire activity in western US forests underwent an abrupt and sustained regional increase, with nearly two-thirds of that increase concentrated in forests of the Northern US Rocky Mountains between 42° and 50° N latitude [1]. This change in Northern US Rocky Mountain forest wildfire has been linked to climatic factors such as warmer temperatures, dry summers, below-average winter precipitation or earlier spring snowmelt [1–4]... A changing climate consequently alters forest fuels characteristics across multiple time horizons.

We demonstrate that human-caused climate change caused over half of the documented increases in fuel aridity since the 1970s and doubled the cumulative forest fire area since 1984.

But what the report didn’t add, leaving it instead to Neil Young’s website, was that climate change cares even less. As President Trump took time out of his busy schedule protecting his hair and insulting the French to blame poor forest management, Young laid it on the line: “As a matter of fact this is not a forest fire that rages on as I write this. We are vulnerable because of climate change.”
In the early stages of the climate crisis, it often felt as if the opposite were true: floods, droughts and heatwaves were always somewhere else’s problem, usually the global south, where they could be chalked up to some pre-existing vulnerability, in a shoulder-shrugging: “OK, so earthquakes aren’t great, but if they’d had better building regulations …” Times moved on. This year, the global heatwave was so pronounced that even habitual climate sceptics – the Sun newspaper, for example – felt moved to point out that the world appeared to be on fire.
Yet nothing brings the environment closer to home than when it affects people who seem a world away, people such as Miley Cyrus and Cher, who you can’t imagine facing any problem more serious than which diamond shoes to pack. If they can’t escape this reality, then it must be real. Right?
If Young was the first celebrity to explicitly name the new normal, there is a distinctive tone to most of the statements: an outpouring not of loss, but of care for the rest of the community, notably, those who have died; statements of gratitude to firefighters; a recognition of what is important – pets, loved ones and other people – versus what is not – bricks, mortar and money. Cyrus and her parter, Liam Hemsworth, have donated $500,000 (£384,000) to victims of the fire. I have no idea what that represents as a proportion of their wealth; still, it’s an unusual and laudable thing, if your first thought, in the face of the charred remains of everything you own, is to give more away.
In short, this is a vivid inflection point in the world’s journey, like a public information film about climate change. If all the money in the world won’t protect you, what is the endpoint of any equation where profit is pitted against the environment? If every star’s first thought is of the people they love, and even Robin Thicke’s second thought is of people he only barely knows (“It’s a great community, it’s a community of wonderful people, a lot of parents whose kids go to the same school as my kid. It’s just devastating”), there is a parable here about priorities, and the hierarchy of needs, and the fundamental nourishment of the human spirit, and it’s delivered – unbelievably – by the people with the best tunes. The devil must be spitting feathers; he thought he had those guys sewn up.
Climate-change denial is dangerous, not because it has major governments by the throat, but because it is shameless: it will reject the facts on a page, and the evidence before its own eyes. It will blame anyone but the real culprits, and marshal that blame to suit a narrative of scarcity and threat. But there does come a point when rhetoric runs out of road, is swallowed up by a more awesome spectacle; the authentic human response to the bite of a reality that can’t be denied for ever.

The Seminole Springs mobile home park, a co-op of 215 small lakeside homes tucked into the canyon between Malibu and Agoura Hills, was on the warpath of the most destructive fire to ever hit Los Angeles and Ventura counties.
By the early morning on Friday last week, flames were quickly billowing toward them.
“The way the smoke was coming you just knew it was on the other side of the hill and about to jump,” he say. His wife was ready with essentials packed. “I never thought we would burn here,” he said. “So, I just grabbed my surfboard” and left many other possessions behind.
But before the day was through on Friday, half the neighborhood would be gone, leveled into ash and metal, foundations and car-frames.
Referred to as a “hidden gem” by those who live there, most outsiders – even southern California locals – didn’t know the Seminole Springs neighborhood existed until an aerial view of the Woolsey fire caught by a local TV helicopter showed what was left behind.
Roughly 100 small homes, which had once been closely clustered together in the canyon, had been reduced to rubble.
Lots of people here consider one another family.
That’s why the broadcast footage haunted residents. “I probably looked at that screenshot 100 times trying to figure out [who was spared],” Kelly said. “I could see my neighbor’s house, but I couldn’t really see mine. It was killing us, my wife and I.”
By Saturday the president of the park had called – his home was safe. But in a tight-knit community like this, the relief couldn’t be fully felt, as neighbors suffered.
“I didn’t know my place was there for sure, until I saw it with my own eyes,” he said, explaining why he evaded blockades set by the authorities and returned to the evacuated area over the weekend. “We came over the little hill and I saw it and … I couldn’t believe it. I got so overwhelmed with emotion. Just to see all the devastation.”
Most members of the mobile home park, which was built in 1969, had lived there for years, raising their families together. It was the kind of place no one wants to leave, once they snag a spot. Initially constructed as a senior community, over the last few decades Seminole had begun to welcome families with children and recently, the 215 units were filled by a mixture of old and young. 
The Seminole Springs website shows brightly colored kayaks adorning the shore, trails that lead past the lake into the green hillsides overlooking the community. There’s a pool, a BBQ area, and a lounge.
“It was a gem,” Kelly said. “And it will be again. We hope.”
Kelly adds: “In my opinion because we are a community of 215 families and homes –and we have been here for 40 years – we should have been a priority, rather than saving the big fancy homes built way in the middle of nowhere.”
The Woolsey fire, which is still burning across more than 97,620 acres near Malibu in southern California, is 47% contained after six days of an around-the-clock firefight.
The Los Angeles county fire chief, Daryl Osby, said the battle against this giant blaze, which has now scorched an area larger than the city of Denver, has been the most difficult he’s seen in his 35-year career.
 So far, it has consumed more than 435 structures, a number officials say is likely to rise as damage crews finish their assessments.
“I feel bad that we lost any homes,” Osby told the Guardian. Though he didn’t know the specifics of the Seminole Springs fire, he said it was something he would assess in the coming months when officials study the fire’s progression.
“We did the best we could,” he adds, emphasizing that their teams had to use the limited resources they had to focus on saving lives. “I think we were successful at that objective, preventing death. Unfortunately, it was at the expense of people’s homes.”
Carol Ornelas’s home was perhaps the last one that burned before the fire moved past the neighborhood. She lived in one of the few decimated houses in the lower-part of the park. Her three best friends, who live in the upper-part of Seminole Springs, all lost their homes.
“We all moved there to be in the same place. But now it’s unbelievable,” she said. “Usually, if something terrible happens to one of your friends you can all rally to help that person – but it is all four of us.”
﻿Now she is resting with a friend and trying not to focus on the negatives. Ornelas had just moved her 94-year-old mother into an assisted living facility, and had recently brought all her family’s keepsakes to her Seminole Springs unit. She and her husband, a drummer, also had the only photo of him playing for Sonny and Cher hanging on the wall. Nothing could be recovered from the wreckage.
“They are just things,” she said, “but they are things that we absolutely can never replace. Things that are not valuable so to speak, but they are the things I wanted to have forever. That’s the worst part – losing the things you can’t replace.”
Houston Waye, a new resident who moved into Seminole Springs in February, left on Thursday evening to ensure his wife, animals, and two-year-old baby were out safely, but he returned on Friday afternoon, avoiding blocked roads by hiking in through a back route. In the first scramble to get out, he’d barely brought any of his own things. “I had two dogs, a cat, a tortoise and a two-year-old,” he said.
By the time he returned, most of the damage was done. But he and others worked to ensure the smoldering patches wouldn’t reignite. The homes on the edge, between the line of saved homes and burned ones, were ablaze when he arrived. Waye and a neighbor who stayed through the ordeal used hoses to put them out.
“This will bring out the best in a lot of people,” their neighbor Brandon Rubin said, calling helpful residents heroes. His was one of the homes still standing, but as someone who both grew up in Seminole Springs and who returned to live there with his girlfriend, receiving the news was “one of the most bittersweet things you can imagine”, he said.
“There are faces to all those homes that you see gone,” he said. “Close to 100 homes were lost. That is a lot of people in trouble. ”
But, he is certain they will rebuild – and they will do it together.
“Like any community it’s not perfect. But we all love each other. We are all there for each other,” he said, adding: “the stuff is gone. But we are here.

An enduring popular myth suggests that in the 1970s the climate science community was predicting “global cooling” and an “imminent” ice age, an observation frequently used by those who would undermine what climate scientists say today about the prospect of global warming. A review of the literature suggests that, on the contrary, greenhouse warming even then dominated scientists' thinking as being one of the most important forces shaping Earth's climate on human time scales. More importantly than showing the falsehood of the myth, this review describes how scientists of the time built the foundation on which the cohesive enterprise of modern climate science now rests.

You could probably find predictions for every eventuality by surveying past media articles. It proves nothing.

Any country can generate hydrogen today at a cost approximately half that of imported fossil fuels, at about 5-6c per km travelled. Yes we need more refueling stations. Yes we need more investment by governments for these refueling stations, because manufacturers will only produce 100,000 cars per year (the level at which these cars reach the same price as IC engines) if there is sufficient refueling in place - and manufacturers are unlikely to start becoming refueling companies with the initial risks and difficulty of being a fuel-providing company; as well as a battery manufacturer, on top of what they used to do: make cars.
So we need to understand not just how stupid politicians are for not doing what they should do > but exactly what it is they should do and how they should do it; at a cost that is not unbearable and with a whole list of economic advantages. Ample evidence exists from the electric utility industry associations and transmission system operators that decarbonising - ie moving away from fossil fuels - will not be difficult. This is because in most cases renewables are already cheaper, and the business case will only improve. However, as they make abundantly clear: only one option exists to enable load-following where each day electricity demand rises and falls on a regular basis - and that is 'power-to-gas', or hydrogen. This involves linking the electric and gas utility grids.
Now, what has recently happened (or is happening) in Europe is that electricity prices are being deregulated on the consumer-side, meaning that when demand is high, prices increase. This also means that night-time and peak solar output will be very low price; and this will easily allow power-to-gas to become competitive - even today, even with current prices and anywhere where there is a need for it and it can replace natural gas. This is momentous news. Hydrogen has suddenly become as cheap if not cheaper than imported fossil gas.
So we need to educate ourselves, and by extension educate our leaders and representatives - not just sit and whine or become locked in endless confrontation within the absence of legitimate alternatives to the current system. 
Yes its true, governments generally make very poor decisions and often produce results that are not only the most destructive, but are also the most costly to the consumer, as they unerringly favour big business, large corporations and those that supply them with money (or who they 'think' supplies them with money).
The truth is; we need to be able to supply better answers than the competition. Which is why there is a strong, concerted resistance to alternative fuel energy, and many industries don't want to do the work of realising a system in any way different to the one we have.
But mark my words: the only way to effectively replace fossil fuels is via hydrogen - and this goes not only for transport, or some niche transport applications - this is for energy storage translated into industry heat processes, residential heating and in fact anywhere that uses natural gas today. Eurelectric put the figure at about 15-20% of all EU energy needs by about 2050.

Governments are happy to endorse O&G lobby groups' wishes because these companies give a lot of money to them. This is why its taking so long to move towards the cheaper option of hydrogen. 
(Even in Montana, the 100-year law on campaign financing was recently overturned. Thankfully a subsequent court case overthrew what was in effect a commercially-funded representative tasked with doing whatever they said. However, this is not the case everywhere.)
Lets not forget that politicians think they are cleverer than everybody else.
Just to go through this slowly: we know fossil fuels are the problem. We also know that fuel is required for industry, heating and most importantly; transport. We also know that the fossil fuel lobby and governments are in many cases one and the same thing, given both a) how much of an impact fuel cost & availability has on the economy b) how much 'legitimate' subsidies and also 'irregular' subsidies are given to these companies to continue and expand their operations.
Politicians are made to feel like oil and gas are the only option; they are the primary driver of any economy; they are the only option for most sectors needing energy and nothing else is ever going to work/or requires excessive subsidies.
All these lies are paid for and bolstered by a very well-paid group of professionals that in some cases believe (some) of the lies they are paid to circulate; and in other cases are aware that their actions are purely to effect the bottom line of their employer - and the many shareholders who ask for these fat margins, and somehow wish to keep the myth of oil & gas profitability alive.

That was for context. You are really a piece of work...I am not denying climate change as a variable. I am simply suggesting climate change is one of many variables, yet one of the most crucial variables you cast aside is available fuels (the point of the first paper...meaningless to you for some reason). You're hung up on aridity (a key variable) but just as key is amount of fuel driven fire frequency (i.e. area burn frequency historically, but suppression strategy now), land use, (grazing, logging etc.). 
So I love now how all of sudden only a tiny part of the globe is in question. I thought climate change is a global issue? Is it only impacting California in terms of fires? Can you post another link to prove that link boy?

My point here is that fossil fuel companies are outrageously and disproportionately responsible for the current situation, and that the general public have diminished responsibility as a result.
If fossil fuel companies were extracting, selling and marketing fossil fuels, and even engaging in political lobbying alone, that would be one thing. We might still have a general populace that understand the scientific consensus on climate change, and would be able to make personal and political decisions based on that.
However fossil fuel companies have misused their status as the most profitable industry on Earth to manufacture false doubt amongst the general public, not through marketing but through black, darkly-funded propaganda. They have skewed their political funding almost-exclusively conservative, imprinting an entire political identity with an antagonism they did not previously hold towards climate change, and taking advantage of increasing partisanship.

No argument that marketing messages guide consumers. This is what they are meant to do.
People who benefit from oil consumption don’t fear the consequences of climate change because they don’t have to. Their profit from consumers will make possibly living free of the consequences, while consumers suffer them, and if they didn't profit obscenely from the irresponsible consumption they do promote aggressively, oil company executives and shareholders will also worry about climate change.
Because consumers have the most to lose and they can reduce consumption, they have the responsibility to reduce consumption and minimize the consequences of climate change, which cannot be stopped by anybody.

You're right about what oil companies have done and do, what every successful company does, whatever generates the most profit quickest. If law impedes progress, they change the law. Nothing new. No secrets revealed.
BQEND
It is illustrative that you place no moral limits on the behaviour of fossil fuel companies, and place the full responsibility on consumers.
No matter, your argument is tautological - ""the morality of the actions of fossil fuel companies is irrelevant because this is what fossil fuel companies do"" to which I might as well respond that the morality of consumers is irrelevant because this is what consumers do.
This is a transparent attempt to normalise the outrageous 30+ year campaign, involving untold amounts of money that has successfully led the general public to believe that there is no scientific consensus on global warming and includes financing politicians who attack the livelihoods of individual scientists (often cheered on by fossil fuel executives), use their opaquely-financed think-tanks to accuse the scientific community of widescale fraud (propaganda most recently repeated by the US President), and in some cases directly pervert the scientific process itself, all while contradicting their own private research into the dangers of global warming.
BQSTART
Everyone makes, individually, decisions about oil consumption, to use a little or more than a little gasoline, electricity, heating oil, stuff made of plastic.
BQEND
As has already been explained to you the ability of consumers to make choices about fossil fuels has been undermined by (a) widescale black propaganda designed to miseducate the general public on the scientific consensus and (b) decades of political campaigning to undermine any action on transitioning to 
BQSTART
Blaming the consequences of your decisions, climate change, on oil companies make you feel good, instead of guilty.
BQEND
This is a moot point since you have simply ignored the mechanisms by which fossil fuel companies undermine those decisions.
BQSTART
Allowing decisions to be influenced by advertising, TV commercials and T-shirt logos is on you, if you allow this.
BQEND
None of the arguments I have made against fossil fuel companies involve common-or-gardener advertising. You are creating a strawman.
BQSTART
Blaming oil companies for influencing your decision-making is a sop. Are you unable to find facts and be guided by facts rather than marketing messages?
BQEND
Fossil fuel companies have spent billions on black propaganda because propaganda is effective against facts, otherwise they would have not spent that money. The proof is in the miseducation of the general public - fossil fuel companies are the most profitable industry on Earth and they have spent decades to convince the general public, via black propaganda not upfront adverstising, that there is no scientific consensus on global warming and they have been successful.
Your argument appears to be that the general public, who have been subjected to this sophisticated manipulation over several decades, should simply ""snap out of it"". This is magical thinking designed to shift blame away from those most responsible for the current inaction.
BQSTART
Should oil companies and any of the other destructive companies, like Amazon, Facebook, Google and Walmart, stop what all companies do, sell aggressively to generate profit, and instead ignore their primary responsibility and lead you down a path that you could lead yourself down?

Do they contradict anything mountainrunnermum posted?
BQEND
I thought you were well-read on this. I guess not... Let me help you.
From the IPCC - SR15 published a month ago....re: floods...
BQSTART
In summary, streamflow trends since 1950 are non-statistically significant in most of the world’s largest 27 rivers (high confidence), while flood frequency and extreme streamflow increased in some regions (high 28 confidence).
BQEND
Also from IPCC SR15 regarding TCs
BQSTART
There is consequently low confidence in the larger number of 9 studies reporting increasing trends in the global number of very intense cyclones.
BQEND
Lastly from the IPCC SR15 regarding droughts....
BQSTART
The AR5 assessed that there was low confidence in the attribution of global changes in droughts (Bindoff et al., 2013a) and did not provide assessments for the attribution of regional changes in droughts (Bindoff et al., 2013a). The recent literature does not suggest a necessary revision of this assessment, except in the Mediterranean region.
BQEND
Finally, from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Lab that's part of NOAA (I stated above NASA...I meant NOAA, apologies). From the link below...
BQSTART
While major hurricanes (Figure 3, red curve) show more evidence of a rising trend from the late 1800s, the major hurricane data are considered even less reliable than the other two records in the early parts of the record. Category 4-5 hurricanes show a pronounced increase since the mid-1940s (Bender et al., 2010) but again, we consider that these data need to be carefully assessed for data inhomogeneity problems before such trends can be accepted as reliable.
BQEND
and...
BQSTART
We find that, after adjusting for such an estimated number of missing storms, there remains just a small nominally positive upward trend in tropical storm occurrence from 1878-2006. Statistical tests indicate that this trend is not significantly distinguishable from zero (Figure 2). In addition, Landsea et al. (2010) note that the rising trend in Atlantic tropical storm counts is almost entirely due to increases in short-duration (<2 day) storms alone. Such short-lived storms were particularly likely to have been overlooked in the earlier parts of the record, as they would have had less opportunity for chance encounters with ship traffic.

As they say, been there, done that - I get what you're saying. Nonetheless, all across the rural landscape, Main Street U.S.A. is dying and the young are leaving the old behind. It didn't have to be this way, but it is. All we hear about these days are the wrongs and bads and evils of the people who killed our jobs, our dreams, our security, our families and our towns. It seems so hopeless, so tragic and so wrong it makes us weep with anger. And yet... not all rural towns have died. Some rural communities, a tiny number to be sure, but still some communities are thriving. Do you not wonder at the reason that we never hear these success stories on the news? Shouldn't success in rural America be front page news everywhere? Obviously, my own community is one of those successes. 30 years ago our town started dying. Instead of dying quietly, the death throes sparked a war. It was a horrible war too, for it pitted old timers against newcomers, the educated against the un-educated, the rich against the poor, men against women, the young against the old and the resource extraction industries, ranchers and farmers against each other and the environmentalists as well. Our war was expensive - we threw tens of millions of tax dollars against death and death kept on winning. Our war lasted more than ten years. That's how long it took to figure out what was killing our community. When we discovered the disease causing our decline, we could not believe we had not seen it before. As the old saying goes, we had been treating the symptoms, not the disease. But once we knew the disease, we could treat it. The disease that kills rural communities was a remedy designed for problems that plague big cities - big, big cities. By applying that remedy to our little rural town, we had almost killed it. We had to laugh at our stupidity; believe it or not, we had tried to attract businesses by building suburbs around our tiny, little rural town. Oh my, how stupid we were back then. The name of the disease is ""zoning"". In big cities, zoning protects residents from industrial waste products by separating the different land uses. But separating residents and businesses in small towns, destroyed the economic eco-system that kept them alive. Simply put, to kill the factory, the mines, oil fields, foresting trade and pesticide laden agricultural fields in our town, was to kill our own jobs and our community along with it. We’d all have clean air and water and starve to death because we did not have a job and so, we fought to keep our jobs. When we replaced zoning with something called form-based-codes, our war ended. Instead of the community that zoning had forced us to build, we had time and money to start building the community we wanted for ourselves. Turns out nerds really liked our lifestyle and young families kept moving here, bringing all kinds of innovations with them. More importantly, our young people aren’t leaving anymore. They go away to college and return to build their lives here. 20 years after our not-always-so-civil war ended, our town is thriving. Yesterday, I drove down Main Street and saw the old hardware store is undergoing renovation – another big tech company is moving in. 30 jobs they say offering over $100,000.00 a year salaries. Across the tracks, our new hospital is finished. At my job, we remember a time when we sat around with no customers at all. For the last three years, we’ve been booked three weeks straight all the time. John – no one is going to bring success stories to you. You won’t hear about them on the news.

while AGW is a variable in wildfires, there are many other variables that contribute to recent events, such as a century of effective suppression.
BQEND
Climate change is the largest contributor to exacerbated wildfire in the American west, according to the science:
BQSTART
Fuel aridity has been a dominant driver of regional and subregional interannual variability in forest fire area across the western US in recent decades (2, 8, 22, 25). This study capitalizes on these relationships and specifically seeks to determine the portions of the observed increase in fuel aridity and area burned across western US forests attributable to anthropogenic climate change. 
The interannual variability of all eight fuel aridity metrics averaged over the forested lands of the western US correlated significantly (R2 = 0.57–0.76, P < 0.0001; Table S1) with the logarithm of annual western US forest area burned for 1984–2015, derived from the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity product for 1984–2014 and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for 2015 (Supporting Information). The record of standardized fuel aridity averaged across the eight metrics (hereafter, all-metric mean) accounts for 76% of the variance in the burned-area record, with significant increases in both records for 1984–2015 (Fig. 1). Correlation between fuel aridity and forest fire area remains highly significant (R2 = 0.72, all-metric mean) after removing the linear-least squares trends for each time series for 1984–2015, supporting the mechanistic relationship between fuel aridity and forest fire area. It follows that co-occurring increases in fuel aridity and forest fire area over multiple decades would also be mechanistically related.

Again, almost everyone needs to travel - far fewer people need a personal vehicle with an internal combustion engine.
Fossil fuel companies have spent several decades and untold amounts of money convincing consumers that fossil fuels are safe, by misrepresenting the scientific consensus on climate change. The misinformed general public therefore has diminished responsibility for owning a car with an internal combustion engine. Remember, fossil fuel companies did not spent all this money on propaganda because it does not work in reducing fears that consumers have about their products.
Fossil fuel companies finance politicians and political campaigns that block meaningful action on climate change and this includes the transition to low-carbon transport of all kinds, leaving many people with little or not option but to purchase a car with an internal combustion engine.
If black propaganda has convinced people that fossil fuels are safe, and if lobbying by fossil fuel companies has left consumers with no alternative options for travel, then the resulting demand for those fossil fuels are absolutely the responsibility of fossil fuel companies.

This change in Northern US Rocky Mountain forest wildfire has been linked to climatic factors such as warmer temperatures, dry summers, below-average winter precipitation or earlier spring snowmelt [1–4]...

For those who actually care about the survival of the human race, the key questions now should be obvious: is there any reason to hope that we will retreat from “drill baby drill” and enact a sane set of climate policies? Or is our country – and, by extension, our species – just going to give up?
Before answering, it is worth reviewing exactly what happened over these last few months, because the election illustrates how little the fossil fuel industry is willing to concede in the face of a genuine crisis. While the dominant media narrative has been about Democratic voters euphorically electing a House majority and yelling a primal scream at Donald Trump, the loudest shriek of defiance was the one bellowed by oil and gas CEOs. As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that we have only 12 years to ward off an ecological disaster, those oil and gas executives’ message to Planet Earth was unequivocal: drop dead.
That message was most explicit in Colorado, where a drilling and fracking boom is happening in the middle of fast-growing suburbs. With oil and gas companies seeking to put noxious derricks and rigs near population centers, local activists backed a ballot measure called Proposition 112 that aimed to make sure new fossil fuel infrastructure is set a bit farther away from schools, hospitals, residential neighborhoods and water sources.
The initiative was an angry response to a state government so awash in fossil fuel campaign cash that it has blocked legislation to merely allow regulators to prioritize the health and safety of residents when those regulators issue permits for drilling and fracking.
According to an industry analysis, Proposition 112 would have left much of the oil and gas reserves near Denver accessible for extraction, but yes, it is true – at a time when climate scientists say we must keep fossil fuel deposits in the ground, there was a chance the initiative would have stopped some extraction.
The oil and gas industry could have looked across a Colorado ravaged by climate-intensified wildfires, droughts and floods and decided to accept the modest measure, knowing that the initiative is the absolute minimum that is required at this perilous moment. Instead, fossil fuel companies did the opposite: they poured $40m into opposing Proposition 112 and spreading insidious agitprop.
Despite scientists warning that fracked natural gas threatens to worsen climate change, oil and gas operatives in the state promoted cartoonishly dishonest claims that burning fossil fuel “is cleaning our air and improving health”. As Colorado’s local media effectively erased the term “climate change” from its election coverage, the industry managed to defeat the measure by outspending its proponents 40-to-1. In the process, fossil fuel companies’ scorched-earth campaign was a clear statement that in the face of an environmental cataclysm, oil and gas moguls will not accept even a tiny reduction in their revenues.
In the Pacific north-west and the south-west, it was a similar tale.
In Washington State, petroleum giants funneled $25m into defeating a proposal to require polluters to pay some of the costs of the climate change havoc they are wreaking. The measure, which would have assessed a $15 fee for every ton of greenhouse gases they emit, was beaten with 56% of the vote, after the industry’s ad campaign featured criticism from a former state attorney general – who viewers weren’t told now works at Chevron’s law firm. In all, $13m of the funding against the measure came from BP – a company that simultaneously claims to unsuspecting consumers that it supports a carbon tax.
In sun-baked Arizona, you may have thought solar energy would be a fairly easy pitch. However, after the owner of the state’s major energy provider poured nearly $30m into the election, Arizonans soundly rejected a ballot initiative to force the utility to get more of its power from renewable sources.
Meanwhile, in a single California county, the fossil fuel industry spent a whopping $8m to defeat a citizens’ initiative to ban new drilling and fracking.
Realizing that they may have overreached, some fossil fuel industry spokespeople are now telling lawmakers that oil and gas companies really do want to work collaboratively on environmental issues. However, their behavior in the election proved that the industry is not operating in good faith. Oil and gas CEOs showed that they will gladly accelerate the climate crisis if doing so allows them to rake in more money.
And make no mistake about it: the industry’s roughly $100m in campaign spending this year was not just about one individual election cycle. It was a shock-and-awe spectacle designed to intimidate any prospective campaigns, organizations and movements that want to challenge the political supremacy of oil and gas – and some prominent Democrats in Washington seem to be cowering in fear.
Always nervous about the donor class and about electoral blowback from Republicans, some congressional Democrats now seem intent on avoiding any direct confrontation over climate change policy.
Indeed, days before the election, the Hill newspaper surveyed lawmakers and major environmental groups, and found that “Democrats are unlikely to pursue major climate change legislation if they win the House majority, despite a growing body of evidence suggesting time is running out to address the issue.”
As her own state was being incinerated by climate-intensified wildfires, the House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi, faced pressure for climate action from new lawmakers like New York Representative-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez – but Pelosi would only commit to reviving a moribund congressional committee to study the issue. The conflict-averse posture follows the party recently rescinding its policy of rejecting fossil fuel campaign cash, as well as Democratic Representative Vicente Gonzalez of climate-ravaged Texas setting up a new Oil &amp; Gas Caucus to promote the “economic benefits of fully harnessing the country’s natural resources”.
Taken together, these developments – coupled with the Trump administration’s opposition to any serious climate policy – have left many voters and activists feeling despondent, even in the aftermath of a “blue wave” election. As former Bernie Sanders campaign aide Claire Sandberg tweeted: “Entire towns are burning to nothing in California. People are being incinerated alive in their cars attempting to flee. But a majority of Democrats still won’t reject fossil fuel money, and no one has put forward a climate plan that is remotely commensurate with the IPCC findings.”
And yet, amid the thick smoke of wildfires and industry propaganda, there is still reason to believe that our children are not guaranteed to live in a real-life version of Mad Max: Fury Road. Our fate is not – yet – sealed, as long as those who want humanity to survive pay attention to exactly what science, the fossil fuel industry and the political trends are telling us, and then act accordingly in the arenas where immediate progress is most likely.
First and foremost, there are now 14 states that have the trifecta of Democratic control of the governorship and both legislative chambers. Those include major fossil fuel producing states such as Colorado, New Mexico and California. Democratic leaders in these states cannot claim that climate inaction is a product of Republican intransigence – the Democrats in these locales have uninhibited power. And so if activists work to hold these local Democratic lawmakers accountable, there is a good chance they can force legislatures to enact emissions standards, renewable energy mandates and other environmental rules that will bolster the fight against climate change.
Similarly, states and cities collectively control trillions dollars of public pension money that can be marshaled for the battle. Shifting that cash out of oil and gas can at once provide more capital for renewable energy and drain fossil fuel companies of resources they need for their extraction binge.
Officials like New York comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, incoming Connecticut treasurer Shawn Wooden and North Carolina treasurer Dale Folwell may be unknown compared with the average backbench senator on the Sunday chat shows, but they and their colleagues who control these massive war chests have an enormous amount of divestment power that can both support the climate change fight, and boost investment returns for retirees. There’s a good chance that at least some of them can be spurred to action if they are no longer permitted to toil in obscurity, and instead face consistent grassroots pressure.
The courts are another arena where the climate fight seems to be accelerating. There, teenagers are mounting a landmark case arguing that the government’s refusal to restrict carbon emissions is endangering the next generation’s constitutional right to life, liberty and property. A federal judge also just blocked the Keystone XL pipeline, saying that the Trump administration had improperly “discarded prior factual findings related to climate change”.
At the same time, state attorneys general are pursuing a lawsuit examining whether the oil industry deliberately buried science that showed the dangers of climate change. Those cases, which bring even more pressure on the industry, can be supported by concurrent hearings and subpoenas from the low-profile House science committee, which is expected to be chaired by Texas Democratic Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson, who has called for more aggressive action on climate change.
So, considering both the election setbacks and opportunities, let’s go back to those original questions: is there reason to hope or are we just going to give up? The answer is contingent on our ability to focus in an age of distraction.
Will those who truly care about the survival of humanity muster the discipline to occasionally look away from the Washington DC garbage fire and focus more activism on the state and local level? Will a media that obsesses over Trump’s tweets find the will to more diligently cover a climate crisis that threatens the planet? Will our political class behold the fossil fuel industry’s sociopathy and realize that we face an existential choice between profits and ecological survival?
In short, will we as a society finally start treating this emergency as an actual emergency?
If the answer is yes, then there is still reason to believe we are not doomed – but we better get to work, because there’s no time to spare.

The Ai Group has used its submission to flag major problems with the proposal, ranging from its “extremely aggressive” administrative timetable, with projects being drummed up before the next federal election; a lack of obvious “strong independent governance” arrangements, and the lack of an overarching climate and energy policy.
The criticism joins significant pushback from Australia’s power companies, and from lobby groups representing renewable energy, reflecting profound frustration in the business community about the way the Coalition has conducted itself on climate and energy policy.
Only the lobby group representing Australia’s resources giants, the Minerals Council of Australia has, thus far, lent public support to the initiative.
The Ai Group says an underwriting program to encourage new generation is reasonable in theory, but if it is not well designed then taxpayers are exposed to significant risks, generators can be shielded from market pressures, and special treatment for some generators can deter investment outside the program.
It notes the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission proposed an underwriting program with a low price floor of $45-50 per megawatt hour “that would be unlikely to expose the Commonwealth to much financial risk” – but the Morrison government has ignored those parameters and is pursuing options that “carry much greater risks”.
The submission notes the underwriting program is being carried out in a policy vacuum. The government has indicated generation projects supported through the new underwriting mechanism would need to conform with an objective to reduce electricity emissions by 26% below its 2005 levels by 2030.
But Ai Group says this is an “inadequate approach to integrating emissions and energy policy”. It says generation assets operate for decades “and emissions targets for 2030 – 12 years away – are not an adequate basis for consideration”.
It says Australia has signed up to the Paris targets, and there is “no reason to think that applying a pro-rata – 26% target to the electricity sector is sufficient or efficient”.
“There are strong arguments that deeper reductions in electricity emissions are cheaper and more practical than pro rata reductions across more challenging sectors,” the submission says.
It calls on the Morrison government – which has abandoned emissions reduction after the internal furore over the national energy guarantee – to set a sectoral or economy-wide emissions policy framework to help guide future investment decisions.
“Our strongly preferred solution to this uncertainty is for all sides of politics across the commonwealth and the states to agree an efficient, pro-competitive, stable and scalable framework for integrating climate and energy policy”.
“In the absence of such a framework, government can try to support investment by guaranteeing it against policy risks. But this support may be very expensive, difficult to sustain and insufficiently credible to attract investment”.
Ai Group says the governance arrangements for the scheme are completely unclear, and a process where proposals are considered by the Department of the Environment and Energy, “with possible ad hoc appointment of outside experts on certain matters, and decided on by the minister for energy with, presumably, Cabinet consideration” raises several concerns.
The energy minister, Angus Taylor, has flagged underwriting new coal projects under the scheme, and the possible indemnification of projects from the future risk of a carbon price.
Speculation is rife around the energy sector that the government underwriting proposal will ultimately centre on an extension of the Vales Point power station near Lake Macquarie in New South Wales. It is owned by Trevor St Baker, who was vocal during a recent stakeholder session convened to discuss the underwriting program.
The Ai Group says: “Given that an underwriting program could result in long-term Commonwealth liabilities with a net present value of billions of dollars, a strong governance arrangement is essential for the actual and perceived integrity of the process”.
It points out, for example, that the net present value of fully offsetting the lifetime emissions of a new 2GW high efficiency low emissions (HELE) power plant could be $17.5bn, and more than $1.3bn annually by 2030, depending on what carbon policies are ultimately adopted.
The business group says the Morrison government needs to take a breath and stop attempting to finalise contracts prior to the federal election expected in May 2019.
“Given the low level of detail currently available, the wide scope of possible design options, and the severe risks of poor design to the public purse and the integrity of the electricity market, we strongly recommend that the government slow down”.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/nov/16/underwriting-coal-power-exposes-taxpayers-to-billions-industry-group-says

Protesters, including families and pensioners, began massing on five of London’s main bridges from 10am on Saturday. An hour later, all the crossings had been blocked in one of the biggest acts of peaceful civil disobedience in the UK in decades. Some people locked themselves together, while others linked arms and sang songs.
By 2pm the blockade of Southwark Bridge had been abandoned and protesters moved from there to Blackfriars Bridge, where organisers said they were soon to move west towards Westminster Bridge.
Demonstrators occupied Southwark, Blackfriars, Waterloo, Westminster and Lambeth bridges.
The Metropolitan police said all the bridges had since reopened
 and that most of the arrests had been for obstruction under the Highways Act.
Afterwards, demonstrators gathered in Parliament Square to hear speeches. Roger Hallam, one of the strategists behind the actions, told the Guardian he felt the protest had been fantastic.
“This is total prediction stuff, mass participation civil disobedience,” he said. “They can’t do anything about it unless they start shooting people, and presumably they won’t do that.” 
The day was due to end with an interfaith ceremony outside Westminster Abbey.
The move is part of a campaign of mass civil disobedience organised by a new group, Extinction Rebellion, which wants to force governments to treat the threats of climate breakdown and extinction as a crisis.
“The ‘social contract’ has been broken … [and] it is therefore not only our right but our moral duty to bypass the government’s inaction and flagrant dereliction of duty and to rebel to defend life itself,” said Gail Bradbrook, one of the organisers.
Alice, 19, from Bristol was one of those blocking Westminster Bridge.
“I took the coach at 3am to make sure I didn’t miss it,” she said, “and I’m so glad that I did. It’s a tiny personal inconvenience and, having made it, I get to be part of a rebellion.
“This moment will be remembered in the history books, when we finally stopped allowing our leaders to take us over the cliff.”
Jenny Jones, the Green party peer, joined the protest on Westminster Bridge. She backed the nonviolent direct action taken by demonstrators.
“We are at the point where if we don’t start acting and acting fast we are just going to wipe out our life support system,” she said.
“It’s fine to think we are a rich country, the sixth biggest economy in the world, but actually we won’t do any better than anywhere else because climate change will massively affect us too. “Basically, conventional politics has failed us – it’s even failed me and I’m part of the system – so people have no other choice.” 
Father Martin Newell said on Blackfriars Bridge: “What brought me here is the climate emergency, the extinction emergency and my faith in God who created all this and whose creation we’re destroying and crucifying … I’m called as a Christian to protect our neighbour who’s being abused.”
In the past two weeks more than 60 people have been arrested for taking part in acts of civil disobedience organised by Extinction Rebellion ranging from gluing themselves to government buildings to blocking major roads in the capital.
However, those disruptions were eclipsed on Saturday, when organisers say 6,000 people took part in protests.
“It is not a step we take lightly,” said Tiana Jacout, one of those involved. “If things continue as is, we face an extinction greater than the one that killed the dinosaurs. I don’t know about you, but I’d rather be a worthy ancestor.”
Extinction Rebellion, which cites the civil rights movement, suffragettes and Mahatma Gandhi as inspirations, said smaller events took place in other UK cities as well as overseas on Saturday.
Organisers say they are planning to escalate the campaigns from Wednesday, when small teams of activists will “swarm” around central London blocking roads and bridges, bringing widespread disruption to the capital.
“Given the scale of the ecological crisis we are facing this is the appropriate scale of expansion,” said Bradbrook. “Occupying the streets to bring about change as our ancestors have done before us. Only this kind of large-scale economic disruption can rapidly bring the government to the table to discuss our demands. We are prepared to risk it all for our futures.”
The group is calling on the government to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025 and establish a “citizens assembly” to devise an emergency plan of action similar to that seen during the second world war.
On top of the specific demands, organisers say they hope the campaign of “respectful disruption” will change the debate around climate breakdown and signal to those in power that the present course of action will lead to disaster.
The group, which was established only a couple of months ago, has raised around £50k in small-scale donations in the past weeks.
It now has offices in central London and over the past few months has been holding meetings across the country, outlining the scale of the climate crisis and urging people to get involved in direct action this weekend.
“Local groups are setting up across the country and even new groups are seeing around 100 people come to meetings, and we have coaches coming, from Newcastle to Plymouth,” said Rupert Read, a philosophy academic at the University of East Anglia.
The campaign hit the headlines a couple of weeks ago when the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams was one of almost 100 academics to come out in favour of it.
In a letter published in the Guardian they said: “While our academic perspectives and expertise may differ, we are united on this one point: we will not tolerate the failure of this or any other government to take robust and emergency action in respect of the worsening ecological crisis. The science is clear, the facts are incontrovertible, and it is unconscionable to us that our children and grandchildren should have to bear the terrifying brunt of an unprecedented disaster of our own making.”
The civil disobedience comes amid growing evidence of looming climate breakdown and follows warnings from the UN that there are only 12 years left to prevent global ecological disaster.
The group is also making international contacts, with 11 events planned in seven countries so far, including the US, Canada, Germany, Australia and France.
“To properly challenge the system that is sending us to an early grave we have to be bold and ambitious,” said Read. “Forging new connections across the world and learning from each other.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/17/thousands-gather-to-block-london-bridges-in-climate-rebellion

I am not a proponent of ""Watts up with that"" but they did do an interesting report on the Gravesend (Broadness) site.

You're not a proponent but you are going to quote them as an authority anyway. WUWT has a very poor record regarding accuracy. Just the other week they called the Spanish meteorological bureau incompetent based on a photo of a poorly maintained temperature station which they said had recorded a record temperature. Someone pointed out in the comments that it couldn't have been the station in the photo. The poorly maintained station was almost certainly no longer in use. They never corrected the story nor provided any corroborating evidence.
The scottish ""record"" was investigated and it was disqualified. Also that station is not included in global temperature data. WUWT have also claimed a temperature station was poorly sited before only for it to be pointed out that it wasn't a temperature monitoring station but an air quality monitor.

. There are of course transmission lines from sites of former nuclear & coal power plants that get used - and these need expanding.
BQENDOne of the reasons that Sizewell is cheaper than Hinkley is because, unlike Hinkley, it requires no grid strengthening.
This is also the strength of SMRs - they simply replace existing coal and gas power plants with the same or smaller physical footprint but without the need for constant train and lorry traffic.

yes the grid needs upgrading, just as it did when coal power plants were removed from towns and cities and centralised
BQENDCentralised its the word.
You make no bones that you prefer a distributed, de-centralised supply.That means more transmission lines, EFR supplies and storage as well as HVDC backbone (as in Germany) to move the non constant power around the country to where it is needed - 
That can be problematic, no matter how pretty the transmission tower.

The National Fruit collection had just been relocated to Brogdale by the University of Reading. The site was a new tourist attraction (miniature steam railway etc) and was looking for something to put it ""on the map"". A central area was being laid with block paving and workmen noticed the pallets of paviours heated up in the hot sunshine well above the ambient air temperature. They were instructed to wheel the pallets around the readily accessible Stevenson Screen to see what effect it may have - it was sufficient to raise the temperature recorded significantly. The pallets were then removed and everyone involved kept schtum. Two days later the site was visited and the reading taken.

(There’s a report: Every Town Should Have One). The arts funding establishment, chose not to, preferring instead to:1) Battle among themselves for primacy.2) Define notions of excellence. 3) Deliberately and wilfully ignore and/or deny local demand.
Both central and regional arts funders completely overlooked the local.
They talked of regional and national grids. They invested in regional and national circuits. They invented an Ivy League or Russell Group of production and receiving houses for theatre, visual art, dance, music and opera.They ignored the local, the vernacular, the different, the ordinary.
When the local came looking for support they were patronised, and fobbed off and told to talk to their local authority.
Smart Regional Arts Associations (before their annexation by Arts Council England) cottoned on and began forming ‘partnerships’ with local authorities. They could then say, we support the less able to become more capable in producing and promoting the arts — but they still overlooked the local. City authorities became too concerned with chasing supposed international baubles; regional and local authorities too concerned with delivering concrete benefits. Parish councils completely locked out of the mystifying loop of the arts funding merry-go round.
Fast forward two decades… 
And the rest? Well, without boring on, had the Arts funding establishment invested in the right places at the right time, and properly supported local arts centres, then the UK would not now be involved in the whole Brexit meltdown. And, as for Serota attempting to now claim a place for the Arts in the climate change debate…well, way too little, way too late.

Let´s stay with a capitalist system where people work for profit and see how it can be domesticated and harnessed to create the jobs that have just been described. 
Caring for dependent people until they die is not profitable. Rearing children rather than being profitable is very costly. Health care, given that there are more of us and that we live longer and that more illnesses and genetic defects are being discovered and more and more remedies and treatments are also being discovered, is a greater and great charge on the public purse. But what if we decided (or even a dictator decided) that these, or some of these unprofitable jobs would be profitable? So, in the same way that the owner of a goldmine sells gold at more than cost price, that the manufacturer of cars sells them at more than cost price, caring for dependent people and/or rearing children and/or health care costs more than the cost price of doing these jobs, a profit is created.
And how can this profit be created? This is the Added Profit Formula. The social wealth of these jobs is expressed in money terms, that is to say, the person who does one of these jobs is deemed to generate both his or her salary and also a mark-up, a profit. Let´s call these X and Y. Workers in a goldmine generate their wages, X, and the owner´s profit, Y. Workers in a car factory generate their salaries, X, and the owner´s profit, Y. So the Added Profit Formula is a way to simply add a mark-up to otherwise unprofitable jobs. By making these jobs profitable, this permits people, and even businesses, to move into this sector of the economy, which means it makes it possible for people, and even businesses, to move out of the “non-green sector” of the economy; this is social engineering to deliberately contact one sector of the economy by making it profitable for another sector of the economy to grow.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1542763024000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'12826250', u'id': u'122800437', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'werdzwerth', u'text': u'I am a social artist.

This was the conclusion of a special report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published in October. We – the collective “we” – have been given 12 years to arrest climate change. The message is clear: everyone is responsible for creating a more environmentally sustainable world. And the arts and cultural sector is no exception.
We have been talking about these issues at the Arts Council for a long time, and over the past decade have worked with the climate change charity Julie’s Bicycle to help arts and cultural organisations reduce their environmental impact. In 2012 we became the first cultural body in the world to include environmental reporting and action in our long-term funding agreements with arts organisations. Recognising that we had to create the conditions for change to happen, the Arts Council buttressed these requirements with a programme of support from Julie’s Bicycle. Together we substantially increased understanding about the role of the sector in addressing environmental issues and associated social challenges.
The findings of our Annual Report on Environmental Sustainability, published on Tuesday, prove the value of that intervention and show that commitment and creativity can bring inspiring results. In six years we have seen a 23% reduction in energy consumption and a corresponding 35% reduction in carbon emissions. Theatres, libraries, museums and concert halls of all sizes – in cities such as Birmingham, Exeter and London and across the country from Cumbria to the Thames estuary – are taking significant steps to highlight the issue in their programmes and improve their own environmental practice, installing solar panels, switching to energy-saving lightbulbs and reducing travel.
We have seen the power of encouraging the arts and cultural community to go on a collective journey. Several major city-wide initiatives have been developed, including the Manchester Arts Sustainability Team – a group of organisations working together to help deliver the city’s first-ever climate change strategy, Manchester: A Certain Future.
Arts and cultural companies possess significant purchasing power and can be instrumental in persuading suppliers to make ethical decisions and develop greener products and services. A quarter of our funded organisations are now on a green energy tariff, helping to drive demand for clean energy across the UK. Of course, the overall contribution made by the arts and cultural sector to energy conservation and carbon reduction is comparatively small. But for large parts of our audience it has become paramount that these institutions are setting an example in embracing and advocating for change.
Arts and culture make a vital contribution to the creation of a more inclusive and more confident society. They have the power to delight, educate, stimulate and inspire and, at a time of increasing division and inequality, we need their influence more than ever. As the IPCC report emphasised, the response to global warming must cover every aspect of life. We need action within the commercial sphere and engagement from the public. Artists and arts organisations can shape conversations about the environment. They can challenge and be provocative, both informing and opening our minds.
In recent years, there has been an overwhelming response from arts and cultural organisations eager to put this conversation centre stage. They are presenting a range of innovative projects that engage audiences in the issue of climate change. Last week, I visited Invisible Dust in Scarborough, which works with leading visual artists, creative technologists and scientists to encourage meaningful responses to environmental issues. In Kendal, Brewery Arts Centre showed Plastic on the Menu, highlighting issues around plastic in drinking water; a VR installation at Leicester’s Phoenix Arts Centre put audiences In the Eyes of the Animal to raise awareness of biodiversity in UK woodlands; and University of Cambridge Museums developed Operation Survival, in collaboration with Fire Hazard Games, a high-energy competition asking participants to come up with solutions for a world in crisis. 
When it comes to the environment, time is fast running out. We have to accelerate our response to the threats. The arts has an important role in helping society to face up to the challenge of climate change and create a more sustainable future for us all.

The Labor leader unveiled the energy policy reboot on Thursday, repeating an invitation for the Coalition to embrace the national energy guarantee it ditched during the August leadership implosion but also outlining a detailed alternative in the event the pitch for bipartisanship is ultimately rebuffed.
Shorten committed to topping up the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to the tune of $10bn and unveiled a new $5bn fund to modernise ageing transmission infrastructure – the ramparts of a 10-year plan to boost the share of renewable energy in the grid and retire coal generation. The funding is off-budget and does not hit the bottom line.
The Labor leader said he would use the Australian Energy Market Operator’s integrated system plan as the basis for transforming the energy system, with a Shorten government playing a hands-on role creating renewable energy zones, investing in new generation and transmission infrastructure and also in firming technologies, like batteries and gas peaking plants.
Shorten said if he wins the next federal election, the government will fund the transformation through concessional loans, equity and contract-for-difference auction schemes that are already used in some Australian states, and internationally.
The Labor leader said potential projects to be underwritten or funded included upgrades to interconnectors, a second connection across Bass Strait assisting Tasmania’s “battery of the nation” project and Snowy 2.0. He said he was also interested in new gas pipeline networks for northern Australia.
Labor is proposing an emissions reduction target across the economy of 45% and aims to have renewables achieve a 50% share of the electricity market by 2030.
Eight coal-fired power stations are set to close over the next two decades because they have reached the end of their operating life, and Labor’s higher emissions reduction target will drive a faster rationalisation.
Shorten unveiled a coal transition plan on Thursday, including a $10m training fund to skill workers in the coal-fired power sector to work in renewable energy, overseen by a Just Transition Authority coordinating the eventual plant closures.
There will also be enhanced industrial relations arrangements for displaced coal workers. Labor will insist that power plant operators and coalmine operators participate in pooled redundancy schemes to ensure workers are given offers of employment at a nearby power station or coalmine, subject to enough positions being created.
Shorten said the objective of the plan was to build the essential energy infrastructure to power industry and manufacturing, while helping households cut their power bills with more renewables and storage.
He said too much time had been lost in the climate and energy wars of the past decade and governments needed to act, not only to safeguard communities against the impact of global warming but also create the industries of the future.
“We will only achieve this if we move now,” Shorten said. “You only get one chance to get in on the ground floor. If the politics of the nation gets bogged down for another three or four years of infighting, of inertia … the moment will be missed.
“The world is very unforgiving for nations who do not take the opportunities that are presented to them.”
Shorten said plans for direct investment in the energy network could “not be hostage to the climate sceptics in the parliament”.
“We will act to bring down power prices and to boost these new blue-collar and green-collar industries. And, in a time of rapid economic and industrial change and disruption, only Labor will make it a priority to help workers and communities affected adapt to the transition.”
The Coalition on Thursday rebuffed the overture on bipartisanship and limbered up for another election fight over climate and energy policy. The energy minister, Angus Taylor, declared the government would never adopt an emissions reduction target of 45% “and we would never adopt the targets”.
Taylor said Labor needed to explain the practical effect of a 45% emissions reduction target in an energy intensive economy like Australia.
“If Labor is committed to those targets, they need to explain which businesses are going out of business in Australia,” he said. “They need to explain which cattle, how many cattle are going to go. They need to explain which aluminium smelters and refineries are going to shut. They need to explain which fertiliser factories, which cement factories are going to shut.
“The truth is that these targets, these reckless targets, will be a wrecking ball through the economy. We won’t stand for it.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/nov/22/bill-shorten-reveals-15bn-energy-plan-to-help-tackle-climate-disaster

The Pacific nation says it is growing desperate for financial assistance to deal with the loss and damage it is increasingly experiencing due to extreme weather and global warming.
In a statement on Thursday to the Climate Vulnerable Forum, an international summit focused on those most at risk to the effects of climate change, Vanuatu’s foreign minister, Ralph Regenvanu, said he was putting the fossil fuel industry “and the states that sponsor it on notice that the climate loss and damages ravaging Vanuatu will not go unchallenged”.
“My government is now exploring all avenues to utilise the judicial system in various jurisdictions – including under international law – to shift the costs of climate protection back onto the fossil fuel companies, the financial institutions and the governments that actively and knowingly created this existential threat to my country,” he said.
No such case brought by a country has been tested but there have been cases brought by citizens in domestic jurisdictions.
Small island countries such as Vanuatu are especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change.
Under the Paris agreement, countries have agreed to limit global warming to between 1.5 and 2C.
The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s recent special report warned the planet had only 12 years in which to meet the 1.5C goal and that the damage of even half a degree warmer than that would be far more significant.
Regenvanu told the forum that Cyclone Pam, the tropical cyclone that hit Vanuatu in 2015, wiped out 64.1% of its GDP, or $US449.4m.
He told Guardian Australia that Vanuatu was facing huge costs in trying to adapt to and prevent the impacts of climate change.
“The mechanism that has been but in place by the Paris agreement to assist least developed countries like Vanuatu to adapt and take measures to deal with loss and damage is the Green Climate Fund,” he said.
“Unfortunately countries like Australia who are the big polluters have just announced they will not contribute.
“There is a moral argument to say that to address our loss and damage bill we should be getting that from the people who are profiting off it.”
He said Vanuatu was looking for other countries to join it and would be discussing this at the next conference of parties on climate change in Poland next month.
Vanuatu is home to 260,000 residents and is made up of 82 volcanic islands dispersed across 1,280km of sea. Many of its islands sit less than a metre above sea level.
Greenpeace said the country was on the front lines of climate change.
“Vanuatu’s brave announcement today is part of a global wave of legal action against oil, gas, and coal companies and laggard governments,” Jennifer Morgan, the executive director at Greenpeace International, said.
Richie Merzian is the climate and energy program director at yhe Australia Institute and a former Australian government negotiator to the UN on loss and damage from climate change.
He said Vanuatu’s announcement was a sign of growing frustration among countries vulnerable to climate change over the loss and damage mechanisms within UN climate forum.
“These countries are desperate and they’re looking for support and instead of finding a friend they’re finding a closed door,” he said. “It’s great Vanuatu is looking for every option available to make their case and there are a number of test cases around the world that they can learn from.” ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/22/vanuatu-says-it-may-sue-fossil-fuel-companies-and-other-countries-over-climate-change

The tone of her article is that, somehow, we can solve the looming Climate Crisis emergency by ourselves. The following article (see link at bottom) shows that China's emissions for 2018 are growing 4% per annum compounded. 
These trends are based on China's own figures. The annual rate of Chinese emissions growth is around Australia's total absolute output. Nothing Australia does is going to make the slightest bit of difference to climate change. Frankly, the Chinese don't give a rat's. The Party will only stay in power as long as they continue to deliver economic growth to the Chinese people. How, and by what means, they achieve that growth is really irrelevant to them. 
China is a dictatorship and, like any self respecting dictator, President Xi will do whatever he has to do to stay in power, including causing catastrophic climate change. For the Politburo, climate change is a third, or fourth, order issue, when compared to staying in power and establishing economic and military hegemony across Asia in the next 10 years.
Australia is so irrelevant to this geopolitical issue as to be frankly laughable. We can puff out our chests and make all kinds of grand gestures but, at the end of the day, we need to accept that we're totally impotent. If the recent IPCC projections are accurate, and I hope that they're not, we need to batten down the hatches because it's going to a very rough ride indeed. 
We might be better off spending our money on preparing to mitigate the worst effects of inevitable climate change (e.g. securing our water supplies) than futilely throwing money at something over which we have no control whatsoever.

The prime minister is wrong about that. The evidence tells us Labor does learn from its mistakes, and in climate and energy the ALP have become shape shifters in order to keep doggedly pursuing policies reducing emissions in an environment when that activity is construed, ever more bizarrely in reactionary circles, as some kind of hostile action.
Again, with our eyes fixed firmly on the evidence, we can note Morrison is brave to be talking about mistakes and a lack of learning in climate and energy policy, given the Coalition has been a rolling botch-up in this area, lurching from bouts of hyperpartisan self-interest to desperate scrambling to produce a policy that Tony Abbott wouldn’t veto (oops he vetoed it anyway), ending at a point that can only be described as outright clustercuss.
Just consider one small counterpoint from Thursday. Bill Shorten went to Bloomberg and laid out an energy policy that defined the pressing challenge of transforming Australia’s energy market from top to bottom, and then he rolled out some detailed policy options for dealing with it.
The energy minister, Angus Taylor, by way of riposte, bunged on a high-vis vest, stood in front of a smelter in Tomago, and talked about Shorten having to nominate which burping cows he would cull, which, for a person of Taylor’s intelligence and technical expertise, must feel about as close as it comes to End Times.
We’ve been here before: the hyperbolic carry on, it’s all pretty tired.
It was stupid then and it’s even more stupid now, with the clock ticking, the grid creaking, power prices rising and emissions rising in sectors of the economy outside electricity. We don’t have time for more nonsense, and there’s already been far too much of it.
When it comes to climate and energy policy, voters desperately need someone to be a grown-up and, on Thursday, Shorten told them, in his most important speech as opposition leader, that it would be him.
He would be the grown-up because, God knows, someone had to be.
Now, to the merits of Shorten’s policy offering. It’s a bit depressing, frankly, where we find ourselves, at the tail end of the dumbest decade, because the only options to achieve progress are third-order options, where governments are back to rolling out industry policies as the solution to problems.
A number of business groups on Thursday pointed out the downside risks of energy policy by picking winners but frankly some of those business groups were also on the front line of campaigning against a carbon price, a market mechanism, only a couple of years ago – so, chaps, what goes around comes around. You reap what you sow.
So, we are where we are. Wishing it were otherwise is a waste of energy and a waste of time and, in the context of where we are, Labor’s offering is sensible enough.
The plan looks like this. Give the Liberals one more chance not to be wreckers on the taxpayer dime, give them an opportunity to wake up for themselves and vote for their own mechanism, the national energy guarantee. And in the event that fails, then drive the required transformation by a combination of measures: a 45% economy-wide emissions reduction target, funding the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to drive new investments in large-scale generation and storage, upgrading sub-optimal transmission infrastructure and preparing coal communities for the inevitable transition.
Conceptually, that’s not a bad mud map.
Of course there will be detailed questions to answer, and there’s an obvious one sitting right at the heart of Labor’s package.
If the economy-wide emissions reduction target is 45% (and that’s the plan) then shouldn’t the emissions reduction target for the electricity sector be higher than that given abatement is cheaper in electricity than in other sectors of the economy? It’s cheaper to reduce emissions in electricity than it is, say, in transport.
The reality is the electricity target should be higher than 45% to try and contain the costs of the transition.
It’s a question that needs an answer but that’s a tangle Labor won’t want to get into, particularly given Taylor and others are already thundering apocalyptically about “wrecking balls” through the economy.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2018/nov/22/bill-shorten-chooses-to-be-the-grown-up-on-energy-as-coalitions-toddlers-have-a-tantrum

In a report on the role hydrogen could play in the energy system, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) spelt out the huge but necessary cost the country faces to switch to green heating.
The cheapest scenario, it said, is a mix of electrifying heating and fitting hydrogen boilers, and will cost the UK £28bn a year, or 0.7% of GDP, by 2050.
While electricity supplies are rapidly switching to low-carbon sources, almost all homes today rely on fossil fuels – predominantly natural gas – for heating and cooking.
The public is largely unaware of the alternatives, said the report, and consumer understanding is “far from where it would need to be” before decisions on decarbonising heating are made in the 2020s.
While householders can keep their radiators, the CCC envisages that in future they will need to live in much more energy efficient homes with heat pumps that use electricity to draw heat from the ground or air, running alongside gas boilers.
Air-source heat pumps cost about £6,000-£7,000 but are expected to become cheaper as they become more mainstream.
To meet the long-term goal of cutting carbon emissions 80% by 2050, gas boilers would eventually need to be replaced by hydrogen ones that provide backup heating at times.
Chris Stark, the chief executive of the CCC, said the committee had previously been a “bit suspicious” of heat pumps but was now confident enough to recommend their rollout as a hybrid heating measure running alongside gas boilers, before a later move to hydrogen too.
“I’ve been cautious about the hydrogen story, because it’s often portrayed as a panacea. [But] I’ve been surprised how well it’s come out of our modelling when it’s accompanied by energy efficiency and electrification from heat pumps,” he said.
Stark urged the government to set out its plan for decarbonising heat in the next three years.
The report said while ministers may have “a strong temptation politically to ‘kick the can down the road’ by sticking with natural gas for longer”, it would be cheaper and better to act sooner.
Despite the high costs of decarbonising heating, the CCC believes the total consumers spend on energy bills could stay similar to today, as it expects electricity prices to fall as more is sourced from wind, solar and nuclear, and costs of running a car to become cheaper owing to the switch to electric vehicles.
Stark said he was now more optimistic about hydrogen, and that it offered “something in the long-term that we need”. But the CCC said producing hydrogen in a low-carbon way would be a big challenge.
Today the vast majority is made from natural gas and is high carbon, but in the future that production would need to involve carbon capture and storage. Producing the hydrogen in bulk using renewable electricity generation and electrolysis was considered “unnecessarily expensive”, said the CCC.

The fear of a rogue nation or military force unilaterally taking control of the global climate is unfounded, the researchers added, as the many thousands of high-altitude flights needed to affect global temperatures could not escape detection.
The new research estimated the technology costs of putting millions of tonnes of sulphate particles high into the atmosphere. This form of geoengineering mimics major volcanic eruptions, which have significantly reduced global temperatures in the past.
“We show that a hypothetical deployment programme, while both highly uncertain and ambitious, would be technically possible,” said Gernot Wagner from Harvard University. “It would also be remarkably inexpensive, at an average of around $2bn to $2.5bn per year.” About $500bn (£388bn) a year is currently invested in green technologies.
The idea of geoengineering is controversial, with opponents arguing it could seem like an easy solution to global warming and weaken efforts to cut the root cause of emissions. Others warn it risks serious unintended consequences, such as droughts and damage to crops. In October, more than 100 civil society groups condemned geoengineering as “dangerous, unnecessary and unjust”.
However, many scientists say not conducting geoengineering research would be even more dangerous, because climate change may become so bad that governments feel compelled to deploy it despite not knowing its full consequences.
“Unfortunately, climate change is dire enough for us to have to consider drastic action,” said Dr Matthew Watson at the University of Bristol. “Some argue against researching these ideas but personally I think that is a mistake. There may come a time, in a future not so far away, where it would be immoral not to intervene.”
The new study, published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, found that the most cost-effective way to deliver the particles requires the development of a new type of aircraft. If the sulphates were released from commercial jets, the particles would fall out of the sky in days.
No aircraft exists that could carry tonnes of particles to the 12-mile (20km) altitude needed in order for them to remain aloft for a year or more, and rockets would be far too expensive. The new plane would need much larger wings and four engines rather than two, as the air at 12 miles is just 7% as dense as at sea level. “It would be an unusual design, but one does not need technological breakthroughs,” said Wake Smith, an aviation engineer who worked with Wagner.
The researchers calculated the cost of a 15-year programme in which six to eight new planes are added each year, including crew costs, maintenance, insurance, fuel, landing charges, spares and training.
The programme would begin with 4,000 flights a year and end with 60,000 flights a year by almost 100 aircraft. “The amount of flights happening would be so big it could not be done secretly,” said Smith. “This is not like the German naval buildup before the second world war. If people were doing this, we would know about it.”
The impact of the programme would be to reduce warming by 0.1C per year, with a total reduction of 1.5C, said Wagner. This is based on emissions being curbed from today’s levels but still rising and leading to 3C of warming, a level considered catastrophic by scientists. A major recent report from the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) cited 1.5C of warming as a far safer limit.
The researchers said they were not advocating the deployment of solar engineering, but believed it must be assessed. “It can only be part of an overall climate policy portfolio that first includes [emission cuts], adaptation and carbon removal from the atmosphere,” said Wagner.
The IPCC report said geoengineering might be adopted as a temporary “remedial measure” in extreme circumstances. “If the world runs through the door with its hair on fire, we need to understand what the options are,” said Smith.
Prof Joanna Haigh at Imperial College London said: “This plan is a distraction that may well encourage weaker action on emissions reduction.” She said the money would be better spent on helping nations cut emissions and protect themselves from extreme weather.
The costs of compensating for droughts, floods and food shortages that geoengineering might cause would be much larger than the engineering costs, said Phil Williamson at the University of East Anglia. “International agreement to go ahead would seem near-impossible. Rapid reductions in emissions remain the best way to avoid climate catastrophe.”
Blocking sunlight does not address other problems caused by global warming, such as the acidification of the oceans. However, Prof Peter Cox at the University of Exeter said: “The fact that researchers at one of the world’s top universities are costing the deployment of such a radical [geoengineering] scheme shows how urgent the climate change problem has become.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/23/solar-geoengineering-could-be-remarkably-inexpensive-report

The influence of climate change is being felt across the US with increases in disastrous wildfires in the west, flooding on the east coast, soil loss in the midwest and coastal erosion in Alaska, according to the US National Climate Assessment. The Guardian saw a draft of the report before publication on Friday.
The draft outlined that “impacts of climate change are intensifying across the country, and that climate-related threats to Americans’ physical, social, and economic wellbeing are rising”. Climate change-related risks “will continue to grow without additional action”, it added.
The quadrennial report, the combined work of 13 federal agencies, was released by the Trump administration on the day after Thanksgiving. Scientists who worked on the report said their research was not watered down but claimed the release was timed to bury the findings during the holiday season.
Global temperatures could be limited to 2C above pre-industrial era if greenhouse gas emissions are slashed but “without significant reductions, annual average global temperatures could increase by 9F (5C) or more by the end of this century”, a previously released chapter states.
Even 2C warming is likely to have major ramifications for societies, as the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report spelled out. Heating the planet well beyond this would create a “totally different world”, said Michael Oppenheimer, a climate scientist at Princeton University.
“It would be indescribable, it would turn the world upside down in terms of its climate. There would be nothing like it in the history of civilization.”
Oppenheimer, with many other scientists, has said warming of around 3C is more likely given the advance of renewable energy and expected emissions reductions in the future.
“That is more of an economic, political and technology question,” a report author who wished to remain unnamed told the Guardian. “It’s hard to say what we are on track for right now.”
Climate-related threats to Americans’ physical, social, and economic wellbeing are rising
The draft report warned that the current response was insufficient to stave off the worst impacts, stating that “neither global efforts to mitigate the causes of climate change nor regional efforts to adapt to the impacts currently approach the scales needed to avoid substantial damages to the US economy, environment, and human health and well-being over the coming decades”.
Another report author said: “Climate change is loading the dice against us, it’s going to affect our water, food and ecosystems. This report is important because it shows it’s already happening where we live, not on far off islands or at the poles.”
Included in the dozens of draft report chapters:
The summary states the “earth’s climate is now changing faster than at any point in the history of modern civilization, primarily as a result of human activities. The impacts of global climate change are already being felt in the United States and are projected to intensify in the future.”
Average sea levels along the US coast have increased by around 9in since the early 20th century as the oceans have warmed and land ice has melted. If emissions are not constrained, “many coastal communities will be transformed by the latter part of this century”.
Fisheries, tourism, human health and public safety are being “transformed, degraded or lost due in part to climate change impacts, particularly sea level rise and higher numbers of extreme weather events”.
Wildfires have burned at least 3.7m acres in the US in all but three years from 2000 to 2016. “More frequent and larger wildfires, combined with increasing development at the wildland-urban interface portend increasing risks to property and human life,” the report states.
More than 100m people in the US live in places with poor air quality and climate change will “worsen existing air pollution levels”. Increased wildfire smoke risks heightening respiratory and cardiovascular problems, while the prevalence of asthma and hay fever is also likely to rise.
Major groundwater supplies have declined over the last century, with this decrease accelerating since 2001. “Significant changes in water quantity and quality are evident across the country,” the report finds.
Climate change will “disrupt many areas of life” by hurting the US economy, affecting trade and exacerbating overseas conflicts. Low-income and marginalized communities will be worst hit.
The national climate assessment is mandated by Congress to compile the latest research on climate change. The last report came out in 2014. Donald Trump has since announced the US will withdraw from the Paris climate deal, with his administration working to dismantle every major policy designed at lowering emissions.
The release of the report comes as California is racked by its most deadly wildfire on record, the so-called Camp fire, which razed the town of Paradise. At least 84 people have died and tens of thousands of people have had to flee the fire, which has occurred at the same time as a smaller blaze further south, near Los Angeles.
Trump has downplayed assertions by scientists and firefighters that climate change is making California more wildfire-prone, instead pointing to “gross mismanagement” of forest areas. Ryan Zinke, the interior secretary, has said conservationist lawsuits by “radical environmental groups” were to blame.
While visiting devastated parts of California last weekend Trump was asked if what he had seen and heard had changed his mind about climate change, which he has previously called a “hoax”. Trump responded to the question with a firm: “No.”
“When there are daily images of California burning up it’s hard for the administration to argue climate change isn’t happening,” said Oppenheimer. “The strategy seems to be let sleeping dogs lie and hope the public doesn’t pay much attention to it.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/23/climate-change-america-us-government-report

The US National Climate change assessment, the work of 300 scientists and 13 federal agencies, was released on Friday afternoon. It found that wildfires, storms and heatwaves are already taking a major toll on Americans’ wellbeing, with climate change set to “disrupt many areas of life” in the future.
The voluminous report, which warns of hundreds of billions of dollars lost, crop failures, expanding wildfires, altered coastlines and multiplying health problems, represents the most comprehensive and sobering analysis yet of the dangers posed to the US by rising temperatures.
I wrote the climate scenarios chapter myself so I can confirm it considers ALL scenarios
Climate change could slash up to a tenth of US GDP by the end of the century, the report found, with $1tn in coastal real estate threatened by rising sea levels and storms. Heatwaves are set to cause thousands of extra deaths and worsen conditions such as asthma and pulmonary disease through increased air pollution.
A White House spokeswoman, however, said the assessment was “largely based on the most extreme scenario, which contradicts long-established trends by assuming that, despite strong economic growth that would increase greenhouse gas emissions, there would be limited technology and innovation, and a rapidly expanding population”.
The spokeswoman added the next report, due in four years’ time, will “provide for a more transparent and data-driven process”.
Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University and a report co-author, said the White House’s statement was “demonstrably false”.
She added on Twitter: “I wrote the climate scenarios chapter myself so I can confirm it considers ALL scenarios, from those where we go carbon negative before end of century to those where carbon emissions continue to rise.”
The climate assessment galvanized Democrats, who will control the House of Representatives next year.
“The days of denial and inaction in the House are over,” said Frank Pallone, a New Jersey congressman set to chair the energy and commerce committee. “House Democrats plan to aggressively address climate change and hold the administration accountable for its backward policies that only make it worse.”
People are going to die if we don’t start addressing climate change ASAP
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a newly elected representative from New York City who has become a standard-bearer for the left, tweeted: “People are going to die if we don’t start addressing climate change ASAP. It’s not enough to think it’s ‘important’. We must make it urgent.”
Authors of the report, which is mandated by Congress, echoed the sense of urgency and lamented the timing of its release on the day after Thanksgiving, which is usually the busiest shopping day of the year.
“This report makes it clear that climate change is not some problem in the distant future – it’s happening right now in every part of the country,” said Brenda Ekwurzel, a co-author and director of climate science at the Union of Concerned Scientists, in a statement.
“When people say the wildfires, hurricanes and heatwaves they’re experiencing are unlike anything they’ve seen before, there’s a reason for that and it’s called climate change.”
Ekwurzel added that the report “makes a convincing case the White House should stop rolling back climate policies and recognize that a much larger scale response is required to keep people safe”.
Donald Trump did not immediately comment on the report, although on Wednesday he responded to a cold snap on the east coast by tweeting: “Brutal and Extended Cold Blast could shatter ALL RECORDS – Whatever happened to Global Warming?”
The president took a trip last week to see the aftermath of California’s deadliest ever wildfires, a phenomenon experts say is worsened by warming temperatures. During a visit to the town of Paradise, which was wiped out by the so-called Camp fire, Trump said he wanted “a great climate”. But he has largely blamed forest management for the blaze.
He has repeatedly disparaged or dismissed climate science in the past.
In a statement in response to the release of the climate assessment, the former vice-president and environmental campaigner Al Gore said: “The president may try to hide the truth, but his own scientists and experts have made it as stark and clear as possible.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/24/climate-change-report-trump-administration-democrats-reaction

Ah, the loading of basic skills such that no young person would be capable of them, plus the Catch 22.
I could ""safely"" drive an old 4WD on a farm by age 11. No I couldn't drive ""down the freeway"" without experience, that's one of the reasons I was taught to do it in a paddock first (that, and I could help with the animals - fun too).Before I reached 'Senior' school, I was expected to read the newspaper and have something intelligible to say about what I had read at the dinner table. 
My parents and I may not have agreed on all things political, nor social, but my views weren't dismissed without attention being paid to them in the first place and a discussion taking place.Agreeing to disagree was one of the things I learnt.I also learnt, if not immediately then with time, that my parents weren't correct about everything.I imagine your offspring have already learnt this last thing.
The point? Children, or young adults as these people are, need to be introduced to things - and it may have escaped your notice, but many are more sophisticated, and better informed, than we were at that age.
OK, they currently have to wait until they are a certain age to vote - but I can see no intelligible reason for their views re what kind of world they want to become adult in to be entirely dismissed.', u'recommendation_count': u'12', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1543243405000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'13011646', u'in_reply_to': u'123010059', u'id': u'123011550', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'deliteful', u'text': u'BQSTART

The prime minister implored children to stay in class rather than protesting things that “can be dealt with outside of school”.
“Each day I send my kids to school and I know other members’ kids should also go to school but we do not support our schools being turned into parliaments,” Morrison told parliament on Monday.
“What we want is more learning in schools and less activism in schools.”
Morrison furiously reacted to Greens MP Adam Bandt during question time about the protest, dubbed the Big School Walkout for Climate Action.
Hundreds of Australian school students are vowing to put the books away and converge on MP offices and parliaments around the country this Friday.
Morrison began his answer to Bandt’s question by saying climate change is a “very real and serious issue” that demands attention.
He said the government was acting on climate change through initiatives such as the emissions reduction fund and the renewable energy target.
“We are committed to all of these things, but I will tell you what we are also committed to - kids should go to school,” Morrison said.
Bandt said he had met with some of the students involved and backed their actions.
“The PM is unbelievably out of touch with young people, not only in Australia but around the world,” he said.
“These students want a leader to protect their future, but they got a hectoring, ungenerous and condescending rebuke from someone even worse than Tony Abbott.”
Australian Youth Climate Coalition spokesperson Laura Sykes said Morrison had shown “irrational outrage” to students who care about their education.
“It was shocking see our prime minister condemning students as young as eight, who are sacrificing a day of schooling to stand up for a safe climate future,” Sykes told AAP.
“When young people try to have a voice in politics, Scott Morrison is shutting them down, yet he’s happy to listen to the coal lobby and big corporations who continue to profit from making climate change worse.”

Dear Secretary of State,
My friend, who is in farming at the moment, recently received a cheque for £3,000 from the Rural Payments Agency for not rearing pigs. I would now like to join the ""not rearing pigs"" business.
In your opinion, what is the best kind of farm not to rear pigs on, and which is the best breed of pigs not to rear? I want to be sure I approach this endeavour in keeping with all government policies, as dictated by the EU under the Common Agricultural Policy.I would prefer not to rear bacon pigs, but if this is not the type you want not rearing, I will just as gladly not rear porkers. Are there any advantages in not rearing rare breeds such as Saddlebacks or Gloucester Old Spots, or are there too many people already not rearing these?
As I see it, the hardest part of this programme will be keeping an accurate record of how many pigs I haven't reared. Are there any Government or Local Authority courses on this?
My friend is very satisfied with this business. He has been rearing pigs for forty years or so, and the best he ever made on them was £1,422 in 1968. That is - until this year, when he received a cheque for not rearing any.
If I get £3,000 for not rearing 50 pigs, will I get £6,000 for not rearing 100?
I plan to operate on a small scale at first, holding myself down to about 4,000 pigs not raised, which will mean about £240,000 for the first year. As I become more expert in not rearing pigs, I plan to be more ambitious, perhaps increasing to, say, 40,000 pigs not reared in my second year, for which I should expect about £2.4 million from your department. Incidentally, I wonder if I would be eligible to receive tradable carbon credits for all these pigs not producing harmful and polluting methane gases?
Another point: These pigs that I plan not to rear will not eat 2,000 tonnes of cereals. I understand that you also pay farmers for not growing crops. Will I qualify for payments for not growing cereals to not feed the pigs I don't rear?
I am also considering the ""not milking cows"" business, so please send any information you have on that too. Please could you also include the current Defra advice on set aside fields? Can this be done on an e-commerce basis with virtual fields (of which I seem to have several thousand hectares)?
In view of the above you will realise that I will be totally unemployed, and will therefore qualify for unemployment benefits.
I shall of course be voting for your party at the next general election.', u'recommendation_count': u'35', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1543256215000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'4632941', u'id': u'123021999', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'graun', u'text': u'I expect McDonnell would want to nationalise it.', u'recommendation_count': u'19', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1543256084000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'4109931', u'in_reply_to': u'123021566', u'id': u'123021931', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Harvestingkarma', u'text': u'Yes, big city dwellers think they live on an island of cement, noise, pollution and endless shops, offices and pubs.

The party says it will ban fracking, spend £2bn a year to insulate homes and build a net zero-emission economy by 2050.
BQENDWell given that we import 60% of our 800,000GWh gas demand and our (and Norways') piped gas stocks are declining then I don't think the maths add up when you consider that imported LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) is 21.05kgCO₂ (e)/GJ whereas domestic natural extracted gas is 5.9kgCO₂(e)/GJ
A ban on fraccing has a lot of support but it is not the same as a policy which lowers carbon.
In point of fact, if we replaced the 150,000GWh og LNG we already consume with fracced gas, the savings would be circa 8 million tonnes of CO₂ a year ... and an £18bn shot in the arm for our balance of trade - more if sterling falls any further against the Dollar.

I couldn’t understand how a Tory of his ilk could adopt such a good policy. Because, let’s be clear, the way the CAP currently works is an ecological disaster; it needs replacing. When I wrote this in a comment, someone replied that it was just a ploy by an arch-Brexiter to argue that the U.K. after Brexit would not drop environmental standards.
Perhaps. I suspect this suspicion may be driving Labour’s opposition to the policy. Which is a pity, because it IS a good policy. Paying farmers for the ecological services which they offer with their land rather than for the amount of produce they grow on it is the way to go. So Labour should accept the principle behind Gove’s bill and work to make it really work. Because the policy has two big weaknesses.
First, whatever scheme the government comes up with, it cannot be the bureaucratic nightmare which Richard Bunning describes below. That will not be easy, because turning the principle of offering ecological services into measurable targets against which to pay farmers is devilishly difficult (and is in part why the CAP is the way it is).
Second, there is also the reasonable objective to be met of being at least more or less self-sufficient in food production. I’m old enough to remember the stories my grandmother told me about lack of food during WWII.

Now it may well be that ancient monuments should be preserved, but the fact get some wealthy aristocrat built something hundreds if not thousands of years ago has nothing to do with environmental conservation now and these sites tend to be in affluent, good farming areas, not the poorer marginal land, so the method of scoring is heavily biased in favour of large rich farms.
Another issue is the ludicrous complexity of the schemes. Dozens of different criteria and options face the farmer, acres of paperwork, photos of every hedge, ditch and field. Records of every individual cow's grazing locations, not to mention crass inconsistencies like missing out funding to maintain ancient orchards in the current year and paying to create laid hedges for breeding birds, but denying money to maintain them once laid but funding maintenance of existing laid hedges.
Micro managing every yard of hedge, every bird box and every square metre of field is quite simply ludicrous. What ought to happen is a simple scheme based on a regime model that says only cut hedges out of the bird nesting season, operate ultra low input grazing without chemical fertilizers or herbicides to a given stock density and then target specific high priority areas that contain important habitats like flood meadows or ancient woodland.
If I add up the hours spent applying for the agriculture environment scheme and divide the hours into the actual money the farm receives, the hourly rate is below the minimum wage! If I then tot up the cost of doing the work, e.g. buying fencing and putting it up, the cost is often more than the grant money received, so as a small farm there is virtually no point in joining the scheme.
We were in the previous high level scheme for a decade and last year were designated a county wildlife site for our resident breeding otters, perigrines, salmon and sand Martin colony, to mention but a few of the species that now thrive here. Our farm was the only one in the whole of Devon to receive this designation last year. Our reward for this?
Dumped out of the scheme, prevented from receiving any grant at all for a year, then offered a much lower level of funding with such onerous levels of paperwork and reporting that we were close to not bothering with it at all. Natural England told us this was because of EU rules, but when we asked the EU they flatly denied this, so they had to let us apply, but then rigged the result by changing the assessment criteria so that we just missed the ranking to receive funding. 
Chaos reigns regularly in the entire government agriculture department: for example we were told we would receive the new contract in January, but it never came until July, contained dozens of changes from the original proposal and we were told to make our first claim for work carried out before we even knew what that work was supposed to be or even had a valid contract with DEFRA for it - and here we are rapidly approaching Christmas and we still haven't been paid anything.
Funding must be allocated according to the value of the environmental conservation being done.
The complexity of the schemes must be drastically reduced and reporting requirements slashed. What on earth is the point of taking dozens of pictures of bits of hedges or fields? Why on earth does DEFRA need grazing records of which piece of grass every cow grazed through out the year? It is overkill.
Farce.

The party says it will ban fracking, spend £2bn a year to insulate homes and build a net zero-emission economy by 2050. Meeting such targets will need politicians to fend off vested interests and their special pleading. Big reforms are easily scuppered by entrenched industries. So it is strange that when plans to change the face of rural Britain in a positive way come before MPs, Labour’s environment team, headed by Sue Hayman, has been accused of trying to wreck them with arguments that put the party on the side of the status quo.
The allegation came as Michael Gove, the environment secretary, is taking the first agriculture bill for seven decades through parliament. It aims to replace the harmful and unfair EU common agricultural policy, which is based on the majority of the direct EU support payments going to farmers for acres owned. “The more you have, the more you get” mentality created a perverse incentive to clear wildlife habitats, even in places unsuitable for farming, to attract cash. Rich landowners were rewarded for their holdings’ size rather than for restoring peat bogs and hedgerows. Mr Gove rightly wants to move to a system that links a much bigger slice of payments directly to farmers’ delivery of “public goods”, notably “environmental protection and enhancement”. As a leaver, he sells Brexit as an opportunity and takes up the cause of campaigners who argue the current model of farming has been behind the collapsing bird and insect numbers in the countryside and is why our rivers are so mucky. It is good Mr Gove recognises the importance of ecosystems for farming. The bill is imperfect and Mr Gove himself is often heavy on style and light on substance, but the direction of travel ought to be welcomed.
Having said that, agriculture would wither without subsidies. British farmers receive payments worth £3bn a year. Post-Brexit, the plan is for farmers to get the equivalent of the CAP subsidies until 2022. Payments will then be phased out and replaced by the new system. The importance of the government cash should not be underestimated: it makes up almost two-thirds of farm income in England and three-quarters in Scotland. Many farmers voted for Brexit because they were fed up of CAP’s bureaucracy. They are now nervous of facing a unpalatable choice: seek government cash for creating public goods or try to increase efficiency to survive on lower subsidies.
There are risks that farmers will go bust before they can go green. Britain might need to suck in cheaper imports, produced wherever the cost of land and labour compensates for longer logistics chains. There is a recognisable political dilemma here: how to achieve radical change without creating an immovable opposition. Emmanuel Macron demonstrates the danger of clumsily loading green costs upfront. Labour is aware that half a million jobs are at stake. The danger is the party trades its principles for opportunistic gain. It ought to focus on holding the government’s feet to the fire over retaining the level of agricultural support and a proper watchdog. It might push co-operative farming, which lowers costs by getting farmers to work more closely together. It could tax land more fairly. We need to make food production sustainable in an era of climate crisis. The bill’s fate is now tied up with that of Brexit. It will not return to the Commons until after the meaningful vote. Labour has time to show it can produce its own policy that reflects the party’s green commitments as well as concerns over food security.

Thanks to our panellists: Bill Hare, Simon Holmes à Court, Amanda McKenzie, Laura Sykes and Piper Albrecht. And thanks to my colleague Lisa Cox. 
Most of all, thanks to all of you for your questions. It’s our future, and I’m glad we got to discuss it. 
The full answers are below, but here’s a list of the best:
Thank you for reading, engaging and asking. Hope to see you all again soon.
And one last question, from Sunny Adcock:
If I am currently 18, do you think that within my lifetime there is hope of preventing climate change? Realistically what is the best and worse case scenario of what may happen within my lifetime?
 Bill Hare says: 
Yes there definitely is hope.
The best case is getting onto a 1.5C pathway, in which case, by the time you turn 50 scientists might be saying that global warming peaked in the 2040s. By the time you are 100, it could be 1.3C or lower and on the way down. 
The worst case is that by your mid-40s the world has busted through 2C warming and is headed for 3.5C or 4C for your 100th birthday. 
There are quite a few reasons for hope, but it will take hard work and real commitment from our political leaders. We are simply running out of time and every climate scientist I know is saying the same thing. 
One of the big reasons for hope is that people are finally waking up all over the world and calling for action. Secondly the costs of renewable technology, electrical storage, electrical vehicles, renewable hydrogen powered trucks and efficiency in industry, housing are dropping rapidly.
And Amanda McKenzie: 
There are three levels of government in Australia – local, state and national.
At the national level, I believe the Morrison government, like the Turnbull and Abbott governments, has not implemented meaningful policy on climate change. 
At the state government level there is a lot happening. In South Australia, they are on track for 73% renewable energy by 2020 while Queensland has a target of 50% renewable energy by 2030. Victoria has a target of 40% renewable energy by 2025 and the Labor government has pledged to increase this to 50% by 2030.
At the local level there is a lot happening too. From floating solar arrays to electric vehicle charging stations to energy efficiency. For more information check out our report on local action here. 
Together there is now more and more happening across Australia. However, it must all be ramped up into the future.
Our second last question. 
From Violeta Zavala-Collin, 10, Harcourt public school.
Is there anything Australian politicians are already doing about climate change? Is it going to be effective?
Simon Holmes à Court answers first:
Australian politicians have at times been very constructive and also very destructive in their response to climate change.
For example, in 2001 the Australian government passed laws requiring more renewable energy in our grid. This level, called the renewable energy target, was increased in 2009. As a result, the amount of renewable energy will increase from 9% in 2001 to around 33% in 2020. 
In 2012 the government passed laws that encouraged polluters to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions. These laws were very effective and our emissions started to fall, but in 2014 the laws were undone and emissions have been rising ever since.
In order to avoid dangerous climate change, almost every country in the world is signed up to the Paris Agreement. We are too – but experts say our target is not strong enough, and worse, even the government’s experts say we’re not even going to hit our targets.
Australia has done quite a bit in the past, but in my opinion, our government does not currently have a real plan to respond to the climate challenge.
From Oli, aged 8: 
How can we build buildings that can help us respond to climate change?
Simon Holmes à Court:
We can look at this two ways.
First, what can we do to reduce the impact our buildings have on the planet? We can choose building materials, like sustainably farmed timber, and orient the house to maximise winter sun and minimise the need for heating and cooling. 
We can make the buildings more energy efficient, by using LED light bulbs, double-glazed windows and good insulation. We can make sure all our appliances have high energy ratings and we can put solar hot water and solar photovoltaic panels on the roof. This reduces the climate impact of our homes, and the house will cost a lot less money to run.
Second, we must accept that a certain amount of climate change is locked in. Bushfires are now more severe and costal flooding more likely. When we build houses we must be aware of the changed and changing conditions. As an example, a suburb of Melbourne is changing the planning code to require that no bedrooms are on the ground floor in areas that are newly considered as flood-prone.
Some great feedback. Thank you to everyone for some incredible questions, and an inspiring level of curiosity and passion.
Overheard in the newsroom: ""That's what I love about this blog, it's kids stating the bloody obvious."" #myclimatequestions https://t.co/mw2vuCEfzo
From Violet, age 6:
How does a windmill work? 
 Simon Holmes à Court:
There is great energy in the wind – think of sailboats being pushed across oceans or storms powerful enough to uproot trees. 
People have built windmills to catch the energy and do something useful with it for more than 1,500 years. Early on it was often used to pump water or to mill grain into flour. In the 1880s inventors started converting the energy to electricity as people started to install lights in their homes. 
In the 1970s inventors started working on what we now call wind turbines. Modern wind turbines have a tall tower with a small building on top called a nacelle. The nacelle is about the size of a caravan, attached to which are three massive blades. The blades can weigh more than 10 tonnes and be longer than 50m and are a little bit like aeroplane wings. 
The nacelle contains motors that turn the blades too face the wind. As the blades catch the wind, they turn, driving a generator in the nacelle. The generator converts the movement into electricity, before being added to our power grid. As I write, 7% of the power in our national grid is coming from wind turbines, which is very close to the average over the past year.
Also apologies to everyone if your question hasn’t been answered yet. Our experts are wrapping up, but we’ll still run the blog until 6.30, and have plenty of questions and answers still to work through. Stick with us! 
Another question from Cranbrook School, from year 7 student Thomas Girle:
 How does climate change affect water scarcity in different areas?
Amanda McKenzie:
Great question as water is a big issue in Australia.
South-east Australia has already experienced a 15% decline in late autumn and early winter rainfall, and a 25% decline in average rainfall in April and May over the past two to three decades. This area includes major population centres of Brisbane, Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne and Adelaide. 
South-western Australia has also experienced a long-term drying trend including a more than 50% decline in streamflow. Across the Murry-Darling Basin – the food bowl of Australia – streamflows have declined by 41% since the 1990s. 
For more info check out our water security report here.
A great question from Samuel Turrin
Do you think people below the voting age should have a voice in parliament on issues that would directly impact their future? How could we do this?
Piper Albrecht, 17, has some ideas:
I think optional voting for children 16 to 18 would be a good idea. Then they would have a say in who is in the parliament making decisions that impact them.
Maybe they could also have a children’s commissioner in parliament. This could be a politician who voices the concerns of the young people. Young people could then direct their concerns to that person. 
Politicians could look more closely at what children are doing and show that they’re listening to them. For example, if the children are striking maybe they should start listening and responding to the children’s specific requests, rather than just being defensive.
And Laura Sykes: 
I 100% think people below the voting age should have a voice in parliament. There are so many challenges young people are facing right now – climate change, unemployment, the housing crisis, mental health and cost of living. 
What has become obvious is that our politics is stuck in three year cycles and in doing so, is not able to deal with a long-term issue which needs serious planning and great long-term ambition, like climate change.
Another video question, from Rhys Kimberley from Cranbrook School.
If we were to move right now into renewable energy, what impact would that have on economical, environmental and political aspects of Australia?”
Simon Holmes à Court:
We can’t move to renewable energy overnight. It will take time – a decade if we are fast, decades longer if we don’t try very hard. 
Economic modelling prepared over the past decade has consistently shown that the costs of aggressively reducing emissions are manageable – certainly much more manageable than the economic impact of unchecked climate change. 
There are two kinds of environmental benefits. In the short term we’ll reduce a range of pollutants from the air that have been shown recently cause an estimated 279 deaths a year from NSW’s coal-fired power stations alone.
In the medium term, if Australia acts on reducing CO2 emissions and is joined by a strong global response, we can avert a massive environmental disaster.
Politically? For the past couple of decades Australian politicians have been fighting about renewables and carbon emissions. As more and more of the public understand renewables, have jobs in the industry, have solar panels on their roof, and prices continue to fall, I believe the toxic politics will fade away.
From Callum, aged 8: 
This spring has been really cold. Is that something to do with climate change?
Bill Hare
I don’t think so, it could just be natural variability. Differences year from year that always occurred and can be quite extreme in some places! 
Over much of the country, spring has been warmer than average, and the weather bureau is predicting a hot summer in large parts of Australia. On the west coast it definitely felt a bit cooler than usual, at least around the Perth.
There may be some link to the change in the temperature of the sea surface, affected by human-induced warming, but this will take a fair bit of research to work out.
Max, 14, asks:
Why are electric cars not everywhere yet? My family say they want one but they are still a bit too expensive. 
Simon Holmes à Court has the answer – they are expensive, but that should be getting better. 
Electric cars might seem very new, but some of the first cars ever made were fully electric, including the Flocken’s Elektrowagen of 1888, but within 20 years the industry had moved over almost entirely to engines burning fossil fuels.
Thanks to massive advances in battery technology, inventors began working on electric vehicles again almost 100 years later. Mass production vehicles only arrived in Australia recently, the best selling Nissan Leaf in 2011 and the next best seller, the Tesla Model S, has only been here for four years.
Electric cars are cheap to run — there’s a lot less to maintain and the electricity needed to charge them is much cheaper than the cost of the equivalent amount of fuel. However, they are currently considerably more expensive to purchase.
The costs will come down as production increases — right now electric cars make up around 1.5% of all new cars, but this number is growing very quickly. We could give electric cars preferential access to express lanes, build more charge stations or provide a rebate.
A quick break for some news, the Senate just voted to show solidarity and support for the striking students. 
The Senate just voted for a motion to support the #ClimateStrike and call for the government to have a climate policy!

Climate efforts aren’t all or nothing
Limiting greenhouse gases would substantially benefit the US economy and stop thousands of deaths each year, compared with allowing climate pollution to continue to rise through the 21st century.
Reaching a peak for climate pollution mid-century and then beginning a decline would prevent in 2090:
48% of the $155bn per year in damages to labor
58% of the $141bn per year in lives lost on extremely hot or cold days
22% of the $118bn per year in damages to coastal property
31% of the $26bn per year in the health consequences from poor air quality
59% of the $20bn per year in damages to roads
47% of the $8bn per year in inland flooding
The earth would continue to warm even if humans stopped producing greenhouse gases from power plants and cars today. But limiting – if not entirely eliminating – that pollution would substantially reduce risks. Cutting greenhouse gases would provide the biggest benefits in the latter half of this century.
“In the absence of more significant global mitigation efforts, climate change is projected to impose substantial damages on the US economy, human health, and the environment,” the report says. “Under scenarios with high emissions and limited or no adaptation, annual losses in some sectors are estimated to grow to hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century. It is very likely that some physical and ecological impacts will be irreversible for thousands of years, while others will be permanent.”
Ocean warming, for example, is causing coral bleaching around the world. If greenhouse gases rise through the century, nearly all coral reefs will be surrounded by acidified seawater.
Reaching a peak for manmade greenhouse gas growth by the middle of the century in the US would also avoid up to tens of thousands of deaths per year from extreme temperatures and up to thousands of deaths per year from poor air quality.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/27/climate-change-report-trump-air-pollution-global-warming

In its annual emissions gap report, which looks at the gap between carbon reduction policies countries have in place and what is required to keep global warming to well below 2C, the UN says global emissions have reached record highs.
It warns that about half of the G20 countries, including Australia, will fall short of meeting their nationally determined contributions under the Paris agreement and, even if they do meet them, they are still not ambitious enough to restrict warming to the levels needed.
“Current commitments expressed in the NDCs are inadequate to bridge the emissions gap in 2030,” the report warns.
“Technically, it is still possible to bridge the gap to ensure global warming stays well below 2C and 1.5C, but if NDC ambitions are not increased before 2030, exceeding the 1.5C goal can no longer be avoided.”
Australia has committed to an emissions reduction target of 26% to 28% on 2005 levels by 2030.
The UN’s report says: “There has been no improvement in Australia’s climate policy since 2017 and emission levels for 2030 are projected to be well above the NDC target.
“The latest projection published by the government shows that emissions would remain at high levels rather than reducing in line with the 2030 target.”
The report finds that annual global emissions have reached a record high of 53.5 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide.
On current policies, it says, annual global emissions would hit 59 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent by 2030. If countries met their unconditional 2030 targets they would hit 56 gigatonnes.
To have a 66% chance of meeting the 2C Paris target, emissions would need to be down to about 40 gigatonnes a year by 2030 and to achieve the more ambitious target of 1.5C they would need to fall to about 24 gigatonnes.
The UN warned that on current trajectories, the world was on track for about 3C of warming by 2100, with warming to continue after that.
In a special report, the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said the world was nowhere near on track to reach the 1.5C Paris target and that even a half degree more of warming would significantly worsen the risks of droughts, floods and extreme heat for millions of people.
The new emissions gap report says G20 countries including Australia “will need to implement additional policies” to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an additional 2.5 gigatonnes a year to achieve their unconditional commitments under the Paris agreement.
Despite the reports findings, Australia’s environment minister, Melissa Price, said on Wednesday the government had “the right mix of scalable policies to meet our 2030 targets”.
“Policies like the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation have led to emissions reductions in the electricity sector, for instance,” she said.
“And they continue to deliver results. Wind and solar generation in the national electricity market is projected to increase by 250% over the next three years.”
Labor’s climate spokesman, Mark Butler, said the report showed the government had been “hopeless” in taking action on climate change.
“It is a slap in the face for Australians that the prime minister, environment minister and energy minister all repeat the lie that Australia will meet our Paris climate targets in a ‘canter’,” he said.
“The government’s own data, and now the UN, show that under Scott Morrison’s hopeless climate change policies, carbon pollution will continue to rise all the way to 2030 – which is as far as the projections go.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/28/australia-isnt-on-track-to-meet-its-2030-emissions-target-un-report-says

“Heatwave records and fire weather is unprecedented,” Palaszczuk said.
A dust storm, brought by strong westerly winds, covered the southern inland parts of the state. In the north, thousands of native flying foxes died due to the high temperatures.
Reef scientist Terry Hughes, from the coral centre of excellence at James Cook University, said the summer heatwave was “terrifying” and lifted the chances of coral death on the Great Barrier Reef early next year.
This is terrifying. An early summer heatwave breaks all records, lifting the chances of another episode of coral mortality on the #greatBarrierReef next Feb/March. https://t.co/NQkoKhGW5P
The reef sustained successive marine heatwaves, in the early part of 2016 and 2017, which killed corals and badly damaged the northern and central sections.
Hughes said the bleaching forecasts were “trending upwards” but scientists would not have a clear picture until the end of January.
Coral ecophysiologist Dr Neal Cantin, from the Australian Institute of Marine Science, said ocean temperatures remained below those recorded at the same time in 2015 and 2016, but warmer than historical averages.
Cantin said the current heatwave would “add heat and warm up the ocean. It certainly adds heat to the system. We’ve seen record breaking land temperatures this week, which we expect to see into the future with climate change and everything heating up.
“We’re in a watch phase. There’s definitely the potential and how the local weather patterns pan out in January and February will really determine whether we get a large scale bleaching event or not.
“There are some signs we may avoid [bleaching] this summer. At this stage it’s less likely to be as bad as 2016, but we’ll be ready to respond [if bleaching occurs].”
“The hazard I worry most about is heatwaves,” Andrew Gissing, a disaster management expert from the firm Risk Frontiers, said.
“Australia needs to be better prepared for heatwaves, with climate change we are already predicting they will get more severe.”
Gissing told Guardian Australia people often respond to extreme weather events and natural disasters based on their previous experiences. But he said governments, businesses and individuals were often not prepared for the increasing severity and frequency of such events.
“We did a lot of work in Lismore after Cyclone Debbie. So many people sheltered in their homes because that’s what they always did when it flooded. They just didn’t realise this flood was that much bigger
“People really need to be attuned to what’s actually happening ... how the nature of climactic hazards is changing.”
Gissing said businesses needed to start investing in climate change mitigation and adaption measures.
“It’s going to be very hard to mitigate a lot of the [predicted climate] impacts, so adaptation for the future is going to be really important. Especially when you overlay climate change on a growing population base.
“The [number of people living on the Queensland coast] is likely to double by about 2030. Because of climate change, we’re looking at there being more exposure [to disaster risks] there as well.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/28/great-barrier-reef-record-heatwave-may-cause-another-coral-bleaching-event

Yet only a month ago, the government’s own advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, argued strongly that current methods being used to protect England’s coastal communities are not fit for purpose. Their report showed that between 2005 and 2014, over 15,000 buildings were built in coastal areas at significant risk of coastal flooding and/or erosion.
And, if the government meets its ambitious targets, 90,000 homes might well be built in the next five years in areas of significant annual flood risk from all sources of flooding, including coastal flooding.

• So the “power plant in Edenderry, County Offaly, no longer burns peat and relies increasingly on biomass” (Peat harvesting to end as Ireland grapples with climate change, 27 November).
This may indeed be worthy. However, peat is regarded by Finland as a slow-renewing biomass fuel. And, while the Irish can certainly do more to clean up their act, Ireland produces 7.3 tonnes of CO2 per capita, while Germany manages a whole 8.9 tonnes. Other UK “allies” further up the list include the UAE (23.3), Kuwait (25.2) and the truly awful Qatar (45.5). (All figures World Bank data, 2014.) Let’s not bash our Irish friends too much.Alastair EdwardsNová Ves nad Nisou, Czech Republic 
• While ending the cutting and burning of Ireland’s peat bogs (which are huge stores of carbon) is welcome the alternative is worse. As in Scotland, most Irish wind turbines are erected on bogland which can decompose for hundreds of metres round every turbine, releasing millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide.
Wind farms may eventually emit more carbon than an equivalent coal-fired power station.Dr John DohertyGweedore, County Donegal, Ireland

Providing a healthy, affordable, and environmentally friendly diet for all people will require a radical transformation of the system, says the report by the InterAcademy Partnership (IAP). This will depend on better farming methods, wealthy nations consuming less meat and countries valuing food which is nutritious rather than cheap.
The report, which was peer reviewed and took three years to compile, sets out the scale of the problems as well as evidence-driven solutions. 
The global food system is responsible for a third of all greenhouse gas emissions, which is more than all emissions from transport, heating, lighting and air conditioning combined. The global warming this is causing is now damaging food production through extreme weather events such as floods and droughts.
The food system also fails to properly nourish billions of people. More than 820 million people went hungry last year, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, while a third of all people did not get enough vitamins. At the same time, 600 million people were classed as obese and 2 billion overweight, with serious consequences for their health. On top of this, more than 1bn tonnes of food is wasted every year, a third of the total produced.
“The global food system is broken,” said Tim Benton, professor of population ecology, at the University of Leeds, who is a member of one of the expert editorial groups which produced the report. He said the cost of the damage to human health and the environment was much greater than the profits made by the farming industry.
“Whether you look at it from a human health, environmental or climate perspective, our food system is currently unsustainable and given the challenges that will come from a rising global population that is a really [serious] thing to say,” Benton said.
Reducing meat and dairy consumption is the single biggest way individuals can lessen their impact on the planet, according to recent research. And tackling dangerous global warming is considered impossible without massive reductions in meat consumption. 
Research published in the journal Climate Policy shows that at the present rate, cattle and other livestock will be responsible for half of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, and that to prevent this will require “substantial reductions, far beyond what are planned or realistic, from other sectors”.
“It is vital [for a liveable planet] that we change our relationship with meat, especially with red meat. But no expert in this area is saying the world should be vegan or even vegetarian,” said Benton.
Rearing cattle and other livestock causes the same carbon emissions as all the world’s vehicles, trains, ships and planes combined. “We have spent 30 to 40 years investing quite heavily on fuel efficiency in the transport sector,” said Benton. “We need do something similarly radical in the farming sector and the scope for doing that by changing the way we raise the animals is much smaller than the scope we have by changing our diets.”
The IAP report notes that in poorer countries meat, eggs and dairy can be important in providing concentrated nutrients, especially for children. It also says other things livestock can provide should be taken into consideration, such as leather, wool, manure, transport and plough pulling.
The UN climate change conference, COP24, which starts on Sunday in Katowice, Poland, is an opportunity for political action, said Joachim von Braun, a professor who co-chairs the IAP project. “Our food systems are failing us. Agriculture and consumer choices are major factors driving disastrous climate change.”
Another member of the IAP editorial group, Aifric O’Sullivan, from University College Dublin, said: “We need to ensure that policymakers inform consumers about the climate impacts of their food choices, provide incentives for consumers to change their diets, and reduce food loss and waste.”
The report recommends many actions that could help deliver the “whole-scale root and branch transformation” that is required, said Benton. These include crops that are more resilient to climate change, smarter crop rotation, soil protection, precier use of fertilisers and less use of pesticides. It also backs innovation such as laboratory-grown meat and insect-based foods.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/28/global-food-system-is-broken-say-worlds-science-academies

We will explore the key findings each day this week.
Donald Trump doesn’t believe his own government’s major report on climate change – which the administration tried to bury over the Thanksgiving break. It warns that rising temperatures are already harming America and will cause huge damage globally.
Water will become increasingly difficult to manage in the face of climate change. Government planners are already having a harder time supplying clean water to America’s general population, farmers and ecosystems, as aquifers are being depleted in many regions of the US.
And with climate change and rising temperatures, they will be battling an even deeper worsening of droughts and more flooding from intense rainfall events.
In 2011, flooding on the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers caused $5.7bn in damages. But a year later, drought conditions in many of the same areas cost the US $33bn and devastated crop harvests.
In California, a drought from 2011 to 2016 was followed by heavy rainfall that caused record flooding, landslides and erosion.
Those pendulum swings could become the normal situation, and water-related disaster events are already costing the US hundreds of billions of dollars a year in damages.
Warmer water will also harm ecosystems and there could be more problems from pollutant runoff into water bodies that are used as human water supplies. Harmful algal blooms, like one that shut down the water supply in Toledo, Ohio, could increase as the warm season lengthens. On the coasts, salt water will increasingly intrude into coastal rivers and aquifers as sea levels rise.
Additionally, public water systems are ageing and will have trouble keeping up with climate change, requiring massive investments.
“A central challenge to water planning and management is learning to plan for plausible future climate conditions that are wider in range than those experienced in the past,” the report says, noting that the challenge is both scientific and political, requiring new approaches and changes to regulatory and legal structures.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/28/climate-report-trump-tried-kill-key-finding-water-battle

Billions of hours of farmwork has been lost during high temperatures and global warming has damaged the ability to grow crops, it said.
The Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change was produced by 150 experts from 27 universities and institutions including the World Health Organization and the World Bank.
“The findings are clear and the stakes could not be higher,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director-general. “We cannot delay action on climate change. We cannot sleepwalk through this health emergency any longer.”
The report sets out the impacts of global warming on health in stark terms. ”A rapidly changing climate has dire implications for every aspect of human life, exposing vulnerable populations to extremes of weather, altering patterns of infectious disease, and compromising food security, safe drinking water and clean air,” it said.
Nick Watt, the executive director of the Lancet Countdown, said: “These are not things happening in 2050 but are things we are already seeing today. We think of these as the canary in, ironically, the coalmine.”
On Tuesday the UN said action to cut carbon emissions must be tripled to avoid catastrophic warming. International climate change negotiations were due to resume on Monday in Poland.
The Lancet report said the lack of progress “threatens both human lives and the viability of the national health systems they depend on, with the potential to overwhelm health services”.
A survey in the report of leaders of almost 500 global cities found half expected their public health infrastructure to be seriously compromised by climate change, meaning systemic failures such as the shutdown of hospitals. 
A heatwave in Europe this summer was linked to hundreds of premature deaths in the UK alone. MPs said in July that the UK was “woefully unprepared” for heatwaves.
The Lancet report says populations in Europe and the eastern Mediterranean are at higher risk than those in Africa and south-east Asia because of the high proportion of vulnerable and elderly people living in cities.
As temperatures rise across the world, the report says 157 million more vulnerable people were subjected to a heatwave in 2017 than in 2000. Hot conditions directly damage health via heatstroke, but dehydration and exacerbation of conditions such as heart disease are also very dangerous. Heat also worsens air pollution and mental health problems.
Prof Kristie Ebi, of the University of Washington, said: “Increased mortality in extreme heatwaves is happening now [but] there is abundant evidence that communities are not prepared for the ongoing increases in the frequency, intensity and duration of heatwaves.”
The Lancet report said 153bn hours of work were lost in 2017 due to extreme heat, 80% of it in agriculture. Almost half the losses were in India, equivalent to 7% of its total working population, while China lost the equivalent of 1.4% of its workers. “This has led to vast losses for national economies and household budgets,” said Prof Joacim Rocklöv of Umeå University in Sweden.
Relatively small changes in temperatures and rainfall could cause large changes in the transmission of infectious diseases spread via water and mosquitoes. The ability of the dengue fever virus to be transmitted – its “vectorial capacity” – reached a record high in 2016, according to the report, 10% above a 1950s baseline. The danger from cholera risk was also rising in regions such as the Baltic states where the sea has been warming rapidly.
Doctors not involved in the report said it presented convincing evidence. “It is clear that climate change is directly impacting our health,” said Howard Frumkin, head of the Wellcome Trust’s Our Planet, Our Health programme. “All sectors must prioritise action on climate change if we are to significantly reduce the potentially devastating impact on our planet and our health, affecting generations to come.”
Prof Paul Ekins, of University College London, said the health benefits of tackling climate change had long been undervalued, with just 5% of funding for adaptation to global warming being spent on health.
“These benefits are enormous, near-term and affect our health immediately,” Ekins said. “If you factor in these benefits, cutting emissions to [keep the temperature rise below] 1.5C is going to be a net benefit to humanity in monetary terms.”
The Lancet report noted some promising trends, such as the phase-out of coal and the growth of electric cars.
Prof Hilary Graham, of the University of York and part of the Lancet Countdown team, said linking health and climate change could help spur further action. “Health is what people feel.

The Bureau of Meteorology’s latest outlook for summer warns that most of Australia has an 80% chance of higher-than-normal temperatures between December and February.
Meanwhile, the chance of an El Niño forming before the end of 2018 and bringing even more drier and warmer conditions to eastern Australia is now at 70%, roughly triple the normal risk.
“We’ve already seen extremely hot temperatures through parts of north and central Queensland in recent days and this should act as an important reminder of the kinds of conditions we can get during an Australian summer,” the bureau’s manager of long-range forecasting Dr Andrew Watkins said.
The forecast of a long, hot summer has increased the chances of Australia recording one of its warmest years on record and sparked fresh warnings about the heightened bushfire risk across southern Australia.
While parts of the drought-stricken eastern states have enjoyed some recent rain and there have been huge downpours along the NSW coast during this week’s storms, experts are warning it won’t be long before the hot summer temperatures dry out ground vegetation.
“Above-normal fire potential remains across large parts of southern Australia,” the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre said in its seasonal bushfire outlook, also released on Thursday.
As part of its summer outlook, the Bureau of Meteorology has forecast a drier-than-average summer for large parts of Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory.
“Having said that, locally heavy rainfall events similar to what we have seen in NSW in the last two days are always a possibility during summer, no matter what the outlook is showing,” Watkins said.
NSW has recorded its eighth driest and fourth hottest April-November on record, with Queensland and Victoria having experienced similar conditions.
The dry, hot weather that stretched from autumn into spring is now driving expectations of an above-normal fire risk this summer for large parts of Queensland, NSW, the ACT, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia.
The Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre report said several months of above-average rainfall is needed to improve the general dryness across the landscape.
“The dry landscape means that any warm windy conditions are likely to see elevated fire risk,” it said.
“Recent rainfall has not been significant enough to drastically change the vegetation [fuel] loads, with many southern and eastern areas already cured or carrying little grass growth.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/nov/29/australias-summer-outlook-soaring-temperatures-and-bushfire-risk

and then, like you say (and i've been flamed on here before for using the term 'keep the lights on') there are always going to be times when you need to pull juice for one reason or another (night time, batteries low, failure/maintenance). 
i can see a time when you will pay the grid to put power in, but sell it to a third party at the same time. similarly, pulling power out from the generator (coal or otherwise) will come at an absolute premium cost.

By far the biggest hurdle is getting those who care about climate change to understand the reality of what the science says - that for limiting warming to 1.5 degrees that the world needs to halve its emissions by 2030 (and Australia has a moral obligation to do more than this). 
The people who care then need to recognise that the ALP is not planning to get anywhere near this level of cuts in TOTAL emissions.

Certainly criticise Labor for Adani but it's bs to say that Labor is the same as the coalition on climate change and the environment.
BQENDUnfortunately when it comes to climate change it is true that both the LNP and ALP are promising to do so little that they will have Australia do its bit to take global warming to well over 2 degrees.

I see climate change as by far the biggest issue, but voting 1 Green is also easy for me because as a progressive I support almost all of there other policies.

From rural Victoria to Townsville, we are walking out of school for a day or more to tell our politicians to listen to us and protect our futures.
We are Milou, Jean and Harriet and we are 14 years old.
Two of us – Milou and Harriet – live in rural Victoria. Throughout our lives, we’ve witnessed the impacts that drought, bushfires and extreme weather have on a community. We have been forced to evacuate when a bushfire came through our town. It was scary. But it is something that will happen more and more as climate change gets worse.
We feel frustrated and let down when we think about the climate crisis and our future. There is so much our politicians could be doing that they aren’t. It seems they are in denial. Our government is supposed to protect us, not destroy our chances of a safe future.
Climate change doesn’t only affect our environment. It affects our physical and mental wellbeing. Milou’s mum is a psychologist and she knows how much something like a bushfire can threaten everything a person cares about. It’s hard to hold on to dreams for the future when we don’t know what that future holds.
We feel hurt when we hear people say that we can’t think for ourselves because we’re still children. This is just an excuse not to listen to us. We are perfectly capable of thinking for ourselves. We deserve to be heard and understood.
As kids, we can’t yet vote or run for government, however scientists say there’s only about a decade left for us to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. By the time our generation is making decisions, it will be too late. We’re striking from school to push for urgent change now.
We were inspired after seeing 15-year-old Greta from Sweden in the newspaper. She’s striking every Friday to put climate change in the spotlight in her country. Australia is even more vulnerable to climate change impacts, which is why we are doing the same here.
We are also inspired by the stories of other kids in our community’s history who did big things to stand up for their values. Jean goes to Fort Street high and in the 60s, kids from her school went on strike to protest the war in Vietnam. They took a stand to help stop the atrocity. Young people have always been part of big movements for social change, and we intend to be the same.
None of us want to grow up in a world where dangerous bushfires and crippling droughts are normal, where we struggle through extreme heatwaves, and where young people lose their homes to sea level rise.
We are often told to count our blessings. We feel lucky to live in such caring communities. But, when we think of all our blessings, it also makes us want to cry. The idea that our children and grandchildren may not get to experience the beautiful world that we live in, is one of the saddest things we can think of.
We want to live in a world powered by 100% renewable energy. We don’t want massive new coalmines like Adani’s that will wreck the climate and our future.
Although we love school and learning, we love our family, friends and community more. And we will do anything to ensure all of us have a safe planet to live on. So, we are striking from school to save our future, and the futures of the people we love and those not yet with us.
""We might not be able to vote, but we have rights. We have a right to a future."" Words from an 8 year old. 🌏🌏🌏🌏🌏🌏🌏🌏🌏🌏🌏🌏🌏 #schoolstrike4climate #schoolstrike #climatechange #climatechaos #actnow #voicesofyouth #voicesofchildren. pic.twitter.com/fOHVeedj9N
And we have a message for our politicians: it’s time to listen to us. You cannot continue pretending we are not here, and that climate change is OK. Because we are here. The climate crisis is here, and it is destroying our planet. People’s lives and livelihoods are on the line. We have trusted you to do what is in the best interest of our country, and it is clear to us that you aren’t doing enough.
At the end of November, we are going on strike together with kids from across Australia to get our voices heard.

Is this 'alarmist hyperbole' reporting?
BQEND
You obviously didn't understand the argument.
rebel7 claimed Macron was saving the planet - which is patent nonsense and alarmist hyperbole. As I pointed out and you ignored, he was passing laws in France for them to achieve their Paris commitments.
Further he commented that people were rioting over this and were they lunatics ?
Well yes as it happens. From the article you selectively quoted from:-
BQSTART
The interior minister, Christophe Castaner, said thousands of troublemakers unconnected to the peaceful demonstrations had deliberately come to “pillage, smash, steal, wound and even kill”. He called them rioters who were “professionals at causing disorder”. 
Authorities suggested extreme-right and extreme-left militants were involved in the rioting. 
BQEND
BQSTART
Across France, more than 75,000 gilets jaunes demonstrated in cities or blocked roads and toll booths,
BQEND
Somewhat fewer than the 250,000 you claimed elsewhere.In Paris, 5,000 protestors out of a city of 2.2 million.And of those protestors only a small minority who had infiltrated them decided too go on the rampage.What did the genuine protestors say (also quoted):
BQSTART
“What message do the yellow vests want to pass today? That we set France on fire, or find solutions? I find this [violence] absurd,” Jacline Mouraud, a prominent activist within the movement, told BFM television.
BQEND
Of course, its also easy to find anonymous rent-a-quote people:-
BQSTART
However, another protester said: “The government is not listening. Revolution cannot happen without violence.”
BQEND
But then, for people who want to protect their corporate fossil fuel sponsored seminars, anything can be taken out of context to present a genuine national level of protest.

very curious that you combine neoclassical economics with neoliberalism.
BQENDIndeed. I was surprised to find that they are synonyms. Neoliberalism
is  Neo-Classical Economics. Globalism is a separate thing, but necessarily corrupted due to the model of economics being extended.
We inescapably have to go back to Classical economics because it was the last known good boot of economic theory. There is no theoretical framework underpinning modern economics.
BQSTART
Neoclassical economics is the idiom of most economic discourse today. It is the paradigm that bends the twigs of young minds. Then it confines the florescence of older ones, like chicken-wire shaping a topiary. It took form about a hundred years ago, when Henry George and his reform proposals were a clear and present political danger and challenge to the landed and intellectual establishments of the world. 
Few people realize to what degree the founders ofNeo-classical economics changed the discipline for the express purpose of deflecting George and frustrating future students seeking to follow his arguments. The strategem was semantic: to destroy the very words in which he expressed himself. 
Simon Patten expounded it succinctly. ""Nothing pleases a ... single taxer better than ... to use the well-known economic theories ... [therefore] economic doctrine must be recast"" (Patten, 1908: 219; Collier, 1979: 270).'
BQEND ~ Masson Gaffney, intro to
The Corruption of Economics, 1994.

Hundreds of arrests in Paris as ‘gilets jaunes’ protest turns violentAt least 100 people injured in street battles, with cars being torched and shops raidedAcross France, more than 75,000 gilets jaunes demonstrated in cities or blocked roads and toll booths, some briefly stormed the runway of Nantes airport and others blocked supermarkets and major motorway junctions or staged barricades near government buildings. There were 580 roadblocks across the country.
In the past two weeks, hundreds of thousands of protesters have taken similar action, complaining that Macron’s pro-business fuel tax policy was unfair and that people in low-income jobs could not make ends meet.
Hundreds of people have been injured and two people have been killed in car accidents since the protests began on 17 November. Polls continue to show that the demonstrations are supported by most French people. The protests have also spawned copycat demonstrations in Belgium.

AGW is a threat multiplier as it will render military systems unable to respond effectively to a more military or terrorist orientated threat.
Therefore it is incumbent upon them to identify this threat, inform the government, and ensure that the threat is prevented, mitigated or adapted to.

Incorrect.Firstly, we need to cut back our CO2e emissions and related consumption using new technologies like renewables, whilst also cleaning up our act on other forms of environmental degradation (over fishing, over eating, over farming etc). Our current use of power is inefficient. The Americans in particular are on a par with Europe in terms of lifestyle, but for a much higher carbon footprint - so its an easy win there if only it weren't for their politicians.
Secondly, we then need to provide the technology and know how to the developing world so they avoid treading the same path we did, and repeat the mistakes we have made.
Thirdly, collectively we need to work out how best to limit if not un-do the damage that has been done since the industrial revolution, whilst maintaining a decent and efficient level of lifestyle for all.

The die off was not only a result of high water temperatures but also ocean circulation changes
BQEND
My comment was aimed specifically at a post that declared that the die off was caused by 'cooling', so that is what I directly addressed. Although technically accurate regarding H2S, I find your post a bit myopic. The earth and the oceans did increase dramatically in temperature, but there are many factors that create/exacerbate die-offs. While it is true there were sulphur blooms, I believe it is a fallacy to blame these blooms for the entire 'extinction event'. The warmer water would have redistributed phytoplankton and also would likely have caused massive algae blooms that created areas so anaerobic that they could not support life. There is also some (controversial) evidence of seabed Methane Clathrate releases being a factor during the Event. 
The PT Extinction Event was a long slow process with many moving and interrelated parts and processes. I believe it is important to note that while there was a 96% die off of marine life, there was also a 70% reduction in terrestrial species, which would have not been directly effected by underwater sulphur releases. I think it is inaccurate to point to any specific mechanism as the 'cause' of the Event. (That said, I think it would be hard to argue the event would have happened without a 1 Million year long series of massive volcanic eruptions.)', u'recommendation_count': u'3', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1543678344000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'cooling', u'effect': u'the die off'}, {u'cause': u'the warmer water', u'effect': u'massive algae blooms that created areas so anaerobic that they could not support life'}], u'author_id': u'4431034', u'in_reply_to': u'123192416', u'id': u'123208059', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Matt Quinn', u'text': u'* Books were expensive, yet Progress and Poverty became the only book in history to outsell the Bible in a single year(globally), which it did for over twenty years.

All true, yet surely the more dominant signal is carried by the systematic corruption of economics itself. The ultimate reason behind all the reasons. This story is going to sound ridiculous, but it's a matter of historical record.
In 1879 an unknown journalist in then-remote San Francisco set out to discover why the worst poverty always seemed to accompany the most progress. Succeeding spectacularly, his book Progress and Poverty became an international bestseller, for George showed how social justice was possible in this life, not just the hereafter. 
Books were expensive, yet Progress and Poverty became the only book in history to outsell the Bible for over twenty years, sparking a worldwide movement.
George explicitly acknowledges that Land(the Earth itself) is the source of all wealth(what you want/need) in concert with Labor. Capital(wealth reserved to make more wealth) provides productivity tools. 
Three parties divided the output: Landowner, Laborer and Capitalist. The landowner was exposed as obviously unneeded, a parasitic burden and also(or hence) a hopelessly wrongheaded control center for the entire group. 
When George out-polled Teddy Roosevelt for Mayor of New York in 1886, he gravely threatened privileged global power elites, so they erased him from history. A mind compared, in his time with Plato, Copernicus, Adam Smith just wiped from living memory by rent-seekers.
In the process they emasculated the discipline of economics, stripped dignity from labor, and set in motion a planet-wrecking doctrine. Neo-Classical Economics(aka neoliberalism) was born.
Einstein, a fan of George, used his methods of thought-experiment and powerful inductive reasoning to discover relativity, twenty years later. If Einstein had been silenced so effectively, relativity would still await rediscovery.

Senior IPCC official Ottmar Edenhofer has openly said, “One has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy. Instead, climate change policy is about how we redistribute … the world’s wealth.” There you have it from a climate change insider: The real agenda is wealth redistribution. Climate change is merely a convenient pretext.""
BQEND
What a load of uniformed, cherry picked and context shifting nonsense, here is what Edenhofer actually said, in full and in context.

EDENHOFER:
 Basically it's a big mistake to discuss climate policy separately from the major themes of globalization. The climate summit in Cancun at the end of the month is not a climate conference, but one of the largest economic conferences since the Second World War. Why? Because we have 11,000 gigatons of carbon in the coal reserves in the soil under our feet - and we must emit only 400 gigatons in the atmosphere if we want to keep the 2-degree target. 11,000 to 400 - there is no getting around the fact that most of the fossil reserves must remain in the soil.

 NZZ AM SONNTAG: 
De facto, this means an expropriation of the countries with natural resources. This leads to a very different development from that which has been triggered by development policy.

 EDENHOFER: 
First of all, developed countries have basically expropriated the atmosphere of the world community. But one must say clearly that we redistribute de facto the world's wealth by climate policy. Obviously, the owners of coal and oil will not be enthusiastic about this. One has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy.

That is true, although there are different modes of vulcanism and not all have the same effect on the atmosphere. That said, one of the theories behind the great die off event is that vulcanism caused an abrupt cooling, which in turn altered ocean circulation patterns from stagnation to upwelling, and the upwelling of previously stagnant deep ocean waters is the agent of the mass die off, bringing with it as it did large amounts of hydrogen sulphide.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1543608139000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'vulcanism', u'effect': u'an abrupt cooling which in turn altered ocean circulation patterns from stagnation to upwelling and'}], u'author_id': u'3638543', u'in_reply_to': u'123183963', u'id': u'123192628', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'rebel7', u'text': u'Then don't.

There are certainly political and economic aspects but the main problem lies in the minds of the people. Somehow hurricane flooding and wildfires aren't enough to change those minds.

The oceans are not acidic, and never would be even if we consumed all known fossil fuel reserves, as this paper by Pieter Tans shows.
The ocean is well buffered by carbonate sediments and corals survived and thrived when the atmospheric CO2 was anywhere from 2 to 5 times higher than now, so higher CO2 is not a long term issue. The argument generally put forward is that CO2 is increasing too fast for the buffering to keep the oceans basic, but the math shows that pH in any case will remain basic no matter how much fossil fuel is used (and not much different than it is now).
The climate movement has been using every natural negative event, like H2S upwelling as evidence of human caused climate change, but when you look at the evidence from paleo and recent history, it's pretty clear a lot of these events, be they California wildfires, euxinic upwelling, or hurricane frequency and intensity, are not unusual in the context of the Holocene, or even recent history.', u'recommendation_count': u'3', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1543596389000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'3638543', u'in_reply_to': u'123183783', u'id': u'123186279', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Michael J Ahles', u'text': u'An analogy: We are all on a ship together when the captain announces the ship is sinking and everyone on board must grab a bucket and start bailing.

The lives of millions would be upended, if not made nearly impossible to survive, by transformed weather patterns and resource scarcity. Tens of millions would become migrants as regions became uninhabitable. Millions would die, more and more as time went on. If this science fiction were reality, US leaders would lead an international effort to immediately disarm and dismantle the weapons.
But this isn’t science fiction. Climate change is a ticking time bomb, literally threatening to end human life on earth over the coming centuries. As climate journalist Peter Brannen describes it, Earth faced a similar crisis hundreds of millions of years ago during the “Great Dying” when volcanoes spewed so much carbon dioxide into the air – including magma that blanketed an area as large as the lower 48 US states, 1km deep – that it almost killed all life. Today, Brannen says, “we’re shooting carbon dioxide up into the atmosphere 10 times faster than the ancient volcanoes”.
Even in the shorter term, climate change will make the world far more dangerous. A World Bank Group report estimates that climate change could drive 140 million people to move within their countries’ borders by 2050. A report by the Trump administration finds climate change could reduce the size of the US economy by 10% – more than twice as bad as the worst part of the Great Recession – by 2100. Growing resource scarcity could cause more wars. Deadly and destructive extreme weather events such as Hurricanes Harvey and Maria and California’s Camp fire are mild symptoms of the plague to come.
There is no greater national security threat than climate change. Even the specter of nuclear war between great powers – the only thing that could remotely mimic the effects of climate change over time – is a much lower risk than climate change, which is already happening.
Every year we fail to act the problem grows, and the solution becomes more difficult. As America dithers, climate change is sparking a slow-motion nuclear-scale holocaust. If the world fails to urgently mitigate climate change, no other challenge – not the rise of China, Russian aggression, terrorism, nor some other future geopolitical peril – will matter because humans won’t survive to be the cause of these threats or suffer from them.
America’s failure is not for lack of capacity to safeguard against future threats – the US invests hundreds of billions of dollars every year in defense to deter adversaries such as Russia and China, and tens of billions more in intelligence capabilities to monitor threats. Instead, America is paralyzed by a lack of political will. Donald Trump and his allies in Congress – many of whom deny the existence of climate change – are making the problem worse. The president announced his intent to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement and is rolling back regulations that would have cut emissions.
Despite this dark reality, there is reason for hope. In 2015, the world came together to negotiate the Paris agreement, which set the goal of limiting global temperature increases to well below 2C. Despite a hostile Trump administration, many US governors, mayors, businesses and private citizens are already leading the way. So are other countries as they seize the economic and public health opportunity that comes with a clean energy future.
The path ahead, to say the least, is daunting. Even if the US were not to leave the Paris climate agreement, the action required to realize its potential is enormous. US policymakers will need to use every policy tool in their toolbox to drive unprecedented deployment of clean energy and build out zero-carbon transportation infrastructure. When the US leads by example, domestic emissions will fall, and new diplomatic doors to more ambitious climate action will open.
Climate activist Bill McKibben says that “global warming … is a world war aimed at us all” and recommends that, like the national effort forged during the second world war to defeat the Axis powers, the US must “mobilize” American industry and citizens to transform to a clean energy economy.
Everybody will need to pitch in. For example, when the Obama administration was negotiating the bilateral climate deal with China in 2014 that made the Paris agreement possible, my colleagues and I in the east Asia bureau at the state department worked with the US climate negotiators on a statement with the 10 nations of Asean committing to cut emissions – a statement only made possible by the US-China deal. The painstaking negotiations for this relatively symbolic statement were indicative of how much work the US needs to put into the climate effort in every corner of the world – and the ripple effects it can have elsewhere.
It’s time for the US to treat climate change as the national security challenge it is. Diplomats are ready to negotiate new agreements. Development experts can support sustainable solutions for countries facing resource scarcity and in need of resilient infrastructure and community designs that can withstand more intense and damaging extreme weather events. The military can help respond to extreme weather disasters. National security experts around the world already recognize climate change as a serious threat to global stability and are ready to answer a global call to action.
Without success in tackling climate change, eventually none of the other threats we face will matter.

Your belief that capitalism (the market economy) is the ideal assumes that human societal development has effectively stopped. The ruling monarchies of the past made much the same arguments to preserve the feudal model which elevated them to the pinnacle of power and privilege. 
Capitalism will not allow itself to be regulated to meet the needs of the majority because it’s fundamentally based on the exploitation of the majority working class. This is why the social democratic reformist model is crumbling all around us now.
Capitalism only conceded ground to Labour in the revolutionary post WWII period when it was forced to or risk being swept away by the working class who had been slaughtered in their tens of millions as the capitalist elites grappled for ever more wealth and power. Thus the gains made under social democracy (full employment, universal health & education, public housing etc) were paid for with tens of millions of lives and as ever under capitalism those gains were temporary as capital will always attempt to claw back what it has lost.
So Social democracy appeared to work during the post WWII upswing from 1945 until the early 70s. Since then we’ve had the neoliberal era which is reversing all of the gains made by the majority labour class during the post war boom. During this era capitalism has bought off social democracy and absorbed it into itself. The Blairite Labour party here and the Socialist Party in France etc are examples of this betrayal. Our democracy is largely an illusion. The world is now run almost exclusively in the interest of the minority big capital owning class. 
Capitalism won’t allow itself to be reformed and regulated to provide for the welfare of all. It’s fundamentally based on the exploitation of the majority to enrich the few. As long as the 1% hold such wealth and power, they’ll bend society to their will. We can see this is the relentless assault on the living standards of the working class under the neoliberal era. The capitalist class could not accept the advances made by the labour class and have been systematically dismantling those gains for the past 40 years.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1509704804000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'it \u2019s fundamentally based on the exploitation of the majority working class', u'effect': u'to meet the needs of the majority'}], u'author_id': u'17748976', u'in_reply_to': u'107696530', u'id': u'107715995', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'pantokrator', u'text': u'Please point out my ad homing.

What's required is a conscious, engaged and intelligent populace of all types and strata, and your simplistic existential postulate is innately flawed -- the choice is not between capitalism or socialism, but fascism and socialism and their warped control of a market economy. There IS a distinction between a market-based economic structure with capital and labor in well-regulated roles (regulatory action taken as lightly as need be, but definitely strong and assertive enough as necessary to be a viable guiding and governing function), and either of those extremes I've identified (where barbarism in one form or another would truly flourish).

Once upon a time the wizards who explored the ocean, the air, fire-breathing mountains and stars and everything else said that to burn rocks for comfort could kill the planet by heating it up. Because of this every old poor woman, man and child died by freezing to death in their own homes, exactly like the sceptics said would happen - while the temperature of the entire planet continued to drop fast - exactly as they said would happen despite the popularity of magical stones. The End. 
Version 2: 
Once upon a time the wizards who explored the ocean, the air, fire-breathing mountains and stars and everything else said that to burn rocks for comfort could kill the planet. The goblins that feasted on selling these rocks fought back and payed leaders of tribes and fake wizards to confuse the people. Saying things like ""without our rocks people with no money will freeze to death"" and ""our rocks feed life"". It worked for many decades - because people were used to needing rocks as a necessity. Many were willing to sell own children and grandchildren - the entire future to get access of the rocks. 
But some of the children survived. And started to doubt the fake payed wizards and tribal leaders who were getting old. They even started to doubt own parents who were willing to sell them for it. 
So they proved that the rocks were less magical and needed to keep old people alive. They started to harvest the wind. The waves. The sun. And the goblins got very angry for seeing that people started to question the need for their rocks. 
The goblins started to talk about freedom. Way of living. The value of culture of living in their magical rock-age. 
And in the mean time one observed that old people did not die from freezing to death more than before. And the young kids started to ask questions of why the established conveyor-belt of goblin-stones could only be used to transport them. Why could they not also be used to transport the energy from the wind and rain and waves and the sun itself?
The goblins said it was impossible. And argued that their stones at least needed to be used for base-load of the conveyor belt. All while the cooling they had promised refused to show up. 
And after generations of this battle, the goblins died out. But not before they had changed the planet according to what the old wizards had warned about. Whole spices had died out. The magic of the atmosphere and ocean and ice had changed for as long as human memory could exist. The 4.5 billion year old story of magic of balanced nature had ended. The time of non-magical intellectual management of what was left of the magical times took over. 
Resources became directed at protecting and micro-managing the remnants of the 4.5 billion years of natural magic. Helicopters were used as Arks to save the last of spices from times past. Taxes were pushed up to pay for the cost of protecting people and the fish in the ocean itself. Humanity itself were allocated to manually plant forests that for billions of years had planted themselves. The energy produced went into sucking up waste from the Goblin's stones, both in the ocean and in the atmosphere. And millions died. Every year. Because not everyone could pay for that cost. 
Now, this tale is written in runes in bedrock. In hope that the same mistake will not happen again. 
But we know humans. It will happen again. The willingness to sell magical rocks for profit is equal to the willingness to become rich from selling the milk of the poppy - or anything else. Suffering is secondary. As long as the goblin have enough profit to not encounter it herself in own life-time. 
It will happen again, of course - because humans see own life as an equal chance to become goblin with own island and private dragon to fly himself there. It is the dream of humans to become goblin - and afford to not encounter reality of suffering. It is the inner goblin of humans that make it easy to blame the masses - never oneself. This is what makes the runes eternal. 
Therefore - the masses of humanity and the only planet known to have life are doomed to suffering. It is the price one pay for goblins. After slavery. After religion. After treating a gender and race as secondary for profit. After monopoly fails. After magic of rocks....goblins will find new truth to sell - without thought of suffering of masses or a planet as collateral damage. 
We have to live this cycle. Because we know that goblins will rather blow up the whole planet with bombs that wizards made possible than to accept the the end of goblin cycles. It is the human condition. 
And every time - wizards and the suffering must try to stop them before they kill everything. 
It is the never-ending story. Goblins vs understanding, compassion and suffering.

Our daily lives seem to have become as dark and disturbing as anything dreamed up by the brothers Grimm, or written down by Charles Perrault, the great 17th-century chronicler of folk and fairytales.
Folk tales emerge in times of upheaval, and from societies’ grimmest moments. They enable us to process and assimilate extreme experience, and deal with our fears. They also, typically, communicate powerful and uncompromising moral narratives. It’s not hard to draw a map of current major global problems with reference to them.
The most powerful kingdom in the world, for example, falls into the hands of a ruler who is equal parts the insatiable, comfortless greed of Midas, and the vanity of Narcissus, who disdains those who love him, and the self-delusions of the naked emperor. Remind you of anyone?
And just as it may be the season of flamboyant, escapist horror, it can be frightening when we discover that places we thought, or trusted to be safe, turn out to be concealing predators. Almost daily at the moment, another male impresario or figure with other power is revealed as the wolf that befriends with an ulterior motive the young and vulnerable, or perhaps the charming vampire seeking to satisfy its lust.
This, of course, is one of the other functions of folk tales – they are cautionary and teach us to identify risks. Across cultures you will find stories designed to keep us away from danger, with many applicable to a warming world.
The kelpies of Scottish folklore carried children to watery graves, while the Inuit told tales of the Qallupilluit, who lived beneath the ice and would steal children through its melting cracks.
One of our greatest contemporary threats is our wholesale abuse of the natural world. Seas are polluted with plastic and acidifying, the atmosphere loaded with more carbon dioxide than human civilisation has ever experienced, and a mass extinction event underway, visible recently in the large-scale die-off of insect life. Folk tales are a guide to the consequences of such short-sighted self-centredness.
King Canute was the monarch who vainly tried to command the seas not to rise. In fact Canute was demonstrating the opposite to his courtiers, the ultimate limits of kingly power and humankind’s attempts to command nature.
And the story of killing the goose that lays the golden egg in order to extract its riches, and finding nothing, stands as a parable for how we over-exploit the environment everywhere from our seas, to our forests, farms, fossil fuel extraction and more.
Folk tales and myths are especially strong on hubris, with the tale of Icarus and Daedalus sharply dividing Icarus, who fails to accept the limits of the material world, overreaches and crashes, from the wiser Daedalus, who still manages to fly, but not too near the sun. Icarus strikes a Richard Branson-like figure, or the head of an oil company still exploring for oil we cannot afford to burn. Daedalus is the smart entrepreneur switching to wind and solar power.
So much accumulated wisdom in tales mocks our multiple current follies. But that is partly because, in campaigning for change, the art of storytelling has been too often replaced with reliance on a deluge of facts and polices.
Progressives have learned the hard way in an age of Brexit and Trump that it is messages that resonate with mythologies – such as “making America great again” tapping the former frontier optimism of nation-builders, or “taking back control” for the brave, resilient island – are impervious to fact and rational argument. In both you might also glimpse the village whipped up by the charismatic trickster who appears in its midst, into a fury of self-destructive suspicion and isolation. If you want change to happen, you have to change deeply embedded cultural narratives.
Progressive politics needs better stories as much as it needs facts and policies. Without them it will flail and flounder. That’s why a group of leading scientists, economists and ecologists recently put facts momentarily to one side, and wrote modern folk tales for troubling times in an experiment to communicate issues of concern more compellingly.
In Knock Twice, the resulting collection, one of the world’s leading authorities on climate and geo-hazards, Bill McGuire, weaves a story of refugees from rising sea levels slipping through immigration controls. Jayati Ghosh, one of India’s leading economists, who has written about women’s extreme inequality in the labour market, spins a tale about a young woman, Chitrangada, who rejects the role assigned for her. Bluebeard &amp; Partners by Anthea Lawson, a leading authority on corporate corruption, exposes a world of tax avoiding shell companies. They are joined by the former head of a cabinet office inquiry into public services, with an unusual re-reading of Puss-in-Boots, and the head of a UN inquiry into designing a sustainable financial system imagining an all-powerful phone app.
Most tales, at some level, present a rite of passage through difficulty to maturity, awareness or resolution. Now, more than ever, it feels like we need new tales to lead us through our troubling times.

Here is more “fluff”:
On September 21, 2017 in the Conversation it was revealed that Australia has the capacity to deliver 100 per cent renewable baseload energy by 2030 with the addition of 22,000 potential pumped hydro sites spread across Australia. https://theconversation.com/want-energy-storage-here-are-22-000-sites-for-pumped-hydro-across-australia-84275. - access the hyperlink and with a bit of imagination looking at potential sites for pumped hydro on the map provided can you envisage how the privately funded EWLP 455bn Project Boomerang could provide the catalyst for clean and green comprehensive national rail infrastructure covering Australia, thereby reducing transport generated CO2 emissions in Australia.
Australian PM Malcolm Turnbull, defender of a massive expansion of thermal coal and new thermal coal power stations, asks what happens when the sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow with renewable energy – hardly unlikely to happen simultaneously in Australia for all states connected with transmission interconnectors to the extensive national electricity grid ( Tasmania, SA, VIC ,NSW and QLD) the uptake of battery technology and now the untapped source of pumped hydro.
The Reserve Bank of Australia grew its balance sheet by around $43B over 2013/14 to about $141B and made a net profit for the 2014/15 financial year of $6.1B. In the 2014 federal budget the RBA was loaned $9B by the LNP federal government.As a part of being agile, creative and innovative turn the $9 billion loaned by the Australian government to the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) or redirect part of balance sheet assets into a Joint Institutional Investment Fund with the RBA, CSIRO and Australian Universities combined that can commercialize research in existing small, medium and large enterprises in addition to new start-ups….that can pay off debt independent of the federal government.

For example I have also suggested:
1) What about the potential of developing clumping bamboo plantations which can assist in cheaper and better housing?...1,000 products made from bamboo to avoid further clearing of old growth forests from Tasmania to the Tiwi Islands in the Northern Territory . We can't change our consumption based economy, but we can certainly change the resources we use and the way we manufacture our products! 
Since bamboo is the fastest growing plant on earth and a sustainable building material, it could easily substitute all known wood applications without having to cut down entire bamboo groves or plantations. Better yet, bamboo continuously grows after harvest without having to re-plant it. Bamboo also converts about 35% more CO2 into oxygen than a regular tree.
The bamboo products we see on the market today, are just the tip of the iceberg, it is predicted that more and more innovative bamboo applications will enter the consumer markets rapidly. Therefore it is an exciting era to live in if you are also a firm believer of how bamboo can contribute to a greener and cleaner environment. We can't change our consumption based economy, but we can certainly change the resources we use and the way we manufacture our products!
Clumping bamboo can provide a holistic solution (economic, social and environmental) while producing more jobs and greater long term profits than sugar cane ever will and can be integrated with existing sugar cane plantations for erosion control, erosion remediation, windbreaks, CO2 sequestration, sound screens and landscaping for starters, with the potential to produce over 1,000 manufactured products….access this hyperlink https://www.bambooimport.com/en/blog/products-made-from-bamboo with embedded video giving greater clarification of multiple uses.Here are further examples of how bamboo can be used in building construction:https://www.pinterest.com/pin/288300813615521314/

At a crucial moment in the 1970’s the Queensland Trades and Labour Council approved a total black-ban by all affiliated unions on oil drilling on the Great Barrier Reef.
The union movement can again change the political direction of both state and federal Labor with support of the public at large by taking away support for the massive Adani Carmichael thermal coal mine and the construction of new coal mines in QLD and opting instead for the PRIVATELY funded EWLP $55Bn Project Iron Boomerang http://www.eastwestlineparks.com.au/ …. opening up a diversity of new job opportunities and defending the jobs and livelihoods of their members whilst giving greater support for protection to an Australian and global icon – the Great Barrier Reef. Proposed steel mills at Abbot Point should however be relocated to inland Moranbah.
Project Iron Boomerang would value add 3-fold Australia’s mineral and energy assets iron ore, natural gas and metallurgical coal where it would close down the bottom highly polluting and highly cost inefficient 3 per cent of global steel mills or the equivalent of the bottom 6 per cent of China’s ZOMBIE steel mills – Australia has the potential to build on a comparative advantage in quality energy and minerals supply used in steelmaking to produce the cheapest globally competitive basic slab steel in the world with new state-of-the art production and transport efficiencies that generate net global carbon credits on global reductions on CO2 emissions and pollution – put in context steel mills around the world are more energy efficient than thermal coal power stations and currently contribute less than 7 per cent to current global warming.
Project Iron Boomerang is a paradox strategy in that it can create the economic rationale for an accelerated uptake of renewable energy sources :
• The creation of a circular national electricity grid passing through NT,SA,VIC,ACT,NSW and QLD with added connections to Indonesia, Tasmania and Port Hedland WA assisted by significantly increased electrified rail supported by large scale solar thermal, geothermal and integrated natural gas supplies in central Australia and rapidly evolving commercially viable battery storage to provide baseload power.
• Heat from steel mills could be used to generate electricity working with solar power, wind power and enhanced battery storage – that can power homes and industry, opening up new recycling opportunities in disposing of electronic waste, the salvage of rare earth metals and the breakdown of motor vehicle components.
• The global renewable energy market is worth $290Bn – common sense would suggest that a highly innovative country like Australia with a number of cutting edge technologies relating to global renewable energy needs a catalyst boost to push commercialization into turbo drive. 
In essence with global warming we are witnessing a growing and repetitive number of extreme weather events that are destructive to natural ecosystems both on land and in the sea – the Great Barrier Reef a prime example but as global warming related to coral bleaching recognizes no international boundaries and is a global cumulative problem, then although desirable, preventing the Adani Carmichael thermal coal mine from going ahead is not going to solve the problem of ongoing destruction.

Forecasts stretching to February are pushing the science to its limits, leaving significant uncertainty. But scientists say there is reason to be concerned, and some bleaching is very likely, although it won’t be anything like what happened during the past two years.
The most recent forecasts of the Coral Watch program of the US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) puts much of the reef, especially the southern parts, on “Alert Level 1” in late February. At that level, bleaching is considered likely although it is not expected to continue long enough to cause much coral to die.
The head of Noaa’s Coral Watch program, Mark Eakin, said predicting the heat stress on the Great Barrier Reef in February was complicated because of the uncertain state of the El Niño/La Niña cycle.
“Unfortunately, that’s four months away and at the bitter end of our forecast skill,” Eakin said. “The farther away the forecast, the lower the skill. We don’t have an El Niño and the La Niña isn’t looking very strong. That lowers skill.”
He said there was reason to be concerned but not “too worried yet”.
“There will probably be some bleaching in some parts of the Great Barrier Reef but so far it doesn’t look anything like the last two years. However, it’s still early and we’ll know more in a month or so.”
Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, a leading coral bleaching researcher from the University of Queensland, said the results were concerning since, after the past two big bleaching events, a summer without heat stress would have given the coral the best chance of recovery.
“Ideally, it would be nice to have temperatures around average because then we might see recruits coming and corals growing back,” he said.
In 2016, the Great Barrier Reef suffered the worst bleaching event on record, with about 30% of the coral dying. At the start of 2017, it was hit again, losing roughly another 20%, leaving about half the coral cover dead.
The damage was worst in the top third of the reef, where some parts lost as much as 90% of their coral. The southern third of the reef mostly escaped any damage.
“We will be watching closely,” Hoegh-Guldberg said. “Most of us are holding our breath to a certain extent. Could this be the year in which we lose coral from the southern end of the Great Barrier Reef?”
The chance for a wave of coral recovery will emerge in the coming weeks as the famous spawning events begin. But for the worst-hit parts of the reef, that event would be hampered by the previous mortality, said Selina Ward, an expert from the University of Queensland, who has conducted studies into the impact of bleaching on coral reproduction.
“If you look at Lizard Island, which has been exposed to 2016 and 2017 heat events and suffered very high mortality, one of my colleagues has just been there and has not seen any reproductive colonies. And that’s where you would have expected most to be reproductive.”
 For the badly-hit parts of the northern Great Barrier Reef, Ward said the spawning event was likely to be so adversely affected that they would be relying on coral spawning from the Coral Triangle to bring recruits through ocean currents.
Richard Leck, head of oceans at WWF-Australia, said conservation groups were also monitoring the bleaching warnings, and believed the forecasts were worrying. .
“The Noaa maps predict a better than even chance of coral bleaching in the southern Great Barrier Reef – the only part that hasn’t suffered widespread bleaching in the last two years,” he said. “It is a huge cause for concern that there is a chance the Reef is facing the threat of a third consecutive mass bleaching event.
 “This is even more reason for Queensland to shift to a renewable energy future and away from old, polluting industries such as coal.” ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/03/more-coral-bleaching-feared-for-great-barrier-reef-in-coming-months

At least one trillion dollars are being invested globally in ways to reduce the threat of climate change, including renewable power, energy efficiency, and public transport around the world.
The sums involved are likely to make it possible in future for the world’s governments to meet their commitments under the Paris agreement on climate change, provided the investment continues and is directed to the right ends, according to a new report.
The World Bank Group’s subsidiary, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), said on Thursday that the investment could hold the key to fighting climate change. Governments will meet in Bonn next week to discuss the next steps in implementing their pledges made at the 2015 Paris conference on climate change.
Philippe Le Houérou, chief executive of the IFC, said: “The private sector holds the key to fighting climate change. We can help unlock more private sector investment, but this also requires government reforms as well as innovative business models, which together will create new markets and attract the necessary investment. This can fulfil the promises of Paris.”
The IFC report, entitled Creating Markets for Climate Business, found that governments could work with businesses by fostering renewable energy as an alternative to fossil fuels. For instance, IFC provided $653m (£492m) in debt financing to fund the construction of 13 solar plants near Aswan, in Egypt. Such financing can result in lower electricity costs for local people, as well as reducing carbon dioxide emissions and cutting down on air pollution from coal-fired power plants.
People in developing countries can also benefit from renewable energy installations, such as solar panels and wind turbines, that provide local power, removing the need for them to be connected to a national electricity grid to receive power – a distant dream in some countries, where the national grid is under-developed or prone to breakdown. The availability of power generated locally has multiple benefits, including safety and education, as it enables emissions-free light and power late into the night, instead of people being forced to rely on expensive and polluting kerosene burners.
The authors of the report estimated that investments in energy storage and off-grid solar of $23bn a year could be possible by 2025, if national governments favour renewable energy over fossil fuels.
However, in many countries, developed and developing, fossil fuel companies have the incumbent advantage, and in some cases policies have been developed to suit them. The International Energy Agency estimated fossil fuel subsidies at $325bn a year in 2016.
Making buildings more energy efficient could also reduce carbon emissions dramatically, according to the IFC report, but only if countries adopt better building codes and higher standards. Public transport is another area ripe for investment, which could yield billions of dollars in greater efficiency, and improve the quality of lives of people around the globe, but which has been held back by poor government involvement.
Christian Aid, the development charity, called on the World Bank Group to stop lending to fossil fuel projects. Funding by the group’s members for fossil fuel projects has increased to $4.7bn in 2016, according to the charity.
Fran Witt, senior climate change adviser at Christian Aid, said: “Despite aiming to champion clean energy, the World Bank Group actually continues to finance large volumes of dirty energy projects, which are driving climate change around the world. It is staggering that even after the Paris agreement the group is still investing most of its energy portfolio in dirty energy.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/02/huge-private-sector-investment-puts-paris-climate-target-in-reach-says-report

Mass extinctions due to rapidly escalating levels of CO2 are recorded since as long as 580 million years ago. As our anthropogenic global emissions of CO2 are rising, at a rate for which no precedence is known from the geological record with the exception of asteroid impacts, another wave of extinctions is unfolding.

A population of a few million human hunter-gatherers was apparently beyond the carrying capacity of the planet as everywhere we showed up the megafauna disappeared.
Around 10-12,000 years ago, when large climate oscillations settled down, we developed agriculture which allowed us to double our population many times into the billions.
But agriculture faces big challenges if we don’t change our ways soon (1), as do our fisheries, and if they both decline significantly, forcing us back to being largely hunter-gatherers, history tells us that out of every 1000 people you see maybe one survives.

No, but several previous mass extinctions have been linked to natural global warming events caused by a strong forcing of CO2 rising in the atmosphere. 
The worst, the end-Permian event, which turned Earth into basically a lifeless rock for millions of years, was linked to coal seams ignited perhaps by magma. 1
This time, the 6th extinction, beginning now largely from over hunting and fishing, habitat loss and pollution, is being exacerbated by silly hominids which know better than to dig up and burn prodigious amounts of coal more rapidly than past natural events.

the longer we wait, the more difficult and expensive it becomes. If we had started in 2005, it would have required emission reductions of three percent per year to restore planetary energy balance and stabilize climate this century. If we start next year, it is six percent per year. If we wait 10 years, it is 15 percent per year -- extremely difficult and expensive, perhaps impossible.

We've already seen conflicts and migration linked to drought with the little bit of warming to date in places like Africa.
Farmers around the Bay of Bengal were driven by drought to fish the Bay and now fisheries there are collapsing and the migration from a population of hundreds of millions is beginning.
People in Madagascar have been reported to be reduced to eating ash and rocks as their crops have failed for several years now due to drought linked to global warming.
When climatic zones and rains cross borders now there will be people with guns on the other side who may not like those being forced to move. I believe India and perhaps one more country are now building walls to contain the population of Bangladesh which resides on the sinking Ganges River Delta. 
And half a billion people live on sinking river deltas while the protective deltas are eroding, sea level rise is accelerating (1) and maximum storm strength may be increasing.

the glaciologist John Mercer speculated that warming due to ‘industrial pollution of the atmosphere’ could cause the ice shelves of West Antarctica to disintegrate, producing a catastrophic release of ice to the sea, thus causing a sea level rise of about 5 m during the course of a century.
BQEND
1981 a paper by James Hansen, that hit the front page of the NY Times, warned of multi-meter sea level rise within a century:
BQSTART
The seven atmospheric scientists predict a global warming of ''almost unprecedented magnitude'' in the next century. It might even be sufficient to melt and dislodge the ice cover of West Antarctica, they say, eventually leading to a worldwide rise of 15 to 20 feet in the sea level. In that case, they say, it would ''flood 25 percent of Louisiana and Florida, 10 percent of New Jersey and many other lowlands throughout the world'' within a century or less. (my emphasis)

And lastly, regarding when are we going to wake up, Antarctic Ice Sheet mass is likely controlled by ocean temperature (1), according to the renowned glaciologist, Richard Alley, and we've not only already put a lot of heat content into the ocean, but there's a lot more dialed in.
So when are we going to wake up? At the current committed ~6m of sea level rise? or 12 or 18 or 24?

1. It's -50 degrees C on parts of Antarctica, warm it up to -45 and big deal. But it is at the melting point at the coast where the floating and thinning ice shelves provide less and less friction constraining ice sheet flow. 
An increase of just 1 degree C destroyed the ice shelf constraining the flow of the Jakobshavn Isbræ Glacier on Greenland and such an increase is a big insult to an ice shelf almost anywhere on the planet.

We consider risk in many areas, like when we pay thousands of dollars extra for a car with air bags because the outcome of a very unlikely high speed collision is severe.
This rational approach to risk is completely missing when it comes to the environment.
And the thing is with global warming, not only is the outcome severe in the extreme, but the likelihood is very, very high that highly damaging impacts will occur if we let global warming continue.
According to the article Tail Risk vs. Alarmism, by Dr. Kerry Emanuel, professor of atmospheric science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, we are on track to triple pre-industrial levels of atmospheric CO2 this century.
According to the graph supplied in the article that would give us a 5 percent chance of exceeding 6.75 degrees C above pre-industrial levels (just a rise of 1.5-2C commits us to 6-9m of sea level rise).
As Emanuel says in the article below:
BQSTART
the 5% high-end may be so consequential, in terms of outcome, as to be justifiably called catastrophic. It is vitally important that we convey this tail risk as well as the most probable outcomes.

BQEND
 Our conclusions are as follows:Carbon footprinta. If adequately regulated, local GHG emissions from shale gas operations shouldrepresent only a small proportion of the total carbon footprint of shale gas,which is likely to be dominated by CO2 emissions associated with itscombustion.b. Any local GHG emissions from shale gas operations would fall within the nontradedsector of the UK’s carbon budgets. If the carbon budgets impose abinding constraint, any increase in emissions associated with domestic shalegas operations would have to be offset by emissions cuts elsewhere in theeconomy.c. The carbon footprint (emissions intensity) of shale gas extraction and use islikely to be in the range 200 – 253 g CO2e per kWh of chemical energy, whichmakes shale gas’s overall carbon footprint comparable to gas extracted fromconventional sources (199 – 207 g CO2e/kWh(th)), and lower than the carbonfootprint of Liquefied Natural Gas (233 - 270g CO2e/kWh(th)). When shale gas isused for electricity generation, its carbon footprint is likely to be in the range 423– 535 g CO2e/kWh(e), which is significantly lower than the carbon footprint ofcoal, 837 – 1130 g CO2e/kWh
specifically
91. Any local GHG emissions from shale gas operations would fall within the non-traded sector of the UK’s carbon budgets. If the carbon budget imposes a binding constraint, any increase in emissions associated with domestic shale gas operations would have to be offset by emission cuts elsewhere in the economy. This increase in emissions accounted to the UK would be an example of on-shoring; bringing production, and any emissions associated with production, back to the UK and displacing imported LNG. In the UK, shale gas operations are expected to be subject to a stricter environmental regime compared with many other locations in the world.[1]https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/237330/MacKay_Stone_shale_study_report_09092013.pdf
So if we impor SHALE GAS from the US, as per my earlier link, converted to LNG, then what is the total carbon footprint?
PS, Qatar uses fraccing too.[2]http://www.shell.com.qa/en_qa/about-us/what-we-do.html

As recent months have made clear, climate change is not only an imminent threat; it is an existing catastrophe. It’s going to get worse, and tar sands oil—the dirtiest oil on Earth—is one of the reasons.
We did this very, very carefully—after talking to pipeline engineers, and doing our own research. Before we touched a thing, we called the pipeline companies twice to warn them, and let them turn off the pipelines themselves if they thought that was better; all of them did so.
We knew we were at risk for years in prison. But the nation needs to wake up now to what’s coming our way if we don’t reduce emissions boldly and fast; business as usual is now genocidal. 
In shutting off the pipelines, we hoped to be part of that wake-up, to put ourselves in legal jeopardy in order to state dramatically and unambiguously that normal methods of political action and protest are simply not working with anywhere near the speed that we need them to.
One major hope of ours was to set legal precedent by using the “necessity defense” and bringing in expert witnesses to testify that because of the egregious nature of tar sands crude and the urgency of the climate crisis, we’d actually been acting in accordance with higher laws. 
The classic example of a legitimate use of the necessity defense is when someone is arrested for breaking and entering after they hear a baby crying in a burning building, and rush in to save her. 
Because it requires a high bar of proof—you must have tried everything else, the danger must be imminent, the action must be likely to be effective—courts seldom even allow this defense to be argued, or expert witnesses to be brought; their only concern, generally, is did you break and enter? Not why.
Three of our trials (which are in four states) had already rejected the use of the necessity defense. In North Dakota, the judge said essentially “I’m not going to let you put US energy policy on trial”. But recently, I and the other Minnesota defendants were finally granted it. 
I have little doubt that the awful weather events of the last couple of months played some role in this—it’s not just scientists seeing the truth anymore: the building is indeed burning, and all the world’s babies are in it. 
I was struck by the North Dakota judge’s implicit understanding that letting science be spoken in her courtroom would have had the effect of putting energy policy on trial—of reversing, in effect, who was the defendant, and who the prosecutor. 
We had no demagogues lined up; we had the nation’s pre-eminent climate scientist ready, as well as two people who were to speak on the effectiveness of actions such as ours (often referred to as nonviolent resistance). How far awry must a system go, before the laws of physics are forbidden in a court of law?
Yet it is indeed a dangerous thing to speak the truth sometimes—dangerous in particular to those who have been lying to us for decades, and who have gotten very, very rich by doing so. Those who are also, at the moment, running our country.
So I find myself feeling peculiarly exposed now. When I first heard the news, elated, I called and texted and emailed family and friends. I deeply regretted that my mother—who died in June—didn’t live long enough to see us do our best to change legal history. 
I wish she had known that a judge had been persuaded by the legitimacy of our argument (if not yet of its rightness)—a judge, no less, in a county where the pipeline company, Enbridge, is the single largest property tax payer. 
I’m heartened by the way the law can be supple—not a thing that, once set, holds that exact shape forever (or we’d still have slavery, and I couldn’t vote or marry), but a thing that responds—slowly—to our evolving understanding of what is just and true.
When it comes to climate change, there’s little enough to feel heartened by, so I’ll take it. ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/24/oil-pipeline-valve-turner-protest-climate-change

He is from Durham, UK and currently living in Taipei, Taiwan
I came across Robert Macfarlane’s article Generation Anthropocene: how humans have altered the planet forever, as part of my MA course last year. It was recommended reading and ignited a deep interest in humans’ impact on the planet, and an impetus to reimagine my relationship with the environment.
Macfarlane explains the term “Anthropocene” as “the new epoch of geological time in which human activity is considered such a powerful influence on the environment, climate and ecology of the planet that it will leave a long-term signature in the strata record”. Many scientists argue that it began in 1950 and continues today. This concept really intrigued me and sparked a fascination that has grown and grown.
I studied Chinese and politics for my first degree, having always had a passion for literature and linguistics, and I have been in Asia since I graduated in 2005. In 2012 I moved to Taiwan, where I work for a company that produces knitwear for the US market. I enjoy my work, but a few years into my career I decided I wanted to do something extracurricular that was stimulating and challenging. 
So in 2015, I embarked on a distance programme with Nottingham University, studying towards an MA in English Studies with a special focus on ecocriticism – the examination of how nature is portrayed using the written word, and how this portrayal influences human behaviour. It’s a really fascinating area of study, and one about which Macfarlane is hugely knowledgeable.
I was introduced to his work during my course, when we were asked to read his book The Wild Places. It had a big impact on me, and I started to read more of his work: Landmarks, an exploration of the language we use to describe nature; Mountains of the Mind, about humans’ fascination with mountains; and soon articles such as this one in the Guardian. This particular piece made a huge splash among environmental academics, but its appearance in a popular newspaper also brought it to the forefront of public consciousness. It struck a chord with me in a way that other literature on climate change had not. 
We are living in an epoch defined by nuclear tests and plastic pollution, and having the right terminology to describe this unique, and uniquely horrifying, time feels important. Macfarlane reminds us in no uncertain terms that “among the future fossils of the Anthropocene might be … shampoo bottles and deodorant caps”, combining clear expertise and a rich array of cultural references with a style of writing that is detailed and extremely evocative. Once I had read this piece, it was impossible to unread.
Almost like the Anthropocene age itself, it “administered – and will administer – a massive jolt to the imagination”. I immediately shared it with friends and family, made its theme the major focus of my thesis, and began to make changes to my life. 
Taiwan has a very throwaway culture, so I began using my own flask when buying coffee, and using metal chopsticks in restaurants instead of disposable ones. I did make some bigger changes too – my family live in the UK and I would like to spend more time with them, but I’m acutely aware of the environmental impact of flying, so now try to do so as little as possible. I surf quite a bit in my spare time, so have helped out with beach cleanups – the beaches in this part of the world have a huge problem with litter. 
But we are living through a cataclysmic environmental crisis, and these relatively small changes will not be sufficient to improve matters unless they occur on a global scale. 
It can sometimes seem overwhelming to consider how to tackle the present situation but there is cause for optimism if we work together. In the time since completing my course I have got married and become a dad, and thinking about the planet we will bequeath to the next generation feels more pressing than ever.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2017/nov/25/article-changed-view-anthropocene-macfarlane-climate

“The other kinds of effects of climate change -- this is coral bleaching. It's a beautiful picture, right? All that white coral. Except it's supposed to be brown. 
What happens is that the corals are a symbiosis, and they have these little algal cells that live inside them. And the algae give the corals sugar, and the corals give the algae nutrients and protection. 
But when it gets too hot, the algae can't make the sugar. The corals say, ""You cheated. You didn't pay your rent."" They kick them out, and then they die. 
Not all of them die; some of them survive, some more are surviving, but it's really bad news. 
To try and give you a sense of this, imagine you go camping in July somewhere in Europe or in North America, and you wake up the next morning, and you look around you, and you see that 80 percent of the trees, as far as you can see, have dropped their leaves and are standing there naked. 
And you come home, and you discover that 80 percent of all the trees in North America and in Europe have dropped their leaves. And then you read in the paper a few weeks later, ""Oh, by the way, a quarter of those died.""

Coral eggs and sperm were collected from Heron Island’s reef during last November’s coral spawning to produce more than a million larvae.
The larvae were returned to the wild and placed on to reef patches in underwater mesh tents, with 100 surviving and growing successfully.
The lead project researcher and Southern Cross University professor Peter Harrison, who discovered mass coral spawning in the 1980s, says the “results are very promising”.
“The success of this new research not only applies to the Great Barrier Reef, but has potential global significance,” Harrison said.
“It may [also] be one of the answers to some of the problems in the Great Barrier Reef. It’s a glimmer of hope.”
The project has the ability to restore damaged coral populations and has seen similar success in the Philippines where blast fishing using explosives to kill schools of fish has destroyed coral.
The Great Barrier Reef Foundation managing director, Anna Marsden, said the research is an important step for the reef, but one that should not lessen the strong action needed against climate change.
“There is much more to be done, but this is definitely a great leap forward for the reef, and for the restoration and repair of reefs worldwide,” she said.
“It’s time to be bold and take some calculated risks because that’s the way we’ll make a change in how we can help restore our coral reefs.”
The team returned to Heron Island in November to collect further coral eggs and sperm for the next step in the project.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/26/great-barrier-reef-coral-breeding-program-offers-glimmer-of-hope

It is true Malawi suffered some recent record setting flooding. Somewhere is always suffering record levels of flooding because extreme flood events occur a small number of times over a long period of time, so there are 100 year events, 500 year events, 1000 year events, etc. We currently only have patchy weather data, including accurate flood records, in the developed world going back at best a few hundred years and in the developing world only really going back decades. So there will be weather records being set somewhere constantly.
The difficulty is trying to work out if there is a long term trend. The IPCC published the largest study of extreme weather events in 2012 (and no matter what has happened since then no data from the last five years could alter the observed long term trend based on such a short time period) and that report has this to say on the link between flooding and climate change.
BQSTART
“There is limited to medium evidence available to assess climate-driven observed changes in the magnitude and frequency of floods at regional scales because the available instrumental records of floods at gauge stations are limited in space and time, and because of confounding effects of changes in land use and engineering. Furthermore, there is low agreement in this evidence, and thus overall low confidence at the global scale regarding even the sign of these changes.”
BQEND
So the IPCC says little evidence that there is increased flooding from climate change. What has happened is that the issue of climate change is now very, very prominent in policy making bodies and so everybody lobbying for more resources, from governments to NGOs, will try to tie almost any issue to that of climate change. I worked for decades in both the public sector and in NGOs and I can assure you that such hijacking of issue as tool of lobbying is very common. Plus climate scare stories plays very well to the Guardian's readership.
The important issue in relation to the cause of the recent Malawi floods, the issue that could be fixed, is the lack of electricity in Malawi. Only 12% of the population in Malawi has access to electricity. Some households have access to bottled gas but most don’t. This means that most cooking in Malawi is done over open fires. This has consequences, not least the terrible damage done to the lungs of millions of mostly women and infant by smoke from cooking fires. But it is also an important driver of deforestation in Malawi.
Malawi suffers the world’s 5th highest rate of deforestation. The two main reasons is the clearing of forest areas for human settlement and agricultural land, and demand for charcoal, 60% of which comes from protected trees in forest reserves and national parks. 
Trees play a significant part in flood prevention. Trees support rivers by deterring the water away from them in several ways: they hold and use more water than other land uses such as farms and grasslands, tree roots create gaps in the surrounding soils making the soil more absorbent and preventing run off and they also act as a barrier, substantially slowing down the rate at which water reaches rivers, giving the rivers more time to handle the excess of water. 
By eliminating trees you also eliminate the organic matter that they produce that enriches the soil with nutrients. So, not only is deforestation linked to floods and thus the destruction of crops, but also to the long term fertility of the soil. This could lead to devastating long-term effects on the land’s ability to successfully grow various agricultural products, Malawi’s main industry and biggest source of income.
Another unexpected link with deforestation is the decline of the fish population. Lake Malawi’s fish supply has declined by 90% in the last 20 years. That’s near to extinction. In addition to the shocking overfishing, the soil erosion causes it to be washed into the lake which kills the fish. When you consider that 1.5 million people depend on the lake for food, this loss of fish population is tragic. And largely avoidable.
The challenge for Malawi moving forward, with its rapidly growing population, is to help communities to develop a more sustainable approach to the environment. As is the case everywhere else, the only way to protect the environment in Malawi, including preventing devastating floods, is through economic development, and in this case through electrification. Bringing abundant, cheap and reliable electricity to Malawi is the challenge, and waffle about climate change (which plays well to the Guardian readers) is a dangerous distraction and diversion from the main issues.

A new NATO special report concludes that climate change is the ultimate “threat multiplier”—meaning that it can exacerbate political instability in the world’s most unstable regions—because by intensifying extreme weather events like droughts, climate change stresses food and water supplies.

Up to the moment the water swept away her parents’ field in Kachaso in the Nsanje district of Malawi, they had been scraping a living. Afterwards they were reduced to scavenging for bits of firewood to sell.
So when a young man came to their door and asked for the 13-year old’s hand in marriage, the couple didn’t think about it for too long, lest he look elsewhere. Ntonya begged them to change their minds. She was too young, she pleaded. She didn’t want to leave. But it was to no avail. Her parents sat her down and spelled it out for her: the weather had changed and taken everything from them. There was not enough food to go around. They couldn’t afford another mouth at the table.
That night she lay down in bed for the first time with the man she had never seen before and followed the instructions of her aunt, who had coached her on the important matter of sex. Ten months later, she gave birth to their first daughter.
Around 1.5 million girls in Malawi are at risk of getting married because of climate change. That’s  a huge number
Everyone has their own idea of what climate change looks like. For some, it’s the walrus struggling to find space on melting ice floes on Blue Planet II. For others, it’s an apocalyptic vision of cities disappearing beneath the waves. But for more and more girls across Africa, the most palpable manifestation of climate change is the baby in their arms as they sit watching their friends walk to school. The Brides of the Sun reporting project, funded by the European Journalism Centre, set out to try to assess the scale of what many experts are warning is a real and growing crisis: the emergence of a generation of child brides as a direct result of a changing climate.
And time and again, in villages from the south of Malawi to the east coast of Mozambique, the child brides and their parents told an increasingly familiar story. In recent years they had noticed the temperatures rising, the rains becoming less predictable and coming later and sometimes flooding where there had not been flooding before. Families that would once have been able to afford to feed and educate several children reported that they now faced an impossible situation.
None of the villages had any way of recording the changes scientifically, or indeed felt any urge to do so. All they knew was that the weather had changed and that where they used to be able to pay for their girls to go through school now they couldn’t. And the only solution was for one or more daughters to get married.
Sometimes it was the parents who made the decision. For the good of the rest of the family, a daughter had to be sacrificed. She would be taken out of school and found a husband, one less mouth to feed. Sometimes it was the girl herself who made the decision and forced it upon her parents. Unhappy, hungry, she hoped that a husband might be the answer.
Carlina Nortino (main image, first left) sits with her husband, Horacio, in the dry sand that is all that is left of the river that once flowed past the village of Nataka in the Larde district of Nampula province, on the east coast of Mozambique. From the ground, there is nothing to see of the river. But a drone camera sent up to hover above reveals the ghost of the river, a darker line of green growth winding its way across the plain.
Carlina is 15, Horacio 16. They married when she was 13, two years after the river disappeared, she says.
“I remember when I saw people here fishing. I used to sell the fish, I took it from the fishermen and went to sell it to the village. There was water everywhere. I remember seeing Horacio with the other fishermen. But without rain, the fish died.”
Her family used to harvest as many as 20 50kg bags of cassava. Today it is down to one or two bags. She blames the lack of rain.
Horacio looks across to where the river once ran. “I can’t fish any more because the fish don’t have water any more. The water disappeared. Now I do agriculture. Before, the rain started in September and came regularly until March. Now the rain only comes in January and February and that’s it.”
Carlina had dreamed of becoming a midwife: school was the most important part of her life. “It was never my desire to get married at that young age. I wanted to go to school. But I was forced to by my father. The family didn’t have enough food to survive. So my father accepted the proposal because he couldn’t support me to go to school.”
She give birth to their first child, a boy, earlier this year. There were problems from the start. The family could not afford to go to a hospital with an incubator and the child died. “I am sure that if my father and my husband weren’t that poor, my son would be alive,” she says.
It wasn’t his choice to marry her off, says her father, Carlitos Camilo. The 49-year-old used to support his family through fishing and farming. Then the weather changed and there was no more fish. “If I was able to feed my children, I wouldn’t have pushed her to get married so young. Look at my other daughters, they grew up, they went to school, they got married at a normal age.”
In 2015 the United Nations Population Fund estimated that 13.5 million children would marry under the age of 18 in that year alone – 37,000 child marriages every day – including 4.4 million married before they were 15. Across the whole of Africa, Unicef warned in 2015 that the total number of child brides could more than double to 310 million by 2050 if current trends continue.
There are many reasons for children marrying young. In some societies, it is regarded as simply practical; when children reach puberty, sexual behaviour starts to carry with it the risk of pregnancy. Elsewhere, poverty is the driver: when parents cannot afford to feed several children, it tends to be the girls who have to go.
But set against that is a growing awareness of the issue and a stated desire by governments to tackle it. Malawi made it illegal to marry below the age of 18 in 2015 and wrote it into its constitution this year. The rate of child marriage should be falling. Yet it persists. In Mozambique the number of child brides is actually rising as a result of the growing population. Something else has entered the equation.
The new factor is climate change, says Mac Bain Mkandawire, executive director of Youth Net and Counselling, which campaigns for the rights of women and children from its base in Zomba, Malawi.
“We do not have detailed figures, but I would say 30% to 40% of child marriages in Malawi are due to the floods and droughts caused by climate change,” he says. There are no detailed figures, he explains, because no one has previously thought to connect the two issues and to ask the right questions.
“Given that there are about 4 or 5 million girls at risk of getting married in Malawi, around 1.5 million girls are at risk of getting married because of climate change related events. That is a huge number.”
The published figures may underestimate the scale of the problem because many marriages are informal affairs, not officially recorded. Often they are simply an agreement between two families, or if there are no parents then between the boy and the girl themselves. Sometimes a small dowry is paid by the husband or his family.
That’s how it was for Filomena Antonio. She was 15 when 21-year-old Momande Churute approached her father, Antonio, and offered him 2,000 Mozambican meticals (£25) to marry his daughter.
Antonio Momade Jamal is 50. He has lived in Moma in Nampula province, all his life. He started fishing in 1985 when it was still a profitable business. Back then, buyers used to come from the city of Nampula to compete for the catch. Then the weather started to change.
“We see that it’s too hot. We talk about that and we all agree that it’s difficult to catch enough fish because of these high temperatures,” he says. “In the areas where we used to go, the sea level is rising and the waves are much stronger.”
He thought Filomena too young to marry but he felt he had little choice and when Momande offered to support her to stay in school, he agreed. He says he is not the only one.
“I’ve seen other neighbours who, because they are struggling, let their daughters get married. I have five other kids who go to secondary school. I have two other daughters, one of 13, another of 11. If a man came to ask for their hand, I would think about it, I would consider it. This man could help me support not only my daughter, but also help my other kids continue their education.”
Filomena sits next to him, listening. She appears to have accepted her fate as long as it means she can go off to study in the city. She wants to be a nurse.
“We met here in the neighbourhood and he asked me to be with him,” she says, indicating Momande. “I liked him. I thought he was a beautiful man.”
She told him he had to ask her father’s permission. “My father accepted because he had poor conditions, so he believed that my husband could support me to go to school. I accepted because my father allowed me to. Since my father is poor, I thought I would get married so that my husband would help me. I believe that if my father had kept doing well with the fishing, he wouldn’t have accepted the proposal because then he could afford my education, the school fees, my books.”
Mozambique is one of the world’s poorest countries, with almost 70% of its 28 million people living below the poverty line. It is particularly vulnerable to climate change: the Netherlands Commission for Environmental Assessment warns that “climate-related hazards such as droughts, floods and cyclones are occurring with increasing frequency”.
The legal age of marriage is 18 (16 with parental consent) but still Mozambique has one of the highest rates of child marriage in the world, with nearly one in two girls married by the age of 18 and one in seven by 15. The highest rates of child marriage are found in the northern provinces, including Nampula, which also has the highest number of adolescent pregnancies.
Fatima Mussa is 16, and nine months pregnant. She hadn’t really wanted to get married. On the other hand, her father could no longer afford to keep her. She married 18-year-old Priorino Antonio last year when she was 15 after he approached her father in the village of Nataka, in Nampula province, and offered him 2,000 meticals. There was no ceremony.
“My father said ‘I would have never considered allowing my daughter to marry now, because she is young. But she will marry because I don’t have enough money to send her to secondary school.’ I didn’t want to get married at such a young age, but I didn’t know what to do, since I couldn’t go to school. So I saw an opportunity to marry someone who could maybe improve my life a little bit.”
Across the border in Malawi, nearly half the country’s girls are married by the age of 18 and nearly one in 10 by age 15, leaving Malawi ranked by Unicef as the 11th worst country in the world for child marriage. The legal age of marriage was raised to 18 in 2015 but there have been no reports of any prosecutions.
Poverty is the key factor, increasingly driven by climate change. The International Monetary Fund says that 70% of the 19 million population live below the poverty line, and 25% live in extreme poverty: “Considering that a significant number of the non-poor in rural areas are highly vulnerable to weather shocks, the poverty rate is – if anything – expected to increase due to the impact of recent floods and drought.”
For Lucy Anusa, it was the drought of 2016 that tipped her over the edge. She was 14, the youngest of three sisters living with their farmer parents in Namalaka, near the southern end of Lake Malawi, when the drought laid waste to their crops.
“I met this man who proposed to get married. I had to accept despite the fact that my parents kept telling me good things about education. But I opted for marriage given the way things were at home.”
Her parents were unhappy, but she was too stubborn. Only when she became pregnant and the husband turned her out of their home did she start to regret her decision.
Now 15, she gave birth to their daughter earlier this year. “My mother had to welcome me back. But she kept reminding me: ‘My daughter, I told you about this. You are too young for marriage. You have a lot of challenges when you go into marriage so young.’”
The changes in the weather are wrong-footing farmers, says Amos Mtonya from Malawi’s department of climate change and meteorological services. “When it starts to rain, they immediately start planting. But then, three weeks later, they realise that everything they planted is dry,” he says. “So to some, giving away their girl child can be a relief. It can also help the husband’s family, since it gets someone to assist with the household chores. Of course tradition plays its role, but climate change will encourage people to get married early.”
The government’s own report on the 2015 floods listed child marriage as one of the side effects, a view shared by the anti-child marriage campaign group Girls Not Brides. “If we don’t act now we risk another generation of childhoods being lost,” says its executive director Lakshmi Sundaram.
Maliya Mapira dropped out of school because a teacher got her pregnant. She was 15 at the time. Her parents are tobacco farmers and the worsening harvests meant they were living hand to mouth. When they discovered who the father was, they wanted Maliya to marry him. “But along the way the teacher was unable to support me, not even the baby. If my parents could have supported me, I would have preferred to continue with education rather than get married. But I didn’t want to put pressure on them. So I just decided to get married to this man to survive.”
But marriage has changed little for her. She and tobacco farmer Maliki Hestone, trying to raise her six-month-old son, Bashiru Akim, face the same problems her parents failed to overcome. “Sometimes, because of the floods, the crops get washed away. At the end of the day, we get very little harvest from it,” she says. “I don’t want to have more children because we are struggling taking care of the one I have. It would just make things more difficult.”
Five hundred miles away, in the courtyard of a house on the edge of Moma, Majuma Julio is stirring a pot of maize, preparing lunch for husband, Juma Momade, who is holding their year-old daughter, Fatima, on his lap.
The couple married two years ago when Majuma was 15 and Juma was 19. It’s not what she wanted, Majuma says. But she was staying with an uncle, a farmer, who was paying to support her through school. The weather changed and there was no more money; marriage was the only solution.
“It was because of the sun. There was too much sun and the rain was not falling enough. His production started to decrease three years before the marriage,” says Majuma. “It used to rain for two months, but after a while it started coming less and less. I don’t blame anyone. The weather just changed. My uncle called me and informed me that there was a man who wanted to marry me. I accepted. I didn’t like the idea but I just accepted because I wanted to study.”
Majuma knew that marriage would mean children. But Juma had promised to support her. “Juma and the imam came to my uncle’s house, they did the ceremony and we were married. I am all right now. I feel better than when I was in my uncle’s house because my husband treats me well, I keep going to school, there’s no problem.
“I won’t let my daughter get married at 15 years old. She has to study.”
Up the coast from Moma, administrator Brigi Rupio looks out across the wide blue expanse of the Larde river. “When I arrived here in 2014, there was a house right next to the river,” he says, pointing to where the bank is being undercut by the current. “But in 2015, there were severe floods that destroyed houses and increased the level of the river. Then there was drought. We had areas where we used to produce rice. But because of the dry spells, it’s not possible any more. The weather is changing. Even those who cannot read or write can notice that.”
The young girls taken out of school to marry early can attest to that.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/26/climate-change-creating-generation-of-child-brides-in-africa

But these are not ordinary times.
Meredith’s Koch-backed deal with Time – which owns, in addition to Time magazine, titles including People, Fortune and Sports Illustrated – was sealed Sunday night. Meredith said in a statement announcing the deal that they are building “a premier media company serving nearly 200 million American consumers.”
Observers of Koch Industries, a longtime supporter of libertarian and conservative causes, especially generous with funding for climate denial through thinktanks and research groups, say more than business is at stake.
The Kochs are billionaire US brothers noted for their control of oil-and-gas giant Koch Industries, the second-largest privately owned US company – and for their anti-regulatory politics. Charles and David Koch (pronounced ""coke"") head up the $115bn company, and are well known for their quiet financial support of conservative causes, through such groups as Americans for Prosperity, a key player in the Tea Party movement. They share the No 8 spot in Forbes' list of the world's richest people.
The brothers inherited the company from their father, Fred Koch – who made his fortune in the 1930s building oil refineries for the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin – and grew it into a multinational giant that now includes a broad array of consumer products, such as paper towels.
David Koch, New York City's richest resident (ahead of Rupert Murdoch and former mayor Michael Bloomberg), was the libertarian vice-presidential nominee in 1980. He has also been a major donor to the arts, giving $100m to a prominent New York ballet theater.
The billionaire brothers have long sought to influence public opinion on energy and climate change, pouring hundreds of millionsinto universities, non-profits, thinktanks and political campaigns. But this week marked their first foray into publishing when, through their private equity arm, Koch Equity Development, they provided Meredith Corp with a $650m cash boost in its purchase of Time Inc.
“It’s a very proper business decision – a cheap way to wield even more political influence,” said Bill McKibben, a former New Yorker writer and key figure in the environmental movement as founder of the group 350.org. “The return on investment on their political work is off the charts, I fear.”
At first glance, the oil and gas giant’s reason for backing the bid by Meredith is not readily apparent. Sure, the Kochs have appeared on the Time 100 list – in 2011, 2014 and 2015 – and David Koch has lunched with the magazine’s former editor. But what kind of money-minded mogul would pivot to print in 2017 – and to Time, of all places?
“Time magazine doesn’t move the needle on anything any more,” said Jay Rosen, a journalism professor at New York University. “It just doesn’t make a lot of sense to me. Unless they want to influence the Fortune 500 rankings or something.”
As a spokesman put it to a media reporter recently, Koch Industries, the second-largest private company in the US, virtually all of which is co-owned by the brothers, “has a longstanding policy of not commenting on deals” — and this latest infusion of cash to Meredith from their private equity arm, Koch Equity Development, is no exception to that rule. But at least some of what the brothers have poured money into over the years is a matter of public record.
The Kochs have, for instance, spent hundreds of millions on not-for-profit organizations, universities, advocacy groups and political campaigns. Though payback on donations is perceptible only through influence, in Time, they would also have an asset.
Charles Alexander, whose decades-long career at Time magazine culminated in 13 years as its science editor, isn’t the least bit puzzled. He is, however, very afraid.
What’s concerning about the Kochs’ interest, according to Alexander, is not that they are conservative. Time’s founder, Henry Luce, was conservative. What Alexander is worried about is a much more recent affliction of the Republican party: its systematic denial of the science underlying climate change and how that presaged a larger skepticism of science and facts in general.
“For decades, the Kochs’ ‘dark money’, as the New Yorker’s Jane Mayer called it, has financed a campaign of disinformation designed to convince the public and politicians that climate change is nothing to worry about,” Alexander wrote in the Nation on Wednesday. Now, the Kochs may be poised to extend its reach directly into the editorial pages.
Time in its heyday was a sort of canary in the coal mine on climate, devoting cover stories and special issues to the matter long before such coverage was considered standard fare. More recently, as Republican leaders have come to regard climate change as fake science, Time’s commitment has slipped.
Under the Kochs’ influence, might it disappear completely – and what, exactly, is to be done about it anyway?
“I confess I don’t know what the solution is,” Alexander concluded, “but it is perverse and dangerous for two billionaires with no commitment to factual truth to be permitted to buy a magazine that has been a voice for reason and use it to further their narrow business interests.”
Like much of print news, Time’s decline is readily apparent. Yet it may be precisely that diminished status that makes it desirable to the media-shy Kochs.
The last time the billionaire brothers weighed a foray into print was in 2013, through the potential purchase of the Tribune Company’s eight newspapers – including such flagships as the Los Angeles Times, the Chicago Tribune and the Baltimore Sun. Amid a wave of protests, the effort was scuttled.
Scott Peterson of the watchdog group Checks and Balances Project said another reason the Kochs were able to keep a comparatively low profile in the Time bid was because they did not seek a complete takeover. Meredith said in its statement Sunday that Koch Equity Development would not have a seat on its board of directors and would “have no influence on Meredith’s editorial or managerial operations”.
“If they tried a complete takeover, that might raise questions in Congress, but if they’re just making an investment, no matter how large, if it’s below 50%, then they’re just a passive investor and who’s going to stop that?” said Peterson. “That is, until they move for full control.”
That was what happened in 2012 when Koch Industries bought a minority interest (around 45%) in Guardian Industries, a Michigan-based glass, automotive and building products company. Earlier this year, they completed the acquisition. Per Koch Industries policy, the terms were not discussed.
The Kochs do not simply give money, Peterson noted. Even charitable donations often come with strings attached. “I would find it kind of surprising if the Kochs simply made a quiet investment and then went on their way and watched their stock,” he said.
Koch’s role in the acquiring of Time comes amid the most aggressive environmental rollbacks since the Reagan presidency: business interests at a recent meeting put on by the Heartland Institute free-market thinktank were “giddy” and “thrilled”. This is also a time when the Trump administration seems intent on developing friendly media entities.
This month, the Federal Communications Commission eliminated protections against monopolies in local broadcast news, a move widely seen as clearing the way for the expansion of a Trump-friendly local broadcasting network.
Because the US does not regulate the printed press in the manner seen in the UK, for example, there were no such protections to be overridden with regard to the Time deal.
The Center for Media and Democracy’s Mary Bottari told the Guardian she considered it “a smart move” on Koch’s part. “The only way they can convince the public not to worry their heads about climate change and to forget about regulating the fossil fuel industry is to create their own media megaphone,” said Bottari.
The Trump administration has demonstrated something of a penchant for giving bigger megaphones to interests it deems its own.
The man behind Sinclair Media Group, the local broadcaster for whose expansion Trump’s regulatory body recently cleared the way, is David Smith, a man whose history of donations and coverage would certainly pass a Trump loyalty test. Rupert Murdoch, whose long association with Trump was once thought to be chilly, has more recently kindled something of a bromance with him, a love affair apparent everywhere from Fox News to the Wall Street Journal.
Now the Kochs may be poised to become the newest conservative media moguls. And though Trump has demonstrated something of a fixation with Time’s annual “person of the year” award, their coziness appears to be less with Trump than with his vice-president, Mike Pence.
Pence has received more traceable campaign donations from David Koch than any other candidate, including $200,000 to Pence and a running mate when Pence ran for governor of Indiana in 2012 and $100,000 to Pence individually in 2016, before he was plucked for the vice-presidency. That doesn’t include funding from other sources, such as the Republican Gubernatorial Campaign Committee, which can legally be hidden.
Their relationship, as chronicled in a recent piece by Mayer – whose writing in the New Yorker helped make the Koch brothers a household name – runs deep.
Pence did the Kochs a valuable political favor in the spring of 2009 when, in light of a congressional push to curb carbon emissions, he signed on to help push the Koch-backed “no climate tax pledge”. Congress’s bill on “cap and trade”, a concept dreamed up by conservative Reagan-era economists, would have incurred catastrophic costs to Koch Industries. 
Since then, they have grown closer still. By 2011, Pence was said to lead Charles Koch’s shortlist of potential presidential candidates. And though the elder Koch presumably had to settle for second best with Pence as VP, it hasn’t worked out so badly so far.
Whatever happens with the Time deal, the Kochs’ optimism appears warranted. Pence is the one White House official whom a drama-loving president can’t fire. 
“They definitely play the long game and I don’t think that their game is the Trump administration,” Peterson said. “While people watch the Trump circus, the Koch brothers just get stronger.”
In the end, the Kochs’ return on any move into media will not be measured by Time’s bottom line. It will be measured by that of their own company – and by the progress of their ideological agenda.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/27/koch-brothers-time-magazine-media-power

BQENDFor the same reason that we accept the collegiate opinion climate science.
Nuclear is an extremely useful low carbon energy source.Fraccing gas domestically has a significantly lower carbon footprint than importing LNG.CCS is classed by the IPCC and UNECE as a critical technology, the omission of which will put up the cost of meeting climate targets by 138%.The UNs DDPP, backed by 29 of the world's top universities recommend nuclear with renewables with gas as a bridge fuel, ultimately with CCS.
These are supported because we accept the reality of climate change.

Incorrect.
The fact that climate has been scientifically understood as being composed of all the components listed (Atmosphere, Biosphere, Cryospehre, Geosphere, Hydrosphere) is text book knowledge dating back to the 1960's. If you want a text book to help inform you I recommend this one.
So you'd have to deny:- that the climate system is interlinked between all those elements- that the climate system is not showing warming in all of those elements
Alternatively, you could continue to cherry pick outdated data sets, or maybe choose the climate gate manufactrovosy e-mails taken out of context, and continue to ignore the Evidence(TM).

The report is available for anyone to read; it was prepared by top scientists, and it gives an overview of the most up to date science. 
If you want to understand climate change and a single document that summarizes what we know, this is your chance. This report is complete, readily understandable, and accessible. It discusses what we know, how we know it, how confident we are, and how likely certain events are to happen if we continue on our business-as-usual path. 
To summarize, our Earth has warmed nearly 2°F (1°C) since the beginning of the 20th century. Today’s Earth is the warmest it has ever been in the history of modern civilization.
While the planet has warmed, the climate and the Earth’s environment has responded. We are observing heating of the atmosphere, oceans, and the Earth’s surface. Glaciers are melting at an alarming rate. Snow cover is decreasing and we are experiencing increased water scarcity, particularly in parts of the world that rely on snowmelt for water. 
The amount of ice is decreasing. In particular, the ice that floats atop waters in the Arctic have decreased significantly since measurements began. As a result of melting land ice and thermal expansion, sea levels are rising. Oceans have risen, on average, 7–8 inches. In some places, the rise has been much more. Astonishingly, half of the total rise has occurred in the last 30 years. Currently, oceans are rising faster than any point in time in the last ~3,000 years. Not only that, the ocean rise is causing city flooding to accelerate.
According to the report, seal levels will likely rise somewhere between 1–4 feet by the end of the century, but increases up to 8 feet can’t be ruled out (~2.5 meters). For context, approximately 150 million people around the world live within one meter of current sea level. 
If you live away from the shores, you are not immune to the impacts of climate change. The report delves into the increases in extreme weather. For instance, heavy rainfall is increasing across the United States as well as globally. These increases will continue into the future and they are already leading to more severe flooding. The prediction that scientists made that wet areas will become wetter is turning out to be true. 
There are more extreme heatwaves as well. Not only are we seeing more heat waves (and severe droughts), but in the next few decades, the authors predict temperatures will rise by ~2.5°F (~1.5°C) in the United States. This is an enormous change in temperature that will reshape the country. Similar changes are occurring and will occur in other countries.
What the report also shows is that the biggest uncertainty in future climate change is us. What will humans do about it? We have the choice of taking action now to reduce future climate change. Or, we can ignore the problem and face the consequences. That choice has tremendous implications. If we take strong actions to reduce greenhouse gases, we may be able to limit global warming by 2100 to 3.5°F (2°C) above pre-industrial temperatures. If we ignore the problem, we will face temperature increases as much as 9°F (5°C). The impact such a temperature change would have on agriculture, sea level, heat waves, droughts, and weather is almost unthinkable.
There is some hope in this report. Even with recent economic growth, the rate at which we emit greenhouse gases has not risen as fast as the past. This means it is possible to have a healthy economy and a healthy environment.
For those who say dealing with climate change is too expensive, they repeat a myth. In fact, ignoring climate change is much more expensive then dealing with it. Had we taken action years ago when scientists first warned us of the problem we would be well on our way to effective mitigation. We’ve lost valuable years to the denialists. The more time we waste, the more expensive this problem will be in both lives and dollars.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/nov/27/american-leaders-should-read-their-official-climate-science-report

Fashion designer Stella McCartney condemned her industry as “incredibly wasteful and harmful to the environment” as she joined forces with round-the-world sailor and environmental campaigner Dame Ellen MacArthur to call for a systemic change to the way clothing is produced and used.
In a report published on Tuesday, MacArthur’s foundation exposes the scale of the waste, and how the throwaway nature of fashion has created a business which creates greenhouse emissions of 1.2bn tonnes a year – larger than that of international flights and shipping combined.
It warns that “if the industry continues on its current path, by 2050, it could use more than 26% of the carbon budget associated with a 2C pathway.”
The report also reveals that: 
MacArthur, who gained the support of industry leaders including the C&amp;A Foundation, H&amp;M, and Nike for her report, is calling for a circular textile economy to be created to make fashion more sustainable.
The report calls for four actions to be taken: to phase out substances of concern and microfibre release; increase clothing utilisation, for example by the industry supporting and promoting short-term clothing rental businesses; to radically improve recycling; and to move to renewable materials.
McCartney said the ideas in the report provided solutions for an industry that was incredibly wasteful and harmful to the environment.
“The report … opens up the conversation that will allow us to find a way to work together to better our industry for the future of fashion and for the future of the planet,” she said.
MacArthur acknowledged the scale of the challenge to turn around the $2.4tn industry. 
“Today’s textile industry is built on an outdated linear, take-make-dispose model and is hugely wasteful and polluting,” said MacArthur. “We need a new textile economy in which clothes are designed differently, worn longer, and recycled and reused much more often.”
Figures in the report reveal the throwaway nature of today’s fashion industry, which is based on a faster turnaround model, with more new collections released per year, at lower prices.
The report said more than half of “fast” fashion produced is disposed of in less than a year. In the US, clothes are only worn for around a quarter of the global average. The same pattern is emerging in China, where clothing utilisation has decreased by 70% over the last 15 years. Sixty percent of German and Chinese citizens admit to owning more clothes than they need.
Globally, customers miss out on $460bn of value each year by throwing away clothes that they could continue to wear.
The report said: “The textiles industry relies mostly on non-renewable resources – 98m tonnes in total per year – including oil to produce synthetic fibres, fertilisers to grow cotton, and chemicals to produce, dye, and finish fibres and textiles.
“Textiles production (including cotton farming) also uses around 93bn cubic metres of water annually, contributing to problems in some water-scarce regions.
“With its low rates of utilisation … and low levels of recycling, the current wasteful, linear system is the root cause of this massive and ever expanding pressure on resources.”
Clothing production has nearly doubled in the last 15 years, and the growth is not just confined to the west. “Demand for clothing is continuing to grow quickly, driven particularly by emerging markets, such as Asia and Africa,” the report said.
“Should growth continue as expected, total clothing sales would reach 160m tonnes in 2050 – more than three times today’s amount.”
Greg Stanton, the mayor of Phoenix, Arizona, who is endorsing the report, said his city was attempting to create a circular economy out of textile waste: “Each year more than 18,000 tonnes of textiles find their way into … waste and recycling streams. Our city is working on creative solutions to redirect textiles from the waste stream … as a valuable resource, to ultimately stimulate the local economy.”
In east London, Cyndi Rhoades, founder of WornAgain, is working on the development of a new technology to separate and recapture polyester and cotton from textiles to be reintroduced back into the supply chain as new, raw materials. 
She said: “We already have enough clothing and textiles in existence today to satisfy our annual demand of new raw materials for new clothing – all we have to do is make sure it doesn’t end up in the bin, and processes like ours are scaled as rapidly as possible.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/28/stella-mccartney-calls-for-overhaul-of-incredibly-wasteful-fashion-industry

With the exception of one prominent study that projects the loss of most West Antarctic ice by 2500 under even moderate warming scenarios, other recent research is still broadly consistent with the AR5 assessment that marine ice sheet instability contribution to sea level rise will “not exceed several tenths of a meter” by 2100. Thus the AR5 projections still represent current understanding, although suggestions that the contribution could be greater than was previously assessed need further evaluation. Quantitative uncertainties, reflected in the spread of results from recent studies, reinforce the need for better understanding of the processes leading to ice shelf and ice sheet retreat. It is moreover virtually certain that sea level rise will continue for many centuries. In a climate as warm as those projected in many models for 2100 and beyond under high emissions scenarios, large parts of both ice sheets would be lost over millennia, leaving sea level many metres higher than present.

BQSTART
But, despite this early and clear-eyed view of the risks of global warming, Shell invested many billions of dollars in highly polluting tar sand operations and on exploration in the Arctic. It also cited fracking as a “future opportunity” in 2016, despite its own 1998 data showing exploitation of unconventional oil and gas was incompatible with climate goals. The film was obtained by the Correspondent, a Dutch online journalism platform, and shared with the Guardian, and lauds commercial-scale solar and wind power that already existed in 1991. Shell has recently lobbied successfully to undermine European renewable energy targets and is estimated to have spent $22m in 2015 lobbying against climate policies. The company’s investments in low-carbon energy have been minimal compared to its fossil fuel investments.

Seven specific use cases of hydrogen are outlined in the new McKinsey report:
 Enabling large-scale renewable energy integration and power generation Distributing energy across sectors and regions Acting as a buffer to increase energy system resilience Decarbonizing transportation Decarbonizing industrial energy use Helping to decarbonize building heat and power Providing clean feedstock for industry.
These are all valid, operational uses for hydrogen; in talking about the vision for hydrogen the report states:
'It does not rely on unknown scientific breakthroughs but on technologies whose viability has been demonstrated. It is not about imaginary solutions but about scaling existing technologies and considering the beneficial linkages and virtuous circles of deploying hydrogen technology across the energy system. It also does not promote hydrogen as a winner-take-all solution, but considers it together with other low-carbon technologies.'
If you consider just the first one; the point here is that you lose 10% of electricity over long distances; within a plastic hydrogen pipeline you incur no losses. Converting from electricity to hydrogen costs 20%, so 10% difference. However, we are talking about the massive cost and visual intrusion of overhead pylons and the transformers/invertors required at substations along the way; the whole process is cheaper and easier using hydrogen - and not forgetting that we are talking ultimately about electricity costs that have fallen through the floor in the last two years. Onshore wind is 2.2c/kWh in some places, and solar below this. Offshore wind is likely to reach 4c/kWh in a year or two.
We are talking about a shift in the way we perceive energy as a whole; to consistantly undermine the argument with petty squabbling is to forget the many advantages of an integrated energy system. This is a whole system and perhaps some imagination is required if we are to convert the one we have to something that works into the future - batteries are simply not the only answer and never will be, no matter what your ideological perspective.
A more useful focus of attack would be the shale oil and gas industry, which is hemorrhaging money in the US, leading to concentrations of wealth and power that are plain unhealthy, and contributing to climate change and water loss in places like the mid-west on a scale we are not yet even beginning to understand.

BQSTART
But instead of placing a rising fee on carbon emissions to make fossil fuels pay their true cost to society, our governments are forcing the public to subsidize fossil fuels by 400 to 500 billion dollars per year worldwide, thus encouraging extraction of every fossil fuel -- mountaintop removal, longwall mining, fracking, tar sands, tar shale, deep ocean Arctic drilling. 
This path, if continued, guarantees that we will pass tipping points leading to ice sheet disintegration that will accelerate out of control of future generations. A large fraction of species will be committed to extinction. And [within a few decades] increasing intensity of droughts and floods will severely impact breadbaskets of the world, causing massive famines and economic decline.

Following the profound strategic transformation from black to green energy and the recent divestment of the upstream oil and gas production, the name DONG Energy does not fit the company anymore....DONG was originally short for Danish Oil and Natural Gas. With our profound strategic transformation and the divestment of our upstream oil and gas business, this is no longer who we are. Therefore, now is the right time to change our name.
Our vision is a world that runs entirely on green energy. Climate change is one of the most serious challenges facing the world today, and to avoid causing serious harm to the global ecosystems, we need to fundamentally change the way we power the world by switching from black to green energy
Henrik Poulsen, CEO of DONG Energy, says:
“2017 will be remembered as the year when offshore wind became cheaper than black energy, as demonstrated by the recent tenders for offshore wind in Germany and the UK. It has never been more clear that it is possible to create a world that runs entirely on green energy. ...
Over the past decade, DONG Energy has transformed itself from an energy company based on coal and oil to a global leader in renewable energy. The company has increased earnings considerably, while reducing the use of coal in its power stations and building out new offshore wind farms (see attachment). Since 2006, carbon emissions have been reduced by 52%, and by 2023, they will have been reduced by 96% compared to 2006.

Obvious from the business angle and excellent PR. Renewables are a safe investment becoming cheaper and more profitable all the time as fossil fuels become more expensive to extract. Electric cars? Who doesn’t want to in on that?! The initial target is achievable by default. With access to carbon markets, offsets and the usual grooming of policy makers much of this can be conjured by accountants

The Anglo Dutch firm is increasing capital expenditure for its new energies division, to $1bn-$2bn (£750m to £1.5bn) a year for 2018-2020, up from a previous plan of up to $1bn a year by 2020.
But the spending on wind power, biofuels and electric car infrastructure will still account for a small fraction of the giant’s planned $25-30bn annual investment. Shell has $5bn-$6bn a year pegged for deepwater drilling and $2-3bn a year allocated for shale oil and gas.
The company’s new climate change target aims to cut the net carbon footprint of its products in half by 2050, and around one-fifth by 2035. 
“It is making sure that the products within society have an overall lower carbon footprint. That is the longterm way of making sure our business remains a relevant business in the face of the energy transition,” said Ben van Beurden, Shell’s chief executive.
The carbon target is similar to one put forward by shareholder activists at the company’s AGM earlier this year, which the board opposed and defeated. 
Shell said the goal addressed the spirit of the shareholders’ proposal but the company’s chosen methodology meant it did not have “negative side-effects” of the resolution. “We could see a kernel of truth and relevance in there,” said Van Beurden.
The Dutch activist shareholder group behind the proposal, Follow This, welcomed the new target. 
“We applaud Shell’s ambitious decision to take leadership in achieving the goals of the Paris climate agreement to limit global warming to well below 2C,” said the group’s founder, Mark van Baal.
Shell said it would grow its new energies division through its existing businesses and by acquiring companies, as it has done recently by buying electric car charging firms Ionity and New Motion.
Van Beurden defended the level of spending on green energy. “Is the investment we are going to put in new energies enough? Let’s see, we have to start somewhere,” he said.
Wind and biofuels would have a key role, he said. “We will systematically improve, we will grow this business up to be a very significant part of the future of the company, otherwise you can’t even get to a 20% reduction of a carbon footprint. 
“But we have to do it in a disciplined way. If we destroy value in this process, no one is going to be served.”
However, the company said hydrocarbons would still be at the heart of its business and the global energy landscape over the next two decades. 
“Oil and gas will remain an important part of the energy system [up to 2030], no credible forecast says otherwise,” said Van Beurden. 
The 2015 Paris climate agreement is the first truly global deal to tackle climate change. It commits governments to limit temperature rises to no more than 2C – which scientists say is the threshold of safety, beyond which the effects of global warming are likely to become catastrophic and irreversible –  and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C. It has been signed by 197 countries. The US is on course to become the only country outside the agreement if it follows through on President Donald Trump’s vow to leave.
On the idea that some of its assets would be stranded by governments taking action on carbon emissions as part of the Paris climate deal, he said: “I think we will have very limited, if any, stranded assets [in the 2020s].”
The chief executive said that the firm sees underlying reasons that the oil price could go even higher than where it stands now, at just over $60 per barrel, but in the meantime the price could be unpredictable.
“I think we will see an era of volatility,” he said, adding: “You may argue the fundamentals point to a slightly higher oil price than we see at the moment.”
As expected, Shell also announced it was would begin rewarding shareholders in cash rather than issuing more shares.
“Ben van Beurden has delivered an early Christmas present for Shell shareholders,” said Nicholas Hyett, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, of the scrapping of the scrip dividend which was introduced after Shell bought gas behemoth BG Group for £35bn in 2016.

No, it’s governments that must take the initiative.

One of the main reasons many business exist in todays capitalist economy is because they are able to avoid or pass on to tax payers any of the costs associated with pollution and climate change and have done since the industrial revolution with only minor improvements. 
While companies are still allowed to pass off environmental costs as 'externalities' that are not included in their profit and loss statements any analysis will not reveal the true picture of its operations and viability on a warming planet.

“Punctuated sea-level rise events"" is a phrase worth chewing over.
As the glaciologist Richard Alley noted, ice sheet mass loss happens in spurts. Debris evidence indicates that as one section of an ice sheet loses its grip on land it slips. So although we know that multi-meter sea level rise is possible in a single century, it’s likely that some decades saw more rise than others.
Think of ice sheet retreat as a retreating army, moving quickly from one hilltop to the next and then pausing.
The 120km wide Thwaites Glacier in West Antarctica can drain 3.3m of sea level rise equivalent of ice (although its basin and surrounding basins only drain around a meter’s worth of ice, the rest of the ice sheet gets hit from behind). 
Ice cliffs appear to fail when they are over 100m in height and when Thwaites backs up of its stabilizing sill Alley said it’s going to try to make an ice cliff 4km high. 
When the top of an ice cliff falls off the bottom lifts and breaks off. When the bottom melts the top collapses. Notch it in the middle and they both fail.
Hence Marine Ice Sheet Instability or rapid and irreversible retreat.', u'recommendation_count': u'2', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1511909621000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'15131989', u'in_reply_to': u'108928595', u'id': u'108929269', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'PossumBilly', u'text': u'I yes wholeheartedly agree, however knowledge and facts are not instrumental to changing the 'opinions' of many, Those who have a different world view and a conflicting ideology.

They will? I wasn't aware this was ALP policy. When was it announced?
I do know the ALP continues to accept donations from the fossil fuel industry; that the best it can come up with in terms of climate change mitigation is an ""aspirational"" target of 50% renewables that is yet to be fleshed out with an actual policy; that, furthermore, it has no plan at present to reinstate a price on carbon or an ETS; that the Qld ALP government has given the proposed Adani mine a ""royalties holiday"" and had to be dragged, kicking and screaming, from backing the proposed taxpayer-funded loan in the middle of an election campaign only once polling told it which way the wind was blowing; that under Rudd it was more willing to work with the LNP you're forever trying to distance it from to produce an industry-friendly ETS that would have given billions of taxpayer dollars to the biggest polluters, rather than with The Greens on one that had teeth; that, once Abbott rolled Turnbull and that deal collapsed, Rudd walked away from ""the great moral, environmental and economic challenge of our time"", again rather than negotiate with The Greens to develop an effective policy that prioritised the environment, not capital; and that Gillard abandoned all plans to introduce a price on carbon once she in turn rolled Rudd, and only did so when cornered by The Greens, at which stage we finally got a scheme that worked - The Greens' scheme, that is. Need I go on?
The ALP is not the messiah when it comes to climate change mitigation.

However, the Centre for Policy Development (CPD) said companies needed to do so in a standardised way, so investors and regulators were able to easily understand economy-wide risks to whole industries.
The progressive thinktank urged Australia’s biggest businesses to use the Paris climate agreement as the centrepiece for their scenario planning, saying it provided a credible, long-term anchor for policies that limit global warming to well below 2C.
The group has released a discussion paper, called “Climate horizons: next steps for scenario analysis in Australia”, explaining the best way to do so.
Australia’s financial regulator warned in February that climate change posed a material risk to the entire financial system and urged companies to start adapting. Geoff Summerhayes, from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (Apra), told the Insurance Council of Australia’s annual forum in Sydney in February that Apra wanted companies to start incorporating “scenario-based analysis” of climate risks into their business outlooks.
He said Apra intended to start running stress tests of the financial system to see if it would survive various climate shocks, and all Apra-regulated entities would need to adapt to the coming regulatory changes. “I think the days of viewing climate change within a purely ethical, environmental or long-term frame have passed,” Summerhayes said.
The CPD’s new discussion paper suggested how Australian businesses could be consistent with the country’s international climate commitments under the Paris agreement and with the leading international framework for robust climate disclosures, the Financial Stability Board’s taskforce on climate-related financial disclosures (TCFD).
It said businesses ought to try to develop a standardised approach to scenario-based analysis, and that all scenario analyses should include:
Sam Hurley, the CPD’s policy director, said shareholders, courts and regulators like Apra clearly expected businesses and investors to prepare for climate change and also for the major physical impacts that are likely even if severe global warming of 2C or more is avoided.
CPD fellow Kate Mackenzie, a co-author of the paper, said many of the climate reference scenarios used by businesses only had a 50% chance of keeping global warming to 2C or less.
“Business-as-usual approaches have us on track for warming of three degrees or more, which would be incredibly damaging both economically and environmentally,” she said. “Scenario analysis work that does not factor in robust Paris-consistent scenarios will mean companies and investors underestimate the scale of the risks present and transitions required to meet Paris targets – and the opportunities that this transition will also create.”
The CPD discussion paper will be discussed at a public forum in Sydney on Wednesday. Summerhayes will be speaking at the event, along with Steven Skala, the chair of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, Christina Tonkin, the managing director of specialised finance at ANZ, and new CPD board member Sam Mostyn.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/29/australian-shareholders-should-be-told-climate-risk-to-profits-says-thinktank

Researchers from the University of Queensland, CSIRO, Australian Institute of Marine Science and the University of Sheffield searched the Great Barrier Reef for ideal areas that could potentially produce larvae and support the recovery of other damaged reefs. 
The Great Barrier Reef is the world’s largest living structure and is made up of more than 3800 individual reefs, stretching 2300km down Australia’s eastern coastline.
The study found 112 “robust source reefs” – just 3% of the entire system – which had “ideal properties to facilitate recovery” of others by spreading fertilised eggs to replenish other areas.
“Finding these 100 reefs is a little like revealing the cardiovascular system of the Great Barrier Reef,” said Prof Peter Mumby, from the University of Queensland’s school of biological sciences and ARC Centre of Excellence in Coral Reef Studies.
Researchers had strict criteria – the reefs must be consistently well connected to other reefs through the constantly shifting currents, be less likely to die in a coral bleaching event and be less susceptible to crown-of-thorn starfish outbreaks.
These reefs were more likely to still be standing in the event of bleaching incidents, for example, and were in the right location to send fertilised eggs to the reefs that need them during the annual reproduction, Mumby said.
“It gives us a bit more hope that the capacity for the barrier reef to heal itself is greater than we expected.”
There have been four significant bleaching events on the Australian reef, including one this year. The longest and worst for the Great Barrier Reef was in 2016, when bleaching caused by climate change killed almost 25% of the reef. 
Scientists have only recently been able to understand how connected the reefs are by ocean currents, Mumby said.
“The Great Barrier Reef is about the size of Italy and at any given time there are patches that have been damaged and patches that are pretty good, so it has an ability to heal itself if you like.”
The researchers used ocean circulation simulations to model the connectivity of the reef larvae across the Great Barrier Reef and generated 208 networks, through which the 112 strong reefs could reach almost half of all reefs through their “amazing capacity to connect the wider system”.
“It’s not perfect,” Mumby said. “There are areas in the northern barrier reefs where there are relatively few of these reefs identified.
“So some next steps are to relax the criteria and look at plan B and plan C.”
Associate professor John Alroy, from Macquarie University’s department of biological sciences, also noted the lack of the robust reefs in the north, saying the research paper was “thorough and interesting” but optimistic.
“That makes me wonder whether reefs in the far north can really be kept alive by being replenished from the south.”
Alroy also suggested many of the Great Barrier Reef’s animals would be absent from those reefs and suggested the paper did not fully acknowledge the worsening nature of climate change, which would probably also kill the robust reefs anyway. 
Dr Andrew Lenton, principal research scientist at CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere, said the report identified what was needed to maximise the capacity of coral to recover, including the protection of the robust reefs.
“It also recognises that this alone is not likely to be sufficient to ensure the longer-term viability of the Great Barrier as a whole and will need to be coupled with climate mitigation, local management and active management such as coral re-seeding.”
Mumby said new information about the reef and the way it functioned and repaired itself was readily adopted by the marine park authorities into its management plans, and received support from the federal government.
“This list of around 100 reefs is both a tangible and feasible set of intervention points to form part of a strategy for maintaining the systemic resilience of an ecosystem that is thousands of kilometres in scale,” the report said.
Tourism generated by the 2 million annual visitors to the reef contributes almost $6bn to the Australian economy.
The “life support” reefs identified in the study were good news, Mumby said, but more needed to be done to ensure the survival of the Great Barrier Reef.
In May scientists warned that the central goal of the government’s protection plan was no longer feasible because of the dramatic impact of climate change.
“It’s very clear that in order to maintain a beautiful reef into the future, we absolutely need to be much more aggressive in our response to climate change,” Mumby said. “We need coherent policies in government about what government is trying to achieve in our actions towards climate change and we need to continue to invigorate the local protections.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/29/great-barrier-reef-scientists-identify-potential-life-support-system

For example, CO2 was last over 400 ppm in the Pliocene.
Global average temperatures then eventually reached 3 or 4 degrees C (5.4-7.2 degrees F) higher than today’s and as much as 10 degrees C (18 degrees F) warmer at the poles.
Sea level ranged between five and 40 metres (16 to 131 feet) higher than today.
Earth systems take time to respond to forcings - sea level can't suddenly rise on that scale, because it takes time for enough heat to be accumulated to melt enough ice.
And we are not stopping at 400 ppm - the level is still rising.
The geological record tells us what happens when lots of CO2 is added to the air.
These events are marked in the geochemical record by negative carbon isotope excursions.
You could look up the end-Permian, the Toarcian, the PETM, and the ETM2, for example.
When igneous activity heated up coal seams in the end-Permian event, the extra CO2 produced by the process caused global warming and ocean acidification, and these led to extinctions.
There's an interesting recent paper on that

With the exception of one prominent study that projects the loss of most West Antarctic ice by 2500 under even moderate warming scenarios, other recent research is still broadly consistent with the AR5 assessment that marine ice sheet instability contribution to sea level rise will “not exceed several tenths of a meter” by 2100. Thus the AR5 projections still represent current understanding, although suggestions that the contribution could be greater than was previously assessed need further evaluation. Quantitative uncertainties, reflected in the spread of results from recent studies, reinforce the need for better understanding of the processes leading to ice shelf and ice sheet retreat.

A paper worth looking at is -
""A human-induced hothouse climate?"" - Kidder & Worsley, 2011
Here's a key quote from the Conclusions:
""The likely cool greenhouse in which about half of Antarctica is still ice-covered means devastation from the tens of meters sea level is likely to rise (e.g., Ward, 2010), and poleward shifting of warm climate belts.""
So the appropriate term for what's likely to happen is a 'cool greenhouse', which sounds harmless, but is not.
It's a very interesting paper.
How quickly?
Another quote:
""a cool greenhouse seems imminent within perhaps a century or two.""
However, although those conditions could set in within that time, the process of melting half of the ice on Antarctica would take around 1000 years.
Meanwhile the
""poleward shifting of warm climate belts.""
means that the equatorial regions will become increasingly inhospitable - but over time, not in a couple of years.
The nearest comparison is probably the PETM.
The current rate of rise in CO2 is faster than during the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum.
The fossil record in rocks formed around the equator during the PETM is really poor, and that's an indication that life was extremely stressed.
If the tropics become virtually uninhabitable, there will be mass migrations far greater than any seen recently.
Agriculture is basically adapted to the mostly-stable Holocene - that is not going to be the offer from earth systems as the effects of CO2 continue.

Both these insects need warmer conditions than the UK could supply until recently.
Flying animals, like birds and insects, respond rapidly to climate change.
For example, beetles.
Professor Russell Coope was the first to discover abrupt climate change events in the geological record of the 'ice age', while doing research for his Ph.D back in the 1950s.
Coope - who was my palaeontology lecturer long ago - made his discovery entirely by accident, while researching fossil beetle assemblages in 'ice age' sedimentary successions.
He ended up spending decades applying this technique to more and more examples of similar sedimentary successions.
The process works because a beetle wing-case is usually sufficient to identify a species, and the species have not changed much in a long time.
Any given collection of species taken together indicates a very precise temperature.
His discovery tells us that the Earth's climates are not fundamentally stable.
These rapid climate events were confirmed a few decades later by ice cores from the Greenland ice sheet..... the events he discovered had a number of natural causes.
Not long before he died in 2011, he said that people are messing with the trigger that causes climate change, and the consequences are likely to be 'ferocious'.

If he meant no bird song, then, when he was writing, during the cooler climatic interlude known as the Little Ice Age, he would have been spot-on. 
Apart from the robin, which unusually among our songbirds holds an autumn territory and so sings throughout the season, the parks and gardens around Hood’s north London home would have been silent in these dark days of late autumn.
But that certainly isn’t true now. Thanks to the effects of climate change, combined with the “urban-heat-island effect” – in which cities are several degrees warmer than the surrounding countryside – London is now a hotspot for unseasonal birdsong. Visit any of the capital’s parks, especially at dawn when the sound of commuter traffic has yet to reach its peak, and you’ll hear a wide range of songbirds. 
Listen out for the impossibly loud song of the wren – with the trill my fellow writer Dominic Couzens calls “the twiddle in the middle” – as this tiny bird signals its presence from deep inside hedgerows and shrubberies. Joining the chorus are the great tit, which sings its “tea-cher, tea-cher” song from a prominent twig, the scolding, frantic sound of the blue tit, and the rather monotonous song of the dunnock.
For something a little more exotic, pay a visit to the WWT’s London Wetland Centre or the RSPB’s Rainham Marshes reserve, where you can hear the explosive sound of a relatively recent colonist, Cetti’s warbler, more or less all year round.

 Chile’s Conaf forestry service shared photos on social media of the enormous block of blue-white ice, which measured 350m (1,148ft) long by 380m (1,247ft) wide, as it floated free in waters of a glacial lagoon near the southern tip of the South American continent.
 Park officials at Chile’s Torres del Paine National Park, home to the glacier, said such ruptures were rare and had not occurred since the early 1990s.
Dr Ricardo Jaña, glaciologist from the Chilean Antarctic Institute, said the iceberg was bigger than expected.
“This is a situation we had anticipated, but the most singular and anecdotal thing is that it is an iceberg of much larger dimensions, which is notable.”
 Torres del Paine is one of Chile’s most popular tourist attractions, famous for its mountain views and visited by more than 115,000 tourists annually, according to Conaf.
Grey glacier is located in the Southern Patagonian ice field, just west of the Cordillera del Paine. Before dividing in two at its front end, the glacier is 6km wide and more than 30m high.

Geoff Summerhayes from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (Apra) revealed it had begun quizzing companies about their actions to assess climate risks, noting it would be demanding more in the future.
Apra also revealed it has established an internal working group to assess the financial risk from climate change and was coordinating an interagency initiative with the corporate watchdog Asic, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and federal Treasury to examine what risks climate change was posing to Australia’s economy.
In February, Summerhayes put banks, lenders and insurance companies on notice, urging them to start adapting to climate change and warning that the regulator would be “on the front foot on climate risk”.
Now, in the first significant update to Apra’s thinking on the topic since that speech, Summerhayes said Apra’s view was that climate change and society’s response to it “are starting to affect the global economy”.
In an extended version of a speech to the progressive Centre for Policy Development, and circulated to journalists ahead of its delivery, Summerhayes said a shift occurring in the global economy was increasingly being driven by commercial imperatives – investments, innovation and reputational factors – rather than what scientists or policymakers are saying or doing.
“Apra is not a scientific body and I can’t say with 100% conviction to what extent scientists’ predictions of increasing temperatures, rising sea levels, more frequent droughts and more intense storms will impact the Australian economy,” Summerhayes said.
“But what I can tell you with absolute certainty is that the transition to a low-carbon economy is underway and moving quickly.”
Summerhayes reported that a Sustainable Insurance Forum meeting in December was told that “that keeping the planet on track to meet the Paris agreement’s two-degree target could reduce fossil fuel revenues globally by a cumulative $33 trillion by 2040”.
“So while the debate continues about the physical risks, the transition to a low-carbon economy is underway and that means the so-called transition risks are unavoidable,” Summerhayes said.
He noted that Apra would be conducting a survey of entities it regulated over the next few months, to find out what the emerging best practice was, and that there is a global trend towards a requirement for companies to disclose climate-related risks.
Summerhayes said Apra had already begun scrutinising the financial sector in this regard and had begun coordinating with other agencies.
He said the regulator had already been asking questions of companies about what they have done in relation to his comments in February and said over time they will expect “more sophisticated answers, especially from well-resourced and complex entities”.
He said the inter-agency initiative created between Apra, Asic, the RBA and Treasury would investigate whether companies are taking steps to protect themselves and their customers from the physical, transitional and liability risks caused by climate change.
The involvement of Asic in the initiative is interesting following advice from Noel Hutley SC last year finding company directors who do not properly consider the material impacts of climate change on their business risk personal liability for breach of duty.
“So whether due to regulatory action or – more likely – pressure from investors and consumers, Australia’s financial sector can expect to see more emphasis on discourse around climate risk exposure and management,” Summerhayes said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/29/banks-warned-of-regulatory-action-as-climate-change-bites-global-economy

The above mentioned paper is clearly an attempt to delegitimize the validity of a scientific author without directly dealing with that authors work and instead using alleged findings in social science. Finding groupings in (as yet un-named) ""denier"" blogs does not actually undermine any tangible science criticisms made by Susan Crockford, believe it or not.
So when I read the social science paper dismissed her as unqualified and unpublished in this quote here:

and then I subsequently find that this can easily be argued against, I raised that point.

Dear Sirs,
You recently published an article by Harvey et al. (Internet blogs, polar bears, and climate-change denial by proxy), which maliciously made a variety of defamatory and untrue allegations against me. These false allegations include: that I have no published peer-reviewed papers on polar bears, that I have manufactured my expertise, that I criticize polar bear researchers without supporting evidence, and that I have ignored or misrepresented science. Over and above these accusations and allegations being untrue, defamatory and malicious, the paper misrepresents my actual expertise. The paper pointedly leaves out the fact that I am a professional zoologist with a Ph.D. and over forty years of experience and dozens of peer-reviewed papers on various topics, and also fails to mention that I have recently published a detailed academic critique on the issue of polar bear conservation status.
MISREPRESENTING MY CREDENTIALS AND EXPERTISEYou (referring here, and below, to the journal collectively with the authors) falsely alleged that I have no expertise on the subject of polar bears.
The paper states: “Notably, as of this writing, Crockford has neither conducted any original research nor published any articles in the peer-reviewed literature on polar bears.”
The paper fails to mention that my Ph.D. dissertation on speciation included polar bears: the paper only says that the Global Warming Policy Foundation describes me as “an expert on polar bear evolution” (as if this is probably a lie). Zoology is the relevant general field for the study of polar bears. My particular specialty of evolutionary theory has a zero field or laboratory component but that does not mean I am not a qualified zoologist, or that I lack expertise in polar bear biology.
In addition to my dissertation that features polar bears, I have an article on evolution in a peer-reviewed journal in which polar bears are prominently featured (Crockford 2003), and two official comments, with references, on polar bear hybridization (which is how official responses to published papers are handled in these two journals). I also have a paper in a peer-reviewed book chapter on ringed seals, the primary prey of polar bears (Crockford and Frederick 2011), and a peer-reviewed journal article on the paleohistory of Bering Sea ice, the habitat of Chukchi Sea polar bears (Crockford and Frederick 2007).

Typically vague denialist crap, either name the author you have defamed and name Crockford's peer reviewed paper on Polar Bears
BQEND
Her's hoping will do a search, and find the inflammatory article he has posted on a denialist blog roll that he is a regular contributor to.
It's a blog roll that squarely fits the profile of unscientific sites that the paper described in the ATL article looks at.
It was set up by some ex-CiF posters who were notorious deniers and who regularly got accounts suspended for breaking guidelines by making allegations that they never backed up. It also has many similar characters whose avatars/names would be recognised by long time CiF readers.
None of the material he has presented here is new, its all covered in the long rambling ideological diatribe against climate scientists.
Unsurprisingly, that blog roll entry fulminates in the comments area against this Grauniad article, so it is also no surprise that some of the usual suspects turn up repeating similar arguments here.
As you say the key thing is, Dr Crockford has not got a history of publishing peer reviewed scientific papers on Polar Bears, and certainly none for their current and projected population trends. All they have is vague tangental references in a couple of papers, and then fall back on other unscientific denialist blog rolls. Again, all documented in the paper described in the ATL article.
The broken record of denial keeps playing.

With science based articles, such as those on global warming in the Guardian I appreciate that the newspaper provides links to the peer reviewed scientific papers published in scientific journals. With science the final drilling down comes down to the evidence and its interpretation plus the manner in which that evidence was gathered.
Unlike the study described above I have not made a thorough review of blogs about climate science but have found, with the exception of those put up by scientists, that the few, I have been referred to by people denying the established science, disregard the overwhelming scientific evidence. My academic teaching career was restricted to undergraduates but an important part of that was ensuring the students covered the field - its evidence and its interpretation- thoroughly and evenly. At the post graduate level the standards of such thoroughness and objectivity expected of me, were higher still.
I first became aware of climate science denial when working voluntarily in my daughter's electorate office when she was minister for climate change, an older female constituent came into the office and informed me, with complete confidence, that scientists did not agree that there was climate change and did not agree on what had caused it. This didn't gel with my experience of a wide variety of scientists over the preceding forty years. Where did this woman's confidence come from? 
Where does the average person in Brisbane, who is not working in a scientific field get their information about global warming and climate change? There are regular opinion pieces in the Courier Mail by Murdock columnists on global warming which make no reference to peer reviewed papers published in proper scientific journals but which repeat the same overused and unsubstantial chestnuts found in the climate science denial blogs. Such people we alarmed that the was a minister for climate change which was something they believed didn't exist and their belief was based on the denier blogs they referred me to.
Given that the daily and only newspaper repeats what is published in climate science denial blogs and that the pseudo-scientific arguments of these blogs are just not up to scratch how can you claim the role of these blogs in the misinformation presented to the general public is unsubstantiated.
What's alarmist about describing the reality of how misinformation about science is spread in our society? What danger is being exaggerated? As science is the best way of knowing what really going on in the world around us, is there not a danger in people not knowing what's going on, because they've only had access to misinformation.', u'recommendation_count': u'5', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1512476148000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'what', u'effect': u'it'}, {u'cause': u""they 've only had access to misinformation"", u'effect': u""as science is the best way of knowing what really going on in the world around us is there not a danger in people not knowing what 's going on""}], u'author_id': u'12483673', u'in_reply_to': u'109234452', u'id': u'109246775', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'idontreadtheguardian', u'text': u'Sorry, I thought this thread was closed, which is why I replied elsewhere. The studies reported on are not necessarily alarmist (although some are fairly spurious and many seem ideologically-driven). However, the spin put on these studies by the articles reporting on them in this publication is almost invariably alarmist, in my opinion. The headlines and sub-headers, in particular, often grossly misrepresent the context of the studies.
Take the study that the article aboves reports on. The abstract claims that it shows that blogs that deny or downplay AGW disregard the overwhelming scientific evidence. OK, well, maybe it does. I didn't read the whole thing.
However the abstract also claims that there is a wide gap between this broad scientific consensus and public opinion; and that Internet blogs have strongly contributed to this consensus gap by fomenting misunderstandings of AGW causes and consequences. While I agree with the claim there is a wide gap between the scientific consensus and public opinion, the further claim that blogs have strongly contributed to this gap appears to be completely unsubstantiated.
So, the study may not be alarmist, but it seems fanciful to me. The article above that reports on it however, has this as it's sub-heading: ""How climate denial blogs misinform so many people with such poor scientific arguments."" So, it takes the unsubstantiated part of the study and puts it front and centre. And, it makes it sound like a really big problem: so many people are being misinformed! Oh, the humanity!

BQSTART
When talking about the future, use of words like ""will"" (or ""is / are [not]"", or ""must"", ...) is unjustified. 
In science, phrases such as ""are [very / extremely] [un]likely to"" (or ""with a probability of X%"", ...) are to be preferred.
BQEND
After some evolution of the discussion, I added the following (to both ""pecadillo"" and UO) :
BQSTART
The point that I was attempting to make was that declarations implying ""absolute 100% [guaranteed] certainty"", as exemplified by the unqualified use of phrases like ""is [not]"" and ""are [not]"" and ""will [not]"", is unjustified by people on all sides. 
Use of words like ""could"", ""might"", ""may"", ""likely"" and ""probably"" are more appropriate in a scientific context.
BQEND
Another (minor) point to add is that when someone is trying to ""bounce"" you into signing something you should watch out for them not giving you time to check on data and think about the possible consequences (yes, I have been ""burned"", and lost money because of this, in the past !).
Phrases to watch out for here are ""[right] now"" / ""immediately"" / ""today"" / ""without delay"" / etc.

""We KNOW enough to KNOW beyond ANY doubt that the increase WILL BE sufficient to harm human civilization, and that it WILL occur soon enough that it MUST BE addressed NOW.""

BQEND
Incorrect.
Firstly, your4 graph is shorn of context which would tell you why your claim is wrong.
Secondly, the graph does not show NET sea ice cover. It shows the standard deviation from the normal for each of the poles, and the sea ice cover is not equal in size - one is a continent, one is an ocean.
Third, Antarctic ice has not been recovering, all but a couple of outliers so a net decrease in continental ice volume.
Fourthly, it was anticipated that Antarctic sea ice may have a short term growth due to changes in sea water salinity and changes in ocean currents. This is not anticipated to be a long term trend.
Here is some scientific analysis of net sea ice cover.

BQSTART
Sea ice increases in Antarctica do not make up for the accelerated Arctic sea ice loss of the last decades, a new NASA study finds. As a whole, the planet has been shedding sea ice at an average annual rate of 13,500 square miles (35,000 square kilometers) since 1979, the equivalent of losing an area of sea ice larger than the state of Maryland every year.

This article is about climate change denial. It's not about climate change and the dangers thereof.

I base my knowledge of developments in climate science on the results of scientific studies described in peer reviewed scientific papers published in proper scientific journals. It's good to keep with what's happening in science. Why do you rely so much on the popular media for such technical information? While understanding science does require the use of your imagination that use is constrained by the evidence. Many recent peer reviewed papers on climate science published in proper scientific journals show that global warming and climate warming are continuing at the rate at which they occurred for the last half of the last century and that this continued warming has increased (and in some cases decreased) the frequency and strength of some weather patterns and phenomena as well as the direct effects of warmer seas. These climate changes have had a variety of run on ecological effects.

Anything is a pollutant if it is emitted by an industrial process or processes in quantities that throw the existing balance out. If industrial processes truned 50% of the atmosphere into CO2 and the world was choking, would you be claiming it wasn't pollution? 
0.2% CO2 in our atmosphere worked well. 0.4% does not.

Instead they focus on what a new study published in the journal Bioscience calls “keystone dominoes.” These are individual pieces of evidence that capture peoples’ attention, like polar bears. The authors write:
These topics are used as “proxies” for AGW [human-caused global warming] in general; in other words, they represent keystone dominoes that are strategically placed in front of many hundreds of others, each representing a separate line of evidence for AGW. By appearing to knock over the keystone domino, audiences targeted by the communication may assume all other dominoes are toppled in a form of “dismissal by association.”
Basically, if these bloggers can create the perception that the science underlying polar bear or Arctic sea ice vulnerability to climate change is incorrect, their readers will assume that all of climate science is fatally flawed. And blogs can be relatively influential – surveys have shown that blog readers trust them more than traditional news and information sources.
In this study, the authors examined the arguments made by 45 denier blogs and 45 science-based blogs regarding the impact of human-caused global warming on polar bear populations and Arctic sea ice extent. They found that the science-based blogs all showed that Artic sea ice is declining, and nearly all said that global warming threatens polar bear populations. 
Conversely, the denier blogs nearly all denied that Arctic sea ice is declining or argued that we can’t predict how it will change in the future, and that polar bears aren’t threatened and/or will adapt to climate change.
The authors also noted that unsurprisingly, the science-based blogs had much stronger supporting arguments:
Scientific blogs provided convincing evidence that AGW poses a threat to both, whereas most denier blogs did not. Science-based blogs overwhelmingly used the frame of established scientific certainties and supported arguments with the published literature affirming that warming is rapidly reducing seasonal Arctic sea-ice extent and threatening the mid- to longer-term survival of polar bears, whereas those written by deniers did not.
In fact, on the question of polar bears, the study authors found that as their primary source, nearly 80% of denier blogs referenced another blog written by a zoologist named Susan Crockford. However, Crockford has never conducted research on current polar bear populations or published any peer-reviewed studies on the subject. There are experts on this subject, like the Polar Bear Specialist Group, but deniers cite Crockford quite simply because she’s one of the few scientists who tells them what they want to hear.
The study authors also examined 92 peer-reviewed papers on polar bears and Arctic sea ice and grouped them using the same categories as the denier and science-based blog posts. As the figure below shows, the scientific research (green triangles) is extremely consistent in concluding that climate change threatens both polar bears and Arctic sea ice, although a few papers (6.5% - the red triangles) suggested that polar bears might be able to adapt to their changing environment.
The science-based blogs (blue diamonds) cluster quite closely to the findings in the scientific research, while the denier blogs (yellow squares) are off in their own world denying that human activity is causing a long-term decline in polar bear populations and Arctic sea ice.
Indeed, the scientific research is quite clear that Arctic sea ice is in the midst of a rapid decline due primarily to human-caused global warming. Because polar bears rely on sea ice to hunt seals, global warming also threatens their species. While some polar bear sub-populations are stable thus far, others are declining, and that trend will only accelerate as sea ice continues to disappear.
The authors conclude their paper by encouraging their scientific colleagues to engage with the public and counter scientific misinformation:
We believe that it is imperative for more scientists to venture beyond the confines of their labs and lecture halls to directly engage with the public and policymakers, as well as more strongly confronting and resisting the well-funded and organized network of AGW denial. This can be done in numerous ways. For example, scientists can be more proactive in approaching the media to emphasize the importance of research findings or to counter misinterpretations. They can also begin to encourage initiatives that empower citizen participation in scientific research, such as citizen science, as is being done currently at several major universities and research institutes. Moreover, scientists need to more effectively use Internet-based social media to their full advantage in order to turn the tide in the battle for public opinion.
They note that this is no simple request because there are few rewards in academics for those who combat misinformation. In fact, many like Katharine Hayhoe, Michael Mann, a Ben Santer have been attacked for their scientific work through what study co-author Mann coined ‘the Serengeti Strategy’:
Nevertheless, climate denial can be influential, and climate scientists remain trusted sources. Their responses to scientific misinformation can be powerful. For example, Climate Feedback (which enlists climate scientists to review news articles related to climate change) is a highly respected and influential resource.
It’s also important that we not lose sight of the forest for the trees.

This deglacial warming was initiated by a peak in Northern Hemisphere high latitude summer insolation (NHHLSI) produced by orbital and axial cycles. This peak produced a meltwater pulse which stopped the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) allowing the Southern Ocean to warm, resulting in oxidation of high carbon ocean sediments increasing atmospheric CO2 resulting in global greenhouse warming resulting, with a 200 year delay in further meltwater that suppressed the AMOC leading to a positive feedback that led to more global greenhouse warming as atmospheric CO2 increased by 40% from 200 to 280 ppm over 11,000 years.
 At 8,000 years ago NHHLSI was still declining from that 19,000 ybp peak and has continued to decline to this day. With an added 120 metres of ocean depth those Southern Ocean sediments had stopped oxidising and from 5,000 years on meltwater pulses ceased restoring AMOC and cooling the Southern Ocean. With declining NHHLSI and atmospheric CO2 remaining on 280 ppm, temperatures have slowly declined since 5,000 years ago until the last 200 years where fossil fuel combustion, a fast form of oxidation, produced another 40% increase in atmospheric CO2 and consequent global greenhouse warming.
You say ""We are well overdue for a meltwater pulse as the last one was about 8,000 years ago"". Given, as described above, that the conditions that produced that last meltwater pulse have disappeared with that 120 metre rise in ocean levels why do you say one is due now when the next repeat of the above mentioned natural scenario would not have been due for another 150,000 years.
 The current global greenhouse warming is the result of the burning of fossil fuels, not the oxidization of high carbon Southern Ocean sediments. As with the CO2 pulses and global greenhouse warming from 19,000 to 8,000 years ago, the peak of the meltwater pulse may not be due for another 200 years.', u'recommendation_count': u'2', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1512199396000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'a series of meltwater pulses', u'effect': u""from 19,000 to 8,000 years ago sea level rose by 120 as global greenhouse warming increased the earth 's average climate temperature by around 4 degrees c above the temperatures of the last glacial or ice age""}, {u'cause': None, u'effect': u'global greenhouse warming resulting'}, {u'cause': None, u'effect': u'oxidation of high carbon ocean sediments increasing atmospheric co2 resulting in global greenhouse warming resulting'}, {u'cause': u'that', u'effect': u'more global greenhouse warming'}, {u'cause': None, u'effect': u'a positive feedback that led to more global greenhouse warming as atmospheric co2 increased by 40 % from 200 to 280 ppm over 11,000 years'}], u'author_id': u'12483673', u'in_reply_to': u'108989221', u'id': u'109087047', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Walsunda', u'text': u'The graph you link to is of ACE or accumulated cyclone energy for each cyclone season.

There are multiple reasons of salinity intrusion in the coastal area of Bangladesh. It includes natural, socioeconomic and political systems. All these systems are interlinked to each other.

Those reviewied are:- critical geographical location of the country, - low flow condition of the river by a barrage in the upstream neighboring country, - faulty management of coastal polders, - sea level rise, - cyclone and storm surge, - back water effect, - precipitation- shrimp culture

""The acceleration in ice sheet mass loss already puts on pace for a meter of sea level rise by 2100""
BQEND
Thank you for making that clearer. However, taking all of the science into account there is far less certainty than your statement suggests: 
With the exception of one prominent study that projects the loss of most West Antarctic ice by 2500 under even moderate warming scenarios, other recent research is still broadly consistent with the AR5 assessment that marine ice sheet instability contribution to sea level rise will “not exceed several tenths of a meter” by 2100. Thus the AR5 projections still represent current understanding, although suggestions that the contribution could be greater than was previously assessed need further evaluation. Quantitative uncertainties, reflected in the spread of results from recent studies, reinforce the need for better understanding of the processes leading to ice shelf and ice sheet retreat.

Salinity mainly affects land and water in the coastal areas. With the consequence of climate change, it gradually extends towards inland water and soil. This scenario of gradual salinity intrusion in the coastal area of Bangladesh is very threatening to the primary production system, coastal biodiversity and human health. The total amount of salinity affected land in Bangladesh was 83.3 million hectares in 1973, which had been increased up to 102 million hectares in 2000 and the amount has raised to 105.6 million hectares in 2009 and continuing to increase (Soil Resources Development Institute (SRDI), 2010) [1]. In the last 35 years, salinity had been increased around 26 percent in this country. Salinity intrusion is spreading into the non-coastal areas as well. Recently, International Rice Research Institute (IRRI)’s Seed Study, funded by USAID, has identified 12 districts of Bangladesh as salinity affected area through GIS mapping [2]. This paper analyzes the cause of salinity intrusion in the coastal belt of Bangladesh such as: critical geographical location of the country, low flow condition of the river by a barrage in the upstream neighboring country, faulty management of coastal polders, sea level rise, cyclone and storm surge, back water effect, precipitation and shrimp culture. This paper also helps the decision makers and planners in sustainable social, agricultural, environmental and other water resources management plan for the coastal region of Bangladesh.""

...not saltwater intrusion (which came later).
On saltwater intrusion, you demonstrate yet more naivite or ignorance. The biggest cause of seawater intrusion along coastal aquifers is over abstraction, not sea level rise. A 20 or 30 cm sea level rise, over the past century does not cause seawater intrusion. The position of the seawater-freshwater interface is defined by the balance between sea level and the rate of fresh groundwater outflow. Its analgous to the delta level. If you over abstract coastal aquifers, this will pull in the interface by 10s of metres or more. The effect of a 20-30cm sea level rise is trivial in comparison. But, anyway, its clear you don't know your water science.

The GSA study makes clear, moreover, that the new dam is only one of a series of environmental threats now facing Egypt. 
Rising sea levels, brought on by climate change, are the most obvious of them. Much of the Nile Delta is only a meter or so above sea level, and a 2014 analysis led by Assuit University geologist Ahmed Sefelnasr predicted that a half-meter rise in sea level would shrink the delta by 19 percent, an area equivalent to all of metropolitan Los Angeles. 
That was the conservative scenario. If the sea level rises by one meter in this century, as many climate scientists think likely, a third of the delta could disappear under the Mediterranean. 
That analysis did not consider the likely effects of the significantly greater rise predicted by a 2016 study in Nature.

Even a modest increase in sea level will imperil much of the south-eastern US’s heritage by the end of the century, researchers found, with 13,000 sites threatened by a 1m increase. 
Thousands more areas will be threatened as the seas continue to climb in the years beyond this, forcing the potential relocation of the White House and Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC and inundation of historic touchstones such as the Kennedy Space Center and St Augustine, Florida, which lays claim to being the oldest city in the US.
“There are going to be a lot of cultural sites lost and the record of humanity’s history will be put at risk,” said David Anderson, a University of Tennessee anthropologist who led the published research. 
“Some sites will be destroyed, some buried in marshes. We may be able to relocate some. In some places it will be devastating. We need to properly understand the magnitude of this.”
Threatened areas, including locations on the national register of historic places, include Native American sites that date back more than 10,000 years, as well as early colonial settlements such as Jamestown, Virginia and Charleston, South Carolina. Researchers pinpointed known sites using topographical data and analyzed how they would fare in various sea level rise scenarios.
Florida, which has a southern portion particularly vulnerable to sea level rise, has the most sites in danger from a 1m raising of the oceans, followed by Louisiana and Virginia. 
A 1m sea level rise by 2100 could prove optimistic, with several studies showing the increase could be much greater. Scientists have warned that the break up of the Antarctic ice sheet could significantly fuel sea level rise, pushing the global increase to around 6ft by 2100. 
The latest US government estimate predicts a worldwide increase of 1ft to 4ft by 2100, although an 8ft rise “cannot be ruled out”.
The eastern seaboard of the US is at particular risk, with water piling up along the coast in greater volumes than the global average. The problem is compounded by areas of the coast, such as in New Jersey and Virginia, gradually subsiding due to long-term geological hangover from a vast ice sheet that once covered much of North America.
Sea level rise is expected to displace millions of people from the US coasts over the next coming decades, with Anderson warning this will create further damage to heritage sites as people move inland. 
There is still some uncertainty over the exact timescale involved in the changes – it may take several hundred years for some coastal places to be at risk – leading to hopes that coastlines can be adapted in time in order to protect vital infrastructure and sacred sites. But losses appear inevitable.
“Putting a sea wall around the whole of the US won’t be an easy thing to do and would cause a lot of damage elsewhere,” said Anderson. “We are going to have to do a lot of planning as a civilization in the next 50 to 100 years and we have to take heritage into account.”
Coastal heritage has been lost by previous fluctuations in sea level rise and Harold Wanless, a coastal geologist at the University of Miami who wasn’t involved in the study, said that tough decisions will need to be made as to what to protect in the future.
“We will have to look at how much effort we expend saving these sites over more practical things such as critical infrastructure or developing new agriculture resources,” Wanless said. “Our human history is important but there are a lot of new things to focus on. They will all need time and effort.”
Human-driven climate change is already creating its own historical artifacts, with around a dozen towns in Alaska set to be abandoned or relocated due to rising sea levels and diminishing sea ice. In Louisiana, a community near New Orleans received federal funding last year to relocate because much of their low-lying land has disappeared.
“It’s going to be an important choice for government,” said Rob Thieler, a sea level rise expert at the US Geological Survey. “There’s land that is becoming uninhabitable right now and we’ve seen from the hurricanes this year that people have to leave not just from the flooding but because infrastructure and services become unreliable.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/29/buried-in-marshes-sea-level-rise-could-destroy-historic-sites-on-us-east-coast

The nearly successful revolution in Europe of 1848 started the first regulations of the workplace, the call for universal vote, unemployment pay, right to unionise, public education etc, which is the meaning of US liberalism.

We do live in a democracy ( people vote for policies).

Some business ( farmers, fossil fuel industries, fashion etc) are trying to reduce their carbon footprint. Maybe the guardian should balance it's ""bad fossil fuel industry"" articles with news of the many business owners whom are making significant steps towards being more environmentally responsible for all our good. 
The usual rhetoric "" that will lose jobs"" or "" this is bad for the economy"" etc etc, without providing more substance on these presumptions is not a logical debate.

I bet economics calculate the value of being the Zoo with the final living Gorilla. Imagine the profit in that - after we have killed all the rest for other types of revenue. 
In a cost benefit world - everything is calculated like this. 
This is humanity. To think that it is lovely to see mountain with a glacier on it has no value until some tourist operator can show that it has true value in dollars. To be in awe of seeing the milkyway on the sky - pretty much every city on the planet has gladly given up that - since the revenue from pollution is clearly worth that non-profitable gaze a child can send. That the child also gets Astma when growing up - that is an expense for the next generations to figure out. So it does not count as a cost. 
It is worth remembering that the only theory that needs net profit to expand is economics. For physics, for example - exponential growth of the universe is such a problem that one have to invent ""dark energy"" and conclude that the universe will die a very empty place.

Almost all your energy is fossil. AKA the ""cheap type"", if we belive the global commercial. You abandoned the carbon tax a few years ago as well. And then you doubled your energy-bills and now are world-leading on electric price. 
This is the nation who want to open new coal mines to sell cheap to India and China - while digging it up yourself to make energy at home for a cost to customers that make pretty much any other nation on the planet look silly for selling energy so cheap. 
It makes me wonder if the price of energy in Australia has little to do with the cheapness of source - but something else. 
Are people in Australia wondering if someone may be playing the grid, for example, to suck money out of your bills? 
Seriously - the price of watts in Australia now makes solar panels and wind-mills look like gold-mines of profit. 
And still - 40% of Australia think that to dig up more coal so cheap at home that China (selling a kWh for a quarter of what it cost in Australia while expanding capacity and building the grid like crazy over the last few decades) will find that cost after shipping interesting?
None of them see a flag - red or not - following this logic? Still thinking that to dig up more coal in Australia will get the price down at home?
What is going on down-under? I seriously do not get it. Your politics is all about - not only does a rather small population have an entire continent to dig up to sell for profit by selling that product to low-cost nations - you think it is windfarms that drive the cost of energy up in Australia?

My guess is that corporations will switch focus quite quickly. Money talks. As long as the reduction is profitable, they'll take the reduction.

The report, co-authored by Corporate Accountability, uncovers a litany of ways in which fossil fuel companies have gained high-level access to negotiations and manipulated outcomes.
It highlights a string of examples, including that of a negotiator for Panama who is also on the board of a corporate peak body that represents carbon traders such as banks, polluters and brokers.
It also questions the role of the world’s biggest polluters in sponsoring the meetings in return for access to high-level events.
The report argues that as a result of the corporate influence, outcomes of negotiations so far have been skewed to favour the interests of the world’s biggest corporate polluters over those of the majority of the world’s population that live in the developing world. It finds that influence has skewed outcomes on finance, agriculture and technology.
We have the wrong people at the table and we’re looking to the wrong people for advice
It comes as the 2018 deadline approaches for member countries to finalise the rule book that guides the implementation of the Paris Agreement. That rule book will determine things such as how compliance will be monitored and enforced and how the developing world will receive finance and support.
“We’ve been at many crossroads on climate change but this is perhaps one of the last of those that we have left,” said Jesse Bragg from Corporate Accountability. “If parties don’t arrive at a set of guidelines that actually facilitates the transition we’ve been talking about and keeps us under 1.5C, we may never have another shot at this.”
“We’re doing this wrong right now. We have the wrong people at the table and we’re looking to the wrong people for advice. If we don’t course-correct at COP 23 and the next inter-sessional in Bonn, we’re in real trouble. And you can look at what’s happened so far to see the evidence of that.”
Examples of the infiltration of polluters into the official negotiations include:
The report argues this access has influenced outcomes at the UNFCCC, undermining the Paris agreement in the following ways:
The report argues that if the UNFCCC process results in a rulebook being developed in line with what the world’s biggest polluters want, then the Paris agreement is doomed to failure.
“If those rules are written in a way to give weight to the provisions that industry is in favour of, and ignores those things that the industry is against, then you’re almost renegotiating the Paris agreement,” Bragg said. “What you’re doing is cherry-picking out of the Paris agreement the things that they want, and leaving behind the things that the global south [developing] countries need.
“It’s where you lose any nod to incorporate non-market mechanisms into article 6. It’s where ‘climate smart agriculture’ becomes the only focus of agricultural negotiations, and so big ag is dominating negotiations there and petrochemicals are the solution. And the fossil fuel industry dominates the conversation around technology so we’re just hoping for a successful large-scale carbon capture and storage to get us out of this mess. It’s those things that are at risk in the rulebook negotiations.” 
Momentum has been building over the past couple of years to have an official conflict-of-interest policy agreed on at the UNFCCC.
In Marrakech in 2016 moves instigated by a group representing the majority of the world’s population – the Like Minded Group of Developing Countries – were thwarted by the US, EU and Australia.
Australia’s delegation has argued that “there is no clear understanding of what a conflict of interest is and it means different things to different people” and that fossil fuel companies were “the providers of the biggest and best solutions”.
But in May this year in Bonn, the group succeeded in getting the UNFCCC to agree to improve “transparency”, and discussions will continue in May 2018.
The World Health Organisation’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control successfully implemented a conflict of interest policy that has widely been acknowledged as a key ingredient in its success.
Corporate Accountability says a similar policy is needed for the UNFCCC.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/01/fossil-fuel-companies-undermining-paris-agreement-negotiations-report

""Human nature"" (a term which you apparently dislike) can be categorised in many ways. The most pertinent when trying to organise society is the value systems that the people hold. As I have already pointed out in another comment, value systems in people develops in a predictable way - as described by Spiral Dynamics, a theory first put forward by Prof. Clare Graves and since then developed by others.
Power hierarchies are totally inimical to equality, but the good news is that people and societies do grow out of them. We only have to look to Scandinavian societies to see that equality can take root - when people are ready for it. Sadly we are a long way behind here in the UK - which is one of the most unequal societies in Europe.

“On the one hand, people who hold altruistic values, who want to achieve equality in society, tend to be more pro-environmental. On the other hand, people who are focused more on self-enhancing values and social dominance tend to be less concerned about the environment. This is the descriptive finding and it’s quite robust, but we don’t know yet why it’s the case.”

One theory that explains exactly why this is the case is Spiral Dynamics. This provides a developmental map of societies and the individuals that make them up, which has been found to be remarkably reliable across the world. Its predictions map well on to may societies across many centuries and in different cultures.
It predicts that as people's value systems develop they start from an egocentric position (anyone seen a baby that doesn't fit that description?), through the family or tribe focus, to an ethnocentric position, to a worldcentric outlook. Problems such as climate change, loss of other species and so on only become a real concern at the sixth level (Green) that spiral dynamics describes. At that same level, a concern to treat all human beings equally becomes of great importance. 
Needless to say such advanced human beings are thin on the ground in most countries at the moment. The only estimate I have seen of those at that Green spiral dynamics level is 10% of the world population - I don't know how old or how reliable that estimate is - but its going to be a while before people with that type of thinking hold enough power to change these age-old hierarchical structures and the present addiction to inequality that we see so often in the UK and US.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1509822616000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'12191611', u'id': u'107764652', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'AMeyer', u'text': u'Back in 1990, the first & original formulation of the solution to the 'climate problem' was the 'climate solution' called 'equity equals survival' After 27 years it is still setting the standard.

Take the 0.5% of world GDP that is given to the negative externality that is fossil fuels every year - such an action is simply not in tune with the observation that goods/services which have a negative impact on third parties - impacts that the first and second party to the contract (supply and demand) have not taken into account in and of themselves - require regulatory action on price.

Effective regulation requires an effective regulator. An effective regulator must base their decisions on the scientific method of observation/measurement.

It just took around 10 million years for biodiversity to recover.
But we do need saving. Never mind all the impacts of global warming like shifting climatic zones and changes to various critical climate systems and ecosystems and just look at sea level rise (SLR).
We’ve likely already lost most of our large cities because they are coastal. According to the paleoclimate record, a rise in temperature of just 1.5-2 degrees C above pre-industrial temperature commits the system to 6-9m of SLR. The question is when.
The NASA glaciologist Eric Rignot, and others, say that not only is the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) irreversibly retreating already (3.3m global mean SLR), but also marine sectors of Greenland (3m SLR). And the Totten Glacier in East Antarctica, which drains more ice than the entire WAIS, is also being eaten away by warming ocean temperatures.
Times scales are the big question. We've never watched an ice sheet retreat before and we don't know our future emissions, and there might be surprises.
A recent paper doubled previous consensus estimates of SLR: ""Incorporating these mechanisms in our ice-sheet model accelerates the expected collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet to decadal time scales, and also causes retreat into major East Antarctic subglacial basins""
Nearly 50 years ago we had a similar warning. 
BQSTART
Mercer (1968) speculated that warming due to ‘industrial pollution of the atmosphere’ could cause the ice shelves of West Antarctica to disintegrate, producing a catastrophic release of ice to the sea, thus causing a sea level rise of about 5 m during the course of a century.

Talk about risk. We consider risk in many areas: when we pay thousands of dollars extra for a car with air bags because the outcome of a very unlikely high speed collision is severe, and we do the same with fire insurance for our homes.
This rational approach to risk is completely missing when it comes to the environment.
And the thing is with global warming, not only is the outcome severe in the extreme, but the likelihood is very, very high that highly damaging impacts will occur if we let global warming continue.
According to the article Tail Risk vs. Alarmism, by Dr. Kerry Emanuel, professor of atmospheric science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, we are on track to triple pre-industrial levels of atmospheric CO2 this century.
According to the graph supplied in the article that would give us a 5 percent chance of exceeding 6.75 degrees C above pre-industrial levels (just a rise of 1.5-2C commits us to 6-9m of sea level rise according to the paleoclimate record).
As Emanuel says in the article below:
BQSTART
the 5% high-end may be so consequential, in terms of outcome, as to be justifiably called catastrophic. It is vitally important that we convey this tail risk as well as the most probable outcomes.

Getting back to the pattern, good results do not necessarily equate to doing well. There's a basic overhead built into the system, so that you have to have some good results just to tread water.

Social dominance theory, which attributes sexism and racism (among other isms) to the way humanity organises its social structures, can be used to explain everything from opposition to welfare policies to why we go to war.
Put simply, the theory states that people with power will always seek more of the desirable things in life (as they see it) at the expense of their subordinates.
Today, researchers are applying social dominance theory to try to understand an even broader scope of behaviours. Two recent studies relate people’s views on social equality to how they think and act on environmental issues such as climate change and conservation. The findings hint at radical new ways to increase support for measures that will make the planet more sustainable for all who live on it.
Social dominance theory revolves around the observation that most modern human social systems are organised in a similar way (with notable exceptions among the Indigenous communities of the world). 
“Human social systems have a tendency to be organised as group-based hierarchies with one small group at the top of the social system and a variety of groups at the bottom,” says Harvard University professor Jim Sidanius, one of the researchers who came up with the theory. “The primary forms of discrimination and anti-group violence we observe around the world and throughout history are simply manifestations of this general tendency for humans to form hierarchical social organisations.”
Sidanius and his colleague Felicia Pratto, now at the University of Connecticut, designed a scoring system known as social dominance orientation (SDO) – a measure of how much people will accept social inequality. It’s based on agreement or disagreement with a series of written statements such as “some groups of people are simply inferior to other groups”.
While it’s not hard to imagine that someone’s SDO score might predict their propensity for racism (which it does), it’s less clear how it would relate to their concern for the environment. But it’s this scoring system that is now being adopted by environmental researchers for exactly that reason.
One recent paper published in Social Psychological and Personality Science brings together data from 25 countries in the first large-scale study of the association between social dominance and environmental behaviours. The researchers surveyed 5,400 participants, determining their SDO score and asking them questions about their environmental “intentions”, such as whether they would sign a petition in support of protecting the environment, or try to reduce their carbon footprint by cycling or walking instead of driving. Their conclusion: that a high SDO score – in other words, being accepting of social inequality – makes a person less likely to take pro-environmental actions.
So how do these two quite different sets of values relate to each other? Lead author Taciano Milfont, an environmental psychologist at the Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, says it’s not exactly clear:
“On the one hand, people who hold altruistic values, who want to achieve equality in society, tend to be more pro-environmental. On the other hand, people who are focused more on self-enhancing values and social dominance tend to be less concerned about the environment. This is the descriptive finding and it’s quite robust, but we don’t know yet why it’s the case.”
In fact, one of the original studies on social dominance, led by Pratto and Sidanius in 1994, also considered people’s environmental attitudes – albeit in a much smaller survey of 255 people, who were asked about environmental policies. Given the similar skew of the results, the new findings are not surprising to Sidanius, who says they fit with the notion that social dominance measures a short- and medium-term desire “to gather as much social power and resources as possible”, with little concern for the long-term consequences.
However, the Wellington team didn’t just look at the link between social and environmental attitudes at the individual level. They looked at between-country differences as well, to see if the nature of a particular society has an effect on attitudes. The results showed the relationship between social and environmental attitudes is stronger in countries that are more developed, have less social inequality, and where there is a focus on addressing environmental issues.
A second study, published earlier this year, probed the links between social inequality and the economic value we place on the natural environment. Putting a price on the pollination of crops by bees, or on bears as a tourist attraction, may sound like a dubious concept, but expressing the benefits of nature and biodiversity in monetary terms is now a common goal of environmental research.
The authors (from the universities of Freiburg, Kiel and Berlin) used “willingness-to-pay” for environmental benefits (“goods”) to understand how people valued nature across 22 countries. As a measure of social inequality, they looked at how income was distributed in those countries. And once again, they found that in more unequal societies, people placed less value on the natural environment.
Sidanius, meanwhile, is using his social dominance theory to better understand the toxic divisions that have opened up in American society over recent times.
In May, he published a paper which showed, among other things, that the individual SDO scores of white Americans across 30 states could account for much of the racism, sexism and persecution of immigrants within society – and that, more broadly, the views and behaviours of individuals within societies act to reinforce the hierarchies and inequalities that already exist.
This headline conclusion doesn’t make for pleasant reading: namely, the more hierarchical a country’s society, the more its people act to maintain the social status quo even if it is profoundly unfair, often by employing violence and prejudice towards others.
Psychologically speaking, Sidanius observes that it’s “in their interests” to do so – since when there is a disproportionate amount of power, wealth and influence in a society, the dominant group lives longer and has healthier children, besides countless other benefits (relative to subordinate groups in that society). 
So while moving to a more equal society would benefit a much greater number of people overall, Sidanius’s findings underline how hard it is to break the “inequality cycle”, because preventing discriminatory behaviour means changing very deeply ingrained views in a society. 
Where does this leave us? “The first important step is recognising how the process works,” according to Sidanius. “We can’t be naive about the ease with which these social patterns can be changed or manipulated, but we have to understand the laws of social systems – that is to say, the scientific ‘laws’ – before we can address them.”
He adds that Marxism failed as an ideology because it was based on wrong assumptions about human nature (by some accounts, it assumes people are motivated by benefits for society at large – the common good – rather than their own self-interest).
In terms of the environment, as new research deepens our understanding of the “laws of social systems”, so new ideas emerge for manipulating human behaviour towards outcomes that offer a more sustainable future for the planet. 
Milfont, for instance, sees potential for re-framing environmental messages to suit socially dominant groups. “The negative impacts on environmentalism could be eliminated by encouraging people to regard pro-environmental actions as patriotic or consistent with protecting the status quo,” he suggests. One US study from 2010 found success with an approach that presented pro-environmental behaviours as “preserving the American way of life”.
Milfont is quick to point out that due to differing social systems, US studies don’t necessarily translate to a European context. But these studies do suggest that for every country, culture or social set, there may be an alternative way to encourage people to recycle or ride their bikes more – one which, in a highly pragmatic way, appeals to the prevalent social attitudes, not just environmental ideals.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/nov/02/psychologists-better-way-persuade-people-to-save-planet-environment

The UN predicted a refugee crises of 50M people displaced by climate change by 2010.
BQEND
There are a number of caveats to this.
First, the original term was ""environmental refugees,"" not ""climate refugees."" The number included a lot of people who are forced to relocate for environmental causes that were not related to climate change.
Second, the 50 million did not refer only to new environmental refugees. It included many millions who had already been forced to relocate.
So, given that the stated number included millions of existing refugees, and not just ""climate refugees,"" how far off do you think it actually was? Do you know? If not, how can you conclude that it was abysmally wrong, as I infer you do?
My personal view is that the report probably overstated the case, but it's not quite so easily dismissed as you would have it. 
Furthermore, this is one report by one guy. It's always easy to find single reports or studies that turned out to be wrong. This is not an indictment of an entire field. Yet this is almost always the only report that anyone uses to ""refute"" findings of climate change resulting in significant volumes of refugees.
As for the article you linked to, I was struck by this bit:

Our worry is that putting too much emphasis on the climate overlooks the role of political and socio-economic factors in determining a community’s vulnerability to environmental stress. Conflict is not inevitable in the face of drought.

Just a point of order:
It appears that the OP was referring here to this particular report, not to climate science in general. I certainly disagree with the characterization of the report as 'scaremongering', but...
While I have little doubt that the basic conclusions of the report are accurate (climate change certainly contributed to the crisis in Syria, no matter what 'skeptics' believe), I don't find much indication that this particular report was written by scientists.
The report doesn't provide author information that I could find in a quick once-over, and the article here says things like ""Senior US military and security experts have told the Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF) study that....""

Migration from Africa has got less than FA to do with climate change.
BQEND
It'll have a lot to do with it in the longer term.
The current rate of rise in CO2 is faster than during the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum.
The fossil record in rocks formed around the equator during the PETM is really poor, and that's an indication that life was extremely stressed.
If the tropics become virtually uninhabitable, there will be mass migrations far greater than any seen recently.
Agriculture is basically adapted to the mostly-stable Holocene - that is not going to be the offer from Earth systems as the effects of CO2 continue.
People can't grasp this, because it truly is outside any human experience.
A paper worth looking at is -
""A human-induced hothouse climate?"" - Kidder & Worsley, 2011
Here's a key quote from the Conclusions:
""The likely cool greenhouse in which about half of Antarctica is still ice-covered means devastation from the tens of meters sea level is likely to rise (e.g., Ward, 2010), and poleward shifting of warm climate belts.""
So the appropriate term for what's likely to happen is a 'cool greenhouse', which sounds harmless, but is not.
It's a very interesting paper.
How quickly?
Another quote:
""a cool greenhouse seems imminent within perhaps a century or two.""
However, although those conditions could set in within that time, the process of melting half of the ice on Antarctica would take around 1000 years.
Meanwhile the
""poleward shifting of warm climate belts.""

Recent studies indicate that there is a direct correlation between increased literacy and decreased fertility. This link was demonstrated in study that covered 90% of India's population. Studies in other developing countries have confirmed this finding. In addition, high literacy rates have been found to correspond to high infant survival rates. Researchers also found that there was little change in the relationship between literacy and fertility when they were both controlled for different levels of urbanization. The problem is that only 1 in 4 Indian women are literate. However, India's government has a program in place the goal of which is to have universal literacy. In Kerala, female literacy is the highest (65%). And at 3.4 children/women, it has 1 of the lowest fertility rates. For the 14 states studied, the total fertility rate was 5.0 children/woman, the child mortality rate was 126/1000, and the female literacy rate was 22%. In contrast in Rajasthan where female literacy is 11% (the lowest of the 14 states studied) fertility is the highest at 6.0 children/woman. No state with higher than average fertility had higher than average female literacy rates. Literate women are likely to have more surviving children because they are more aware of good health practices, and they tend to live in better circumstances. As a result, couples need fewer births to reach their desired family size.

Now, my point above - that you classify as my “opinion” was commentary that was based on an analysis of the situation at the time. The 2014 analysis of the Somalia famine began thus: “Famine entails a widespread and extensive scarcity of food, attributed to a “triple failure” of food production, access to food and political response by governments and international donors”. The food production failure was exacerbated by the manner in which food aid was handled, which helped to put the farmers into further financial difficulty. Better management sees aid also being directed towards ensuring the survival and recovery of the farmers, rather than simply tossing food into the local square for all and sundry to grab their share.

Actually, even short-term weather will do it. For example in every 10 years, experience shows that around 7 will be absolutely great in most of sub-Saharan Africa.

Poverty, the lack of economic development, and some of the highest rates of population growth on the planet, are contributory factors.

The answer would therefore appear to be to fix the economies rather than trying a global climate fix. And this would involve targeted investment.
The Horn of Africa lacks the relative stability of the Mediterranean climate, and so their agriculture is always going to be somewhat boom and bust by comparison.

And for Tunisia, read Libya, Mauritania, Algeria, Mali, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Zimbabwe, Congo (B), Congo (K), etc. I’m sure you get the message. Now that the principle has been demonstrated with such success, and the USA has successfully destabilised key frontier states (Libya, Syria), the floodgates are essentially open. 
It has taken the Australians several very fraught and very sad years to stem the flood of migrants that came from across the world once the sea route from Indonesia started. Once a significant flow begins, the bribes and other benefits for the staging points en route, and the transporters (and in Australia’s case, the Indonesian authorities) can make people rich and migration can become an important economic activity in its own right. A similar business is becoming well established across the Mediterranean also, and is surely gathering steam.
Whether or not climate change will eventually contribute is a moot point. It would be difficult to claim that any significant part of what is going on now is as a result of climate. Particularly given the extent and sheer power of the other drivers such as ambition and unemployment. I guess if you stretch your imagination, you could think that all these would-be migrants were in some way involved in agriculture, or perhaps were short of food because of some climate issue, but this really is speculative and unproven.

BQSTART
It is virtually certain that global mean sea level rise will continue for many centuries beyond 2100, with the amount of rise dependent on future emissions. Medium confidence that GMSL rise by 2300 will be less than 1 m for a radiative forcing corresponding to CO2 concentrations below 500 ppm (as in RCP2.6), but 1 to more than 3 m for 700–1500 ppm (as in RCP8.5). Larger sea level rise could result from sustained mass loss by ice sheets, and some part of the mass loss might be irreversible. Sustained warming greater than a certain threshold above preindustrial would lead to the near-complete loss of the Greenland ice sheet (high confidence). The threshold is estimated to be greater than 1°C (low confidence) but less than 4°C (medium confidence) global mean warming with respect to preindustrial.

Senior US military and security experts have told the Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF) study that the number of climate refugees will dwarf those that have fled the Syrian conflict, bringing huge challenges to Europe.
“If Europe thinks they have a problem with migration today … wait 20 years,” said retired US military corps brigadier general Stephen Cheney. “See what happens when climate change drives people out of Africa – the Sahel [sub-Saharan area] especially – and we’re talking now not just one or two million, but 10 or 20 [million]. They are not going to south Africa, they are going across the Mediterranean.”
The study published on Thursday calls on governments to agree a new legal framework to protect climate refugees and, ahead of next week’s climate summit in Germany, urges leaders to do more to implement the targets set out in the Paris climate agreement.
Sir David King, the former chief scientific adviser to the UK government, told the EJF: “What we are talking about here is an existential threat to our civilisation in the longer term. In the short term, it carries all sorts of risks as well and it requires a human response on a scale that has never been achieved before.”
The report argues that climate change played a part in the build up to the Syrian war, with successive droughts causing 1.5 million people to migrate to the country’s cities between 2006 and 2011. Many of these people then had no reliable access to food, water or jobs.
“Climate change is the the unpredictable ingredient that, when added to existing social, economic and political tensions, has the potential to ignite violence and conflict with disastrous consequences,” said EJF executive director, Steve Trent.
“In our rapidly changing world climate change – and its potential to trigger both violent conflict and mass migration – needs to be considered as an urgent priority for policymakers and business leaders alike.”
Although the report highlights to growing impact of climate change on people in the Middle East and Africa, it says changing weather patterns – like the hurricanes that devastated parts of the US this year – prove richer nations are not immune from climate change.
But Trent said that although climate change undoubtedly posed an “existential threat to our world” it was not to late to take decisive action.
“By taking strong ambitious steps now to phase out greenhouse gas emissions and building an international legal mechanism to protect climate refugees we will protect the poorest and most vulnerable in our global society, build resilience, reap massive economic benefits and build a safe and secure future for our planet. Climate change will not wait. Neither can we. For climate refugees, tomorrow is too late.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/02/climate-change-will-create-worlds-biggest-refugee-crisis

This is La Niña and it could send the world’s weather haywire over the next few months. Its impact could even be felt in Britain. Seven years ago one of the most powerful La Niñas on record led to catastrophic floods in Queensland, Colombia, southern Africa, and Pakistan, as well as drought in east Africa and the Amazon. There were record snowfalls followed by spring floods in the US.
In the UK there was a corresponding savage freeze. November 2010 began mild, then turned unbelievably cold towards the end of the month, with Northern Ireland and Wales breaking their lowest temperature records for November. 
The following month was worse, the coldest December for more than 100 years, and one of the coldest of any month on record – Altnaharra in the Scottish Highlands registered a low of -21.3C. 
The UK turned into a magical winter wonderland of ice crystals – trees, fences and blades of grass looked as if they had been sprayed with icing sugar, glittering and sparkling in the winter sunshine. This was a thick frost called rime, a classic hallmark of incredibly cold weather.
Basing winter predictions in Europe on the strength of La Niña is a dangerous game to play, of course, as there are often other competing global weather phenomena which can throw a spanner in the works. But there is undoubtedly a link between La Niña and colder than average northern hemisphere winters. 
This time around this new phase of La Niña is expected to be much weaker than was the case in 2010-11.

Perhaps the electoral system shouldD have built in counterbalances to other tyrannies, though. 
For instance, the wealthy wield much more social power and influence by virtue of their wealth.
So perhaps we should categorise voters by wealth and income, and give multiple votes to the less wealth groups, in inverse proportion to their poverty or wealth .
If a poor person had ten votes to the millionaires one, say, then parties would be compelled to shift the balance of their appeal. And the poor might be more motivated to vote regularly, too, if they felt their preference had real weight.
If electoral college counterbalancing is valid, then surely this is, too, although those with vested power would hate it. So would those who suffer from the delusion that wealth distribution is a fair, meritocratic process.

You are 100% accurate. But that is not gerrymandering. It is a system in which the tyranny of the majority is minimized.

That Time article you cite is full of BS. Not only does Akhil Reed Amar completely ignore the spectrum or arguments at the time of drafting the Constitution, his whole theory falls apart when you look at the 13th and 14th Amendments abolishing slavery.
He maintains that the electoral system was enacted to benefit slave holding states. Even if that were true then why not abolish the system once slavery was abolished? What purpose would the system provide when its reason for being was no longer present. It wasn't because it was inadvertently overlooked. The 14th Amendment specifically addressed it. The 14th addresses both the apportionment of Representatives as well as the ""election for the choice of electors for President and Vice-President of the United States.""
What Amar neglects to address is the interdependence of the census and how taxes were apportioned at the time. We didn't have an income tax. Each state paid an apportioned amount to the federal government based on the number of people in that state. That number was determined by the census, and a slave was counted as 2/5ths as a person. If slave holding states were going to be taxed based in part on the number of their slaves they wanted apportioned representation to be likewise based in part on the number of their slaves.
As for Amar's argument that ""...the Electoral College...let each southern state count its slaves, albeit with a two-fifths discount, in computing its share of the overall count (of electors)"" is at best sloppy scholarship. He should know full well that the number of electors to the college is NOT determined by the number of the people in that state but instead by the number of senators and representatives which is NOT the same thing. Article II Section 1 clearly states: ""Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress."" Representatives are based on the number of people in that state but Senators are not, Each state gets two regardless of their population and Amar knows that or ought to know that. To imply otherwise is bullshit.
Amar ignores fundamental debates that took place, dismisses the entire large state small state debate, and zeroes in instead on a skewed interpretation of an unintended consequence of the electoral system. It wasn't enacted to advance slavery or maintain it.
Amar completely ignores why it was addressed in the 14th amendment but not abolished at that time if his theory was true. In fact his whole argument sort of ends with the lead up to the civil war and then just fizzles out. So please Dana, expand your reading selection and don't rely on Time magazine articles with an ax to grind because Trump won the electoral vote while the sum of all the states totals was greater for Hillary than Trump.

This was initiated in the 1930s by the Labor Party at a timer when rural electorates contained large numbers of farm workers employed by the land owners and land holders. After the second world war, the mechanisation of agriculture and movement of rural workers to the cities, the Country Party (National Party, now Liberal National Party) continued the city rural gerrymander which now benefited them, and extended it to ridiculous extremes as the cities grew in population.

These powers are: Legislative, Judicial, Executive, and the States. The first three are lumped together as 'the federal government'.
The reason the States are given such powers (which is quite different from most European forms of parliamentary democracy) is to give political power to all regions of the United States. Obviously, the kinds of issues affecting a western desert state like Nevada (low population) vs. an eastern humid state like New York (high population), from water to energy to housing, etc., will be different.
So, to ensure that all regions had some degree of agency in the federal government, a Senate with two members from each state was created, and a House whose members were representative of each state's population. In addition, the electoral college served a similar function (wiki):

In The Federalist Papers, James Madison explained his views on the selection of the president and the Constitution. In Federalist No. 39, Madison argued the Constitution was designed to be a mixture of state-based and population-based government. Congress would have two houses: the state-based Senate and the population-based House of Representatives. Meanwhile, the president would be elected by a mixture of the two modes.

With even war-torn Syria now signing the agreement, the leadership of every world country has announced its intent to tackle the existential threat posed by human-caused climate change, except the United States. 
It's the US vs. the rest of the world, as Syria agrees to sign Paris climate accord https://t.co/Q1tkxuiHas pic.twitter.com/hnV2wHmLHL
While this decision may seem puzzling to the rest of the world, the explanation is simple - a study published two years ago found that the Republican Party is the only major political party in the world that rejects the need to tackle climate change, and we know that voters follow elite cues. In 2016, American voters made the terrible mistake of putting that party in charge of the entire federal government, including electing this man president:
The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.
However, a year later, Americans are already recognizing this error. Trump’s approval rating is around 38%, and has not touched 40% in over six months. Meanwhile, congressional Democrats enjoy an 8–10% lead over their Republican opponents. Those polling results translated into a landslide Democratic victory in the 2017 elections last week.
The clearest result came in Virginia’s gubernatorial election, in which Republican candidate Ed Gillespie ran a Trump-like culture war campaign. He also took the standard Trump administration line on climate change, acknowledging only that humans play some undetermined role while supporting America’s withdrawal from the Paris climate accords and opposing all policies to address the problem.
Gillespie’s campaign was praised by Trump and Steve Bannon, until he lost the race by 9%. 
Last week’s election results showed that Trump has strongly mobilized Democrats to vote, even in off-year elections. In Virginia state House of Delegates elections, Democratic candidates similarly beat their Republican opponents by more than 9% in total votes. However, due to gerrymandering and geographical disadvantages (Democrats tend to cluster in cities), unless recounts change the results of close races, Democrats will only hold 49% of the seats in the Virginia House.
That structural disadvantage holds across the country. Estimates are that Democrats need to beat Republicans by 7–8% in overall congressional votes in order to win a bare majority of the seats. With a current lead of 8–10% in the generic congressional ballot, they have a chance to take the House in 2018, depending on what happens over the next year.
We saw that same structural advantage hand Trump the presidency in 2016. While he lost the popular vote by over 2% (nearly 3 million votes), Trump won the Electoral College, as was the case in 2000 with Bush v. Gore (Gore won the popular vote by a half million votes). America has a bizarrely unbalanced election system in which people who live in sparsely populated areas (predominantly rural Republicans) are disproportionately represented in the government. 
It will take a landslide election for Democrats to overcome that structural disadvantage, but last week’s results demonstrate that Trump and the Republican Party have become so unpopular, it very well might happen in the 2018 and 2020 elections. That would give Democrats the opportunity to undo Republican gerrymandering after the 2020 census. The Supreme Court is also currently considering a critical gerrymandering case.
Regarding the presidency, betting markets currently give Trump approximately a 35–40% chance of winning a second term (which seems overly bullish), and Democrats a 55% chance of retaking the White House in 2020. If that happens, the next president can quickly begin reversing the damage the Trump administration has done to American climate policies and its standing in the world.
At the UN climate talks in Bonn, the ‘We Are Still In’ coalition of US states, cities, tribes, and businesses has been given a US Climate Action Center. Meanwhile, the US government for the first time doesn’t have a pavilion, and the Trump administration perversely plans to promote fossil fuels and nuclear power in a presentation at the meeting. As Senator Brian Schatz (D-HI) noted,
If you show up at a climate conference to talk about coal, you’re likely to be ignored. I think the We Are Still In delegation will get more attention than the executive branch. We’ve gone from the indispensable leader to being the only country not engaged in climate change. Many people in Congress are troubled not only from a climate standpoint but a geopolitical standpoint. China is happy to take that leadership from us.
Indeed, China is stepping into the global leadership role that the United States has shrunk from under Trump’s “America First” platform. Chinese carbon pollution is approaching a peak 15–20 years ahead of schedule, and its leaders relish the opportunity to take America’s place as a global leader.
Americans embrace the notion that their country is the greatest in the world. But what does it say that the United States is the nation that is responsible for the largest fraction of overall carbon pollution and global warming over the past 200 years, and is the only country in the world that refuses to take steps to address the existential threat we created? That lack of responsibility and willingness to protect the well-being of future generation is not the behavior of a great nation.
However, that is almost exclusively a Republican Party position, and the party and its president are currently supported by fewer than 40% of Americans. Most of its leaders seem unwilling to reverse the party’s slide toward anti-climate culture wars-based isolationism, but with accelerating climate change and a growing population of non-whites, these are positions that will cost them elections. As we saw last week, the ‘Trump base’ is relatively small, and structural advantages won’t be enough to withstand landslide elections.
America’s withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement won’t take effect until the day after the 2020 elections. The next president can quickly reverse that withdrawal, making America the last country to sign on, but resuming its global leadership role. While the Trump administration has exceeded everyone’s fears in its anti-environment, anti-climate actions, the damage is temporary. While the American majority fights to wrest control of its government away from the isolationist climate-denying minority, the rest of the world (literally) is moving forward to tackle this problem.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/nov/13/on-climate-and-global-leadership-its-america-last-until-2020

As well it should be. Several previous mass extinctions have been linked to natural global warming events caused by a strong forcing of CO2 rising in the atmosphere. The worst, the end-Permian event, which turned Earth into basically a lifeless rock for millions of years, was linked to coal seams ignited perhaps by magma. 1
This time, the 6th extinction, beginning now largely from over hunting and fishing, habitat loss and pollution, is being exacerbated by silly hominids which know better than to dig up and burn prodigious amounts of coal more rapidly than past natural events.

BTW, I think Germany is now in a position where it could shut down most of its lignite burning as that excess is now exported, but there are legislative issues. Here's a recent explanation I found:-
Germany Could Shutter 20 Oldest Brown Coal Plants Without Creating Energy Shortages
BQSTART
In germany a power plant cannot simply shut down because it is out of money. They need to get permission from the grid manager to insure the shutdown would not be harmful to the grid. This requires a study that can take some time to do. Which would increase the financial losses. 
Apparently many plants that are barely profitable decided it was easier to sell the power in different markets. So for about the last 15 years every increase in renewable generation resulted in an increase in Energy exports to another country (France, poland, Denmark and others). So today Germany exports more power than anyone else in Europe.
If other European countries decided to stop accepting power from germany those 20 plants would have to shut down. If those power plant were allowed to shut down whenever they wanted they would have shut down years ago.
A couple of years ago some about 8 power pants applied for permission to shut down. Apparently the export power lines were maxed out and they couldn't export any more power. Some of the 8 were shut down. The Others were put in reserve. The reserve power plants are are maintained and not used unless a power shortage occurs. So most of the time the reserve power plants don't burn any coal.

Germany will be burning coal for power well into the 2040s, according to state secretary for the environment and energy Rainer Baake.
The country is famed for its “Energiewende” programme to boost the use of renewables, but a rapid phase-out of nuclear power since 2011 has seen it continue to burn coal.
“When I look at the stakeholders’ positions, it seems to suggest that the last [coal] power station will likely go offline between 2040 and 2045,” Baake said in quotes reported by Clean Energy Wire.
“There is an unsolvable contradiction between using lignite for power generation and climate targets.”
Really? Who would have thought?
Holding up Germany as a role model for effective climate policy is ridiculous. It's not about percentage renewables. It's about carbon emissions. Shutting down nuclear is a disastrous climate policy. 
So what if Germany gets 50% renewables by the mid 2020s. By that stage all of Germany's nuclear power plants will have been shut down removing. In 2016 nuclear power generated 13.1% of Germany's electricity. If Germany does manage to get 50% renewables it will not have reduced emissions.

The experts (no scare quotes, have been reporting the science for 50+ years. POTUS Johnson got briefed on it in 1965 for example.
In all this time, no investigative journalist has found this global decades long, multi generational conspiracy that you intimate. 
Yet Nixons real conspiracy unravelled thanks to investigative journalists in less than 5 years, with less than 100 people involved.
Once agin , deniers show themselves up to be: lazy; wrong or just plain mad.
On to a more constructive topic - CCS. Whilst theoretically possible, and pilot plants show it can work, it has not been demonstrated as a commercially viable technology ready to be rolled out after decades of research.
Rather than spending money on denialist campaigns to smear actual science, maybe the fossil fuel industry should have spent that money on proving it (CCS) is commercially viable and actually deploying it.
Just a thought.

While Donald Trump’s special adviser on energy and environment, David Banks, said cutting emissions was a US priority, “energy security, economic prosperity are higher priorities”, he said. “The president has a responsibility to protect jobs and industry across the country.”
Other attendees at the summit condemned the argument. 
“Promoting coal at a climate summit is like promoting tobacco at a cancer summit,” said Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor and a UN special envoy for cities and climate change. 
Benson Kibiti, from the Kenya Climate Working Group, said: “More coal will entrench poverty.” 
When questioned, just one of the four energy executives Trump’s team chose to speak at the event expressed support for his decision to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement.
At the only official event put on by the US government at the two-week summit, Banks said: “Without a question, fossil fuels will continue to be used and we would argue that it is in the global interest that when it is used it is is clean and efficient as possible.”
“This panel is only controversial if we choose to bury our heads in the sand and ignore the realities of the global energy system,” he added. 
The event was interrupted when about three-quarters of the 200-strong audience stood up and began singing in protest. 
To the tune of God Bless the USA, the mostly young protesters sang: “So you claim to be an American, but we see right through your greed, it’s killing right across the world, for all that coal money.”

The protesters then left, but the panel was heckled, with angry members of the audience shouting “bunch of liars” and “clean coal is bullshit”.
 The appearance of an executive from Peabody Energy, the US’s biggest coal miner, was particularly provocative. In 2016, the Guardian revealed the company had funded at least two dozen groups that cast doubt on manmade climate change and oppose environment regulations.
Peabody’s Holly Krutka challenged the argument that coal has no future role. “The discussion needs to be not if we use coal but how,” she said. 
She also cited carbon capture and storage technology as vital in cutting fossil fuel emissions. Such technology includes the Petra Nova CCS project in the US, which captures CO2 and then uses it to flush more oil out of reservoirs. The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said that tackling global warming without CCS will be much more expensive.
Another panellist, Barry Worthington, executive director of the United States Energy Association, illustrated his points in favour of fossil fuels using future energy projections from ExxonMobil, BP and Statoil. He said US energy companies were already cutting carbon and was the only panellist to back Trump’s Paris pullout, saying: “Frankly, we don’t need the Paris plan.”
But the US event prompted fierce criticism at the climate summit, where countries are working to implement the landmark 2015 Paris agreement. Coal is both the dirtiest fossil fuel and a cause of air pollution that causes millions of early deaths every year.
“If the [Trump] administration won’t lead, it should at least get out of the way.,” said Bloomberg, who is also a backer of “America’s pledge”. That effort saw 20 states, more than 50 big cities and 60 big businesses confirm their commitment to the Paris goals on Saturday – a group that would have the third biggest economy in the world if it were a country. 
Kibiti said: “More coal is not going to end the problem of people living without electricity. The vast majority – 84% – of electricity-poor households globally are in rural areas, so off-grid solutions powered by renewables like solar, wind and small hydro are going to be the cheapest and quickest.”
“Exploiting poor, disadvantaged populations to justify continued fossil fuel usage is a despicable breach of humanity,” said Kathy Egland, at the NAACP in the US. “The Trump team promoting this abomination are exhibiting the depth of greed, lack of morality and lengths the fossil industry will go to maintain their wealth.”
Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Bangladesh, who advises some of the least developed countries, said: “Any country or company continuing to champion coal and even other fossil fuels from now on would be wilfully carrying out a crime against humanity.” Professor Piers Forster, at the University of Leeds, UK, said: “Coal is not clean – it is dangerous. [Coal emissions] have to rapidly reduce to zero. Those who argue coal has a future are putting the planet under real risk.”
Two dozen of the 196 countries backing the Paris agreement have included efficient coal technology in their national contributions to cutting emissions. But predictions for future coal use have the plummeted in recent years as the cost of renewable energy has dropped. In 2013, the International Energy Agency expected coal-burning to grow by 40% by 2040; today it anticipates just 1% growth, while China and India have recently cancelled plans for hundreds of new coal plants.
Andrew Steer, CEO of the World Resources Institute, said the US event was irrelevant: “It is a total distraction. It will not change the overwhelming momentum away from coal. The closing of coal plants in the US has accelerated since Trump was elected. It’s King Canute trying to hold back the tide.”
 Earlier on Monday in Bonn, the US’s neighbours Canada and Mexico further isolated Washington by announcing a new partnership with the 15 US states that have pledged strong climate action. Canada’s environment minister, Catherine McKenna, and her Mexican counterpart, Rodolfo Lacy, joined with the governors of Washington state and California, Jay Inslee and Jerry Brown, to form a group that will focus on phasing out coal power and boosting clean power and transport.
“We are all in this together,” said McKenna. “The countries that move forward and realise there is a $30tn opportunity will be creating clean jobs and growing their economy.”
 Inslee added: “Trump is a blip in history. Not one country has expressed that there is any doubt [about climate action] just because Trump is still a climate denier. He can tweet his fingers off, but he won’t stop us. If you want to grow your economy, focus on the jobs of the future.”
The global campaign to phase out coal use received a boost last week when Bloomberg donated $50m. He has given $164m to anti-coal efforts in the US in the last six years, during which time half of US coal power plants have closed or been cancelled.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/13/bonn-climate-summit-trump-fossil-fuels-protest

From <https://www.insidescience.org/news/my-1975-cooling-world-story-doesnt-make-todays-climate-scientists-wrong> However, these are media articles, not scientific studies. A survey of peer reviewed scientific papers from 1965 to 1979 show that few papers predicted global cooling (7 in total). Significantly more papers (42 in total) predicted global warming (Peterson 2008). The large majority of climate research in the 1970s predicted the Earth would warm as a consequence of CO2. Rather than 1970s scientists predicting cooling, the opposite is the case.

In 1856, Eunice Foote published a scientific paper in the Journal of American Science, entitled “Circumstances Affecting the Heat of the Sun’s Rays.”
She placed various atmospheric gases in glass vessels into which thermometers were inserted.
She wanted “to determine the different circumstances that affect the thermal action of the rays of light that proceed from the sun.”
Oxygen and hydrogen, when pumped into the glass containers and exposed to the sun, displayed no significant difference in temperature in comparison to the control vessel containing air.
Pumping carbon dioxide into another receiver, also exposed to sunlight, Mrs. Foote wrote that the mercury in the thermometer leaped, with the one containing the carbon dioxide becoming much hotter, “more so than the others.”

John McDonnell will highlight the human and economic costs of manmade climate change, calling it the “greatest single public challenge” and say the government should include the fiscal risks posed by global warming in future forecasts.
The landmark change would, for the first time, put climate change on an equal footing with other complex challenges affecting the public finances such as demography.
Under a Labour government, the Office for Budget Responsibility would be given total independence, McDonnell will announce, saying the forecaster would report directly to parliament rather than the Treasury.
Speaking at the Institute for Public Policy Research on Tuesday, McDonnell will say that meeting the challenges of climate change will require “a transformation of our institutions and how our economies are run”.
McDonnell said that Labour “wants to ensure that the overwhelming challenge of climate change is addressed from the very centre of government. This includes the potential losses to the public finances.
“The public deserve to know what impacts we might expect on the national purse from the degradation of our environment. Sound, responsible economic management should already be accounting for this.”
Labour Treasury sources said the party wanted to ensure that long-term impacts of climate change and environmental damage, including effects on food prices, flooding and loss of productivity in more frequent extreme weather, could have a direct impact informing economic policymaking.
McDonnell will argue that the effects of manmade climate change are already having an economic effect. Costs in recent years have included more frequent flooding, which the Environment Agency estimates now costs £2.2bn annually. 
Over the summer, the Bank of England said it had begun its own investigations into the extent of the banks’ exposure to the effects of climate change, announcing it was “initiating a review of climate-related risks in the UK banking sector”. 
Several other authorities in Europe, including in Germany and Sweden, have also been examining the financial consequences of climate change. But the UK would be the first country in the world to mandate the assessment done by an independent fiscal council.
Under Labour, the OBR would be given additional resources to deliver the best economic modelling of environmental impact, McDonnell will say. “It will become a new centre of expertise for environmental macroeconomics,” he will say.
The shadow chancellor said he would “guarantee and reinforce that independence of the OBR by making the body report to parliament rather than the Treasury. 
“We want the public, whether businesses or voters, to be absolutely confident that the public finances are properly scrutinised and managed.”
Environmentalists welcomed the proposal though cautioned that the effects of climate change could not all be given economic value. 
Greenpeace UK’s chief scientist, Dr Doug Parr, said the change would “help concentrate the minds of future governments on the urgency and scale of the challenge” of climate change on the economy. 
“Major companies and financial institutions have already started factoring in the impacts of climate change in their forecasts, so it’s right that the UK government should do the same for the public purse,” he said. 
“Not all environmental degradation can be translated into monetary values, but if you just look at the billions of pounds of damage caused by floods, you can see why the impact of climate change on the government’s balance sheets cannot be ignored.”
Michael Jacobs, director of the IPPR commission on economic justice, said the change would be an important shift. “Over the last few years the Bank of England has been telling the financial sector that it must report on the investment risks arising from climate change,” he said. 
“It is very welcome that Labour is now signalling that government – through the OBR – should do the same with its macroeconomic forecasts. This is an important way to ensure that climate change is properly integrated into economic policy.” 
Friends of the Earth CEO Craig Bennett said the change would be “welcome news” and said the effects of climate change “could easily dwarf the huge financial crisis from which the world is still recovering.” 
The WWF also backed the change and said other parties should follow. “All political parties need to ensure long-term planning for the environment is at the heart of their programmes,” Karen Ellis, WWF’s chief advisor on economics and development, said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/13/labour-vows-to-factor-climate-change-risk-into-economic-forecasts

After hearing oral arguments from both sides, the higher regional court in the western city of Hamm said Saul Luciano Lliuya’s demand for damages from RWE was “admissible”, paving the way for the case to proceed.
Luciano argues that RWE, as one of the world’s top emitters of climate-altering carbon dioxide, must share in the cost of protecting his hometown Huaraz from a swollen glacier lake at risk of overflowing from melting snow and ice.
The appeal court’s decision not to throw out the case immediately, as a lower court had done in the first instance last December, was hailed as a win by climate change activists.
The court in Hamm has written “legal history”, said Klaus Milke, chairman of the pressure group Germanwatch that is advising Luciano.
“It’s good news for the many potential plaintiffs worldwide who will be emboldened to take action themselves,” he told AFP.
The Hamm court said it would give both sides until 30 November to provide further arguments before deciding on the next steps, but that it was “likely” the case would proceed to hearing evidence.
After the decision, RWE reiterated its view that the complaint was “not acceptable” and was even “unjustified,” arguing that a single company cannot be held liable for specific consequences of climate change.
A lower court in the German city of Essen, where RWE is based, initially found that the lawsuit against RWE was unfounded.
Luciano, who is also a mountain guide, was all smiles as he left the court building. German media have likened his fight against RWE to a “David versus Goliath” battle.
“I would like to return home to the mountains and tell the people that I was able to do something for them,” the father-of-two told reporters ahead of Monday’s hearing.
Luciano wants RWE to pay €17,000 ($20,000) to help pay for flood defences for his community in Peru’s northern Ancash region.
The 37-year-old also wants the German company to reimburse him for the €6,384 he himself has spent on protective measures.
Luciano bases his claims on a 2013 climate study which found that RWE was responsible for 0.5% of global emissions “since the beginning of industrialisation”.
He says this makes the firm at least partly responsible for his plight.
 RWE, Germany’s second-largest electricity producer, has long insisted the Peruvian’s case has no legal basis.
RWE has in the past said it did not understand why it has been singled out for legal action, stressing the efforts the company had made to become more environmentally friendly.
As well as modernising its coal-fired power plants to reduce CO2 emissions, RWE has invested billions in renewable energy as part of Germany’s move away from fossil fuels, it says.
Luciano’s lawyer Roda Verheyen said earlier on Monday that she believes her client has a winnable case that could set a precedent for so-called “climate justice” cases.
The case comes as climate change is once again in the global spotlight with the UN climate talks taking place in Bonn, a two-hour drive away from the Hamm courthouse.
Thousands of diplomats from around the world have gathered there to negotiate the “rulebook” for the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which goes into effect in 2020.
The pact calls for capping global warming at “well under” 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial levels, and 1.5C if possible.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/14/peruvian-farmer-sues-german-energy-giant-rwe-climate-change

But the Paradise Papers have revealed that behind the scenes, the universities are investing tens of millions in projects that systematically exacerbate inequality and climate disaster.
The scandal is not simply tax avoidance. It is the hypocrisy of universities that espouse their commitment to sustainability while financing environmental destruction offshore.
A 2016 Cambridge report insisted that the university’s investments would reflect its underlying values, which include a commitment to environmental protection. Oxford’s vice-chancellor Louise Richardson declared in 2015 that the university must “recognise the need to work towards net-zero emissions in … all of the university’s activities, including the stewardship of our investment funds.”
The Paradise Papers disclose a complex chain of investments that begins at Oxford and Cambridge, whose combined endowments exceed £11bn, and ends with the financing of Royal Dutch Shell initiatives to explore deeper into the ocean and identify more carbon to burn. These investments are not compatible with a carbon-neutral endowment, a stable climate, or a just future.
Cambridge has defended its approach, pointing out that the charitable status of the universities means they do not normally have to pay tax on investments, while Oxford pointed out that offshore investments were commonly used and said it had “very low exposure to the broader energy sector”.
The universities are, in fact, not totally exempt from taxes. Even charities must pay a special US tax on investments in hedge funds, but the Paradise Papers expose that Oxford and Cambridge use blocker corporations. Blocker corporations act as middlemen, converting the hedge fund income into dividends, which US law doesn’t tax. The schemes are legal, but the practice reveals two universities exploiting loopholes in pursuit of maximum return, generating profit at the expense of human communities near and far.
It comes as no surprise that our universities are financing dirty oil. But the sheer scale of the investments and the disingenuous approach is breathtaking. It demonstrates a lack of transparency and a failure to take responsibility. What else are they hiding?
Fossil fuel divestment is not just a prudent financial decision, it is a moral imperative. As we hurtle towards a dangerously warming world, it is essential that we stigmatise the industry most responsible for the climate crisis.
Divestment has worked before – consider the cases of apartheid South Africa, or the tobacco industry. And it is working now, with a third of British universities already committed to fossil fuel divestment in some form.
At Oxford and Cambridge alike, students have banded together in opposition to this immoral system, launching coordinated actions on both campuses under the banner of Oxbridge #ComeClean. Last Friday, Oxford students protested at the headquarters of the endowment management company; on Tuesday hundreds of students will march through the streets of Cambridge calling for justice and transparency.
Our coalition has four demands: full disclosure of where the universities are investing their endowments; a complete withdrawal from all offshore funds and a public apology for such investment practices; full divestment from both direct and indirect investment in fossil fuels; and comprehensive student and faculty-led ethical investment policies.
Both Cambridge and Oxford pride themselves on their contributions to society. Cambridge’s core values include “a concern for sustainability”, while Oxford seeks to “benefit society on a national and a global scale”. Our message is simple: they must start practising what they preach. Sustainability is not just a buzzword; it should be integral to everything the universities do. Greater profit margins are no excuse for dodging tax and profiting from climate breakdown. If they call themselves charities, they should start acting that way.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/14/oxbridge-must-end-dirty-investments-both-offshore-and-oil

It will be joined by Canadian oil companies working to put a green hue on Canadian tar sands – but the world shouldn’t be fooled.
The truth is, Canada cannot yet meet its own arguably weak climate targets. The country plans to expand oil and gas production despite evidence that this is inconsistent with Paris goals. Then, there is the issue of the toxic sludge of waste products from Canada’s tar sands destruction, which form what are known as tailings ponds. 
As of this year, these ponds hold 1 trillion litres of sludge that is unlike any other industrial byproduct in the world. They contain a unique cocktail of toxic chemicals and hydrocarbons that will remain in molasses-like suspension for centuries if left alone. 
These open, unlined ponds currently cover 220 sq km, an area of land equivalent to 73 New York Central Parks. A single tailings pond – the Mildred Lake Settling Basin – has been identified by the US Department of the Interior as the world’s largest dam.
These tailings ponds made international headlines in 2008 when 1,600 ducks flew into one of them. The resulting imagery of animals coated in oil was a powerful reminder of the costs of our global oil addiction. 
Since then, the issue has slowly faded from public memory as the Alberta government’s strident promises to clean up the ponds left Canada and the rest of the world under the impression the problem was being seriously dealt with.
Yet, last month the government of Alberta approved a tailings management plan for Suncor Energy Incorporated, the oldest mining company in the Canadian tar sands. By approving this plan, Suncor will get an additional 70 years after their operations shut down to clean up the environmental mess that they have created over 60 years of oil extraction. 
These open, unlined ponds currently cover 220 sq km, an area of land equivalent to 73 New York Central Parks
To be clear, Alberta has a new progressive majority NDP government which has made some great, long overdue strides in addressing social and environmental issues such as a coal phase-out and a cap on emissions from the tar sands. 
However, even under this government, the cumulative impacts of this fossil fuel development are growing and industry continues to obtain sweeping approvals that are shocking for their lack of environmental rigour. 
The history of the government’s weak attempts to address tailings are shocking. A couple of years ago a directive was put into place to require companies to reduce tailings. Not a single company complied. Rather than fining the companies or refusing permits, the government simply removed the directive.
This recent Suncor approval highlights the staggering and growing cumulative environmental footprint of the Alberta tar sands. Mining the tar sands for oil produces over 3,600 tonnes of CO2 emissions per hectare, consumes freshwater at a rate that rivals the daily water use of several major Canadian cities combined, and has destroyed a New York City-sized chunk of boreal forest and muskeg habitat. 
For these reasons, the tar sands have been dubbed the largest (and most destructive) industrial project in human history. 
Unfortunately, the now full-blown environmental crisis of tar sands tailings ponds has only gotten worse in the last decade. In Canada, provinces and territories have jurisdiction over resource extraction, and the implementation of a new tailings regulation by the provincial regulator has resulted in a recent review of all tar sands operations tailings management plans. 
Suncor’s plan is the first to be approved, but represents a typical submission. For this reason, the approval decision has now set the precedent for what will be considered acceptable by the regulator in the sector, and it isn’t pretty.
 While Suncor’s mine will close down in 2033, they have been granted until after 2100 to figure out how to clean up their tailings and reclaim the land. Moreover, they will be “treating” their tailings by dumping them in the bottom of pits and covering them with freshwater to form a permanent “lake”.
The long-term ecological risks this creates extend far beyond Alberta, and even Canada. Several of the tailings ponds are now decades old. A failure of a single tailings dyke could result in contaminated waterways from Alberta’s Athabasca region through to the Arctic Ocean, that would make even the Exxon Valdez disaster look mild by comparison. 
In addition, government data shows that these tailing ponds are leaking and indigenous leaders have repeatedly called for health studies and noted that the expansion of the tarsands is violating their Treaty rights
The dire state of this situation is compounded by the very uncertain economic future for tar sands mining. The tar sands industry’s approach to tailings management since 1967 has been to procrastinate on cleaning up the mess until a silver bullet technology is found to deal with them. 
Now, 50 years later, technologies to clean up tailings that have been discovered are not being implemented because they are expensive and government is not requiring them. 
Meanwhile, the buck is being passed even further into the future. In 2015 the auditor general estimated that tailings liability now surpassed $20bn, a figure many say is conservative. Mining tar sands is one of the most expensive ways to produce crude oil in the world, and with the International Energy Agency assessing 21st-century peak oil demand to be around the corner, it will be among the first oil industries to face bankruptcy. 
If they are not dealt with now, tar sands tailings could become a permanent toxic legacy of the most reckless forms of 20th-century fossil fuel extraction. 
Fortunately, however, there is still time to shine a light on Canada’s most shameful environmental secret and force the polluters to pay up today before they are no longer around to do so.

You can't escape the plain and undisputed fact that the average citizen of a developing country consumes far less CO2 than people from modern, westernised/industrial cultures.
In a nutchell, it is fair for wealthier nations to pay up because much of the environmental degradation in developing countries is due to supplying wealthier, industrial nations with raw materials for manufacturing/consumption. The developing country receives paltry payment compared to the huge profits those materials generate for the wealthy in other nations.

He had just received a phone call telling him to go to the bank for an automatic insurance payout following the major hurricane that struck in 2014.
“I used that very same money to get some syrup to look after my bees,” he said. Storms destroy the flowers the bees need for food, and falling branches damage the hives. Edwin is one of millions of people around the world vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather already benefiting from low-cost insurance schemes.
But on Tuesday, leaders at the UN climate change summit in Bonn, Germany, revealed a huge leap in ambition: to help protect 400 million poor and vulnerable people around the world by 2020. The project, called the InsuResilience Global Partnership, aims to provide insurance against the damage increasingly being caused by global warming.
The issue of climate change impacts is perhaps the most sensitive among the 196 parties negotiating in Bonn, with the potential to explode into a row that derails other issues. Developing nations are adamant that rich nations, who they say caused climate change, should pay for the “loss and damage” that results. This year’s series of huge storms and floods across the world has intensified the debate.
The InsuResilience scheme, started in 2015 by the G7, is one response. Patricia Espinosa, the UN’s climate chief, said: “People devastated by recent weather events and communities vulnerable to climatic impacts are looking to the nations meeting in Bonn for an answer. This new, higher ambition initiative represents one shining example of what can be delivered.”
“Instead of only reacting to catastrophes we want to shift to planning, preparing and protecting,” said Thomas Silberhorn, a senior official in the German government, which on Monday announced an additional $125m of funding. 
The UK donated £30m in July and so far the $550m raised means 160 million people could be covered by 2020. But the scheme, which has now expanded to involve more nations like Ethiopia and Madagascar, insurers including Allianz, Swiss Re and Munich Re and NGOs like Care International, expects to expand to reach the 400 million target.
Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, the economy minister of Fiji, which is running the climate summit, said: “When we had cyclone Winston in 2016, 40,000 houses and 225 schools were devastated. We need to be able to get people back quickly to day-to-day living after disaster strikes. But at the moment only 10% of homes in Fiji are insured.”
Key to the scheme is slashing bureaucratic assessment and claims procedures. With some, like Edwin’s, , which was set up by the Munich Climate Insurance Initiative, the policy pays out simply when weather data passes trigger points. In September, $55m was paid to 10 Caribbean countries within 14 days of hurricanes Irma and Maria wreaking disaster on the islands. The scheme is also active in Zambia, Paraguay and elsewhere.
However, the initiative has been met with suspicion by some delegates in Bonn.
“It pushes the poor people of the poor countries to pay the insurance premiums from their limited resources,” an African diplomat told Climate Home. Julie-Anne Richards of the Climate Justice Program said: “The insurance mechanism is a clever initiative of developed countries to pushing the developing countries to pay for climate risk for which they are not responsible.”
Gebru Jember Endalew, the Ethiopian chair of the 47-strong Least Developed Countries negotiating bloc at the climate talks, pointed out homes have to be resilient to be insurable at all. “When you go for health insurance, they ask you if you are already ill,” he said. “So first we need to address the vulnerability of infrastructure.”
The disagreement about loss and damage could turn ugly, according to Prof John Schellnhuber, at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany and who has advised both Angela Merkel and the Pope. “Loss and damage could turn into a bombshell,” he said. But he is optimistic this can be avoided and said disputes over damages were moving into lawsuits in the courts.
Silberhorn defended the insurance plan: “It is one tool among many others and it is a very effective tool. It is a different tool to loss and damage.” He said action on cutting emissions and funding adaption must also continue: “Insurance tools do not mean we do not have to change our behaviour.”
Taking action like paying the $8 per month insurance premium has been very important to Edwin, who is in Bonn to tell his story: “If we just stay sitting there our bees are going to suffer. It is a very good thing.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/14/global-insurance-plan-aims-to-defuse-potential-climate-damage-bombshell

The Winchester poetry festival, Wilfred Owen Association and Winchester Action on Climate Change are three of the recent successful ventures he led.
The youngest of three children of Terence Hutchison, and his German-born wife, Loretta (nee Hack), Robert was born in Baghdad, where his father, later an eminent economic historian, was teaching English. The family fled to India when he was two weeks old, to escape the approaching German army.
He first set foot in Britain when he was five. Educated at St Paul’s school, London, and Trinity College Dublin, Robert took up a prized BBC general traineeship on graduating in Mental and Moral Science (now philosophy) in 1963. This led to jobs as senior editor at Penguin Books from 1967 to 1969, and as the Arts Council’s first senior research and information officer from 1973 to 1979.
He met Lizzie Kessler, an urban designer, at a party in London in 1976, and discovered a shared enjoyment of Irish music and the countryside. They married in 1982 and had a daughter, Sarah.
In the 1980s, Robert was senior research fellow at the Policy Studies Institute. There he pioneered new forms of social and economic research underpinning national and, especially, regional arts provision, and published Amateur Arts in Britain (1991) and The Politics of the Arts Council: The Making of the English Opera Class.
Briefly, in 1981, the first director of the Green Alliance, the now prominent national environmental association, he was also a founder-trustee of the arts environment charity Common Ground. Politics took him to Shrewsbury, where he was the SDP parliamentary candidate in 1987 and subsequently a Lib Dem Shropshire county councillor.
Robert was committed to the healing power of the arts and their provision at devolved levels. With the creation of regional arts boards in 1993, he became deputy chief executive and director of arts at the new North West Arts Board. From there, in 1996, he was appointed chief executive of Southern Arts, which took him to Winchester, until the controversial abolition in 2001 of regional arts boards. The following year he became chief executive of Oxford Inspires, leading the city’s bid to become European Capital of Culture 2008. Liverpool’s bid won.
On retiring in 2006, he founded Winchester Action on Climate Change, campaigning effectively for reductions in the city’s carbon footprint. He also became chair of Twin Trading, one of the parent bodies of Cafedirect and an important player in the fair trade movement.
In 2013, he spearheaded the biennial Winchester poetry festival, building on his earlier successful creation in 1989 of the Wilfred Owen Association, and was trustee and vice-chair of the Poetry Society between 2011 and 2014. From 2010 to 2015, he was a Lib Dem councillor on Winchester council.
Cultured and principled, Robert brought encouragement and warmth wherever he worked.

Yeah, but they don't post in internet forums. They publish in the Wall Street Journal and Faux News and such.

It's not just ""picked up"" by them, it is targeted specifically at attention whores and delivered right to them. 
I think you might be overlooking how these techniques were developed by the religious leaders, the Republican Party and then by sensationalist media outlets. 
The technique is based on religions. Look at the incredibly blatant and dishonest denials you can get out of people by telling them that the gods consider them to be very special, and it's just scientists conspiring worldwide to sell that evil biological evolution stuff. 
That risible denial has persisted for over 200 years of progressively stronger evidence, to the point where there is more evidence for evolution than there is for atoms (as Dr. Dawkins likes to point out) and yet the denial is even more fervent now than it ever has been. 
That's exactly what televangelists and Republicans saw and decided to take advantage of. They can whip ignorant/credulous people into doing something against their own interests (give them money or vote for them or even die by refusing science based medicine) in exchange for pandering to the people's need to be the center of attention, the ""chosen ones""
Think about it, religion sells people on the most extreme narcissism there can ever be: The individual is *so* important that the gods themselves have chosen to reveal themselves to that individual. That individual is unlike ""them"", religious individuals are the *only* ones smart enough to have chosen the ""real"" gods. They're the only ones with specially gifted knowledge to see how every biologist and geneticist in the world is completely wrong and that biological evolution is just a big fraud, nothing but a global conspiracy against them, an attack on religious people for being ""chosen.""
Now they're the only people smart enough to see that climate science is all a big fraud. Same shit different day.
In all of that, the people posting online are the ones seeking attention. The manipulators only have to provide minimal input, just a whisper to start the feedback loop in the echo chamber. That's what makes the technique so profitable, just a tiny bit of work, just a tiny hint of what you want them to say, and they'll do all the work and take all the blame. The manipulators don't have to waste time posting in online forums, it gives them time to think about what conspiracy theory they want to promote next.

“In the next five to 10 years battery storage may be coming in a big way,” Deepak Amitabh, chairman of state-owned power-trading company PTC India Ltd., said in an interview at his office in New Delhi. Distributors don’t want to be stuck in pricey agreements for two decades or longer, so it’s better to reach deals for as little as 10 years, he said. Longer-term power contracts have all but disappeared in the past two years except in the clean-energy segment, according to Amitabh. 
India invested in its first overseas battery-storage project in a deal announced earlier this month. One goal is to learn better methods of stabilizing the electricity grid back home as Prime Minister Narendra Modi targets almost tripling renewables capacity to 175 gigawatts by 2022. Unlike stable thermal electricity, green-power supply fluctuates with time of day and seasonal variations, a problem battery storage would help alleviate.
“Why would buyers of power choose to lock themselves in high-priced long-term contracts when they can be reasonably certain of softer prices in the future, either via direct procurement deals with renewable-power generators or at the power exchange?” said Vandana Gombar, global policy editor at Bloomberg New Energy Finance in New Delhi.

Insurers tend to play a much longer game than the generic equities based traders and hedge funds. Though I will bet that a few of the latter are short on coal producers share price, low as it is.
Why this ""matters"" is a medium term thing, it means that when coal producers (and soon oil and gas) go to the market to raise equity to replenish existing production by opening new mines, adding capital equipment to extend the lives of existing facilitates or perhaps have to meet new regulatory standards, the will find it harder to raise capital via equities. And this will mean debt will be harder to renew and or raise new debt. 
Penny to the pound a couple of clowns will try to talk the impacts of this down, but it poses a significant risk to the industry in the coming decade. 
It also flags big risks in raising capital for consumers of coal like thermal power stations.

About £15bn has been divested in the past two years, according to a new report that rates the world’s leading insurers’ efforts to distance themselves from the fossil fuel industry that is most responsible for carbon emissions.
Fifteen companies – almost all based in Europe – have fully or partially cut financial ties, says the study by the Unfriend Coal campaign, which represents a coalition of a dozen environmental groups including Greenpeace, 350.org and the Sierra Club.
Zurich, the world’s seventh biggest insurer, is the latest to shift away from coal, announcing this week that it is pulling out of coal to contribute to broader efforts to achieve the Paris accord goal of keeping global warming below 2C.
Allianz, Aviva and Axa have previously made similar moves. Lloyd’s and Swiss Re are expected to follow in the coming months. 
The campaign has a long way to go. The early movers represent only 13% of all global insurance assets. None of the major US insurers such as Berkshire Hathaway, AIG and Liberty Mutual have taken action, according to the study.
Despite this, the authors say the shift of assets and coverage since 2015 is gaining momentum.
“Coal needs to become uninsurable,” said Peter Bosshard, the coordinator of Unfriend Coal. “If insurers cease to cover the numerous natural, technical, commercial and political risks of coal projects, then new coalmines and power plants cannot be built and existing operations will have to be shut down.”
Such financial pressure is crucial if global warming is to be kept in check.
The International Energy Agency says 99% of coal generation needs to be phased out by 2050 if even the upper goal is be reached, but coal production continues to rise and governments have shown insufficient commitment to reining it back.
Zurich said its decision to pull out was a practical as well as altruistic. “It’s not about politics or blame. It’s about utilising the immense amount of data and analytics we have from internal engineers, as well as external scientific experts, to guide our view of the future,” said Rob Kuchinski, global head of property and energy.
The Bank of England has identified four reasons insurers should be concerned about climate change: their fossil fuel assets could be stranded, they could be held liable for damages linked to their investments, they could see their market diminish, and their payouts could rise.
Payouts are also expected to rise. Munich Re, the world’s largest reinsurer, recently suffered a €1.4bn loss and also faces soaring claims from hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria.
 “Left unchecked,” British insurer Aviva states, climate change will “render significant portions of the economy uninsurable, shrinking our addressable market.” 
The topic of insurance is prominent on the agenda of UN climate talks in Bonn this week, where the focus is on the lack of coverage for small islands and other nations most affected by rising sea levels and worsening droughts. Wealthy nations are proposing a plan to underwrite climate change coverage to 400 million people in developing countries by 2020.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/15/growing-number-of-global-insurance-firms-divesting-from-fossil-fuels

I agree with you that the article is thin on evidence, and that's a shame because it makes it easy to dismiss, and chalk it up as further evidence of an identitarian bias in Guardian articles.
But there are good reasons why the impacts could be asymmetric because a lot of work is gendered. If poor women are the ones working on family farms, and collecting water and firewood, while poor men work on building sites, or as contract labour on large, mechanised farms, then climate change that dries up wells and shrivels up woodlands will have different impacts on them.
It is important to keep in mind that climate change will have different impacts on different people and groups, and make sure that the widest range of voices is heard in discussing how to deal with the impacts.

Climate change may well be making the life of women harder but it's also making the life of the men in their life harder too. The article indeed notes that women don't tend to have resources and financial resources of men so how on earth can ""women"" tackle the very difficult issues driving climate change. Corporations aren't going to roll over and hand power to women and women can't make governments adopt more planet-friendly policies. Even powerful men (and some powerful women) are having major problems getting the big players to even consider the issues. Protest all you like but nothing will change due to those protests. 
There are various gender issues that may well need activism but leave it out of climate change.

The women of the Marshall Islands and the Pacific have been fighting colonialism and injustice for a long time. They bore the brunt of the long term effects of nuclear testing, and women leaders like Lijon Eknilang and Darlene Keju-Johnson brought these issues to the international stage. 
For women, fighting for justice – including climate justice – can be downright dangerous. Last year was one of the deadliest for women fighting on the frontlines for human rights and environmental justice. Environmental defenders are being killed at the rate of almost four a week across the world, a staggering toll that disproportionately affects female activists and indigenous leaders. Among the most high-profile cases was Honduran indigenous Lenca leader Berta Cáceres, who was murdered in 2016. And for every woman like Cáceres who is killed, dozens of others are threatened with violence or destruction of their home or village or vital resources.
Yet despite this perilous landscape, where corporations and even the governments who are in their pocket threaten life itself, these women continue to stand up for freedom of expression and participation, for land rights and the rights of indigenous and rural communities. For sexual and reproductive health and rights, against harassment and gender-based discrimination. And for the right to preserve a safe, liveable environment for present and future generations.
At the UN climate talks in Bonn, the cause of these courageous women is being amplified by a host of organisations working on gender and climate justice issues through the Women and Gender Constituency. Together they are working to raise awareness of the work already done by women on the ground to combat climate change, and also, critically, how climate policies should address their specific needs and responsibilities and ensure the realisation of their rights.
The tragic reality of gender and climate is that women, especially women of colour, are disproportionately affected by the impacts of climate change, but are far less likely to be empowered to cope because they have fewer resources such as power and access to finance and technology. A multitude of structural barriers means they are far less likely to take up position of political power and decision-making.
Yet, when it comes to solutions — from large-scale mitigation efforts to focused, local resiliency responses — the gender perspective is often lacking, and the particular rights and needs of women are overlooked or downgraded in importance. Women aren’t making enough of the decisions, and the decisions aren’t yet doing enough for women.
Consider the issue of climate finance, where developed countries that have accumulated wealth through the combustion of fossil fuels have pledged aid to developing countries to be spent on climate solutions. In choosing actions to fund, financiers too often default to large, centralised projects, looking more at emissions data and financial rates of return than at social and human impacts. Making climate finance more gender-responsive would help address the specific needs and responsibilities of women, and channel funding to smaller scale projects that benefit women.
Ultimately, putting more decision-making in the hands of local communities, including indigenous women is the clearest path to ensuring a just climate response. A more democratised energy system based on 100% renewables allows for the input from women and promotion of their rights more than a fossil fuel-based economy run by and for the benefit of unaccountable corporations. One such system could be constructed of energy cooperatives, which are community-based and democratically run, helping to ensure equal access to affordable and sustainable energy. 
In August 2017, my government organised a major international conference in the Marshall Islands bringing together female leaders from the Pacific. Our experiences and conclusions concurred with the findings of many studies on women’s role in promoting development. Women are key activists protecting vital common resources, and at the forefront of developing local climate solutions respecting and incorporating traditional knowledge. Women consistently show ingenuity, creativity, and drive. While women and girls still bear the heaviest burden of climate change’s impacts — and while women continue to be threatened with harassment and violence, they continue to speak up to defend our waters, our trees, our soil, and our atmosphere. They have proven to be the most effective agents of change. 
This week at COP23, all governments must reach an agreement that will ensure enough climate ambition to stay below a global warming of 1.5C. To make sure that all climate action will include gender equality, the governments will agree on a Gender Action Plan. In the next two years, the plan will aim to increase the number of female climate decision-makers, train male and female policymakers on bringing gender equality into climate funding programmes, and engage grassroots and indigenous women’s organisations for local and global climate action.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/15/global-climate-action-must-be-gender-equal

The original quote was about ""preparing for"" 7 feet of ""sea level rise"" by 2100, which is not exactly what you refer to but it is more reasonable than my initial (incorrect, as I've already admitted !) inference about raising existing buildings by several feet.

Using your specific value of ""five feet"" (instead of seven) lead me to this Business Insider article (titled ""How Miami has prepared for sea level rise and monstrous hurricanes like Irma ""), which does indeed include :

To make the road less vulnerable to water, the city is rebuilding it higher and raising the height of the adjoining seawall up to five feet.

Straw man argument.
Neither the author or anyone else is suggesting the planners are going to raise the city by 7'. This is an Impossible Expectation, a usual argument from deniers.

What I tried to get at though (and perhaps more of a pub conversation than BTL) is that adapting to climate change, in my view, is about far more than just limiting temperature rise. Obviously green energy and cutting emissions is a key part of the solution, but any solution to climate change has to sit within the political and economic realities of today. These may not line up as cleanly as we'd like. 
Approaching that requires creative thinking and (sadly) selling of benefits that affect people today. To take green energy for example. There is a clear moral and long term reason to move away from fossil fuels, there is however a high short to medium term cost to do so.

... they are already having to raise roads etc today in Miami
BQEND
As I wrote ""ID2310987"" just above, I read ""raising parts of the city"" as including ""raising BUILDINGS"" by (at least ?) 7 feet, hence the level of my incredulity.
Your hint of ""raising roads"" lead me to a Miami Herald article from January this year titled ""Miami Beach to begin new $100 million flood prevention project in face of sea level rise"", which includes :
BQSTART
Along the way, engineers will have to figure out how to smoothly join private property to the public right-of-way, which will be an average of two feet higher than it is now.
BQEND
This does not explain how raising roads by two feet to cope with existing ""sunny day / king tide flooding"" in 2017 is going to ""deal with"" SLR of seven feet in the year 2100 ...
The list of proposed public works in the article include :
BQSTART
Three new pump stations will be placed at Fisher Park, at the end of 56th Street, and at 63rd Street and Alton Road. Sewer connections will be moved to the front of homes, new street lighting will be installed, and a bike lane will be added on 51st Street.
BQEND
It is unclear to me, at least, how building a bike lane is going to prevent Miami from flooding due to SLR over the 21st century ...
From the same article :
BQSTART
Resident Barry Klein asked about what happens when properties that drain excess water into the street now can’t do that once the road is higher. 
“Are we expected to do injection wells?” Klein asked. “What are we expected to do?”
The answer could lie in a new program that would allow private properties to pay a fee and connect to the street drainage system — a concept city staff is exploring and that would require approval from the commission.
BQEND
So it looks like my inference that ""city planners"" were ""exploring"" the possibility of raising buildings (/ residential homes, at least) was incorrect.
They're going to ""deal with"" the problem by raising ""parts of the city"" like roads, and leave residents / businesses to cope with water levels 7 (or more) feet higher on their own ... in addition to ""paying a fee"" to use the new utility connections ...', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1511194198000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'slr', u'effect': u'flooding'}], u'author_id': u'3985037', u'in_reply_to': u'108408396', u'id': u'108506532', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'MarkBLR', u'text': u'BQSTART
The following link includes a link to a recent NOAA study where they discuss planning for a slr of 2.5 metres and more for Florida under a worst case scenario
BQEND
Consider the following 2 options :
1) Reports that ""(climate) scientists"" are exhorting ""city planners"" (/ ""decision makers"" / politicians / ...) to include their ""worst-case scenario"" of 7 feet (/ 2 metres) of SLR by 2100 in their plans (/ deliberations).
2) Reports that ""city planners"" are considering the specific ""solution"" of raising parts of the city in response to those exhortations.
NB : I initially inferred that someone had proposed raising buildings by (more than ?!?) 7 feet in order ""to deal with this"", but I may have read (a teensy-weensy bit) too much into what Dr. Abraham wrote ...
Your link falls under ""Option 1"", though note that ""TheTanuki"" came up with a link slightly closer to the ""Option 2"" that I was asking for.

BQSTART
I downloaded it and noted their prediction but didn't have time to read how they came to that conclusion and why it's more than the ipcc prediction.
BQEND
This basically comes down to assuming that MISI (Marine Ice Sheet Instability) will lead to partial (or even complete !) ""disintegration"" of the WAIS (West Antarctic Ice Sheet) by the year 2100 (despite GMSTs over 2°C warmer than today for several millennia only resulting in a partial collapse of the WAIS during the Eemian interglacial about 130kya; most of the ""extra"" 20 feet / 6 metres of SLR at that time came from melting the Greenland ice-sheet).
In 2013 the IPCC could only write (AR5, WG1 report, page 1174) :
BQSTART
In summary, ice-dynamics theory, numerical simulations, and paleo records indicate that the existence of a marine-ice sheet instability associated with abrupt and irreversible ice loss from the Antarctic ice sheet is possible in response to climate forcing. However, theoretical considerations, current observations, numerical models, and paleo records currently do not allow a quantification of the timing of the onset of such an instability or of the magnitude of its multi-century contribution.

before a 1.5 page long ""Box 13.2 : History of the Marine Ice-Sheet Instability Hypothesis"" outlining this possibility, which included the following in the last paragraph :
BQSTART
Numerical modelling is needed to simulate the GL retreat rates that are required to make accurate SLR projections. There are major challenges in designing models whose results are not controlled by the details of their numerical design.

Plumby are you kidding - not heard of ""splicing a proxy temperature record to an instrumental record"" problem?
BQENDIndeed - splicing is an important QA/QC modelling technique - a technique that Mann and Lawson, for example, explicitly identify in their modelling.
There are several methods - Overlap Data necessary to apply both the previously used and the new method must be available for at least one year, preferably more.Surrogate Data Emission factors, activity data or other estimation parameters used in the new method are strongly correlated with other well-known and more readily available indicative data. Interpolation Data needed for recalculation using thenew method are available for intermittent years during the time series. Trend Extrapolation Data for the new method are not collected annually and are not available at the beginning or the end of the time series.Other Techniques The standard alternatives are not valid when technical conditions are changing throughout the time series (e.g., due to the introduction of mitigation technology). 
So the fact that a (web?)surfing IT technician with a scientific capability we can only hazard a guess at, perceives a low signal modelling technique as 'fraud' does not make it so - his and, I surmise, your, focus on it is probably more to do with confirmation bias targeted at a perceived weakness in climate science than any systematic actual flaw.But I am, perhaps unfairly, guessing that splicing reinforces your belief rather than being the root of it. Am I right though?
As JamesCA points out, an awful lot of other things have to be inexplicably and fundamentally wrong for this conspiracy theory to hold any water.After all, any scientist who proved that AGW was not a valid hypothesis would almost certainly receive a Nobel prize and life ling tenure, the dream of all scientists./
In summary, you have an hypothesis - to which you've spiced in a belief of systematic, continuing fraud that no scientist (thus far) has exposed.I'll stick with my acceptance of the consensus view and our existing probability modeling of an ECS to 1ς which relies on about 3000 models , thanks.

About those 1970s ice age predictions as mis-cited: This stems originally from a 1971 Rasool and Schneider study, which was predicated on a quadrupling of aerosol emissions; this possible pathway never happened.
Emissions actually went the opposite trajectory due to the establishment of the EPA and the Clean Water Act in 1970 (both enacted by Republicans), the Vienna Convention on the Protection of the Ozone Layer of 1985, the The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete 17the Ozone Layer of 1987 and the Clean Air Act of 1990.http://www.sciencemag.org/content/173/3992/138http://www.epa.gov/ozone/intpol/

However, those are media articles, not scientific studies. A survey of peer reviewed scientific papers from 1965 to 1979 show that few papers predicted global cooling (7 in total). Significantly more papers (42 in total) predicted global warming (Peterson 2008). The large majority of climate research in the 1970s predicted the Earth would warm as a consequence of CO2.

Of course there are data problems -- every scientific discipline has them, and those with a large historical component such as geology are forced to deal with proxies for the older time periods and merge them with instrumental data for more recent periods.
But those problems are well understood and are honestly and capably managed to get the most information possible out of the existing data (of admittedly wildly varying accuracy and precision). 
More importantly, you could throw out the ENTIRE proxy record -- ignore it completely -- and still have 100 times the evidence you need to demonstrate that AGW is real and poses a threat. It follows from basic physical laws: if you add CO2 to the atmosphere, there will be a heating effect. Period. No ifs, ands, or buts. Basic quantum mechanics, radiative physics and thermodynamics. And the exact amount of heating predicted by theory has been observed with extremely accurate and precise modern measurements. 
Given that, the only way to avoid AGW would be the existence of some never-seen deus-ex-machina that would somehow magically produce and equal and opposite cooling effect. Many such mechanism have been proposed -- every single one has been shown to be non-existant. No one is even currently suggesting any new mechanisms that would have the required effect.
Which (as I get tired of point out) is why effectively every scientific organization in the world has stated, unequivocally, that AGW is real and poses a threat.

Those key differences are why I recommend you watch it. 
This movie successfully accomplishes a number of interweaving tasks. First, it gives some of the science of climate change. Gore gets his science right. I remember his first movie, which I thought was more steeped in science and data than this one, so based on my recollection this new picture is somewhat abbreviated. That’s a good thing because the science is settled on climate change. That is, the science is settled that humans are causing current climatic changes and the science is settled that we are observing these changes throughout the natural world. 
Readers of this column who venture into the comments below will likely find people claiming, “science is never settled.” But the people making those comments are not scientists. They don’t work in this field every day, they don’t see the data, and they don’t know what they’re talking about.
The opening of the new film shows a sample of the misguided attacks on Al Gore, exclusively from conservatives in the United States. It was so clear to me, when watching and listening, that these attacks are the same ones that we climate scientists constantly have to endure. Most scientists have not been attacked as consistently or for such a long duration as Mr. Gore, but the types of attacks he has had to handle are close cousins to what my colleagues and I experience on a regular basis. 
Many conservatives, and some progressives too, claim that Al Gore made climate change political. But I now realize he didn’t. Al Gore was simply the first major political figure that took a stand on climate change. He would have loved to have been joined by anyone of any political persuasion. I firmly believe that the denialism we see from conservatives in the USA is partly because they cannot bring themselves to admit he was right. 
In many people’s subconscious, it is better to deny the science and damn the world than admit a liberal former vice president was correct. And that failure is on them. Better people would rise above gut emotions and follow facts faithfully to where they lead. Instead, most US conservatives have tied their legacy to a climate denial movement that is causing and will cause irreparable harm to the planet, its biology, and human societies. 
A party that calls itself “conservative” has acted out of accord with its stated values. And this fact should anger true conservatives. How could they allow an entire party to be tarred with this damning legacy? It isn’t Mr. Gore’s fault that conservatives have made climate denial a litmus test for their party. It isn’t Gore’s fault that conservative politicians have been bought by fossil fuel industries who have attacked climate science and climate scientists. It isn’t Al Gore’s fault that the Republican Party has stood in the way of the development of clean renewable fuels in the US. That is on them. It isn’t Mr. Gore’s fault that the very few conservatives who have taken a principled stand have been cast out from their party. The politicization of science is their scar.
With respect to the science, this new movie focuses on actual implications of climate change. Whether Mr. Gore is discussing Greenland’s crumbling ice sheet with scientists Eric Rignot or Konrad Steffen, or conversing with Miami city planners on ways to handle rising waters, the movie brings the implications of a changing climate home. Mr. Gore reminds us of projections for the future. For instance, South Florida may see 7 feet of sea level rise by 2100. City planners are considering ways to raise parts of the city to deal with this. Oh by the way, yes the best evidence shows we really may get 7 feet by 2100.
Later, Gore meets with people who have suffered through terrible and super-charged storms, such as recent typhoons in the Pacific. He lays clear the science that climate change is warming our oceans, providing extra fuel to make storms like Irma, Harvey, Sandy, and Maria more powerful. In these spots, his science is dead on.
This may make you wonder why I recommend people watch this movie. Isn’t it just more doom and gloom? Well, this is the exciting part. While the politics of climate change, at least in the USA (with a President and Congress in full denial mode, not only rolling back progress but sabotaging the science), what reason is there to be hopeful? 
First, other countries are taking the lead from the US. I see this in my own work. Not only in basic science but in deployment of renewable energy. This is one area of great potential. Even though, as shown in the movie, fossil fuel companies and some conservative politicians are trying to sabotage clean energy markets, they cannot deny the economics. It just makes sense to use clean and renewable energy. 
Do you remember that iconic scene from his first movie, where he followed greenhouse gas data upward using a lift? The gas levels were literally off the screen? Well, that gloomy image is replaced in the new movie by an equally iconic but optimistic animation of how countries are installing clean energy. 
A large part of the story does deal with Al Gore’s personal journey. In many ways, this is mirrored in the journeys of climate scientists and people who care about the Earth’s environment. We have all experienced the ups and downs of this crisis; in fact, we’ve experienced them together whether we knew it or not. Interestingly, I have come around to a cautious optimism that is identical to Al Gore’s. 
The election in the US was a climate disaster and it is turning out to be worse than we could have feared. The US President and Congress are doing everything they can to ensure more rapid and devastating climate change. They are doing everything they can to ensure more California wildfires, more Marias, more Harveys, and more Irmas. They are doing everything they can to bring us more California droughts and wildfires and Texas floods. They are doing everything they can to cut funding from climate science so we won’t know how bad it is. They are doing everything they can to make the USA a pariah nation. In fact, on the day I write this, the US has become the only country to reject the Paris Climate Accord. That is a stunning fact. What kind of country does this?
What they are doing is so un-American; so un-conservative. 
But what these forces cannot do is turn back the tide of the economics. People are investing in clean energy because it makes economic sense. And this is the inflection point that makes the clean energy revolution unstoppable. That’s why I am optimistic. That’s why Al Gore is optimistic. That’s the threaded message in his movie. And it’s why you should be optimistic too.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/nov/15/an-inconvenient-sequel-the-science-history-and-politics-of-climate-change

Incorrect.The WTO and participants know what it means, the use of ""tax credits"" is an example, not a single definition.

For instance, if the government sets a particular tax rate, the rate is the rate, and revenue that is otherwise due is not foregone.

The glaciation of Antarctica began around 34 million years ago, when CO2 reduced from around 1000 ppm to around 600 ppm.
Antarctic glacial inception began at around 750 ppm, and spread more widely as the CO2 level continued to fall.
So - eventually - if CO2 rises back to those levels (around 800 ppm) allowing for the fact that it takes a lot of (latent) heat to melt ice at zero C to water at zero C - this would create conditions where Antarctica would eventually become ice-free again.

The focus of concern is a government proposal for up to $300bn in tax relief to companies that develop offshore oilfields that opponents claim would use up 7% of humanity’s emission budget if global warming is to be kept below 2C.
Climate Observatory, WWF, Greenpeace and other groups say the subsidies could spark a get-it-out-of-the-ground race with fossil fuel rivals such as the US, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Norway and the UK.
The accusations contradict Brazil’s position at this week’s climate talks, where the country’s negotiators have urged the world to be more ambitious in cutting carbon emissions.
“The country is doing the exact opposite – increasing emissions and opening itself up to big oil with billionaire subsidies at a time when the country still tries to recover from its worst recession,” said Carlos Rittl, executive secretary of Climate Observatory.
The pre-salt fields are believed to contain oil and gas equivalent to 176bn barrels of crude, or 74.8bn tonnes of CO2. This is 7% of the carbon budget for 2C and 18% for 1.5C, according to calculations by Climate Observatory 
Extraction is already under way, but the administration of Michel Temer, who seized power in an impeachment plot against former president Dilma Rousseff last year, is keen to accelerate the process.
It has proposed a bill – known as MP 795 – that would slash taxes up until 2040 for firms that win auctions to develop the oil fields. The subsidy would give the government one of the lowest revenue shares in the world of each barrel extracted, effectively undercutting the competition.
“This is a terrible signal,” said Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International. “With this bill, Brazil will make the global responsibility to reduce emissions even more difficult than it already is.”
Congress is due to vote on the bill before 15 December. Opposition congressmen say the subsidies for oil are unjust at a time when health and education budgets have been frozen for 20 years and payments for forest protection have been slashed.
The government says the measure is necessary to ensure the success of future auctions which will generate revenue to help an economy that is only slowly emerging from its worst recession in a century. It has earmarked 70.5% of all energy investment until 2026 (pdf) to be spent on fossil fuels.
 Brazil’s carbon emissions surged 8.9% last year – the biggest rise since 2008 – largely as a result of increased deforestation in the Amazon and Cerrado. 
This threatens the lead-by-example role that Brazil’s skilled diplomats have long played at climate talks.
Officials point out that many developing countries are also promoting oil and coal and that in some cases, such as Germany, their emissions are also rising. By comparison, they say, Brazil gets 74% of its energy from renewables (mostly hydropower dams) and that the pace of deforestation slowed by 16% this year after a two-year uptick that pushed the country off course from its climate goals.
The country’s chief climate change negotiator, José Antônio Marcondes, insisted Brazil was doing its part and urged developed nations to pick up the pace by taking action over the next three years.
“If we are to reach the goals set out in Paris, we cannot delay action until 2020. Ambition and actions should not be postponed,” he said. “If we do not meet the deadlines, if things become even harder on the discussions – which we are doing everything to avoid, we must not, we cannot run the risk of repeating Copenhagen when the world failed to agree on action.”
It was exactly the sort of stirring and positive argument that has enabled Brazil to push past negotiations forward and bridge the gap between rich and poor countries. However, when asked about proposals back home for fossil fuel subsides, he was far less assured.
“We are of course following the legislative discussions around any possible fiscal measures. However, it should not be overlooked that we adopted in the Paris Agreement emissions reduction targets that are among the most ambitious in the world – across both developed and developing countries – and these targets are on top of the dramatic reductions already achieved,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/15/brazils-oil-sale-plans-undermine-its-role-at-bonn

 But it’s arguable that these prejudices also influence our science and policy. Take, for example, the specialised method of rotational farming used by many indigenous farmers all over the world but particularly in the global south. Farmers use seasonal fires to clear and farm parcels of natural landscapes and rotate their crops while the previously farmed parcel is allowed to regain fertility and natural vegetation – a method known as swidden agriculture. This technique helps preserve the soil quality and creates variation that helps counter the dominance of a few species and promotes biodiversity. It also helps prevent larger wildfires of the type that ravaged California recently, leaving 41 people dead and causing financial losses worth $30bn (£22.7bn). After decades of neglect, the US Forest Service is now embracing the Native American methods of fire management.
And yet, despite these potential benefits to the environment, and its crucial role in the wellbeing of many millions of indigenous families throughout the global south, swidden is neglected in science and policy research related to landscape conservation.
 The huge internationally financed programme of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (Redd) encourages governments in developing countries to plant new forests on “barren” lands to offset carbon emissions responsible for global climate change. Swidden landscapes, which are left fallow for several years before they are farmed again, are an easy target for governments and “carbon cowboys” looking to profit from Redd, who may sow fast-growing and ecologically harmful commercial plantations in swidden lands. 
A high-profile international project focused on researching biodiversity in Cameroon, Madagascar, Tanzania, Indonesia and Laos offers a case in point. Even though swidden was the dominant land use in these research sites, scientists from the Centre for International Forestry Research ignored it altogether, thereby missing an opportunity to learn about its potential to aid biodiversity conservation. Such neglect reinforces the stigmatisation of swidden and other indigenous farming methods. Government agencies and environmental NGOs seek to ban, restrict, or phase out swidden, without any provisions for viable alternatives. This is unfortunate because if swidden landscapes are allowed sufficient fallow period and are protected against commercial exploitation, they help nurture biodiversity and contribute to the food security of some of the poorest people on earth.
 Despite talks about protecting indigenous land rights, influential policies for nature conservation and climate change threaten indigenous livelihoods and endanger the global efforts to promote environmental stewardship. Crucial support in science and policy, which is currently lacking, will go a long way in building on indigenous knowledge about farming, fire management and other ways of conserving the landscape, without having to sacrifice the goals of human development.
 This year, as we celebrate the completion of a decade of the adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, we would do well to incorporate indigenous wisdom in our science and policy. Respecting indigenous rights will also give humanity better protection against catastrophic climate change.

“This is a victory for indigenous peoples who have always been fighting for recognition of our rights as a way to protect forests and tackle climate change. This is a big advance,” said Juan Carlos Jintiach of Coica, a group representing indigenous communities in the Amazon.
For much of the past 20 years, indigenous groups have been a disgruntled, fractious presence on the fringes of climate talks who were primarily portrayed as victims, but this has gradually changed along with a growing body of research showing that respect for the territorial rights of communal land is one of the most cost-effective ways of sequestering carbon. 
The 2015 Paris accord recognised the contribution of indigenous knowledge in dealing with climate change, but the document approved in Bonn this week goes further by acknowledging that countries “should, when taking action to address climate change, respect, promote and consider their respective obligations on the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities.”
It also proposes greater participation of indigenous communities in “leadership roles” and mentions this will have budget implications, opening the possibility that they could be covered by the Green Climate Fund. 
“This shows that the international community increasingly recognises the way indigenous peoples and local communities manage their lands and territories can be an important climate change solution, because they help to protect forests and other natural resources. Now for the first time the UNFCCC [United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] is establishing concrete mechanisms, with funding to support those efforts,” said Penny Davies of the Ford Foundation.
In a sign of the change in status, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, was scheduled to meet indigenous representatives in Bonn on Wednesday. China, which is keen to appear as a climate leader, has also softened its position on indigenous rights, long shaped by Beijing’s concern about separatist movements in Tibet, Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia.
Governments should now be obliged to talk to indigenous communities when drawing up national climate targets, though their influence remains to be seen.
Former Brazilian environment minister Izabella Teixiera welcomed the move and hoped it would have positive domestic as well as international implications. 
“Indigenous rights are really important to move towards a fair, low-carbon planet,” she said. “I hope this can also help us avoid backsliding on this agenda in Brazil.”
Clare Shakya of the International Institute for Environment and Development said new mechanisms for indigenous participation should not be used to channel their voices away from the main debate. 
“This is an important step forward but only if it really does mean that indigenous and local communities are listened to and their knowledge recognised,” she said. 
“This decision is an opportunity to make sure that they drive the solutions to tackling climate change. Throughout this climate meeting numerous representatives from developing countries have said how top-down responses to addressing climate change actually marginalises them. Today’s decision is a chance to change that.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/15/indigenous-groups-win-greater-climate-recognition-at-bonn-summit

The delegates heard a series of strong political messages on Wednesday, urging them to use the final two days of the summit to complete important work on putting the landmark 2015 Paris deal into action. Without this, the world faces a devastating 3C or more of global warming.
The UN secretary general, António Guterres, told the conference in Bonn of his visit to the Caribbean after this year’s hurricanes. 
“The catastrophic damage of climate change is upon us and when the frontline is devastated, the whole army is lost” he said, railing against the $825bn invested in fossil fuels in 2016. “We must stop making bets on an unsustainable future.”
The French president, Emmanuel Macron, who has been among the most vocal critics of Donald Trump’s decision to pull the US out of the Paris deal, got the loudest applause when he committed France and European partners to filling the funding gap for the UN’s climate science panel, left by the US withdrawal. “They will not miss a single euro,” he said.
Macron also emphasised the global importance of tackling global warming, saying: “The fight against climate change is by far the most significant struggle of our times.” He also addressed the issue that underpins most disputes at the global negotiations: the responsibility of rich nations that caused climate change to pay for the solution and compensate for the damage: “Climate change adds further injustice to an already unfair world.”
President Ali Bongo Ondimba of Gabon, representing African nations, said the need for faster action was urgent: “The fire is right under our feet. That is why I am expressing the extreme concern of Africa in light of the increase of disasters related to climate change. Africa suffers the loss and damage on a daily basis.” 
“It is now time for the developed countries to live up to their responsibilities,” said Baron Waqa, president of Nauru and representing small island states. “Lack of resources is the problem.”
The talks in Bonn have progressed reasonably smoothly, without the drama and walkouts of previous summits. But one issue has flared up – whether rich nations are doing enough before 2020 to cut their emissions and to help poorer nations cope with the impacts of global warming. 
It has been forced to the top of the agenda by the devastating floods and hurricanes seen around the world this year – as well as the meeting being run by the vulnerable island nation of Fiji. Negotiators agreed a deal on this on Wednesday, involving new stock takes of action in 2018 and 2019 and on progress towards the $100bn a year in climate funding that rich nations have promised to deliver by 2020.
The divisive issue of “loss and damage” – compensation for poor nations for the climate change damage – has been defused for now, with an expert meeting to address concerns next year. Progress has been made in drawing up the draft rules for implementing the Paris agreement, an essential step ahead of agreeing them in 2018.
Merkel, Guterres and Macron were almost upstaged by the first speech of the high-level session, given by 12-year-old Timoci Naulusala from Fiji, without any hint of nerves. Referring to the impact of Cyclone Winston in 2016, he said: “My home, my school, sources of food, money, water, were totally destroyed. My once beautiful village, which I called home, is a barren waste. Climate change is real, not a dream.” 
Frank Bainimarama, Fiji’s prime minister and president of the summit, said: “We are not simply negotiating words on a page, but we are representing all our people and the places they call home.”
Merkel, who as an environment minister chaired the first climate summit 23 years ago, has been under pressure this week to phase out Germany’s large coal-fired power stations, which are likely to bust Germany’s climate targets. 
“We still use a lot of coal, particularly lignite,” she said, acknowledging the issue is controversial, but she said jobs had to be taken into account too. She added that progress was expected in the next few days as she settles the terms of a new governing coalition with the Green and Liberal parties.
However, Prof John Schellnhuber, at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, and who has advised both Merkel and the pope, said the 20,000 German jobs in coal would be lost to mechanisation in any case, and were a small number compared to the 600,000 created in the wider economy each year.
Macron set out unusual detail for a head of state in his speech, saying France would close all its coal power plants by 2021 and would ban all new exploration for fossil fuel in its territories. He also said France would fund interconnectors and energy storage technology to spread renewable energy around Europe and work to push the cost of CO2 emissions to €30 a tonne, which would end the viability coal and drive out gas.

Compared with pre-industrial levels, we find acommitted warming of 1.5 K (0.9–3.6, 5th–95th percentile) atequilibrium, and of 1.3 K(0.9–2.3) within this century. However,when assuming that ocean carbon uptake cancels remnantgreenhouse gas-induced warming on centennial timescales,committed warming is reduced to 1.1 K (0.7–1.8). In thelatter case there is a 13% risk that committed warming alreadyexceeds the 1.5 K target set in Paris15.

BQENDAnd from deeper in the paper.
BQSTART
Our estimates of committed warming are sensitive to therelatively large uncertainty in aerosol forcing which leads to a longtail of high climate sensitivity values (Fig. 1). In the energy-balanceframe work, warming on centennial timescales is closely connectedto TCR (Fig. 3): commitment median probability exceeds 1.5 K forTCR of 1.5 and 1.9 K for cases d and e, respect ively, and excee ds 2.0 Kfor TCR of 2.1 and 2.6 K. This me ans that, if TCR of the Earth turnsout to be in the upper range, then the 1.5 degree target could alreadybe unachievable. But high values of TCR are almost exclusivelyassociated with strong aerosol cooling (Faero< −1.0 W m−2, Fig. 3red shading). Such strong aerosol cooling may be inconsistent withmid-century warming being forced17although the lower bound onaerosol is the subject of current debate.

There are hopeful signs that this is not an unrealistic goal. Worldwide CO2 emissions grew at a rate of 2.9% per year from 2000 to 2011, slowed to 1.3% per year from 2012 to 2014, and further decreased to near-zero growth (−0.2% per year) for 2015. This near-zero growth rate continued into 2016 (2). The low to near-zero growth rate since 2014 is due to a combination of several factors: switching from coal to oil and natural gas; an increase in production of renewable energy such as nuclear (1.3%), hydro (1%), and wind and solar (15%); and a reduction in carbon intensity of the economy. The negative growth rate from the United States (−2.6%) and China (−0.7%) mostly contributed to the recent bending of the emissions curve. While these are encouraging signs, aggressive policies will still be required to achieve carbon neutrality and climate stability.

Coal has to be eliminated by pricing it out of the market.This should have been done by the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, but Germany crashed the carbon price by flooding the market with emissions permits:

Climate change will determine humanity's destiny, says Angela Merkel Damian Carrington, The Guardian, 15 November 2017 
Macron set out unusual detail for a head of state in his speech, saying France would close all its coal power plants by 2021 and would ban all new exploration for fossil fuel in its territories. He also said France would fund interconnectors and energy storage technology to spread renewable energy around Europe and work to push the cost of CO₂ emissions to €30 a tonne, which would end the viability coal and drive out gas.
BQEND
He's closing all France's coal plants by 2021, much earlier than the UK's final coal plant closure in 2025, and he's pushing for an EU-wide carbon price floor of €30/tonne CO₂, which would wipe out the economics of Germany's coal power plants.

German predicament due to Macron’s climate protection Clean Energy Wire, 23 June 2017 
French President Emmanuel Macron’s proposal to introduce a high price on CO₂ emissions in the European Union would give France an “enormous competitive edge” over Germany, as his country’s energy supply is based mostly on emission-free nuclear and hydro power, according to Pöyry Management Consulting, Daniel Wetzel reports in Die Welt. A price of 30 euros per tonne CO₂ – reported by news agency Bloomberg – would see Europe reach its CO₂-reduction goals faster, but increase power prices in Germany by about 40 percent. This would put export-oriented, energy-intensive industry at a disadvantage, the consultancy says in a press release.
BQEND
Germany's electricity prices would rise by 40% because of its coal-heavy generating mix, even at a relatively low carbon price floor of €30 per ton of CO₂.

“It’s about getting on with it,” Lord Nicholas Stern told the Guardian. “They have to get on with it. But there are good signs.”
He said the recent meeting of the International Monetary Fund had proved countries were prepared to pass the test. “[We will have] the absence of the US for a little bit, but the determination at that meeting was striking. There is a determination to get on with things come what may.”
A former World Bank chief economist, Stern was the author of the landmark review of the economics of climate change in 2006, which showed that tackling greenhouse gas emissions sooner would cost less and yield more economic benefits than waiting for years, or decades, until the results of climate change are clearer.
The COP23 talks discussing crucial issues related to climate change began in the former West German capital, Bonn, last week and will finish on Friday. Ministers began arriving on Wednesday for the final “high-level segment” of the talks, which are expected to include toughening pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions made at the historic Paris conference in 2015.
Trump has begun the process of US withdrawal from the Paris agreement, which will take several years, but in the meantime the US will continue to participate in the talks. So far, the US has taken little part in discussions, but this could change in the final days.
“Trump could be passive and do very little, or could be obstructive. I suspect the former, though not with great confidence,” said Stern. “The officials [sent by the US to Bonn] are a long way down the pecking order, which really suggests passive disengagement rather than an aggressive blocking strategy. But there is no predicting what the Trump administration will do.”
Stern said this was why other major countries bore a greater responsibility for making progress without the White House. He pointed to China and India, which he expected to play a strong role in furthering the Paris agreement.
“We should recognise that these countries are moving very quickly [on greenhouse gases],” he said. “My view is that [emissions from] China will peak by 2030. In India, the price of solar power has fallen to three cents a kilowatt hour [on a par with coal]. That is remarkable. The dial is really turning up in India now, which is really important.”
India has been a reluctant participant in previous talks. Six years ago, when the UN’s climate conference was held in Durban, India and China stood alone in holding out against the proposals which led to the Paris agreement. They eventually agreed, and China went on to take a leading role in the run-up to Paris, but India’s position has been less clear. The country’s prime minister made an angry speech in Paris saying that developed countries should take more responsibility, but the country signed up to the ensuing agreement and since then, according to Stern, there has been much more support within the Indian government.
Stern also called for more focus on the ways for poorer countries in particular to adapt to the effects of climate change. He said this should be known as fostering “resilience”, rather than adaptation as it used to be known, because resilience requires a broader range of measures and skills and it makes more sense to build and retrofit cities and infrastructure in such a way as to improve their resilience to all potential natural disasters, not just the effects of climate change.
He called for resilience to be built into all discussions on international development, in order to help the world’s poorest to cope with the social, economic and climate-driven problems that may arise, and in some cases are already taking place.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/16/nicholas-stern-ministers-must-pass-trump-test-at-bonn-climate-talks

You are suggesting we start all over again from scratch, throw out the good with the bad and replace it with what! As you say time is of the essence on addressing the negative impacts of climate change. BUT even the climate change experts advocating action realize that a transition to global carbon free emissions could take up to at least 2050. 
I have accessed your hyperlinks but do not need to be convinced of the need for urgent action on climate change. In North Dakota there have already been reports of major gas and oil leakages on the Keystone XL oil/gas pipeline in conjunction with documentaries suggesting gas pipelines in the US in general, not properly serviced and maintained, are losing up to 8% of gas to the atmosphere – in effect worse than the burning of thermal coal in terms of CO2 emissions.
I heard today in the media that forests absorb up to 25% of carbon emissions but through increased respiration due to global warming are releasing 30% of that 25% take-up. I have suggested recently that we should start looking at the use of clumping bamboo to extend vegetation cover by utilizing degraded land in order to protect old growth forests from logging. Clumping bamboo for example can provide a holistic solution (economic, social and environmental) while producing more jobs and greater long term profits than sugar cane ever will and can be integrated with existing sugar cane plantations for erosion control, erosion remediation, windbreaks, CO2 sequestration, sound screens and landscaping for starters, with the potential to produce over 1,000 manufactured products….access this hyperlink https://www.bambooimport.com/en/blog/products-made-from-bamboo with embedded video giving greater clarification of multiple uses. Here are further examples of how bamboo can be used in building construction: https://www.pinterest.com/pin/288300813615521314/
A report commissioned by the Queensland Tourism Innovation Council (QTIC )with Queensland Farmers Federation and WWF last year estimated the annual investment needed to maintain the reef by managing water quality and other adverse impacts was $574m.” – a current shortfall of $374 million based on the current contribution by the LNP federal and QLD state governments ($200 million) could be funded from generated tax revenue in the construction phase of Project Iron Boomerang.
As part of a new evolutionary capitalism paradigm I have also suggested , GIVEN ACCELLERATED ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE ON SO MANY FRONTS and not just deforestation or abuse of oceans and waterways - I would like to see organizations like the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology in Australia pool their research talents and produce a large digital wall map of Australia as shown on ABC News weather maps but with far greater satellite imagery of topography and vegetation coverage, together with water resources, biodiversity hotspots (flora and fauna), population spread etc.- a base map that can be rotated and zoomed in and out off – as detailed as GOOGLE mapping. Protagonists for new and improved existing infrastructure could work with government through the use of transparent infrastructure map overlays superimposed on the integral base map of the Australian land mass and surrounding oceans to demonstrate a holistic infrastructure approach to reducing global carbon emissions...observable in real time by the voting public.
Let the land and its resources, both natural and man-made, tell us what is feasible in a holistic sense – economically, socially and environmentally.

Just wrong. The generators, whether they be coal, wind or anything else are not being paid the retail price of electricity. They get paid the wholesale price (plus subsidies if applicable). The difference between the wholesale price and the retail price goes to pay for the transmission and distribution network, retailing costs such as billing costs etc etc. The wholesale prices are set on the National Electricity Market (NEM) which is operated by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO). You can see the most recent wholesale prices here:

Wholesale prices are currently about $0.07/kWh (Qld and NSW), $0.08 (Victoria) and $0.10 (SA and Tas).', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1510913972000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'4069809', u'in_reply_to': u'108359767', u'id': u'108368685', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'realist66', u'text': u'eh?', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1510927865000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'4710139', u'in_reply_to': u'108347759', u'id': u'108381488', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'realist66', u'text': u''ollocks.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1510927108000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'4710139', u'in_reply_to': u'108335992', u'id': u'108380715', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Mikhail Baxterchov', u'text': u'I'm just some hack/lay observer who is trying to do the right thing with a tiny carbon footprint....

Catch The Long Road Home on Tuesdays at 9/8c on National Geographic.SAMARRA, IRAQIt was a few weeks after the rains failed in the winter of 2009 that residents of Shirqat first noticed the strange bearded men.
Circling like vultures among the stalls of the town’s fertilizer market in Iraq’s northern Salahaddin governorate, they’d arrow in on the most shabbily dressed farmers, and tempt them with promises of easy riches. “Join us, and you’ll never have to worry about feeding your family,” Saleh Mohammed Al-Jabouri, a local tribal sheikh, remembers one recruiter saying.With every flood or bout of extreme heat or cold, the jihadists would reappear, often supplementing their sales pitches with gifts. When a particularly vicious drought struck in 2010, the fifth in seven years, they doled out food baskets. When fierce winds eviscerated hundreds of eggplant fields near Kirkuk in the spring of 2012, they distributed cash. As farming communities limped from one debilitating crisis to another, the recruiters—all members of what soon became the Islamic State—began to see a return on their investment.
Now this is from the Nat Geo. So think about it, if we do nothing about climate change , the jihadists win.

It was greeted as a “political watershed”, signalling the end of the dirtiest fossil fuel that currently provides 40% of global electricity.
New pledges were made on Thursday by Mexico, New Zealand, Denmark and Angola for the Powering Past Coal Alliance, which is led by the UK and Canada.
“The case against coal is unequivocal,” said UK climate minister Claire Perry, both on environmental and health grounds – air pollution from coal kills 800,000 people a year worldwide. “The alliance will signal to the world that the time of coal has passed.” The UK was the first nation to commit to ending coal use – by 2025 – but the electricity generated by coal has already fallen from 40% to 2% since 2012.
“There is a human cost and an environmental cost but we don’t need to pay that price when the price of renewables has plummeted,” said Catherine McKenna, Canada’s environment minister. “I’m thrilled to see so much global momentum for the transition to clean energy – and this is only the beginning.” The alliance aims to have 50 members by next year.
Asked about Donald Trump’s US administration, whose only event in Bonn was to promote coal, McKenna pointed out that renewable energy already employs 250,000 people in the US, compared to 50,000 in coal, and said this is the clean growth century: “The market has moved on coal.” 
But McKenna said it was very important that communities dependent on coal jobs received help. Mohamed Adow, at Christian Aid, said: “It is a rebuke to Trump from the UK and Canada, two of America’s closest allies.”
The current alliance includes a few nations like Fiji that do not use coal and does not include any Asian countries where much of the world’s coal is used. Australia, the region’s biggest supplier of coal, has refused to join. But Nick Mabey, chief executive of the E3G thinktank, said: “The launch of this new alliance is a political watershed moment. Governments have now grasped the reality that coal use can end, and fast. The only way for coal is down.” 
Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, who led the UN climate talks in Peru in 2014 and is now at WWF, said: ‘We welcome the first steps countries have taken today but this is only the start.” 
The alliance was also welcomed by the most vulnerable states. “I can’t stress enough that coal is by far the largest single barrier to staying within 1.5C of warming, and giving vulnerable countries like mine a chance of survival,” said David Paul, environment minister from the Marshall Islands.
Earlier the Marshall Island’s President Hilda Heine said the country was very disappointed in Australia’s continued pursuit of coal: “We’re neighbours: they should be aware of the issues that are facing small island countries.” 
The Australian Greens MP Adam Bandt said the nation was “posing an existential threat to many of our neighbours” and that the countries backing coal phase outs came from across the political spectrum: “A door has been opened for the Australian government here.”
But Australia’s environment minister Josh Frydenberg, said coal was expected to remain the bedrock of Asia’s power supply, providing about a third of electricity in 2040. At the moment, coal generates about 75% of Australian power.
Greenpeace UK lauded the alliance, but Rachel Kennerley, from Friends of the Earth UK, said: “It’s a profound disconnect that the UK is positioning itself as a climate leader but simultaneously green-lighting fracking, which will open up a whole new fossil industry.”
Germany is not part of the new alliance and the pressure for it to announce the phase-out of its large fleet of heavily polluting coal power stations intensified on Thursday. New OECD data shows that its fossil fuel subsidies have increased each year from 2014-16, to €3.9bn. Another new report, part of the G20 peer review process, shows Germany believes only two of its many fossil fuel subsidies need to be removed – both are already being phased out under EU rules.
Shelagh Whitley, at the Overseas Development Institute in the UK, said: “Germany is subsidising climate chaos and is saying it won’t stop.” Alex Doukas, at Oil Change International in the US, said: “Germany should be ashamed of itself.”
Chancellor Angela Merkel addressed the climate summit on Wednesday, saying the response to climate change would determine the destiny of humankind and urging faster action. But she was heavily criticised for not announcing a coal phaseout. Michael Schäfer, at WWF Germany, said: “Internationally, Merkel is often still perceived as a climate champion. But she will lose that reputation if she does not finally act at home.”
That could happen imminently. Merkel’s CDU party is negotiating a three-way coalition to form a new government and talks are due to end on Thursday night. The CDU and Free Democrats have offered to close 10 coal power stations by 2020 but the Greens want 20 shut down to enable Germany to meet its carbon target.
Asked about Germany’s coal, Perry said: “We are not trying to tell other countries what to do, we want to show them it can be done. Every country is different [but] we all know we need to move beyond coal.”
The alliance will work by encouraging new commitments and using financing and shared technology and best practice to encourage others to phase out “unabated coal” – plants where carbon dioxide is not captured and buried below ground. Its national members are Angola, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Fiji, Finland, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Marshall Islands, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Niue, Portugal, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/16/political-watershed-as-19-countries-pledge-to-phase-out-coal

Now we are living through another extraordinary period in history: one defined by dazzling political shocks and the disruptive impact of new technologies in every part of our lives. The public sphere has changed more radically in the past two decades than in the previous two centuries – and news organisations, including this one, have worked hard to adjust.
But the turbulence of our time may demand that we do more than adapt. The circumstances in which we report, produce, distribute and obtain the news have changed so dramatically that this moment requires nothing less than a serious consideration of what we do and why we do it.
The Scott Trust, which owns the Guardian, stated a very clear purpose when it was established in 1936: “to secure the financial and editorial independence of the Guardian in perpetuity and to safeguard the journalistic freedom and liberal values of the Guardian free from commercial or political interference.” As an editor, it’s hard to imagine a finer mission for a proprietor: our sole shareholder is committed only to our journalistic freedom and longterm survival.
But if the mission of the Scott Trust is to ensure that Guardian journalism will exist for ever, it is still left to us to define what the mission of that journalism will be. What is the meaning and purpose of our work? What role do we play in society?
After working at the Guardian for two decades, I feel I know instinctively why it exists. Most of our journalists and our readers do, too – it’s something to do with holding power to account, and upholding liberal values. We know what defines a Guardian story, what feels like a Guardian perspective, what makes something “very Guardian” (for better and for worse).
In my own work as editor of the Guardian in Australia, and then as the editor of the Guardian in the US, I tried to conceptualise the Guardian with a different accent – to identify the essential qualities of Guardian journalism and bring them to new audiences. Now, as the editor-in-chief of the Guardian and the Observer, I believe our time requires something deeper. It is more urgent than ever to ask: who are we, fundamentally?
The answer to this question is in our past, our present and our future. I want to lead a Guardian that relates to the world in a way that reflects our history, engages deeply with this disorientating global moment, and is sustainable for ever.
The history of the Guardian begins on 16 August 1819, when John Edward Taylor, a 28-year-old English journalist, attended an enormous demonstration for parliamentary reform in Manchester. In St Peter’s Field, a popular radical speaker, Henry Hunt, addressed a crowd estimated to contain 60,000 people – more than half the population of the Manchester area at the time, dressed in their Sunday best and packed in so tightly that their hats were said to be touching.
At the time, the mood in the country was insurrectionary. The French revolution, three decades earlier, had spread throughout the world the seismic idea that ordinary people could face down the powerful and win – a revelation for the masses and a fright for those in power. After Britain’s victory at Waterloo and the end of the Napoleonic wars, the country was mired in economic depression and high unemployment, while the Corn Laws, which kept the price of grain artificially high, brought mass hunger. There were protests and riots throughout the country, from handloom weavers trashing newly invented factory machinery to anti-slavery campaigners boycotting sugar.
There was also a growing campaign for the vote: the big, densely populated city of Manchester had no member of parliament – while Old Sarum, a prosperous hamlet in southern England, with just one voter, had two MPs to represent him. The city’s businessmen were demanding an overhaul of this rotten system – and working men (and, for the first time, women) wanted their own chance to vote.
The combination of economic depression, political repression and the politicisation of workers with economic need was combustible. As the essayist William Hazlitt wrote one year earlier, “nothing that was established was to be tolerated … the world was to be turned topsy-turvy.”
As most of Manchester gathered in St Peter’s Field on 16 August, the city’s magistrates, intimidated by the size of the crowd and their demands, ordered armed cavalry to charge into the crowd – to break up the meeting and arrest Hunt and other speakers on the podium. The troops stormed through the people, hacking with their sabres and “cutting at everyone they could reach”. Eleven people were killed on the day, seven men and four women, and many hundreds were injured. It became known as the Peterloo massacre or the Battle of Peterloo, and its impact was huge: the historian AJP Taylor said that Peterloo “began the breakup of the old order in England”.
John Edward Taylor was in the crowd that day, reporting for a weekly paper, the Manchester Gazette. When a reporter for the daily Times of London was arrested, Taylor was concerned that the people of the capital might not get an accurate report of the massacre – he correctly feared that without the account of a journalist on the scene, Londoners would instead get only the official version of events, which would protect the magistrates who had caused the bloodshed.
So Taylor rushed a report on to the night coach to London, got it into the Times, and thus turned a Manchester demonstration into a national scandal. Taylor exposed the facts, without hysteria. By reporting what he had witnessed, he told the stories of the powerless, and held the powerful to account.
But Taylor did not stop there. After the massacre, he spent months reporting on the fate of the wounded, documenting the injuries of more than 400 survivors.
On 16 August 1819, a crowd of more than 50,000 gathered at St Peter's Fields outside Manchester to demand the reform of parliamentary representation. 
Magistrates ordered the Manchester Yeomanry to disperse the demonstration and the sabre-wielding cavalry charged the crowd. At least 15 people died and up to 700 were injured. 
​Labelled Peterloo as an ironic nod to the battle of Waterloo, which had occurred four years earlier, the massacre sparked an outcry that was a key contributing factor in the establishment of the Manchester Guardian.
John Edward Taylor, ​a radical Quaker cotton merchant who did unpaid journalism for the Manchester Gazette, was at St Peter's Field on the day of the slaughter.
When the reporter from the London Times was arrested, Taylor and a friend sent an account of the killings to the paper to make sure the truth wasn’t smothered by the official version. This was published along with an angry editorial based on the reporting.
Peterloo and its aftermath confirmed to Taylor that reformers in Manchester needed their own voice. Two years later, and with the financial backing of 11 supporters, a prospectus for a new paper, the Manchester Guardian, was issued, stating: “It will zealously enforce the principles of civil and religious Liberty … It will warmly advocate the cause of Reform.” The first edition of the paper was published on 5 May 1821. 
Taylor’s relentless effort to tell the full story of Peterloo strengthened his own reformist political views – and he became determined to agitate for fair representation in parliament. He decided to start his own newspaper, the Manchester Guardian, with the financial backing of other middle-class radicals (10 put up £100 each, and an 11th contributed £50). The first edition was published on 5 May 1821, devoted to enlightenment values, liberty, reform and justice. It was launched with great confidence and optimism, by a man who believed that, “in spite of Peterloo and police spies, reason was great and would prevail”.
The Manchester Guardian was founded in a mood of great hope, and faith in ordinary people. The manifesto that Taylor produced before the paper’s launch speaks powerfully of the “great diffusion of Education” that was taking place, and “the greatly increased interest which political subjects excite, and the immense extension of the circle within which they are discussed. It is of the utmost importance that this increased interest should be turned to beneficial account”.
It is a powerful document, and one whose ideals still shape the Guardian – a celebration of more people getting educated, of more people engaging in politics, from different walks of life, from poorer communities. And it is a document that articulates a sense of responsibility to the public – that the Manchester Guardian could engage with the people who were starting to become involved in politics, giving them the information they need to take action. It is a wholly uncynical and unsnobbish document. It is on people’s side.
In the decades following Taylor’s death in 1844, the Manchester Guardian began to drift from the political ideals that had inspired its founding. It was highly profitable, but in becoming so it got too close to the Manchester cotton merchants who paid for the advertising that supported the paper. It even sided with the slave-owning south in the American civil war: the paper demanded that the Manchester cotton workers who starved in the streets because they refused to touch cotton picked by American slaves should be forced back into work. (Abraham Lincoln wrote to the “working men of Manchester” in 1863 to thank them for their “sublime Christian heroism, which has not been surpassed in any age or in any country”.)
This period of complacency for the Guardian was dramatically ended by the appointment as editor of CP Scott, who transformed the paper and helped establish the political commitments that have been so important to its identity ever since.
Scott was made editor in 1872, at the age of 25. He was a radical Liberal and party activist who cared greatly about social justice and pacifism. Scott faced two big ideological challenges during the 57 years of his editorship; and his response to both helped form the Guardian as it is today.
The first was the question of Irish Home Rule: on the most contentious issue of the time, which split the Liberal party in the 1880s, Scott campaigned for self-government in Ireland – marking the moment, according to the historian David Ayerst, when the Guardian most clearly became “a paper of the Left”. At the end of the 19th century, Scott took the Guardian to an even more controversial anti-colonial position. During the second Boer war, from 1899 to 1902, Britain was rampantly jingoistic; anyone who opposed the war was cast as a traitor. The Guardian stood against it and ran a campaign for peace, while the brilliant Guardian reporter Emily Hobhouse exposed the concentration camps for the Boers run by the British.
The paper’s stance was so controversial that it lost advertisers and one-seventh of its sales. One rival paper, confident that the Guardian was on the verge of collapse, sent a brass band to stand outside our offices in Cross Street, Manchester to play Handel’s mournful Dead March from Saul.
Scott’s courageous position nearly did kill the Guardian. But in standing up to the prevailing political mood of the day, Scott turned the newspaper into “the dominant expression of radical thinking among educated men and women”, as Ayerst wrote. “Clearly this was a paper that could not be bought.”
As Scott orientated the paper towards a more radical position – away from laissez-faire liberalism to what was known as “New Liberalism”, concerned with social justice and welfare – he set the Guardian on the progressive path it has maintained, with a few missteps, ever since.
One of those missteps came in 1948. Surprising as it may seem today, the Manchester Guardian disparaged the foundation of Britain’s National Health Service. While supporting the changes as a “great step forward”, the Guardian feared that the state providing welfare “risks an increase in the proportion of the less gifted”. Three years later, the paper went further and backed the Conservatives at the 1951 general election. (Historians believe that these decisions came about because the editor at the time, AP Wadsworth, loathed Nye Bevan, the passionate Labour politician behind the welfare state.)
Making sense of a political moment when you’re in the midst of it is difficult – even if you avoid commercial and personal conflicts, it can still be hard to see it and understand it. A news organisation might often get things wrong – it needs some core values and principles to stick to in order to try to get it right.
In April, a prospectus announces a new paper for Manchester. A month later, on 5 May 1821, John Edward Taylor publishes the first Manchester Guardian as a newspaper in the liberal interest. 
Charles Prestwich Scott, a liberal thinker with strong principles, becomes editor of the Guardian - a post he holds for 57 years.
CP Scott buys the Guardian, becoming both owner and editor.
CP Scott writes a leading article to mark the centenary of the paper that becomes recognised around the world as the blueprint for independent journalism and includes the line “Comment is free, but facts are sacred.”
CP Scott retires as editor in favour of his son Ted.
CP Scott’s death in January is followed swiftly by that of his younger son; Ted Scott is killed in a tragic boating accident in April. William Percival Crozier is appointed as editor.
Ownership of the Manchester Guardian is transferred to the Scott Trust to protect the paper, its independence and the journalistic principles of CP Scott.
Following  WP Crozier’s death, Alfred Powell Wadsworth becomes editor.
Alastair Hetherington becomes editor following Wadsworth’s death.

-
Many of these core values were laid out by Scott on the 100th birthday of the Guardian, with his justly celebrated centenary essay of 1921. It was here that Scott introduced the famous phrase “comment is free, but facts are sacred”, and decreed that “the voice of opponents no less than that of friends has a right to be heard”. It was here that he laid out the values of the Guardian: honesty, cleanness [integrity], courage, fairness, a sense of duty to the reader and a sense of duty to the community.
CP Scott’s essay, like John Edward Taylor’s foundational prospectus, is both powerful and hopeful; as Scott writes, “the newspaper has a moral as well as a material existence”.
Our moral conviction, as exemplified by Taylor and codified by Scott, rests on a faith that people long to understand the world they’re in, and to create a better one. We believe in the value of the public sphere; that there is such a thing as the public interest, and the common good; that we are all of equal worth; that the world should be free and fair.
These inspiring ideas have always been at the heart of the Guardian at its best – whether the paper is called the Manchester Guardian or the Guardian, the name it adopted in 1959 – and they are enshrined in our independent ownership structure, in which the Guardian is owned solely by the Scott Trust. Any money made must be spent on journalism. (The Observer, of course, has its own distinct and honourable history and perspective – and as part of the same company, we are close siblings, but not twins.)
This is the mission that has motivated so many of the great moments in Guardian history, from our independent reporting of the Spanish civil war to the dramatic Edward Snowden revelations; from taking an anti-colonial position in the Suez crisis to standing up to Rupert Murdoch, the police and politicians in the phone-hacking scandal; from sending Jonathan Aitken to jail to the Panama and Paradise Papers.
These values, beliefs and ideas are well-established and enduring. They do not, by themselves, tell us how to meet the moral urgency of this new era. The world we knew has been pulled out of shape, and we must ask what it means to uphold these values now – as journalists and as citizens – and how they will inform our journalism and purpose.
Almost 200 years have passed since the public meeting that sparked Peterloo. But the past three decades – since the invention of the world wide web in 1989 – have transformed our idea of the public in ways that John Edward Taylor and CP Scott could not have imagined.
This technological revolution was exciting and inspiring. After 600 years of the Gutenberg era, when mass communication was dominated by established and hierarchical sources of information, the web felt like a breath of fresh air: open, creative, egalitarian. As its creator, Tim Berners-Lee, put it, “this is for everyone”. At first, it felt like the beginning of a thrilling new era of hyper-connectivity, with all the world’s knowledge at our fingertips and every person empowered to participate – as if the internet was one big town square where all our problems could be solved and everyone helped each other.
While many news organisations saw the internet as a threat to the old hierarchies of authority, forward-looking editors like Alan Rusbridger, who led the Guardian from 1995 until 2015, embraced this hopeful new future for journalism, by investing in digital expansion – hiring engineers and product managers – and by understanding that journalists, in this new world, must be open to challenge and debate from their audience. From making the Guardian the first British news organisation to employ a readers’ editor to launching an opinion site that inverted the traditional model of top-down newspaper commentary, he put the Guardian at the forefront of digital innovation and the changed relationships of this new era. As I wrote four years ago in my essay The Rise of the Reader, the open web created genuinely new possibilities for journalism – and journalists who resisted the technological revolution would damage both their own interests and the interests of good journalism.
But it has become clear that the utopian mood of the early 2000s did not anticipate all that technology would enable. Our digital town squares have become mobbed with bullies, misogynists and racists, who have brought a new kind of hysteria to public debate. Our movements and feelings are constantly monitored, because surveillance is the business model of the digital age. Facebook has become the richest and most powerful publisher in history by replacing editors with algorithms – shattering the public square into millions of personalised news feeds, shifting entire societies away from the open terrain of genuine debate and argument, while they make billions from our valued attention.
This shift presents big challenges for liberal democracy. But it presents particular problems for journalism.
The transition from print to digital did not initially change the basic business model for many news organisations – that is, selling advertisements to fund the journalism delivered to readers. For a time, it seemed that the potentially vast scale of an online audience might compensate for the decline in print readers and advertisers. But this business model is currently collapsing, as Facebook and Google swallow digital advertising; as a result, the digital journalism produced by many news organisations has become less and less meaningful.
Publishers that are funded by algorithmic ads are locked in a race to the bottom in pursuit of any audience they can find – desperately binge-publishing without checking facts, pushing out the most shrill and most extreme stories to boost clicks. But even this huge scale can no longer secure enough revenue.
On some sites, journalists who learned in training that “news is something that someone, somewhere doesn’t want published” churn out 10 commodified stories a day without making a phone call. “Where once we had propaganda, press releases, journalism, and advertising,” the academic Emily Bell has written, “we now have ‘content’.” Readers are overwhelmed: bewildered by the quantity of “news” they see every day, nagged by intrusive pop-up ads, confused by what is real and what is fake, and confronted with an experience that is neither useful nor enjoyable.
Many people get most of their news from Facebook, which means that information arrives in one big stream – which may contain fact-based independent journalism from transparent sources alongside invented stories from a click farm, or content funded by malevolent actors to influence an election. The Richmond Standard, a website in California’s Bay Area, describes itself as a “community-driven daily news source”. If you see one of its headlines in your news feed, you couldn’t possibly know that it is owned by the multinational oil giant Chevron – which, according to the Financial Times, also owns “the Richmond refinery that in August 2012 caught fire, spewing plumes of black smoke over the city and sending more than 15,000 residents to hospital for medical help”. Such arrangements are no longer remarkable: the Australian Football League employs about 30 journalists to write friendly stories. Many free local newspapers in the UK are funded by the very councils they should be holding to account. It is asking a lot of individuals to sift the real from the fake when they are bombarded by information – how do they know who to trust?
Trust in all kinds of established institutions – including the media – is at an historic low. This is not a blip, and it should not be a surprise, when so many institutions have failed the people who trusted them and responded to criticism with contempt. As a result, people feel outraged but powerless – nothing they do seems to stop these things happening, and nobody seems to be listening to their stories.
This has created a crisis for public life, and particularly for the press, which risks becoming wholly part of the same establishment that the public no longer trusts. At a moment when people are losing faith in their ability to participate in politics and make themselves heard, the media can play a critical role in reversing that sense of alienation.
“If mistrust in institutions is changing how people participate in civics, news organisations might need to change as well,” the MIT professor Ethan Zuckerman has argued. “We could rethink our role as journalists as helping people … find the places where they, individually and collectively, can be the most effective and powerful.”
To do this well, journalists must work to earn the trust of those they aim to serve. And we must make ourselves more representative of the societies we aim to represent. Members of the media are increasingly drawn from the same, privileged sector of society: this problem has actually worsened in recent decades. According to the government’s 2012 report on social mobility in the UK, while most professions are still “dominated by a social elite”, journalism lags behind medicine, politics and even law in opening its doors to people from less well-off backgrounds. “Indeed,” the report concludes, “journalism has had a greater shift towards social exclusivity than any other profession.”
This matters because people from exclusive, homogenous backgrounds are unlikely to know anyone adversely affected by the crises of our era, or to spend time in the places where they are happening. Media organisations staffed largely by people from narrow backgrounds are less likely to recognise the issues that people notice in their communities every day as “news”; the discussions inside such organisations will inevitably be shaped by the shared privilege of the participants.
After 71 people died in the devastating Grenfell Tower fire in west London – which residents had forewarned for years – the Channel 4 News presenter Jon Snow said that the failure to attend to these warnings showed that the media was “comfortably with the elite, with little awareness, contact or connection with those not of the elite.” As Gary Younge, the Guardian editor-at-large, has put it: “‘They’ are not ‘us’ – ‘their’ views are not often heard in newsrooms, and they know it.”
If journalists become distant from other people’s lives, they miss the story, and people don’t trust them. The Guardian is not at all exempt from these challenges, and our staff is not diverse enough. Because of our history, values and purpose, we are committed to addressing these issues – but there is still a long way to go.
Meanwhile, those in power have exploited distrust of the media to actively undermine the role of journalism in the public interest in a democracy – from Donald Trump calling the “fake news” media “the enemy of the American people” to a British cabinet member suggesting that broadcasters should be “patriotic” in their Brexit reporting. All over the world – in Turkey, Russia, Poland, Egypt, China, Hungary, Malta and many other countries – powerful interests are on the march against free speech. Journalists are undermined, attacked, even murdered.
In these disorientating times, championing the public interest – which has always been at the heart of the Guardian’s mission – has become an urgent necessity. People are understandably anxious in the face of crises that are global, national, local and personal. At the global level, these crises are overwhelming: climate change, the refugee crisis, the rise of a powerful super-rich who bestride the global economy. It is easy to feel that humanity is facing a great shift, about which we were not consulted. Overwhelming technological, environmental, political and social change has precipitated what the philosopher Timothy Morton memorably describes as “a traumatic loss of co-ordinates” for all of us.
These global upheavals have plainly destabilised national politics, producing the shocks and surprises of the past two years: the unexpected result of the Brexit referendum, which leaves Britain facing a deeply uncertain future; the stunning election of Donald Trump; the collapse of support for traditional parties across Europe, and the unexpected rise of Emmanuel Macron. These events confounded the experts and the insiders who confidently declared them impossible. In the UK, Jeremy Corbyn appeared to have torn up the rulebook that had governed electoral politics for two decades – finding a surge of support in the June snap election, particularly with young people, by promoting socialist ideas that had long been dismissed. Bernie Sanders tapped into a similar mood in the US Democratic primary.
Skyrocketing inequality between the rich and poor has bred resentment at the political and economic establishment. In October it was revealed that the world’s super-rich now hold the greatest concentration of wealth for 120 years – many of them taking elaborate steps to avoid tax in the process, as the Paradise Papers showed.
What is becoming clear is that the way things have been run is unsustainable. We are at a turning point in which, in writer Naomi Klein’s words, “the spell of neoliberalism has been broken, crushed under the weight of lived experience and a mountain of evidence”. (Klein defines neoliberalism as “shorthand for an economic project that vilifies the public sphere”.) Perhaps the markets don’t have all the answers after all. The Financial Times columnist Martin Wolf, who says that many had not understood how “radical the implications” of worsening inequality would be, suggests that the political backlash to globalisation could possibly produce a “fundamental transformation of the world – at least as significant as the one that brought about the first world war and the Russian revolution.”
In many local areas, in our neighbourhoods and our communities, we see the collapse of civic life, from public space sold off cheaply to developers to the closing of libraries to the underfunding of schools and hospitals. It is not hard to imagine what has produced the growing tide of resentment that has shaken our politics. It is painful to see the rich getting away with it in the big cities while you’re struggling in your small town. Older people lament the loss of community life; younger people are unlikely to be able to find a good job or afford somewhere decent to live.
All of these dislocations have led to another set of crises at a personal level. This year, the World Health Organisation announced that cases of depression had ballooned in the past decade, making it the leading cause of disability worldwide. Loneliness is now being recognised as an epidemic throughout the west.
Our lives are increasingly atomised, but you can see the pleasure that comes from communal or civic participation. People long to help each other, to be together, to share experiences, to be part of a community, to influence the powers that control their lives. But in everyday life, such togetherness is hard to achieve: workplaces in the era of the gig economy no longer offer a solid place to gather; religion has declined; technology means that we often communicate via screens rather than face-to-face.
This is a dangerous moment: these are fertile grounds for authoritarianism and fascistic movements, and it’s no surprise that people feel anxious and confused. The desire to belong can just as easily find a home in dark places; new ways of participating can just as easily be used to foster hate.
But it is the presence of all these crises that recalls AJP Taylor’s remark that Peterloo “began the breakup of the old order” – and I cannot help wondering if this is another such moment. After the fever of Peterloo, amid mass demands for the vote, the Manchester Guardian caught the mood of the people, and found a way to respond – not to deny what was happening or minimise it, but to acknowledge it, contextualise it, analyse it, try to understand it, to “turn it to beneficial account”.
The urgent question now, then, is how the Guardian should do that today.
One response to this crisis is despair and escapism: to bury our heads in our phones, or watch some dystopian TV. Another is to declare that the whole system is broken, and everything must be torn down – a view whose popularity may partly explain our recent political tremors.
But despair is just another form of denial. People long to feel hopeful again – and young people, especially, yearn to feel the hope that previous generations once had.
Hope does not mean naively denying reality, as Rebecca Solnit explains in her inspiring book Hope in the Dark. “Hope is an embrace of the unknown and the unknowable, an alternative to the certainty of both optimists and pessimists,” Solnit writes. It’s a belief that actions have meaning and that what we do matters. “Authentic hope,” she says, “requires clarity and imagination.”
Hope, above all, is a faith in our capacity to act together to make change. To do this, we need to be bold. “Not everything that is faced can be changed,” James Baldwin wrote in 1962. “But nothing can be changed until it is faced.” We need to accept the limits of the old kind of power, and work out what the new kinds will be. We need to be engaged with the world, uncynical, unsnobbish, on people’s side: just like the 1821 manifesto that established the Guardian.
Because people are not powerless to change things, and they are finding ways to act – new ways to get involved, to be citizens – it’s just that it might not be the kind of civic action that we’re used to. It might be American football players taking a knee to protest against police violence; it might be the people of Iceland, swarming around their parliament building banging pots and pans to bring down the government that bungled their country’s financial crash. It might be university students demanding divestment from fossil fuels, or the spread of small-scale renewable energy projects across the developing world. It might be digital activists building powerful new encryption tools in the wake of the Snowden revelations. This kind of action might not look like politics as we know it – but it’s politics all the same. These are new forms of engagement and participation, new ways to be an engaged citizen.
If people long to understand the world, then news organisations must provide them with clarity: facts they can trust, information that they need, reported and written and edited with care and precision.
If people long to create a better world, then we must use our platform to nurture imagination – hopeful ideas, fresh alternatives, belief that the way things are isn’t the way things need to be. We cannot merely criticise the status quo; we must also explore the new ideas that might displace it. We must build hope.
To do this, the Guardian will embrace as wide a range of progressive perspectives as possible. We will support policies and ideas, but we will not give uncritical backing to parties or individuals. We will also engage with and publish voices from the right. In an age of tumultuous change, nobody has a monopoly on good ideas.
But our guiding focus, especially in countries such as Britain, the US and Australia, will be to challenge the economic assumptions of the past three decades, which have extended market values such as competition and self-interest far beyond their natural sphere and seized the public realm. We will explore other principles and avenues through which to organise society for the common good.
In doing this, we want nuance and knowledge, surprises and context and history, because power and influence might not reside where they used to; as identities change, the political assumptions of the recent past should not dictate our perspective on the present. We should be guided by curiosity, not certainty. We like experts, but that’s not enough; we must also ask why more people don’t.
This kind of journalism, which champions the public interest, requires a deep understanding of the changes taking place, so we will continually find the best ways to listen to people, even – perhaps especially – those who don’t read us. This is why it is essential that we have a staff that is representative of the society to which we all belong. We need to ensure our journalists will find and hear different stories, have different instincts, gain different insights, make different connections, give voice to the silenced, cover areas and topics that are neglected – in other words, make our journalism better.
We do this by taking people seriously and treating our subjects, sources and readers with respect. Our relationship with our readers is not transactional: it is about sharing a sense of purpose and a commitment to understand and illuminate our times.
Supporting the Guardian – via subscriptions, contributions or membership – is only one way to participate in our mission. We are inviting our readers to be part of a community, whether that means reading and listening to and watching and sharing our work, or responding to it, or by sending us anonymous information or participating in a reporting project. We will also collaborate with news organisations – and others – who are doing work in the public interest.
We must embrace the new ways that people are engaging in the world, not long for a lost past when the ballot box and a handful of powerful media was the end of the story. As Ethan Zuckerman says, “if news organisations can help make citizens feel powerful, like they can make effective civic change, they’ll develop a strength and loyalty they’ve not felt in years”.
The Guardian is now funded more by our readers than by our advertisers. This is not only a new business model. It is an opportunity to focus on what readers value in Guardian journalism: serious reporting that takes time and effort, carefully uncovers the facts, holds the powerful to account, and interrogates ideas and arguments – work that speaks to the urgency of the moment, but lasts for more than a day. Being funded by our readers means we must focus on the stories that are most meaningful. It also means that we must spend money carefully, trying to produce – as one writer described CP Scott’s ambition for the Guardian a century ago – “a great paper without any of the airs of a great paper”.
Of course, in a serious age, the appetite for thoughtful, clever features beyond the news is possibly greater than ever. Our readers want to be nourished – by meaningful journalism about technology, economics, science, the arts – not fattened up with junk. They want useful, enjoyable reporting on how we live now, spotting trends, catching the mood, understanding what people are talking about – life-affirming, inspiring, challenging. We can be fun, and we must be funny, but it must always have a point, laughing with our audience, never at them. Their attention is not a commodity to be exploited and sold.
We will give people the facts, because they want and need information they can trust, and we will stick to the facts. We will find things out, reveal new information and challenge the powerful. This is the foundation of what we do. As trust in the media declines in a combustible political moment, people around the world come to the Guardian in greater numbers than ever before, because they know us to be rigorous and fair. If we once emphasised the revolutionary idea that “comment is free”, today our priority is to ensure that “facts are sacred”. Our ownership structure means we are entirely independent and free from political and commercial influence. Only our values will determine the stories we choose to cover – relentlessly and courageously.
We will ask the questions that people are asking, and the questions that no one is asking. Honest reporters approach every situation with humility: they find the people who don’t get listened to and really listen to them. They get to know a place. We will get out of the big cities and the big institutions, and stay with stories for the long-term. Our commentary must also be based in facts, but we will keep a clear distinction between news and opinion.
We will provide a worthwhile space in which to read, watch, listen to and debate the issues of the day. We will be at the forefront of emerging new technologies, and will embrace those that truly benefit Guardian journalism and our readers’ experience of it. We must be proud of everything with the Guardian’s logo on it. Rather than overwhelming readers with stuff we demand they consume, we will edit for a meaningful experience. In print and in digital, we will be explanatory, visual, keepable. In recent years, the trend has been to prioritise the platforms on which journalism appears. We must now prioritise the reason for that journalism.
More than 800,000 people now help fund the Guardian, because they think what we do is important – and there are millions more who read us every day. This is inspiring, and it shows us a path towards a secure future for our journalism. We want to make sure that generations to come can read the Guardian, and that requires making our finances sustainable.
For now, we cannot predict where this political moment will lead, or what changes await. There is much about the future that we do not know.
But we do know that there are serious questions that must be answered today, and that the Guardian is well placed to do this: because of our unique independent ownership; because of our high-quality journalism, rooted in the facts; because of our progressive perspective; and because our readers believe, as we do, that Guardian journalism should have the biggest possible impact and try to change the world for the better.
To steal Rainer Maria Rilke’s phrase, we must “live the questions now”: constantly examining our assumptions, our biases, how the world is changing, what it means. To do this, we will follow five principles: we will develop ideas that help improve the world, not just critique it; we will collaborate with readers, and others, to have greater impact; we will diversify, to have richer reporting from a representative newsroom; we will be meaningful in all of our work; and, underpinning it all, we will report fairly on people as well as power and find things out.
This is a challenge: a challenge for us at the Guardian to grab these principles, develop them and use them in all we do; a challenge to Guardian readers, to engage with us, support us if you believe in us, participate, advocate; and a challenge to all media organisations, to find ways to face this moment.
In the two-and-a-half years since I became editor-in-chief, we have experienced a huge number of political and social shocks, a dramatic undermining of the business model for serious journalism, and what many believe is an unprecedented level of disruption to our planet, our nation states, our communities, ourselves. It is a searching time to be an editor, a journalist and a citizen – but also a privilege to be grappling with these questions, with a possibility of helping to turn this era into something better, to turn this moment to “beneficial account”, as our founding manifesto proclaimed. And to do what has been the mission of the Guardian since 1821: to use clarity and imagination to build hope.
• More than 800,000 readers now help fund the Guardian. Join them.

The changes in the Arctic and the forces that brought it about are likely to have a huge knock on effect for life on this planet and its climate.

It is likely that it is ocean temperature which controls Antarctic Ice Sheet mass (57m sea level rise equivalent of ice).
It's -50 degrees C on parts of Antarctica, warm it up to -45 and big deal. But it is at the melting point at the coast where the floating and thinning ice shelves provide less and less friction constraining ice sheet flow.
An increase of just 1 degree C destroyed the ice shelf constraining the flow of the Jakobshavn Isbræ Glacier on Greenland and according to the glaciologist Richard Alley such an increase is a big insult to an ice shelf almost anywhere on the planet.
The Antarctic Peninsula has lost 8-10 ice shelves over the last 25-30 years.

There are parts of the system that could already be out of our hands. And those parts are related to the ocean. Because we know that we’ve already put a lot of heat content into the ocean. 
And in the case of the Antarctic Ice Sheet, regarding the marine based ice which is very sensitive to ocean temperatures—West Antarctica 3.3m, East Antarctica 19m—we may end up being committed to some response of the ice sheet to the heat that has already gone into the ocean. And Greenland has around 3m worth of marine based ice as well.

Well below 2 °C: Mitigation strategies for avoiding dangerous to catastrophic climate changesThe historic Paris Agreement calls for limiting global temperature rise to “well below 2 °C.” Because of uncertainties in emission scenarios, climate, and carbon cycle feedback, we interpret the Paris Agreement in terms of three climate risk categories and bring in considerations of low-probability (5%) high-impact (LPHI) warming in addition to the central (∼50% probability) value. The current risk category of dangerous warming is extended to more categories, which are defined by us here as follows: >1.5 °C as dangerous; >3 °C as catastrophic; and >5 °C as unknown, implying beyond catastrophic, including existential threats. With unchecked emissions, the central warming can reach the dangerous level within three decades, with the LPHI warming becoming catastrophic by 2050. We outline a three-lever strategy to limit the central warming below the dangerous level and the LPHI below the catastrophic level, both in the near term (<2050) and in the long term (2100): the carbon neutral (CN) lever to achieve zero net emissions of CO2, the super pollutant (SP) lever to mitigate short-lived climate pollutants, and the carbon extraction and sequestration (CES) lever to thin the atmospheric CO2 blanket. Pulling on both CN and SP levers and bending the emissions curve by 2020 can keep the central warming below dangerous levels. To limit the LPHI warming below dangerous levels, the CES lever must be pulled as well to extract as much as 1 trillion tons of CO2 before 2100 to both limit the preindustrial to 2100 cumulative net CO2 emissions to 2.2 trillion tons and bend the warming curve to a cooling trend.http://www.pnas.org/content/114/39/10315.abstract', u'recommendation_count': u'12', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1511114235000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'13496713', u'in_reply_to': u'108457896', u'id': u'108458140', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'kent31', u'text': u'So tell me why reduced coverage of marine ice sheets is catastrophic?

Care to comment on Hansens testimony to the hearing by the Environmental Pollution Subcommittee in 1986: 
Average global temperatures would rise by one-half a degree to one degree Fahrenheit from 1990 to 2000 if current trends are unchanged, according to Dr. Hansen's findings. Dr. Hansen said the global temperature would rise by another 2 to 4 degrees in the following decade
BQEND
Hansen was misquoted. What he actually said (see p. 88 here) was:
BQSTART
The warming in Scenario A at most mid-latitude Northern Hemisphere land areas such as the United States is typically 0.5 to 1.0 degree C (1-3 F degrees) for the decade 1990-2000 and 1-2 degree C (2-4 F degrees) for the decade 2010-2020.
BQEND
Error 1: Hansen was referring to mid-latitude Northern Hemisphere land warming, not global (the Northern Hemisphere is warming faster than the Southern, and land is warming faster than the oceans).
Error 2: 2010-2020 is not the decade that follows 1990-2000!
Hansen also stated the estimates were subject to several caveats:
- in his scenario A, CO2 emissions continued to grow at then-current rates (they haven't)
- if climate sensitivity is lower than 4.2C (recent research suggests it probably is), the warming would be less
- other climate forcings could counteract the greenhouse warming (this appears to have happened to some extent, due to an unusually quiet Sun and higher volcanic activity)', u'recommendation_count': u'6', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1511070544000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'an unusually quiet sun and higher volcanic activity', u'effect': u'this appears to have happened to some extent'}], u'author_id': u'15902664', u'in_reply_to': u'108426779', u'id': u'108435835', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'nanning', u'text': u'BQSTART

The range of uncertainty for the warming along the current emissions path is wide enough to encompass massively disruptive consequences to societies and ecosystems: as global temperatures rise, there is a real risk, however small, that one or more critical parts of the Earth’s climate system will experience abrupt, unpredictable and potentially irreversible changes.

It was the German state's decision to close nuclear plants and consequently open an average of one new coal plant per since deciding to do so (6 so far, another seeking permission to start next year)As to safety, coal burning in Europe kills 22,000 people a year - just in Europe..Nuclear kills nobody. Not one.Fukushima, an old design in a severe Earthquake zone killed no one.If you want to sue the USSR for feeding children contaminated milk following an accident at a type of reactor that only they used and does not exist anymore then go ahead, but of the 4,600 the WHO and UNSCEAR modelled could be the final death toll of Chernobyl, fewer than 80 people died and it was >40 years ago.How many people died from your precious coal in those 40 years?
BQSTART
How is Germany doing with alternatives though? Solar and Wind energies abound and continue to spread
BQENDWell yes -all balanced with new coal plants.
Renewables are great, they definitely are p[art of the solution. - I'm a big fan - but they don't work 24/7, hence the new coal plants replacing the nuclear ones which is why German emissions have not fallen for 16 years.
Do you acknowledge that it is the emissions that count?
 United Nations and World Health Authority ""While the doses were very small, the UNSCEAR 2016 Report found that the coal cycle contributed more than half of the total radiation dose to the global public from electricity generation. The nuclear fuel cycle contributed less than a fifth of this. “These results should be seen from the perspective of the share of each technology in worldwide electricity production; 40 per cent of the world’s energywas produced by the coal cycle in 2010, which is the baseline year for the assessment, compared with 13 per cent by nuclear,” said Hans Vanmarcke, Chair, UNSCEAR, on the release of the UNSCEAR 2016 Report. “Of the remaining technologies, the combustion of natural gas and geothermal were important contributors to global public exposure,” he added.

From a New Yorker article by the Pulitzer-Prize winning author Elizabeth Kolbert about James Hansen:
BQSTART
From early on, the significance of Hansen’s insights was recognized by the scientific community. “The work that he did in the seventies, eighties, and nineties was absolutely groundbreaking,” Spencer Weart, a physicist turned historian who has studied the efforts to understand climate change, told me. He added, “It does help to be right.” 
“I have a whole folder in my drawer labelled ‘Canonical Papers, ’ Michael Oppenheimer, a climate scientist at Princeton, said. “About half of them are Jim’s.”

Former Nasa scientist James Hansen says the litigate-to-mitigate campaign is needed alongside political mobilisation because judges are less likely than politicians to be in the pocket of oil, coal and gas companies.
“The judiciary is the branch of government in the US and other countries that is relatively free of bribery. And bribery is exactly what is going on,” he told the Guardian on the sidelines of the UN climate talks in Bonn.
Without Hansen and his fellow Nasa researchers who raised the alarm about the effect of carbon emissions on global temperatures in the 1980s, it is possible that none of the thousands of delegates from almost 200 countries would be here.
But after three decades, he has been largely pushed to the fringes. Organisers have declined his request to speak directly to the delegates about what he sees as a threat that is still massively underestimated.
Instead he spreads his message through press conferences and interviews, where he cuts a distinctive figure as an old testament-style prophet in an Indiana Jones hat.
He does not mince his words. The international process of the Paris accord, he says, is “eyewash” because it fails to put a higher price on carbon. National legislation, he feels, is almost certainly doomed to fail because governments are too beholden to powerful lobbyists. Even supposedly pioneering states like California, which have a carbon cap-and-trade system, are making things worse, he said, because “half-arsed, half-baked plans only delay a solution.”
For Hansen, the key is to make the 100 big “carbon majors” – corporations like ExxonMobil, BP and Shell that are, by one account, responsible for more than 70% of emissions – pay for the transition to cleaner energy and greater forests. Until governments make them do so by introducing carbon fees or taxes, he says, the best way to hold them to account and generate funds is to sue them for the damage they are doing to the climate, those affected and future generations.
Hansen is putting his words into action. He is involved in a 2015 lawsuit against the US federal government, brought by his granddaughter and 20 others under the age of 21. They argue the government’s failure to curb CO2 emissions has violated the youngest generation’s constitutional rights to life, liberty, and property. 
A district court is due to hear the case in February in Oregon, though the federal government has tried to delay the case.
Hansen believes Donald Trump’s actions to reverse environmental protections and withdraw from the Paris accord may be a blessing in disguise because the government will now find it harder to persuade judges that it is acting in the public interest.
“Trump’s policy may backfire on him,” he said. “In the greater scheme of things, it might just make it easier to win our lawsuit.” 
He feels a growing sense of urgency. Current government commitments are so inadequate that temperature rises are currently on course to exceed 3C by the end of the century. Hansen says that would mean existing problems – rising sea levels, displacement by flooding, droughts disrupting food production, wildfires consuming forests, worsening storms and hurricanes – would get three times worse.
“Three degrees would be disastrous. You can imagine the planet becoming ungovernable because we would lose the coastal cities where most people live … You’ll see migrants from those parts of the world and also so much disruption to the centres of wealth. So we can’t go down that path.”
Hansen is a believer in direct action. “I’ve been arrested five times. The idea was to draw attention to injustice,” he says. He has also testified on behalf of others who have lost their liberty during climate campaigns. On January, he will speak in defence of an activist who turned off the tar sands pipeline in North Dakota.
But he says litigation and political mobilisation are more effective than protests.
“Those are defence. We should be on the offensive. The lawsuits versus Trump and the fossil fuel industry are offence. People should use the democratic process,” he says. “That’s our best chance. It’s better than getting arrested.”
He draws comparisons with two other great, slow-moving, but ultimately successful legal and public opinion battles: against segregation, where the innate conservatism of judges was overcome by the civil rights movement, and tobacco, where the courts accepted the science despite a misinformation campaign by the industry.
“Climate change is a human rights issue,” Hansen says. “We are seeing injustice against the young. The present generation has a responsibility to future generations.”
Worldwide, the number of legislative activities related to climate change has increased from 99 to 164 in the past two years, according to a report earlier this year by the Grantham Research Institute and the Columbia Law School. Their study found that two-thirds of the litigation resulted in stronger regulations.
The vast majority of cases have been heard in the US, most notably the 2007 supreme court ruling that greenhouse gases are a public health threat. To support future actions, some legal experts are volunteering their services, such as the Earth Justice group in San Francisco, whose motto is: “The Earth needs a lawyer”.
There have been sporadic successes elsewhere, including a lawsuit by a group of Dutch citizens who overturned their government’s move to weaken its greenhouse gas reduction target. 
“Over the past 10 years courts are becoming more flexible,” said Cosmin Corendea, legal expert the at United Nations University Institute for Environment. “These isolated cases have started to flash up. It shows the willingness of courts to serve people.”
Corendea echoed Hansen’s call for more climate litigation in the countries that have highest emissions. “Go out there if you have the resources to do that and see if you can help other countries that can’t get to the courts so easily,” he said. “Any good litigation may help. It can raise awareness and create legal practice.”
According to Hansen, the action cannot come too soon. In a press conference at the climate conference, which is the first under the presidency of a small island state – Fiji – he noted that the risks are rising and so should the push for justice.
“We are entering a period of consequences and are in danger of being too late,” he warned. “I have come to note that greenhouse gas climate forcings are accelerating, not decelerating, and sea-level rise and ocean acidification are accelerating. We confront a mortal threat, now endangering the very existence of island and low-lying nations in the Pacific and around the planet. Accordingly, ambition must be increased and enforced.” ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/17/we-should-be-on-the-offensive-james-hansen-calls-for-wave-of-climate-lawsuits

Sadly, your explanation merely reinforces the Warmists' arbitrary leap of logic from stating that a process exists, to claiming that that process has caused various real world outcomes.
There is no empirical evidence that the greenhouse effect has been exacerbated to any measurable degree by the activities of Mankind, let alone that it has caused or will cause catastrophic global warming.
And there is no empirical evidence that the greenhouse effect is limitless, as Warmists assume. If the greenhouse effect didn't self-regulate, then none of us would be here to discuss it.
It's funny how newspapers, such as this one, continue to peddle the 97% claim, despite the fact that they know that there is absolutely nothing supporting it bar a couple of very poorly designed opinion polls that rely on self-reporting, and alleged meta-studies that were designed and manipulated to manufacture support for a political result.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1511183280000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'that process', u'effect': u'various real world outcomes'}, {u'cause': u'it', u'effect': u'catastrophic global warming'}, {u'cause': u'it', u'effect': None}], u'author_id': u'18332140', u'in_reply_to': u'108480165', u'id': u'108495903', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'TTauriStellarbody', u'text': u'BQSTART

We've already seen conflicts and migration linked to drought with the little bit of warming to date in places like Syria and Africa.
BQENDThis is very controversial and mixing such poorly sourced controversial claims muddies the waters with the much stronger set of claims we can make about climate change.
BQSTART
This article provides a systematic interrogation of these claims, and finds little merit to them. Amongst other things it shows that there is no clear and reliable evidence that anthropogenic climate change was a factor in Syria’s pre-civil war drought; that this drought did not cause anywhere near the scale of migration that is often alleged; and that there exists no solid evidence that drought migration pressures in Syria contributed to civil war onset. The Syria case, the article finds, does not support ‘threat multiplier’ views of the impacts of climate change; to the contrary, we conclude, policymakers, commentators and scholars alike should exercise far greater caution when drawing such linkages or when securitising climate change.

The greenhouse effect is simply a process and it exists to different degrees, like, say, saving money. e.g. Just because it's possible to save money, that doesn't mean that someone has all the world's money.
BQENDI think you are very confused and this analogy is very weak. What is widely described in the literature and supported by paleoclimate over many scales is that CO2s impact on the temperature is broadly logarithmic, that is sometimes described that each doubling of CO2 has the same effect on temperature.
For example in IPCC Third Assessment Report this is given as Radiative Forcing is equal to 5.35 time ln (C/C0) that is the natural log of the CO2 concentration divided by the original concentration.
When one matches CO2 changes in the past with changes in solar output the same pattern broadly emerges,
Royer 2004 is a very good source for this. 

BQSTART
Also, the greenhouse effect caused by CO2 is self limiting, since it it causes other effects, such as the growth of more plants that eat CO2.
BQENDThe greenhouse effect causes radiative forcing, that is changes in the downwelling IR. This would happen on a planet with no vegetation.
The increased consumption of atmospheric CO2 only slighly slows the rate at which additional CO2 is being accumulated in the atmosphere. When that additional CO2 is in the atmosphere it then increases the absorbtion of the upwelling component of the IR and thus the greenhouse effect.
BQSTART
The Earth has a long history of having massive CO2 levels, and all that's happened to life was that it adapted and often prospered because of the increase.
BQENDThis was often when the Suns output was significantly weaker. The heuristic is roughly 1% weaker per 100 million years though this is very rough. Stars increase in their energy output as they age along the Main Sequence.
Past warmer times included very different rain patters and much higher sea levels. We are not browsing herbivours who can wander a few hundred miles to better pasture. Our cities and farm lands cannot grow legs and walk.
BQSTART
Finally, CO2 is a trace gas in the atmosphere, so, even if it does increase -- as it has in the recent past -- by an enormous degree, there is no evidence that that would cause anything too horrible to to happen to people or to the planet.
BQEND""Horrible things happening to the planet"" does not read like anything I have ever read in any science text book.
Care to quote which text book you got it from?
The IPCC has said that the best evidence is that the climate sensitivity to CO2 is roughly 3C per doubling. We think that our best chance of limiting serious economic consequences from increasing the temperature of the ocean atmosphere system is broadly at 2C.
As you seem totally devoid of even the most simple grasp of the physics and are reduced to arguing against strawmen analogies that bear no resemblence to what text books and the IPCC says, this statement
BQSTART
There is simply no empirical evidence showing that any actual CO2 increase has caused any specific change to the climate.
BQENDmakes much more sense.

Senators blast tech companies over Russian meddling: ‘Do something about it — or we will’
The corporately controlled media has created this fantastic narrative that assumes Trump wouldn't have been elected if it wasn't for the Russians, so Feinstein is just using that story as an excuse to control the narrative of social media. It is more difficult for the media to distribute its lies and half truths when social media exposes the lies for what they are. Democracy Now is about as left wing as a media distribution can get. Amy Goodman is its anchor. You can hear in this video what she thought of the election as it was unfolding in 2016. Here she is again appearing on a panel

Democrats have been arguing for background checks, possibly restoring the ability to sue gun manufacturers when they market guns without regard to their safety or regard to the sanity or criminal record of the people they sell them to.
How does that ""punish everybody""??? Are you punished if the nutcase down the street who served time for felony assault, had restraining orders against him, and had been shooting at his neighbor's house wasn't able to buy 40 guns, 4000 rounds of ammo and shoot up your kid's school?
Are you punished if another whacko who espoused white supremacist B.S. and had a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic in her house was unable to stockpile 20 guns and a boatload of ammo?

“I can guarantee that, starting in 2018, the IPCC will have all the money it needs and will continue to support our decision-making,” he said. “It will not miss a single euro.” Obama pledged around $3 billion a year, is Macron preparing to fund that ot just the $1.8 million the IPCC costs?
Anyhow, he is going to cover the cost by slapping tariffs on US imports. The EU currently has a €114 billion (US $134 billion) trade surplus with the US and he is willing to jeopardize that to prove the point. I'm sure he sought approval for this from the other EU member states; particularly Germany.

We've already seen conflicts and migration linked to drought with the little bit of warming to date in places like Syria and Africa.
Farmers around the Bay of Bengal were driven by drought to fish the Bay and now fisheries there are collapsing and the migration from a population of hundreds of millions is beginning.
People in Madagascar have been reported to be reduced to eating ash and rocks as their crops have failed for several years now due to drought linked to global warming.
When climatic zones and rains cross borders now there will be people with guns on the other side who may not like those being forced to move. I believe India and perhaps one more country are now building walls to contain the population of Bangladesh which resides on the sinking Ganges River Delta. 
And half a billion people live on sinking river deltas while the protective deltas are eroding, sea level rise is accelerating and maximum storm strength may be increasing.

Something to think about as we further warm a planet where crops are already stressed by heat.
A population of a few million human hunter-gatherers was apparently beyond the carrying capacity of the planet as everywhere we showed up the megafauna disappeared.
Agriculture, which developed around 10-12,000 years ago when large climate oscillations settled down, allowed us to double our population many times into the billions.
But agriculture faces big challenges if we don’t change our ways soon (1), as do our fisheries, and if they both decline significantly, forcing us back to being largely hunter-gatherers, history tells us that out of every 1000 people you see maybe one survives.

There are no two way about that. The real hazard of coal burning is not CO2, rather it is SO2, NOx, and pm 2.5 particle effusion. PM 2.5 is killing millions each year, mostly in China and India. 
O.K. so we don't burn coal. What then? A Greenie will immediately say solar and wind generation. And sure enough they are lovely and clean. Unfortunately they are intermittent. Solar plants produces nothing at night and their output is diminished by clouds and storm. Wind slacks off. No windfarm today delivers more than 60% of its rated maximum output. Wind turbines must feathered if the wind velocity becomes too high. For home owners reliance on batteries might become feasible but for industry and heavy commerce the current battery technology is insufficient. Industry requires baseline power 7/24/365 and solar and wind cannot yet deliver and will not until significant advances in energy storage are made.
What to do? The only viable alternative is fission based electric power generation. Preferably we should push for thorium based reactors. We have enough thorium on earth for the next 100,000 years. In addition thorium fission does NOT produce plutonium or any other bomb grade fissile material. Waste disposal can be promoted using breeder reactors which will minimize the waste problem. Waste can be safely store in underground salt caverns in areas that are seismically stable. The new generation of reactors are design with passive gravitationally energize cooling systems, so no more Dai Ichi Fukishima. And high safety and management standards can be maintained so no more Chernobyl and Three Mile Island.

Why do you think Democrats are trying to take your freedoms?
BQEND
A mere one month elapsed between 911 and the so called Patriot Act. It happened under W so we can't excuse the GOP on that but according to what I remember doing my research, Biden already had this legislation ready when 911 happened. The left is always trying to impose gun control. The left is always trying to shut people up for the greater good. The left seems more than happy to trade security for freedom and that is why I think democrats are trying to take away freedom. I appreciate much of what the ACLU does, but the democrats have to take something in order to get financial support from corporations. Diane Feinstein basically told social media that if they don't control what people say on the internet, the government is going to control it for them. It is Orwellian.
Re: health insurance, if the democrats cared about people's health, they could have passed single payer. Instead they chose to force people to buy insurance. That could be a ""windfall"" for the insurance companies. Clearly a case of corporations controlling the masses through democrats. During the campaign, HRC threatened to do something about gun control once she became president if Congress failed to act. Because of the Brady Bill, she never had any 2nd amendment support to lose with that threat/promise but it got her some votes from those who would trade freedom for security. Democrats campaign as though we have to punish everybody because some people don't know how to act with a gun.
the left wants to violently stop hate speech on college campuses. Although I can see that, I don't condone it in any way shape or form. People have the right to voice their opinions.

This led to a breaking point in July 1911, when Congressman Charles August Lindbergh asserted that a banking trust existed within the United States and that it should be investigated.
If one talks about things of this nature, people will do one of two things:1. They will either do further investigation on their own or2. they will get dismissive and chalk it up to just another wacky conspiracy theory.
Too many are doing number 2 and the perpetrators get to continue their wrong doing. The US is a constitutional republic on paper, but a corporate oligarchy in reality.

No. What I am saying is that even though some democrats claim to support single payer, the democratic leadership is not on board. If you look into corruption, you'll find that money goes to the party leaders. If you want to know how the party will vote, watch Schumer and Pelosi because they are the ones who'll be accountable to the donors should the democrats pivot on this. The leaders tell the rest of the house how to vote. That is why they have whips. it is a follow the leader scenario if you want to stay in Congress for decades. Schumer tried to anoint Sanders (who isn't even a democrat), the party spokesmen so it will appear that the party really cares about progressive values.

The telltale ad hominem that indicates that you (rightly) have no faith in the actual merits of your argument.
BQENDI would like to remind all readers that these are not my arguments.
They are the physics you will find in textbooks.
I have a very limited knowledge of this physics. Something like radiative transfer in a gaseous medium is an entire subject in and of itself. As would cloud physics or the thermodynamics of oceanography.
If my arguments are bad then thats on me. If someone turns up and claims ""evolution is wrong"" and I cannot argue the case or my tone is not servile enough, this does not mean evolution by natural selection is some kind of fraud.
Not a week goes by when I do not try to learn something of the physics of the climate, the economics of the energy sector or refresh my maths skills. In my view this should be the sine qua non behaviour of someone who wishes to try to promote a controversial science, but very few people seem interested in expanding their knowledge, just pushing their very limited grasp as a complete picture.Its more about coming on here to shout abuse at the other side than enjoying the pleasure of learning new things. 
Thus our friends is trying to push the burden of ""proof"" onto others then take utterly irrelevant arguments about ""tone"" to dismiss physics it cannot understand.

Beyond the intricacies of the negotiations, here is one key thing to remember instead: about $1tn is already being invested in climate solutions, ranging from renewables and energy efficiency to public transport.
To put it simply: for those that act on climate now, the size of the economic prize will be immense. 
What is especially exciting is not just the unprecedented coming together of almost every single country in the world around the Paris Agreement, it is that others –cities, states, regions and businesses– are all stepping up to the challenge ahead.
Nearly 7,500 cities worldwide have already come together to promote and support climate action. They know that sustainable cities are successful cities. In fact, investing in low-carbon cities could be a $17tn opportunity worldwide by 2050, based on energy savings alone. 
We should be watching what actions cities will be announcing: in particular, efforts that enhance coordination between local and national governments, significant moves to capitalise on mobility innovations, and on promoting solutions that have already proven to work.
States and regions have also stepped up their efforts. In the US, for instance, a broad coalition of actors representing more than half the US economy, including a number of state governments, declared efforts on green infrastructure investments, renewable energy targets, and efforts to reduce carbon pollution. 
State action can also be key to drive efforts around carbon pricing. Today, 42 national and 25 sub-national jurisdictions are covered by carbon pricing initiatives that are either already in place or imminent: a fourfold increase over the past decade. This includes my own country, Mexico. 
Even in the US, despite the current administration’s step away from the Paris Agreement, more and more states are actively exploring carbon pricing, building on existing schemes in California and the north-eastern US. We should demand – and welcome – more efforts from state governments. 
Regional efforts, coordinating across national borders, to accelerate action on climate change are also gathering speed. Take for instance the International Solar Alliance launched two years ago at the Paris climate negotiations, bringing together more than 121 countries –most of them sunshine countries – to work together on solar energy, thereby reducing dependence on fossil fuels. 
Earlier this month, in record time, less than two years since its launch, it became a full-fledged international legal body. It is also the first such international intergovernmental treaty-based organization based in India, an important signal that developing countries are taking climate action seriously and will continue to do so.
Where business is concerned, it is good to remind ourselves of the role that they played in supporting – and in continuing to support – the Paris Agreement. What is the extent of the benefits for them? An estimated $12tn by 2030 in savings and revenues by pursuing sustainable, low-carbon business models. 
Now 300 companies representing $6.5tn in market value have set or committed to setting science-based climate targets, and more than 100 companies have committed to running their global operations with 100% renewable power. 
How does this work in practice? Take a leaf out of Unilever’s book: in 2010 it set out the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan, which is fully proving that there is no trade-off between sustainability and profitable growth, with these brands growing 30% faster than the rest of the company. I am confident that we will see more signals that businesses recognise the profitability of doing the right thing regarding climate.
Much has changed since the Paris Agreement was struck, and despite all the positive momentum the new political landscape is far from ideal. From those who are gathered in Bonn – representatives from businesses, states, cities, and civil society – not only do we need real leadership, we also need them to carve out a new vision for climate action in a politically divided world.
Acting on climate can certainly be driven by pure pragmatism: the economics of it are clear. However, I believe that when 195 countries held hands in Paris and committed to beat climate change together, it also went beyond self-interest. We did it because the poorest and most vulnerable among us don’t deserve to lose their lives and livelihoods to an increasingly hostile environment. 
We did it because we know that a more sustainable, prosperous and inclusive future is within our grasp. And we did it because leaving the world safer and healthier for our children’s children is simply the right thing to do.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/17/economic-prize-climate-change-action

The UN talks were tasked with the vital, if unglamorous, task of converting the unprecedented global agreement sealed in Paris in 2015 from a symbolic moment into a set of rules by which nations can combine to defeat global warming. Currently, the world is on track for at least 3C of global warming – a catastrophic outcome that would lead to severe impacts around the world.
The importance of the task was emphasised by Frank Bainimarama, Fiji’s prime minister and president of the summit: “We are not simply negotiating words on a page, but we are representing all our people and the places they call home.” 
The Paris rulebook, which must be finalised by the end of 2018, now has a skeleton: a set of headings relating to how action on emissions is reported and monitored. Nations have also fleshed this out with suggested detailed texts, but these are often contradictory and will need to be resolved next year. “The worst outcome would have been to end up with empty pages, but that is not going to happen,” said a German negotiator.
One issue that did flare up during talks was the action being taken by rich nations before the Paris deal kicks in in 2020. Developing nations argued not enough is being done and, with the UN climate negotiations running largely on trust, the issue became unexpectedly serious before being defused by commitments to a “stocktake” of action in 2018 and 2019. 
The final hours of the negotiations were held up by a technical row over climate funding from rich nations, always a sensitive topic. Poorer and vulnerable nations want donor countries to set out in advance how much they will provide and when, so recipient nations can plan their climate action. Rich nations claim they are not unwilling, but that making promises on behalf of future governments is legally complex.
Progress in raising the importance of gender, indigenous peoples and agriculture in tackling climate change was made. But NGOs criticised slow progress in delivering previous funding promises. Raijeli Nicole, from Oxfam, said: “For the most part, rich countries showed up to Bonn empty-handed.” 
Coal – the dirtiest fossil fuel – has had a high profile at the summit, with the US administration’s only official side-event controversially promoting “clean coal”. But the overwhelming momentum has been against the fuel, with a new coalition of countries pledging a complete phaseout. This happened outside the negotiations, a significant move, according to Camilla Born at thinktank E3G: “We have had the Paris agreement living in the real world.”
Poland, which is heavily dependent on coal, is hosting the next UN climate summit in a year’s time and has frequently held up climate action in the EU. But on Friday, apparently under heavy EU pressure, it ended its hold-out against passing a climate commitment called the Doha amendment which sets in law pre-2020 climate action. 
Germany, however, has been unable to commit to phasing out its huge coal industry, because Angela Merkel’s talks to form a new coalition have run over time. Nonetheless, Barbara Hendricks, the out-going German environment minister, said on Friday: “The phasing out of coal makes sense environmentally and economically.” She was certain the new government would act, she said.
US president Donald Trump’s decision to pull the US out of the Paris deal has had little impact at the talks, according to negotiators, who say US officials have been neutral and not blocked anything. Gebru Jember Endalew, the Ethiopian chair of the 47-strong Least Developed Countries negotiating bloc, said: “Unlike immigration, you cannot protect your country from climate change by building a wall.” Other big powers, such as China and India, have not used the US move to try to gain extra advantage but remain constructive players, insiders say.
Last minute hitches in closing the Bonn summit remain possible but are not expected by the delegates. Instead the attention now moves to 2018 and the tougher, final decisions that need to be made then.
Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, who as Peru’s environment minister ran the 2014 climate talks and is now at WWF, said: “The planet is at a crossroads. The decisions we make today set the foundation for 2018 and beyond. Countries must increase their ambition to put us on a path to a 1.5C future.”
“The Poland summit [in 2018] will be tough,” he said. “We expect to make progress, but it is not going to be easy.” 
Laurence Tubiana, France’s climate ambassador during the Paris deal and now at the European Climate Foundation, said: “There is no time to rest on our laurels, we are not on track. If we are serious about tackling climate change, everyone will need to step up and put forward ambitious climate commitments between now and 2020.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/17/planet-at-a-crossroads-climate-summit-makes-progress-but-leaves-much-to-do

But there remains a very long way to go before the world gets on track to avoid catastrophic levels of global warming.
There was little drama as the diplomatic sherpas trekked up the mountain of turning the political triumph of the 2015 Paris agreement into a technical reality, with a rulebook that would allow countries to start ramping up action. They got about as far as expected in turning the conceptual into the textual, but no further.
But that is not to say there were no star turns. Timoci Naulusala, a 12-year-old Fijian boy, gave a passionate yet nerveless account of the destruction of his village by Cyclone Winston in 2016 to the gathered heads of state and ministers. “Climate change is real, not a dream,” he said.
The French president, Emmanuel Macron, turned on the charisma and heartened the gathered nations with a pledge to replace the US funding dumped by Donald Trump for the UN’s climate science body.
The Trump administration, which wants the US to be the only country in the world not in the Paris deal, was the pantomime villain, but only succeeded in uniting the 195 other nations against it. The sole US event brought an executive from Peabody, the US coal company with a long history of funding climate denial, to argue for “clean coal”. A protest song and walkout from most of the audience followed and for the rest of the summit, the US delegation was irrelevant.
But the large coalition of US cities and states backing climate action – which as a group represents the third-largest economy in the world – stole the American show, with the California governor, Jerry Brown, popping up everywhere, pumping up the crowds.
The multi-nation pledge to phase out coal use was the political high point, but the dragging on of the coalition talks in Germany prevented Angela Merkel from potentially joining the party. The politics is key: UN climate talks run on consensus, with no votes, so trust and momentum are vital and were preserved in Bonn.
But the summit was like a dress rehearsal for next year, when the Paris rulebook has to be finalised and poorer and vulnerable nations will demand much more action and funding from the rich countries they blame for climate change. Further gatherings in Paris in December and California next year will also help prepare the stage for the 2018 UN climate summit.
That will be in Silesia, a heartland of Europe’s King Coal, Poland, which has already started feeling the international pressure to clean up its act. If that summit achieves its goals – accelerating carbon cuts – then the curtain will have been raised on the clean, green 21st century, against a backdrop of the mines and power plants of the 20th century.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/17/climate-summit-bonn-makes-slow-steady-progress-king-coal-looms

Andrew Adonis’s enthusiasm for the Oxford-Cambridge axis is only the latest chapter in a saga stretching back to Letchworth Garden City in Edwardian times.
Low-density greenfield development is highly profitable for developers and really good at increasing traffic and greenhouse gas emissions. It’s also proved good at dragging wealth out of places that desperately need it to regions which lack the housing to support population growth. Backing economic “winners” just perpetuates an endless spiral of housebuilding, roadbuilding and destruction of our precious farmland. It also exacerbates the dangerous divide between rich and poor regions.Jon ReedsSmart Growth UK
• John Hall, who thinks people use the benefit system to “stay where they were born, waiting for someone else to bring them a car factory, or reopen mines”, writes from Bristol (Letters, 14 November). I don’t know what new jobs there are in Bristol, but I do know that young people are moving there from London because of the capital’s house prices. As a result, Bristol house prices are now rising faster than London’s. Mr Hall may welcome that, until his own children have to move away – to where?
We learned a few years ago that one of Margaret Thatcher’s cabinet ministers had suggested that troublesome Liverpool should just be cut off, possibly to float away into the Irish sea. At the same time, Norman Tebbit famously said people in need of work should get on their bike to go and look for work. That seems to have been government policy for far too long: ignore the areas where industry is dead (or has been killed); allow areas to be depopulated and services withdrawn, while the south becomes overheated and unaffordable. Better attention over many years to the regional divide would have spared us Brexit. Judith MartinWinchester
• Now that research has been carried out on levels of productivity on a city-by-city basis and found, unsurprisingly, that the economy would be far larger “if all cities were as productive as those in the south-east”, is it not time to investigate earnings levels in a similar manner (Productivity study shows south-east miles ahead, 16 November)?
The fact that “growth in earnings” nationally is lagging well behind the inflation rate is well documented, but it would be interesting to see the changes in pay levels on a regional basis, and whether the most recent 2.2% increase in the July-September quarter would be replicated in all areas. Presumably this percentage rise is positively affected by pay levels in the City, as it is difficult to see levels rising nationally, even at 2.2%, when a pay freeze for state sector workers is in operation.
If as much had been invested by successive governments in education and infrastructure in all areas as it was in London, the UK’s productivity problem would be less significant. A sensible tax policy for the very rich would have prevented short-termism in business and encouraged CEOs to invest in technology and training, rather than to accumulate wealth for themselves and shareholders.Bernie EvansLiverpool
• The north has no monopoly in broken Britain. Cornwall is below Larry Elliott’s north-south divide from the Severn to the Wash. It is the second poorest region in northern Europe. Lithuania and Hungary are better off. Indicators show Cornwall is as badly served by the London elite as the north. Rural isolation will remain a problem when the south-west gets a £212-a-person spend on transport infrastructure, compared with London’s £1,943. Penzance is 110 miles from Exeter, but the high-speed train takes three hours. The line is severed every winter by floods. A quarter of Cornish children are below the poverty line.
Wages are low – 77% of the national median; in north Cornwall, 43% get less than the living wage. On average the Cornish just about manage on £14,300. House prices are 12 times the average wage. Homelessness and the rough sleeping count are both the third highest in the country; 22% have no formal qualifications. And it’s getting worse. There are 17 neighbourhoods among the 10% most deprived in the UK. That’s up from eight in 2010.
Larry Elliott is right. The north does needs investment and infrastructure. But after Brexit, the lights will go out in Cornwall if agricultural subsidies and EU money aren’t covered. There are still no guarantees, despite Boris’s promises before the referendum. If anywhere is in need of a new deal, it’s Cornwall.Philip KerridgeBodmin, Cornwall
• Dani Rodrik’s perceptive long read (The fatal flaw of neoliberalism: it’s bad economics, 14 November) reminds us that economics is always a half-truth, because the full subject is political-economy. Discussing economics without considering institutions, the natural environment and politics is like choosing a vehicle regardless of terrain or where you want to go. Economists need to be honest about the social purpose and political dimensions of their subject.Titus AlexanderDemocracy Matters
• There is no mention by Dani Rodrik of growth being incompatible with climatic normalisation. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, promises to include the risks of climate change in future economic forecasting (Labour vows to factor climate change risk into economic forecasts, 13 November), saying there needs to be “a transformation of our institutions and how our economies are run”, but omits to mention that climatic stabilisation can only be achieved through economic sustainability. It seems economists and politicians have yet to accept that we must re-evaluate our “cherished ideals” if we are to survive climate collapse.Geoff NaylorWinchester
• Didn’t people like Larry Elliott have this sort of vision of a northern rebirth soon after 15 September 2008? Oh, what a special time that was, sitting in the John Radcliffe hospital during my mum’s final week and reading how the financial crash would be a marvellous opportunity for the left.Andrew WilksLondon

""Anthropogenic and natural warming inferred from changes in Earth’s energy balance"" - Huber & Knutti 2011
BQSTART
We find that since the mid-twentieth century, greenhouse gases contributed 0.85 °C of warming (5–95% uncertainty: 0.6–1.1 °C), about half of which was offset by the cooling effects of aerosols, with a total observed change in global temperature of about 0.56 °C.

On the Possible Contribution of Natural Climatic Fluctuations to the Global Warming of the Last 135 Years

...... The results show that in frame of the selected mathematical model the return period of climatic events, analogous to the current global warming (linear increase of temperature for 0.95˚C during the last 135 years) is 2849-5180 years (one event per 2849-5180 years). This means that global warming (GW) of the last 135 years can unlikely be fully explained by inherent oscillations of the climatic system. It was found however, that natural fluctuations of climate may appreciably contribute to the GW. The return period of climatic episodes with 0.5˚C warming during the 135 years (half of the observed GW) was less than 500 years. The result testifies that the role of external factors (emission of greenhouse gases, solar activity etc.) in the GW could be less than often presumed.

Climate change science is accepted by every single professional scientific academy, in every country, and every field of science.
Physicists, geologists, chemists, astronomers, oceanographers, palaeontologists - all their professional bodies disagree with you.
The geological record tells us what happens when lots of CO2 is added to the air.
These events are marked in the geochemical record by negative carbon isotope excursions.
You could look up the end-Permian, the Toarcian, the PETM, and the ETM2, for example.
When igneous activity heated up coal seams in the end-Permian event, the extra CO2 produced by the process caused global warming and ocean acidification, and these led to extinctions.
There's an interesting recent paper on that
""Initial pulse of Siberian Traps sills as the trigger of the end-Permian mass extinction"" - Burgess et al, 2017.
Plus -
""Catastrophic dispersion of coal fly ash into oceans during the latest Permian extinction"" - Grasby et al, 2011.

The catastrophic impacts of altering the atmosphere impose an enormous cost on future generations that the current generation creates but has no incentive to fix. To focus the minds of today’s decision-makers the 2015 Paris agreement sent a clear signal that the era of fossil-fuel-powered growth was coming to an end. The signatories agreed to limit global warming to no more than a two-degree celsius rise, the threshold of safety, beyond which climate change is likely to become irreversible. The real genius of Paris is not that it is rooted in science but its timing and its structure. While the 2C target was binding, the national targets agreed by each nation were not. Those non-binding targets do not add up to a 2C world – they would, if followed to the letter, lead us to a 3C one, unthinkable in terms of the devastation it would cause. So upping them was part of the point of this year’s UN climate meeting in Bonn, which closed on Friday, and will be the main issue at next year’s, and the year after next.
The US under Donald Trump reneged on the deal before this year’s talks began. There is some solace in the fact that Washington cannot formally withdraw until 4 November 2020, the day after the next presidential election. The rest of the world, rightly, is moving on. Given what is at stake, it is worth pausing to consider where – and how quickly – the globe is going. Backwards – if one considers that China will almost single-handedly cause global emissions of carbon dioxide to grow in 2017. Canada and Britain, meanwhile, began a new 19-nation alliance in Bonn aimed at phasing out the use of coal power by 2030. This sounds like an important move until one realises that members of the “powering past coal alliance” account for less than 3% of coal use worldwide. Germany, which is not a member, held the climate talks an hour’s drive from a village that is being demolished to make way for a coalmine. These green talks, which are fundamentally about ethical concerns, are nevertheless becoming more like discussions about trade. In the case of climate change these involve transitions from one way of producing, distributing and consuming energy to another, cleaner way of doing so. It would be good if this could be seen only as a process of mutual support. However, as the talks in Bonn show, they are also hard-nosed negotiations which revolve around the exchange of concessions.
Such bargains can lead – once they are set in national plans – into the toxic politics of globalisation. Domestic politics is central to determining the way people live in a globalised world, and whether they like it. So an environmentally successful policy can end up politically dead if it is seen as unfair to the poor or disproportionately favourable to foreign industry, as happened with the Tory-led coalition’s support for low-carbon power.
If Brexit goes ahead, Britain will nevertheless need to shape a green politics with devolution and social justice at its core. Outside the European Union, Britain will be less able to ensure the Paris agreement is enacted. EU environment laws do not stand alone – the European court of justice polices their implementation. So there is an open question about how British measures to tackle climate change will be overseen. Ministerial self-regulation will not be an adequate substitute. Outside the EU – the world’s most powerful trading bloc – Britain will almost certainly have to obey rules without being able to influence them. Britons will suffer if we cannot fashion electric vehicle markets to suit our car industry, for instance. We are healthier and better off as a result of EU protections, safeguards that could be lost if they become bargaining chips in a future post-Brexit trade deal. In the 1990s Britain was seen as the dirty man of Europe. We are now the continent’s leading decarboniser. The retreat from the EU must not mean that a fairer, greener future disppears from the field of view.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/commentisfree/2017/nov/17/the-guardian-view-on-climate-talks-brexits-heavy-weather

We had made history when the Senate adopted legislation to implement an emissions trading scheme to address global warming. I was both exhausted and excited, having negotiated and shepherded the legislation through the senate for the Greens. It had been a long haul over many years.
Then an email landed in my inbox; after some preliminary congratulations, the writer and vice-chancellor of James Cook University, Sandra Harding, asked why I was wearing a polar bear badge in the newspaper photographs and not one representing an Australian animal.
I thought: “Oh for goodness’ sake, why can’t people just for once be pleased?” I decided to ignore it but then I checked out the sender and decided to reply. I wrote back pointing out that what I was wearing was an artwork, a brooch by Léa Stein, not a badge. I explained that I had deliberately chosen to wear the polar bear brooch for the debate because polar bears are the globally recognised symbol of global warming. They rely on the Arctic sea ice for hunting, breeding and travelling. With record temperatures in the Arctic, the ice is melting and retreating earlier in the spring and refreezing later in the autumn when eventually the temperatures drop. The changing pattern of ice habitat threatens their ability to feed, find a mate and raise cubs. There is nothing sadder than knowing that polar bears are drowning because of the loss of Arctic ice.
However, the critic of the polar bear brooch was not deterred. She told me she could produce a badge featuring an Australian white lemuroid ringtail possum, and that I should wear it to highlight the plight of tropical species far more endangered by global warming in the short term than polar bears. 
 I agreed to wear it at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Durban in 2011. The beautiful white lemuroid ringtail possum used to make up about 40% of the population of possums that live in the cool misty rainforest above 1100 metres on Mount Lewis in tropical north Queensland. It was featured in the campaigns to protect the Wet Tropics in the 1980s. Biologist William Laurance, distinguished research professor at James Cook University, wrote:
Much has been written about how global warming will affect the colder parts of the planet – the polar and boreal regions, glaciers, and alpine mountains. In fact, some of the warmest places on Earth, especially tropical rainforests, could also be intensely vulnerable to climate change … many people are unaware that tropical species – particularly those specialised for cool, cloudy mountaintops – are often sensitive to hot weather … as temperatures rise mountaintop specialists have nowhere to go. Their populations will wither and shrink and potentially disappear altogether.
While recognising the impacts of global warming on polar bears, he pointed out that creatures living near the poles have adapted to seasonal swings in temperature, whereas tropical zone species are thermal specialists adapted to a narrow stable temperature range. He added that tropical species endangered by global warming probably outnumber their polar counterparts by 1,000 to one.
He illustrated the point by referring to the mass death of a colony of giant fruit bats in New South Wales on 12 January 2002 when the temperature soared to 42.9C, eight degrees higher than the average summer maximum: 
The fruit bats normally just doze in the treetops through the day but on this afternoon they were fanning themselves, panting frantically, jostling for shady spots and licking their wrists in a desperate effort to cool down. Suddenly when the thermometer hit 42C the bats began falling from the trees. Most quickly died. The research team led by Justin Welbergen counted 1,453 dead from one colony alone.
The same thing happened in February 2014 when 45,500 fruit bats died in a single day as temperatures in Queensland rose to 42–44C. In December 2016 young bats started dropping out of trees in large numbers. The mothers had flown off, and the babies were not attached. They gradually dropped lower down the trees as they starved to death until they fell out. The causes were thought to be the El Niño weather pattern and loss of food and habitats as more land is cleared. 
Over the weekend of 14 February 2017 south-eastern Australia was the hottest place on the planet. The mercury hit 46C, and thousands of bats fell dead to the ground.
Steve Williams and his team, also of James Cook University, specialise in the study of the impacts of global warming on tropical wildlife. They concluded in 2009 that species extinctions will increase dramatically if temperatures rise more than two or three degrees and that most of the wildlife found only in North Queensland will be wiped out entirely if temperatures rise the four to six degrees that is projected in the absence of a global concerted effort to restrict the rise to less than two degrees. 
By 2016 Williams had observed that many endemic birds of the wet tropics are experiencing retracted ranges and have already moved uphill with only one degree of warming. He told me that the only other population of possums (Hemibelideus lemuroides) not on Mount Lewis has had to move higher up the Atherton Tablelands; at 1,000 metres you can find the animals but there are none in what used to be the lower part of its range below 700 metres. It is not a good sign for the diversity of life in the tropical forests. Once at the top of the mountain, there is nowhere else to go.
The white lemuroid possum was thought likely to be the first mammal globally to be driven to extinction solely by global warming, but that sad place has now been taken by a small rodent, the Bramble Cay melomys (Melomys rubicola), which lived only on a single low-lying island off the eastern Torres Strait. It was last seen in 2009. It is likely to have been driven to extinction by sea-level rise and ocean inundation, destroying its habitat and killing many individual animals.
The white lemuroid ringtail possum is not far behind. In late 2005 a severe heatwave hit the Mount Lewis region, coinciding with a failed wet season. Without misty cloud cover the possums could not withstand the heat and died. The survey conducted afterwards found only four possums, but since then there has been a very slow recovery. But with more extreme and more frequent heatwaves predicted as the world warms, it is only a matter of time before such an event coincides again with clear skies, and that will prove fatal for the white lemuroid possum on Mount Lewis.
Just how empty and silent the seas and those landscapes become depends on us
Having agreed to take the badges to Durban and feeling devastated by the realisation that the possums’ extinction was looking me in the face, I began wondering if Léa Stein would design a white lemuroid possum brooch, not just because it would be beautiful but for global distribution as a way of raising awareness of the fact that global warming combined with habitat loss from mining and logging, urban expansion, commercial agriculture and invasive species will send one-third of all species to extinction by 2050. Stop for a minute and take that in.
Though Sandra Harding had delivered a badge to commemorate this magnificent creature, I put to her the idea of a Léa Stein brooch and asked for her assistance in having the university prepare and translate into French the work of their researchers and provide a high-quality image so I could send them to Stein. I talked to Léa Stein’s agent in Australia, Bruna Harrison of Harlequin Jewellers in Sydney, and put the idea to her; she was enthusiastic. Bruna told me that Léa, now in her eighties, is a recluse but still produces two designs a year. She does not use computers and has to be approached in person, so Bruna agreed that if information and a photo could be provided, together with a letter from me, she would give them to Lea on her next buying trip to Paris. Léa told Bruna that she would consider it.
A year went by, and I had given up thinking that anything would come of the idea. Then I heard from Bruna, who had been in Paris and could report that Léa had been working on the design but was having trouble with the tail. Finally the brooch was completed, in six different variations of texture. Three hundred were made available for early release in Australia before the global release in 2015. We were all incredibly excited that our project was about to materialise, and were quite blown away when we saw the brooches for the first time – a badge had been transformed into a stylised and stylish artwork. The brooch was launched most appropriately at the Global Tropical Biodiversity Conference at James Cook University in Cairns in 2014.
I had been invited to deliver a keynote address there, and it seemed appropriate to bring together the Australian team who had made the brooch happen and the scientists on whose work we relied, and to celebrate as a group. It is a modern example of the age-old ways women work, in families, communities and life in general. This was a tale of four women: a French artist, a university vice-chancellor, a small business proprietor and an Australian Greens party leader, working together and combining our ideas, our skills, our nous and our networks to produce something beautiful, meaningful and multilayered.
When I wear that brooch, it is a statement that at the poles and in the tropics, our fellow species, which we have known and loved, are on their way to extinction. 
I have a granddaughter who will be 35 in 2050. According to modelling of business as usual provided by Sophie Lewis at the Australian National University, the global land temperature will have increased by just over three degrees from my birth to when my granddaughter turns 35. I grieve that she will know silent and empty places where polar bears, white lemuroid possums, orang­utans, elephants, giraffes and a myriad other species on land and in the oceans once lived. 
Although the Great Barrier Reef will already be dead, just how empty and silent the seas and those landscapes become depends on us. It is why I will never stop being a campaigner to address global warming, environmental degradation, overpopulation and over-consumption, and I will never stop standing up to the governments and corporations that continue to drive them.
We are living in the Anthropocene, a period in the Earth’s history in which we humans have altered all the systems that support life on Earth. We are destroying the habitat that we and our fellow creatures need to survive. We live on a finite planet, yet we behave as if an increasing global population can continue to consume the Earth’s resources from forests and fisheries to fossil fuels at an accelerating rate and nothing will change. When I was born in 1953, the global population was 2.5 billion; it is now over 7 billion, and by 2050 it is projected to be more than 9 billion. 
If everyone consumes at the current rate of those of us in the developed world, why would we think that anything other than a reduced number of humans will have a place to live? When you add to that the impact of invasive species and overlay it with global warming, changing the climate and threatening food and water security for everything from plankton, plants and insects to reptiles, birds, animals and humans, you cannot escape the fact that we are living in the sixth wave of extinction and destroying our own home.

For 30 years the American public has been warned that the world will end if we don't take immediate action. And so far those warnings have been met with a big yawn. I'm sure it's only a matter of time (maybe 30 more years of constant warnings and awareness campaigns about the 97%) before that public stops yawning and starts laughing. Those darned persnickety Americans just refuse to get all worked up and panicky about ""AGW.""

And if and when they see evidence of the problem, then and only then will it become a big enough concern for them to address it.

No, ""moanaflyer"" (not ""MarkBLR"" !) started this sub-thread when they posted :

Rather very interesting turn of events, that these Americans are now awaking to the horrors which now beset them going forward into the future. Curiously they are only doing so after having been constantly pounded by storm after storm of growing intensities.
BQEND
I summarised this as ""Curiously they [AMERICANS] are only doing so after having been constantly pounded by storm after storm of growing intensities."", and outlined my objections to that particular statement (I repeat, made by ""moanaflyer"" in their OP).
NB : While the count of ""Major (Category 3 or higher) hurricanes at the moment of CONUS landfall"" is a poor substitute for ""intensity"" (= ""maximum (sustained) wind speeds over the lifetime of the hurricane""), in the context of ""[AMERICANS being] constantly pounded by storm after storm of growing intensities"" it is a reasonable one to make (IMNSHO).

BQSTART
... and a 10 year time scale and now you claim that 20 years is too short ...
BQEND
It was ""Anthonyhu"" (again, not ""MarkBLR"" ...) who brought up the Yan et al (2017) paper about ""the decline of the Atlantic major hurricane frequency during 2005–2015"".
If you read MY ""long"" post above you will find that I extracted a subset of AOML / NOAA data from 1990 to 2016/7 (the current hurricane season isn't officially over yet), which corresponds to 27 or 28 years worth.
The only (?) ""10 year timescale"" in MY posts related to the update of Emanuel's PDI, where the ""training data"" up to 2003 used in his initial paper was checked against subsequent real-world measurements and found to ""diverge"" extremely rapidly.

I repeat the main ""conclusion"" from NOAA (GFDL) :
BQSTART
It is premature to conclude that human activities–and particularly greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming–have already had a detectable impact on Atlantic hurricane or global tropical cyclone activity. That said, human activities may have already caused changes that are not yet detectable due to the small magnitude of the changes or observational limitations, or are not yet confidently modeled (e.g., aerosol effects on regional climate).

Firstly, yes I did see the first time you posted this, and partially (if indirectly) covered it with my ""Nota Bene"" :
BQSTART
NB : The minimum (and default) ""integration time"" for something to be even considered as ""climate"" is 30 years (not ""months"").
BQEND
It doesn't matter how much something has ""increased over the last 20 years"", 20 < 30 therefore it's not about ""climate change"".
Secondly, linking to a page specifically about Atlantic hurricanes after banging on about ""global data"" is a bit rich, however ...
After hitting ""Figure 3"" on that page to bring up the graph, my first reaction was ""What the f... I mean what on Earth makes you think that graph shows that 'storm intensity is closely related to variations in sea surface temperature in the tropical Atlantic' ?!?"".
There is indeed a close correlation (from 1950) up to around 2004/5, but since then the PDI value fell (from a peak of 6 to just under 2, that's a factor of 3) ... while SSTs ""plateaued"" / oscillated around 83°F !
Note also that while the ""dataset"" is referenced as ""Emanuel, K.A. 2016 update to data originally published in: Emanuel, K.A. 2007. Environmental factors affecting tropical cyclone power dissipation. J. Climate 20(22):5497–5509."" if you go to Dr. Emanuel's own (MIT) website his ""Papers, Data, and Graphics Pertaining to Tropical Cyclone Trends and Variability ..."" page ends with ""... (Updated through 2009)"", which is extremely odd.

After asking the question ""Have humans already caused a detectable increase in Atlantic hurricane activity or global tropical cyclone activity?"" their first conclusion is :
BQSTART
It is premature to conclude that human activities–and particularly greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming–have already had a detectable impact on Atlantic hurricane or global tropical cyclone activity. That said, human activities may have already caused changes that are not yet detectable due to the small magnitude of the changes or observational limitations, or are not yet confidently modeled (e.g., aerosol effects on regional climate).

Hardly a ""ringing endorsement"" of your position, is it ?
NOAA (NCEI) Link
NB : NOAA is American, so the fact that this is limited to impacts on the North American continent is completely normal, but again contradicts your insistence on ""global data"" support for your position.

Peer reviewed studies
The Emanuel paper is from 2005, Elsner et al is from 2008, and the UCS ""flyer"" dates from 2006 and highlights the Webster et al paper from 2005.
The good news : I agree that Elsner et al (2008) is a good piece of ""supporting evidence"" for your (up to now) assertions.
I am unable to find any ""updated"" versions of their work, are you aware of any ?
The bad news : Emanuel's PDI has already been mentioned, unfavourably, above.
The abstract to Klotzbach & Landsea (2015), titled ""Extremely Intense Hurricanes: Revisiting Webster et al. (2005) after 10 Years"" (!), reads :
BQSTART
Ten years ago, Webster et al. documented a large and significant increase in both the number as well as the percentage of category 4 and 5 hurricanes for all global basins from 1970 to 2004, and this manuscript examines whether those trends have continued when including 10 additional years of data. In contrast to that study, as shown here, the global frequency of category 4 and 5 hurricanes has shown a small, insignificant downward trend while the percentage of category 4 and 5 hurricanes has shown a small, insignificant upward trend between 1990 and 2014. Accumulated cyclone energy globally has experienced a large and significant downward trend during the same period. The primary reason for the increase in category 4 and 5 hurricanes noted in observational datasets from 1970 to 2004 by Webster et al. is concluded to be due to observational improvements at the various global tropical cyclone warning centers, primarily in the first two decades of that study.

I believe you're referring ""Climate Scientists Virtually Unanimous:Anthropogenic Global Warming Is True"" Powell 2015 yes?
Powell's paper may as well be printed on toilet paper and used for you know what.
a) he leaves no definition for what 'AGW' means - so if someone believes 5% of global warming is AGW, then its a positive. If someone believes 95% of global warming is AGW, then that is a positive. (and guess what, even the most vehement skeptics like J.Curry fall into this bucket). Yet at the same time implies AGW as ""Given the threat that global warming poses to future genera-tions, possibly even to civilization itself, this is a vitalquestion"" in other words, a catastrophic outcome, yet this is never worded as a definition or applied to the criteria for judging other scientist's abstracts or beliefs for that matter.b) the consensus position put forth by Cook is ""greater than 50% of warming is man-made"", Powell does not use this criteria in any way to judge the abstractsc) Use of rejection as the criteria for consensus is flawed. AS ive mentioned before; much research goes into other aspects of climate unassociated with calculating or determining climate sensitivity - scientists specialise in various fields and this occurs within Climate Science too.. the AR5 outcomes would be an assumption used by many in the field (remembering the AR5 has quite a range of possible outcomes -for the TCR/ECS) but that doesnt prove or disprove that all/some/most or any of the scientists writing these papers actually endorse some quantified AGW amount (which isnt specified by Powell in his paper anyway?!!!.
In summary, Powell plays into the lack of definition about AGW - he generalises the term where it suits, and makes it specific when it suits: poor scientific writing and therefore a ridiculous article.""

CO2 (and CH4) are contributing about 110% (+/- 20%) of the warming we see. Other anthropogenic factors (aerosols, deforestation, etc.) are contributing less well-defined effects. When you add the uncertainties from all the anthropogenic forcings, it is harder to be certain that 100% of the heating is anthropogenic. At one unlikely extreme it could be +90% CO2, -30% misc other human activity, +40% natural. At the other unlikely extreme, it could be something like +130% CO2, -20% other anthropogenic, and -10% natural. Most likely it is about 110% CO2, -10% other anthropogenic, 0% natural.
To summarize, we are contributing AT LEAST 50% of the observed warming (90% from CO2 alone), and possibly more than all of it.
At any rate, we know for a fact that CO2 is contributing roughly all of the observed heating (this has been measured with relatively high precision), and we know that the sum of all other anthropogenic factors is about equal and opposite to the sum of all natural factors.

Using observations and a coupled earth system model (GFDL-ESM2G), here we show that the decline of the Atlantic major hurricane frequency during 2005–2015 is associated with a weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) inferred from ocean observations. Directly observed North Atlantic sulfate aerosol optical depth has not increased (but shows a modest decline) over this period, suggesting the decline of the Atlantic major hurricane frequency during 2005–2015 is not likely due to recent changes in anthropogenic sulfate aerosols. Instead, we find coherent multidecadal variations involving the inferred AMOC and Atlantic major hurricane frequency, along with indices of Atlantic Multidecadal Variability and inverted vertical wind shear. Our results provide evidence for an important role of the AMOC in the recent decline of Atlantic major hurricane frequency.

I believe you're referring ""Climate Scientists Virtually Unanimous: Anthropogenic Global Warming Is True"" Powell 2015 yes?
Powell's paper may as well be printed on toilet paper and used for you know what.
a) he leaves no definition for what 'AGW' means - so if someone believes 5% of global warming is AGW, then its a positive. If someone believes 95% of global warming is AGW, then that is a positive. (and guess what, even the most vehement skeptics like J.Curry fall into this bucket). Yet at the same time implies AGW as ""Given the threat that global warming poses to future genera-tions, possibly even to civilization itself, this is a vital question"" in other words, a catastrophic outcome, yet this is never worded as a definition or applied to the criteria for judging other scientist's abstracts or beliefs for that matter.b) the consensus position put forth by Cook is ""greater than 50% of warming is man-made"", Powell does not use this criteria in any way to judge the abstractsc) Use of rejection as the criteria for consensus is flawed. AS ive mentioned before; much research goes into other aspects of climate unassociated with calculating or determining climate sensitivity - scientists specialise in various fields and this occurs within Climate Science too.. the AR5 outcomes would be an assumption used by many in the field (remembering the AR5 has quite a range of possible outcomes -for the TCR/ECS) but that doesnt prove or disprove that all/some/most or any of the scientists writing these papers actually endorse some quantified AGW amount (which isnt specified by Powell in his paper anyway?!!!.

Interesting assertion, but in addition to not providing any links or references to whatever it is you were thinking of when you wrote your post you have failed to define your terms.
NB : My assumptions below will ""obviously"" be wrong, but in the absence of any alternatives they will have to suffice.Note also that ""CONUS"" = ""COntinental / COntinguous United States""
Assumptions1) ""Storm"" = ""(Atlantic) Hurricane""2) ""Increasing intensities"" = ""More 'Category 3+ / Major' counts > 0""3) ""Pounding Americans"" = ""Making landfall in CONUS / USA48""4) ""Constantly"" = ""Since 1990""
So, let's look at the actually empirical data (from AOML / NOAA) fitting these assumptions ...

Regarding ""a reason for optimism"", although we know that the momentum in Earth's climate means many changes for a long time, the fact is we could prevent much worse if we begin to treat this as the global emergency that it is.

Try reading this article that the Guardian published just today, which includes :
BQSTART
Even Rob and Dave had a huge range of predictions for that very high scenario – anything from 30 cm sea level fall to nearly two metres rise – and they originally described their model as ‘speculative’. So it’s not justified to use such strong, certain phrases as ‘the destruction would be unstoppable’.
BQEND
One reason why ""the (American) public"" remains so ""poorly informed"" (as Dana puts it) is that the media has a tendency to exaggerate the certainty of what the weather will be like in the year 2100, leading to enhanced levels of ""scepticism"" (or even ""skepticism"").
Your use of the word ""is"", as opposed to something like ""could be"" / ""may be"" / ""has the potential to be"" / ..., is unjustified.
""Rob and Dave's"" scientific paper's ""30cm fall to nearly 2m rise"" likely refers to the limits of the 95% (/ 90% ?) ""confidence interval"" of their model runs, which would mean that each of those values have equal probability of being reached (putting to one side just how ""speculative"" their model [parameterisation] actually is), i.e. 2.5% (/ 5%).
How many ""serious"" newspaper (/ magazine / blog) articles do you think will put a headline above their reporting along the lines of ""Scientists say sea-levels could FALL by 30cm (or more) this century"" ?

My response: From your link: ""The contributions from ice sheets include the contributions from ice-sheet rapid dynamical change” This is different than the previous version which excluded rapid ice sheet flow changes.
BQEND
One problem (or maybe that should be ""One advantage"" ? ...) of a report over 1500 pages long is that it tends to include ""something for everyone"" in it.
Checking chapter 13 of AR5 (IPCC, WG1, 2013) for ""ice-sheet rapid dynamical change” points to the captions for Figures 13.10 and 13.11, and Table 13.5 (pages 1180, 1181 and 1182 respectively).
All three of those captions include the disclaimer (at the bottom of the Table in the last case) :
BQSTART
Only the collapse of the marine-based sectors of the Antarctic ice sheet, if initiated, could cause GMSL to rise substantially above the likely range during the 21st century. This potential additional contribution cannot be precisely quantified but there is medium confidence that it would not exceed several tenths of a meter of sea level rise.
BQEND
Also note that section 13.4.4.3 (""Possible Irreversibility of Ice Loss from West Antarctica"", page 1174) ends with the following paragraph :
BQSTART
In summary, ice-dynamics theory, numerical simulations, and paleo records indicate that the existence of a marine-ice sheet instability associated with abrupt and irreversible ice loss from the Antarctic ice sheet is possible in response to climate forcing. However, theoretical considerations, current observations, numerical models, and paleo records currently do not allow a quantification of the timing of the onset of such an instability or of the magnitude of its multi-century contribution.
BQEND
So the IPCC both included ""straight numbers"" for ""ice-sheet rapid dynamical change"" and excluded precise ""quantification"" for ""Antarctic marine ice sheet instability"".

Only 54% understand that it’s mostly human-caused, while 33% incorrectly believe global warming is due mainly to natural factors. 
In fact, a new study published in Nature Scientific Reports developed a real-time global warming index. It shows that humans are responsible for 1°C global surface warming over the past 150 years – approximately 100% of the warming we’ve observed. Lead author Karsten Haustein explained their new index and study in a blog post.
Americans are nevertheless growing increasingly concerned about climate change. A record 22% are very worried about it (double the number in the March 2015 survey), and 63% of Americans are at least somewhat worried about climate change. That’s probably because they perceive direct climate impacts – 64% of survey participants think that global warming is affecting the weather, and 33% said it’s having a big influence.
Americans also connecting the dots to specific extreme weather events. About 54% said that climate change worsened the extreme heat waves, wildfires, and hurricanes that pummeled the country in 2017. 
They’re generally correct; in fact, a recent study by MIT climate scientist Kerry Emanuel found that global warming made the extreme precipitation associated with Hurricane Harvey (the largest rainfall of any US hurricane on record) more likely. Previously a 1-in-100 year event for Texas and 1-in-2000 year event for Houston, Harvey’s extreme precipitation has already become a 1-in-16 year event for Texas and a 1-in-325 year event for Houston – six times more likely due to human-caused global warming.
Overall, 42% of those surveyed believe that Americans are being harmed by global warming right now – an increase of 10% from the response in March 2015, and a record high in the survey that began in 2008. That increase is likely due to the beating America took from extreme heat waves, droughts, wildfires, hurricanes, and floods in 2017. It’s difficult to deny global warming when its effects are punching us in the face.
At the same time, only 15% of Americans realize that the expert consensus on human-caused global warming is over 90%. That’s an important result because the expert consensus is a ‘gateway belief.’ Research has shown that support for climate policy is linked to perceptions about scientific agreement on climate change.
The survey also found that Americans are very pessimistic about the odds that we’ll successfully tackle the threats posed by global warming. While 78% realize that humans could potentially slow global warming, only 5% of Americans believe we’ll be successful in doing so. A quarter of those surveyed think that we’ll fail because people are unwilling to change their behavior, and 48% said it’s unclear at this point whether we’ll take the necessary action. 
Given the current state of affairs in the Trump administration, that pessimism is certainly justified. However, there are still reasons for hope, especially since the climate-denying Republican Party is beginning to lose its grip on power.
It’s a positive sign that Americans are increasingly connecting the dots between climate change and extreme weather impacts. That realization increases public concern and support for efforts to solve the problem. Research has shown that support for climate policies would be even stronger if more people were aware of the 97% expert consensus on human-caused global warming.
While Americans are becoming pessimistic about the prospect that we’ll successfully prevent dangerous climate change, these survey results are a reason for optimism. It’s only a matter of time before the country’s leaders catch up with the public understanding of the climate change threat.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/nov/20/battered-by-extreme-weather-americans-are-more-worried-about-climate-change

The promise of economic growth is that the poor can live like the rich and the rich can live like the oligarchs. But already we are bursting through the physical limits of the planet that sustains us. Climate breakdown, soil loss, the collapse of habitats and species, the sea of plastic, insectageddon: all are driven by rising consumption. The promise of private luxury for everyone cannot be met: neither the physical nor the ecological space exists.
But growth must go on: this is everywhere the political imperative. And we must adjust our tastes accordingly. In the name of autonomy and choice, marketing uses the latest findings in neuroscience to break down our defences. Those who seek to resist must, like the Simple Lifers in Brave New World, be silenced – in this case by the media.
With every generation, the baseline of normalised consumption shifts. Thirty years ago, it was ridiculous to buy bottled water, where tap water is clean and abundant. Today, worldwide, we use a million plastic bottles a minute.
Every Friday is a Black Friday, every Christmas a more garish festival of destruction. Among the snow saunas, portable watermelon coolers and smartphones for dogs with which we are urged to fill our lives, my #extremecivilisation prize now goes to the PancakeBot: a 3D batter printer that allows you to eat the Mona Lisa, the Taj Mahal, or your dog’s bottom every morning. In practice, it will clog up your kitchen for a week until you decide you don’t have room for it. For junk like this, we’re trashing the living planet, and our own prospects of survival. Everything must go.
The ancillary promise is that, through green consumerism, we can reconcile perpetual growth with planetary survival. But a series of research papers reveal there is no significant difference between the ecological footprints of people who care and people who don’t. One recent article, published in the journal Environment and Behaviour, says those who identify themselves as conscious consumers use more energy and carbon than those who do not.
Why? Because environmental awareness tends to be higher among wealthy people. It is not attitudes that govern our impact on the planet but income. The richer we are, the bigger our footprint, regardless of our good intentions. Those who see themselves as green consumers, the research found, mainly focused on behaviours that had “relatively small benefits”.
I know people who recycle meticulously, measure the water in their kettles, then take their holidays in the Caribbean
I know people who recycle meticulously, save their plastic bags, carefully measure the water in their kettles, then take their holidays in the Caribbean, cancelling any environmental savings a hundredfold. I’ve come to believe that the recycling licences their long-haul flights. It persuades people they’ve gone green, enabling them to overlook their greater impacts.
None of this means that we should not try to reduce our footprint, but we should be aware of the limits of the exercise. Our behaviour within the system cannot change the outcomes of the system. It is the system itself that needs to change.
Research by Oxfam suggests that the world’s richest 1% (if your household has an income of £70,000 or more, this means you) produce about 175 times as much carbon as the poorest 10%. How, in a world in which everyone is supposed to aspire to high incomes, can we avoid turning the Earth, on which all prosperity depends, into a dust ball?
By decoupling, the economists tell us: detaching economic growth from our use of materials. So how well is this going? A paper in the journal Plos One finds that while, in some countries, relative decoupling has occurred, “no country has achieved absolute decoupling during the past 50 years”. What this means is that the amount of materials and energy associated with each increment of GDP might decline but, as growth outpaces efficiency, the total use of resources keeps rising. More important, the paper reveals that, in the long term, both absolute and relative decoupling from the use of essential resources is impossible, because of the physical limits of efficiency.
A global growth rate of 3% means that the size of the world economy doubles every 24 years. This is why environmental crises are accelerating at such a rate. Yet the plan is to ensure that it doubles and doubles again, and keeps doubling in perpetuity. In seeking to defend the living world from the maelstrom of destruction, we might believe we are fighting corporations and governments and the general foolishness of humankind. But they are all proxies for the real issue: perpetual growth on a planet that is not growing.
Those who justify this system insist that economic growth is essential for the relief of poverty. But a paper in the World Economic Review finds that the poorest 60% of the world’s people receive only 5% of the additional income generated by rising GDP. As a result, $111 (£84) of growth is required for every $1 reduction in poverty. This is why, on current trends, it would take 200 years to ensure that everyone receives $5 a day. By this point, average per capita income will have reached $1m a year, and the economy will be 175 times bigger than it is today. This is not a formula for poverty relief. It is a formula for the destruction of everything and everyone.
When you hear that something makes economic sense, this means it makes the opposite of common sense. Those sensible men and women who run the world’s treasuries and central banks, who see an indefinite rise in consumption as normal and necessary, are beserkers: smashing through the wonders of the living world, destroying the prosperity of future generations to sustain a set of figures that bear ever less relation to general welfare.
Green consumerism, material decoupling, sustainable growth: all are illusions, designed to justify an economic model that is driving us to catastrophe. The current system, based on private luxury and public squalor, will immiserate us all: under this model, luxury and deprivation are one beast with two heads.
We need a different system, rooted not in economic abstractions but in physical realities, that establish the parameters by which we judge its health. We need to build a world in which growth is unnecessary, a world of private sufficiency and public luxury. And we must do it before catastrophe forces our hand.

However, further budget backing for greener vehicles was limited to a small rise in vehicle excise duty for new diesel cars that fail to meet rigorous emissions standards – disappointing campaigners who had hoped for a rise in fuel duty or a diesel scrappage scheme.
The government will contribute £200m to a £400m fund to upgrade the electric car-charging infrastructure, as well as setting aside a further £40m for research and development into charging technology. The chancellor committed a further £100m to maintain a car-buying subsidy until 2020, which contributes up to £4,500 towards the cost of buying an electric vehicle. 
There are 115,000 electric cars in the UK and 13,000 charging points spread across 4,500 locations. 
Announcing the electric car funding, Philip Hammond said: “Our future vehicles will be driverless, but they’ll be electric first. And that’s a change that needs to come as soon as possible.”
Although moves on driverless cars had been widely trailed before the budget, the chancellor only made passing reference to the technology in his speech. However, the budget report confirms that the government will reform road laws to allow self-driving cars on UK roads by 2021.
Other measures in the budget to increase the take-up of next generation vehicles will include a commitment to make 25% of cars in central government department fleets electric by 2022, and to remove any tax for employees who recharge their vehicles at work. An innovation prize will also be launched by the National Infrastructure Commission to determine how roads should be built to support self-driving cars.
The Petrol Retailers Association – whose members may soon be forced by law to install charging points alongside pumps – said it hoped the £400m charging fund would be partly ringfenced for them, adding: “If the government insists on mandating EV charging equipment upon retailers, they must be prepared share some of the financial burden.”
Meanwhile, Hammond made limited moves to tackle diesel, saying the “tax system can play an important role in protecting our environment”. Diesel cars that have yet to pass on-the-road emissions tests will move to a higher tax band for vehicle excise duty. Along with a 1% rise in company car tax for diesel vehicles, the move would fund a £220m clean air fund, Hammond said. 
But documents published by the Treasury said carbuyers’ response to the policy change would be “negligible” – putting a one-off £20 on the cost of a new Ford Focus.
Some campaigners said it remained an important symbolic move. Dr Penny Woods, of the British Lung Foundation, said: “Increasing tax on new diesel cars sends a clear message that diesel is toxic.”
However, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: “The measures announced to clean up our polluted air are totally inadequate – and no action to introduce a desperately needed diesel scrappage fund.”
Hammond admitted he was averting negative headlines by not bringing in wider moves on diesel and continuing to freeze fuel duty. He said: “No white van man (or woman) will be hit by these measures.”

The new white paper, released on Thursday, contains warnings over the disruptive effects of climate change in Australia’s immediate region, noting that many small island states will be “severely affected in the long term”, and the coming decade will see increased need for disaster relief.
The white paper notes the demand for water and food will rise, with the world’s oceans and forests under intense pressure. It notes climate change and pressure on the environment could contribute to conflict and irregular migration, impacting specifically on Australia’s economic interests.
Despite the obvious challenges for Australia and the world posed by Donald Trump’s presidency, and a live debate in this country about whether Australia needs to rethink the American alliance, the white paper makes a strong case for the United States to remain engaged in the region to counterbalance China’s increasingly assertive posture.
It notes that the postwar alliance with the US “is central to Australia’s security and sits at the core of our strategic and defence planning”.
While the white paper makes the case that it is in Australia’s interests to pursue a cooperative relationship with China, it contains language critical of China’s military posturing. It characterises the disputes that have emerged in the South China Sea as “a major fault line in the regional order”.
“Australia is particularly concerned by the unprecedented pace and scale of China’s activities,” the paper says. “Australia opposes the use of disputed features and artificial structures in the South China Sea for military purposes.
“Elsewhere in the region, Australia is concerned about the potential for the use of force or coercion in the East China Sea and Taiwan Strait.”
With strategic tensions in the region on the rise, the white paper foreshadows a more activist Australian engagement with the democracies of the Indo-Pacific, meaning Japan, India, Indonesia and Korea – and more active support for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) countries, where China is attempting to assert diplomatic dominance.
It also underscores the “grave and growing” threat posed by North Korea, characterising the behaviour of the Pyongyang regime as the most immediate security challenge for the region – while referencing the ongoing global threat from terrorism and insurgencies. Australia has been active in countering Isis-linked militants in the southern Philippines.
The white paper also references the political challenges of the age, charting rising anti-globalisation and populist sentiment. “Doubts about openness has grown, as have concerns about the effect of globalisation, mainly immigration, on cultural identity and social cohesion”.
It notes that politics in some countries has become more fragmented and “volatile”, with nationalism and protectionist sentiment on the rise, with global governance and the rules-based order now contested.
It notes that a more inward-looking world is a world less likely to rise collectively to meet collective security challenges.
“We will be living in a more contested and competitive world,” the foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, said Thursday.
“Technological advances will disrupt the way we live and work and interact. There will be shifts in relative power between nations and the international rules-based order will continue to be challenged by some nations seeking short-term gain.”
She said Australia would step up support for “our neighbourhood, where we have distinct responsibilities” and resist the “false hope of protectionism and isolationism”.
In signalling a more activist role for Australia in the Indo-Pacific, the prime minister said that, in the past, “we could safely assume that the world worked in a way that suited Australia”.
“Now power is shifting and the rules and institutions are under challenge.”
Malcolm Turnbull said the world was experiencing unprecedented prosperity and opportunity “but the liberal, rules-based order that underpins it all is under greater stress than at any time since its creation in the 1940s”.
He noted that Australia had entered a period where its dominant security partner, the United States, was not its dominant trading partner, China. “We must see this as an opportunity, not as a risk,” he said.
The prime minister said the white paper provided “a framework for securing our own future, while sharing the burden of collective leadership with trusted partners and friends”.
Turnbull said Australia had no intention of degrading the postwar alliance with the US but the contemporary climate meant “pursuing our interests as much in San Francisco as in Shanghai, and always on our own terms”.
“Our alliance with the United States reflects a deep alignment of interests and values, while never being a straitjacket for Australian policymaking,” the prime minister said. “Our friendship and partnership with China enriches our economy and society, while not preventing us from vigorously advancing our own interests.”

BQSTART
Yes, but Greenland has gained over 500GT of ice (and this is at the end of the melt season), it's still gaining ice at way above the average rate.
BQEND
This is a misreading of the DMI article you cite, there is a gain in the Surface Mass Balance, but this figure does not account for calving losses.
Try reading your own evidence:

BQSTART
For an ice sheet that neither grows or shrinks, there is at all points averaged over the year a balance between 
 the amount of snow that falls and is compressed to ice the amount of snow and ice that melts or evaporates (sublimates) and the amount of ice that flows away due to the ice motion
The two first contributions make up the surface mass balance. For the ice sheet as a whole, there is a balance between the surface mass balance and the amount of ice that calves into the ocean as icebergs.If climate changes, the surface mass balance may change such that it no longer matches the calving and the ice sheet can start to gain or lose mass. This is important to keep track of, since such a mass loss will lead to global sea level rise. As mentioned, satellites measuring the ice sheet mass have observed a loss of around 200 Gt/year over the last decade. 
BQEND
-------------------------------------------

BQSTART
I'm not saying the hotspot study proves Global Warming isn't causing melting, but if the ice sheet is gaining ice (according to NASA) it's reasonable to assume that the volcano's under the ice sheet is causing some if not most of the melting, coincidentally the only areas that are melting are the areas above volcano's.
BQEND
Jumping to false conclusions is not remotely reasonable, your fanciful assumption is ignorant and wrong.
Once again, the evidence you cite directly contradicts your nonsense:

BQSTART
“If we are to predict with any certainty the future response of Antarctica in a warming world, scientists need to understand the role that heat from the Earth plays,” BAS Science Director and glaciologist David Vaughan said. “What we know is that over time, the heat flow into the ice is quite constant and so the ice sheet adjusts to it. The ice loss we’ve seen in recent decades is actually the result of changes in air and ocean temperatures. How the ice sheet will respond to these recent changes is influenced by the pattern of geothermal heat, and that’s why this new map is so important.”

Total pressure(entire weight of atmosphere pushing down, which delivers 198,550 newton force per square meter to the ground) raises the gas temperature by forcing an increase in the motion of the molecules,(temperature measures the average kinetic energy of molecules, kinetic energy is weight times the velocity of an object in joules) therefore bringing 99.9% of the atmosphere's gases to a liveable temperature. Trace gases like CO2 have a partial pressure and is not warmed up enough. Even with additional heat through solar radiation heating of the surface that produces infrared radiation that is absorbed/re-emitted. CO2 specific heat is lower than air so heats up quicker by 0.18C but cools quicker when that heat is taken away.

I was particularly concerned about some of the implied time scales and impacts. That ‘slowly burying every shoreline…creating hundreds of millions of climate refugees…could play out in a mere 20 to 50 years’ (it could begin then, but would take far longer). That ‘the full 11 feet’ could be unlocked by 2100 (Rob and Dave predicted the middle of next century). That cities will be ‘wiped off the map’ (we will adapt, because the costs of protecting coastlines are predicted to be far less than those of flooding). We absolutely should be concerned about climate risks, and reduce them. But black-and-white thinking and over-simplification don’t help with risk management, they hinder.

We need to quell exponential population growth - the taboo subject of our time, which will never be addressed due to encroaching on existing human rights.
BQEND
The population is not growing exponentially, in fact the population is stabilising. About a decade ago the number of children being born stopped increasing, a momentous milestone. There will be continuing growth in total population numbers for a couple of decades - due to demographic infill - and then the population will stabilise at around 11 billion. This is not a projection or prediction but an inevitably fact given the population statistics. Managing a population of 11 billion and delivering good life outcomes for all those people is easily within our capabilities.

But we have to take care not to talk about the apocalypse as if it were inevitable.
BQEND
 
Yes Stephen I agree, fear mongering should be ignored and has no place in science, it will always leave the door open to scientists being accused of being snake oil salesman. Talking about the apocalypse as if it's inevitable isn't helpful either, especially when the evidence is examined with an objective mind, for example the 2 greatest threats of sea level rise is melting ice in Antarctica and Greenland.
 
Take Greenland, ice growth has been well above average for nearly 2 years now. See- https://www.dmi.dk/en/groenland/maalinger/greenland-ice-sheet-surface-mass-budget/
 
Antarctica land ice has been gaining mass for decades, here's what NASA has to say on the subject.

I’ll admit my fascination is personal. In late 2015, Catherine Ritz and I co-led a study about the future of Antarctica, and our predictions – though definitely bad news – were far less dire. So what evidence do we have that the Antarctic ice sheet could, or would, collapse this century? 
First, it’s important to map out what is known. Yes, the Antarctic ice sheet is vulnerable to global warming. Not because it will melt in the warm air like an ice cube, but because the ice shelves around the coastlines act as bracing for the glaciers. When the surface of an ice shelf melts it can disintegrate, and the flow of ice into the oceans can speed up: we saw this for Larsen B in 2002. Our greenhouse gas emissions make this more likely. 
Yes, scientists have proposed that disintegration of ice shelves could trigger two types of ‘instability’ that may have caused the ‘marine’ parts of the Antarctic ice sheet (lying on bedrock below sea level) to drastically reduce in the past, raising sea levels by several metres. Confusingly, these are named ‘marine ice sheet instability’ and ‘marine ice cliff instability’. Broadly speaking, both are based around the idea that the thicker the edge of the ice sheet, the faster ice can be lost into the oceans. Both may be ‘positive feedbacks’: in other words, self-sustaining. The marine parts of the ice sheet are thicker in the middle than at the edges, so once these proposed instabilities started, they would keep going until they ran out of ice. As Eric says, this would be over three metres worth of sea level rise.
Yes, one instability may already be happening. In 2014, new evidence suggested marine ice sheet instability may be underway in the Amundsen Sea area, forty years after it was first predicted. But Eric is wrong to say Antarctica’s ‘ice budget’ has tipped out of balance due to our burning of fossil fuels. Not only has it been out of balance before – such as the ancient West Antarctic collapse that causes concern – but the reason for the Amundsen Sea changes, where most ice is being lost, is that the ring of deep warm water around Antarctica has welled up onto the continental shelf and is melting the ice from underneath. We don’t know if human activities made this more likely.
As far as I know, scientists agree the basic theory of marine ice cliff instability by Jeremy Bassis and Catherine Walker is sound (it’s a shame Catherine’s joint contribution to that key 2011 paper wasn’t mentioned). Ice is not strong enough to form a sheer cliff taller than about 100 m above the water line. And indeed, we don’t see any ice cliffs taller than this, which gives us indirect evidence their calculations are correct. We also have the recent study led by Matthew Wise of marks left by the keels of ancient icebergs, scraping along the bedrock like heavy ships, which point towards this kind of cliff collapse in the distant past.
But there is little consensus in the scientific community about how this ice cliff instability could behave. That’s because there is a big leap from identifying a potential problem and predicting the real world consequences. Iceberg scrape marks, though important, can’t tell us how soon, how fast, or for how long. Rob DeConto and Dave Pollard have been the first to put their heads above the parapet, but others may come to different conclusions. Ted Scambos mentioned ‘piles of icebergs’ acting as new ice shelves. Could cold freshwater from melted icebergs also slow things down? Could cliffs partially, instead of catastrophically, crumble? Would a model with finer detail predict fewer tall cliffs? Eric describes the collapse rate as conservative compared with Jakobshavn in Greenland, but this compares apples with oranges: the rapid ice losses from that great glacier are mostly due to its unusually fast speed, rather than the rate of retreat of the ice edge. 
Just as important is the initial trigger: how sensitive are the ice shelves to global warming? In Rob and Dave’s study, they disintegrated fast and early: predictions by others are less pessimistic. Eric compounds this by describing their highest scenario as ‘business as usual’, but it’s really business-worse-than-usual. Under current policies we’re headed for less warming than this scenario, and if national pledges under the Paris agreement are carried out this would decrease the warming more (though not meeting the two degree target).
Even Rob and Dave had a huge range of predictions for that very high scenario – anything from 30 cm sea level fall to nearly two metres rise – and they originally described their model as ‘speculative’. So it’s not justified to use such strong, certain phrases as ‘the destruction would be unstoppable’.
I was particularly concerned about some of the implied time scales and impacts. That ‘slowly burying every shoreline…creating hundreds of millions of climate refugees…could play out in a mere 20 to 50 years’ (it could begin then, but would take far longer). That ‘the full 11 feet’ could be unlocked by 2100 (Rob and Dave predicted the middle of next century). That cities will be ‘wiped off the map’ (we will adapt, because the costs of protecting coastlines are predicted to be far less than those of flooding). We absolutely should be concerned about climate risks, and reduce them. But black-and-white thinking and over-simplification don’t help with risk management, they hinder. 
Is “the entire scientific community [in] emergency mode”? We are cautious, and trying to learn more. Climate prediction is a strange game. It takes decades to test our predictions, so society must make decisions with the best evidence but always under uncertainty. I understand why a US-based climate scientist would feel particularly pessimistic. But we have to take care not to talk about the apocalypse as if it were inevitable.

The Treasury said it had taken the decision to “protect” consumers, because households and businesses were facing an annual cost of about £9bn on their energy bills to pay for wind, solar and nuclear subsidies to which it had already committed. 
The revelation that there will be no more money for projects before 2025 could dash hopes for pioneering projects such as the proposed £1.3bn tidal lagoon in Swansea, which has a mooted launch date of 2022.
In a Treasury document on carbon levies published on Wednesday, officials said: “On the basis of the current forecast, there will be no new low-carbon electricity levies until 2025.”
Environmental groups criticised the Treasury move. The WWF said it was a huge disappointment, while Greenpeace claimed Wednesday’s budget was one of the least green ever.
Business groups also reacted with dismay. The pro-environment Aldersgate Group, whose members include BT, Ikea and Marks &amp; Spencer, said the lack of clarity on low-carbon power investments was disappointing. 
James Court, head of policy at the Renewable Energy Association, said: “The UK government seem to be turning their back on renewables by announcing no new support for projects post-2020 and a freeze on carbon taxes.”
It is understood the policy will only affect projects generating electricity before 2025, so would not stop firms signing contracts for power stations coming online after 2025. That means the backers of new nuclear power stations are unlikely to be affected by the decision, because none was expected to be built by then. But it could be a blow for the companies wanting to build solar farms, onshore windfarms and other clean power plants at an earlier date.
Some industry figures took comfort from Treasury language suggesting that some contracts might be allowed for renewables if the price were so low as to be effectively subsidy-free. 
The government confirmed that it would honour an existing pledge to auction £557m of renewable energy subsidies, beginning next year. But most of that pot is expected to be taken by giant offshore windfarms, likely crowding out other technologies such as tidal.
John Sauven, chief executive of Greenpeace, said: “Despite the chancellor’s pride in the UK’s climate leadership, hidden away in the unannounced text of the budget, he quietly revealed this was one of the least green budgets ever because there will be no new money for renewables until at least 2025.”
Gareth Redmond-King, head of energy and climate at WWF, said: “It is a huge disappointment that there will be no new investment in UK renewables.”
The government also announced that until 2025 it was freezing a carbon tax on dirty energy generators. Big energy firms, including SSE, have been calling for the tax, the carbon price floor, to be strengthened to encourage new investment in greener energy.
Recent research by energy analysts suggested that without an increase in the tax, coal power plant owners would enjoy a last hurrah in the early 2020s before they hit a government deadline for the closure of all coal-fired stations by 2025.
One expert said the decision to freeze rather than increase the tax meant the UK’s climate change target for 2030 was being put at risk.
“It is disappointing that the Treasury is continuing its indefinite freeze of the carbon price support rate, a move that could endanger the achievement of the UK’s emissions target for 2030,” said Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment. 
He added that the current price of around £24.50 a tonne of CO2 was likely to be too weak to drive the energy market to shift from gas power stations to renewables and nuclear.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/22/no-subsidies-for-green-power-projects-before-2025-says-uk-treasury

This is especially true for such a distant proxy (migration of genetics as indication of ice-sheet behaviour). 
So this is not conclusive evidence. If they find a molecular ""clock-reset"" - a string of alternative hypothesis present themselves - including migrating ""around"". 
So this is more ""a piece in the puzzle"" research. 
Want to ""nail"" the question: Drill hundreds of holes to the bottom the bottom of the WAIS, that can retrieve basal sediments. 
Even if one drill and does not get sediments from MIS 5e (LIG) - this is not evidence either per se. As we know ice erodes, and the WAIS has been present for 120,000 years. But if one of 100 such drill-sites do show LIG marine sediments - not that becomes pretty hefty evidence. Because of the low probability of drilling through ice and find a pocket of ""surviving"" sediments. 
The cost of ice-core drilling obviously does not make such an approach possible, though.

This trend is due to both longer storm lifetimes and greater storm intensities."" So the Dr Emanuel paper of 2005 says that hurricane or tropical cyclone intensities have increased since the mid-70s up to the mid-00s but it does not say that their intensities will increase with more anthropogenic global greenhouse warming in the coming 30 years. As global greenhouse warming increased the intensity of cyclones and hurricanes in the past it's likely to increase their intensity in the future.

The West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) holds a lot of water – enough to push up sea levels around the world by 3m or so.
Even though this sort of melting would play out over century-long time scales, getting a handle on how much melting there would be, and how fast it could happen, are big questions with big consequences. 
Hundreds of millions of people living around coasts and cities around the globe might be interested in the answer, as would cartographers who would need to be redrawing maps of the world. 
Deep underneath the ice in west Antarctica is a break in the continental landmass – a seaway that links the Weddell Sea to the north with the Amundsen Sea to the south.
About 120,000 years ago, the Earth was in an interglacial period with temperatures comparable to the 2C of warming that countries who are part of the UN’s Paris agreement (everyone but the US) are all trying to avoid.
But scientists are unsure if enough ice melted during the last interglacial (LIG) to expose that trans-Antarctic seaway. 
But, if they could find some clues, then this would give them vital information about the fate of the world’s sea levels.
This is where octopuses come in or, more specifically, what evolutionary biologist Jan Strugnell thinks she could find out using octopus DNA.
Associate Prof Strugnell, of James Cook University in Townsville, Australia, describes an ingenious plan in a scientific paper published in the journal Quaternary Science Reviews, co-written by Joel Pedro of the University of Copenhagen and Nerida Wilson of the Western Australian Museum.
The future of the planet is tied up in that ice.
Strugnell writes that by examining the DNA of some bottom-dwelling animals currently living around the entire Antarctic continent, you can work out if the ancestors of those species were able to move through that trans-Antarctic seaway. 
It sounds complicated – and it is. 
But in the paper Strugnell describes recent advances in genome sequencing that can “provide powerful insight into the demographic history of species including processes such as migration, population divergence and changes in effective population size”.
Strugnell tells me if you match the DNA sequencing to powerful modelling, you could work out if that species was able to move across the seaway about 120,000 years ago. If they moved across the seaway, then that would mean enough ice had melted to clear the way. Ingenious!
In the paper, she says the best animals to test would be those that live on the ocean floor and currently exist all around the continent. 
Speaking to me, she reveals she already has a possible candidate – the Pareledone turqueti, or Turquet’s octopus. 
She says: “The genome of the species contains signatures of what happened to populations in the past and different demographic changes – these are all held within that DNA. 
“The DNA contains a record of those processes and so we can investigate different hypothesis of what happened in the past – just like your own human DNA contains a record of your ancestors.” 
Strugnell says a cruder version of these techniques are used in the popular human DNA tests to track a person’s own ancestry.
Strugnell has visited Antarctica three times, most recently earlier this year where she was helping gather octopus and other animals that live on the sea floor (scientists get them by either diving or dong small targeted trawling).
She has already used similar DNA techniques to understand the evolution of octopus around Antarctica and now wants to push the technology even further. 
“The future of the planet is tied up in that ice,” says Dr Ceridwen Fraser, of the Australian National University. Fraser also uses DNA analysis to work out how populations of species have moved around the plant, particularly in Antarctica. 
She says the techniques partly use what is known as the “molecular clock” – an understanding of the way genes change, or mutate, in different species. 
In recent years, Fraser says there have been giant leaps in the capability of genetic technologies and also in the computer power needed to analyse massive sets of data. 
She says Strugnell’s proposal is a “cool idea” and, with recent developments in the technology, was certainly feasible.
I think the timing for this is right. We now have the genetic tools more refined than ever before and we are moving into the era of interdisciplinary scientific research. There’s a lot of eyes on Antarctica right now and a lot of scientists want to know what’s going to happen.
Prof Richard Alley, of Penn State University, is a glaciologist and expert on ice sheets.
He tells me there were multiple challenges in understanding how the ice sheets had behaved in the past but says Strugnell’s method “looks like a great idea worthy of testing”.
It is worth noting that historical science, including paleoclimatic research and other research into Earth’s past and life’s evolution, does indeed generate hypotheses and do new experiments, just as in other branches of science – our ‘historical science’ really is science.
He says the paleoclimate science community (those are researchers studying ancient climates) is constantly coming up with new ways to understand what happened in the past.
We are limited to studying the materials left behind from past times but other branches of science do face limitations as well and, like them, we work hard to find the ways to use the possible to answer key questions. We’re not even close to exhausting the possibilities, and may never be, so there is still much to learn. I hope that this new idea is similarly tested.
Prof John Church, of the University of New South Wales Climate Change Research Centre, is a leading authority on sea level rise.
He ays the WAIS was likely to have made a “significant contribution” to the rising sea levels during the last interglacial “but whether it was a complete collapse is not yet known”.
“But the question is an important one,” he says, because high levels of greenhouse emissions would likely cause several metres of sea level rise over the coming centuries.
We could be committing the world to these higher sea levels this century, depending on our emissions. In addition to what emission and climate trajectories we will choose, the question is how quickly these multimetre sea-level rises could occur. One of the major issues in refining estimates of rates of future sea level rise is the future of the WAIS and other marine ice sheet areas in Antarctica.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2017/nov/23/could-octopus-dna-reveal-the-secrets-of-west-antarcticas-ice-sheet-collapse

SPIEGEL ONLINE: Mr. Hansen, is it a mistake to get out of nuclear power? James Hansen: It's a big mistake for the world. A majority of countries can not afford to do without nuclear power. SPIEGEL ONLINE: In order to achieve its climate goals, Germany would have better built new reactors, instead of relying on renewable energy? Hansen: Germany can do without nuclear power, if it really wants to, because Germany is a prosperous country, and the public seems ready to take on the costs of renewable energy. But the ideal balance between renewables and nuclear power is usually not zero for either. It is unbelievable that China and India will be able to phase out their use of fossil fuels fast enough without the help of nuclear energy. SPIEGEL ONLINE: Do not you ignore the risks of nuclear power? Hansen: No energy system is perfect, but in the case of nuclear energy it is clear that we can reduce the problems to such an extent that nuclear power is the most environmentally friendly of all the energy candidates we know about. SPIEGEL ONLINE: To fight global warming with nuclear reactors, hundreds of them would have to be built - a plausible scenario? Hansen: Surely it is possible, and newer reactors produce even less waste than current ones. SPIEGEL ONLINE: Could the money for new nuclear reactors not be better invested in renewable energy? Hansen: Even more for renewable energies? You're kidding. Renewable energy subsidies force customers to pay higher rates, a kind of invisible tax. The electricity bill is rising, but the customer does not know why.

NZ since imposing George Osbornes UK Jobseeker Policy under direction of London Bankers & IMF which replaced 1964 Social Securities was nothing other than veil AUSTERITY CUTS now regularly cuts beneficiaries off for the most minor of trumped up reasons. This draconian tactic includes permanently disabled and bedridden sickness beneficiaries, who are under new -UK Jobseeker Policy required to go find a job. This imposed jobseeker policy formulated from false economic data using Greece as model which basically said when a countries debt level reached a 90% threshold it would not be able to repay its IMF and other foreign bank loans. It failed to take into account several relevant sets of data from other countries. This now discredited theory imposed upon the poor, sick, disabled and even pensioners wrecking havoc upon the populace, yet NZ government for some insane reason hasn't moved to revoke it. Add the fact the benefit rates are so low and NZ less than 1% urbanised and hence little public transport for most of the country, and unable to afford registration, warrant of fitness for low price vehicles for to be able to travel about to get a job or go to work when one found the police are doing their best to confiscate their only assets the vehicles and thus effectively ensure these poor & beneficiaries do not have a means to get off the benefits. Add the massive amount of fines issue for no registration of 250,000 for one year alone and one get some idea NZ is not a friendly place to live if one is poor. Add that NZ is now like UK with cameras everywhere and one can fairly state it boardering on a police state. The moral of the story is don't look to NZ for any commonsense advice when they too like most countries are pawns of toxic IMF/World Bank 40 + years attack upon the less fortunate in society. This achieved by the passing of one toxic policy after policy which has sold off the public asset of each country to the wealthy and effectively transfered the wealth of country after country to already wealthy influentual few.

Clearly, the Chinese are using money and influence to termite our political system and swipe our sovereignty. Not that Turnbull's immune to accepting a handout as we've seen these last few days.
Mind you some admirable qualities can be seen in this ruthless system. Based on what we see in China, can't imagine any bikie gangs, dole bludgers, whinging minorities and all the other vast number of ills currently afflicting Australia being allowed to continue under the ruthless rule of the Chinese Communist Party.
Unfortunately, us ordinary folk will have to accept quite a lot more control in our life too. (check out China's grid system of citizen control - http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/inquirer/chinas-allseeing-spy-grid-takes-surveillance-to-new-level/news-story/7dfdf3fef86da6b8203c6acba3840539).

All the programs I mentioned in my post were programs aimed at long term poverty alleviation and long term health outcomes, and not constant handouts to the same people over and over. e.g. vaccinations work long term, the seed programs are self perpetuating because the farmers can get next year's seed from this year's crops, programs that teach women to be independent of future aid and those that teach men not to chop up their wives with machetes, solar lamps that continue to work for ever, as long as the sun exists, do not require repeated aid for the same group of people. Yet you deliberately ignored these perpetual aspects of these programs. 
Additionally, if you check the federal government websites, you will see these programs are reported as having been massively successful, yet they were defunded anyway by Julie Bishop under Tony Abbott.
So thank you for your unproven, unjustifiable, un-evidenced generalisation that NO aid programs work! In the face of massive evidence to the contrary, I prefer to follow the trail of evidence, proof, and fact, and state to the contrary, that these programs I chose to list, DO WORK! So much so, that my husband and I give over $5,000 a year to charities who are trying to continue to carry out these programs without any Australian government funding. But our few thousand $ is nothing to the billions that have been cut by this LNP government. For those people who missed out on getting this aid in the past, there is no NO funding for them to become healthy, independent, educated and permanently lifted out of poverty. Those who got this aid are thriving, BUT many, many, more need it, yet the LNP has focussed on killing people, instead of saving people.

After years or even decades of doing things a certain way, suddenly, everything changes. We look back, often in bemusement, shame or anger, and wonder how people accepted a certain way of doing things.
Changes once fiercely resisted become archaic: corporal punishment in schools, slavery, women and Aboriginal people denied the right to vote, the death penalty, LGBTIQ people denied the right to marry, the institutionalisation of people with disabilities … the list goes on. 
Smart leaders who are at the right place at the right time, sense the zeitgeist, capture a nation’s hopes and dreams and catapult themselves into the history books as the personification of that change. Visionary leaders look to the future, wonder what we’ll reflect back on in 30 to 50 years and take the first steps on an alternative path.
Our world is undergoing a once in a generation period of significant disruption to the status quo. 
The “trickle down” neoliberal economy that replaced the welfare-state economy has the stench of decay. Wealth is not trickling down: the rich and powerful have structured our economy so that the fruits of our collective efforts are concentrated in the hands of fewer and fewer people. Extreme inequality is a major factor causing people to turn to the old gods of blood (race) and soil (nationalism). But a “wellbeing” state that puts people and planet at its heart could trump the nationalists.
Public concern about the environment and climate damage, combined with technological progress, means the writing is on the wall for coal and big polluters. 
The US dominance as a superpower is waning as China is becoming more powerful (economically, diplomatically and militarily). Global tension is rising and economic power is shifting to three of the four most populous countries on earth: China, India and Indonesia as well as Japan. 
These are just a few of the major global challenges and opportunities confronting us.
A smart government would grasp the future and get ahead of the curve. Yet on Thursday, the government released a foreign policy white paper that desperately clings to the past while the rest of the world moves on. Its primary focus is terrorism, trade and Trump (even if it doesn’t mention him by name). 
Security gets 207 mentions, inequality gets 8.
Trade gets 182 mentions, poverty 29.
Terrorism gets 40 mentions, climate change 29. 
It sidelines the almost 9,000 people who wrote individual submissions with consistent messages that climate change, inequality and poverty should be foreign policy priorities, and that Australian aid is a key tool to help deliver a fairer world. 
The foreign policy white paper should encapsulate the kind of world we want to live in and the role Australia can play in helping to realise that vision. Instead, it paints a bleak picture for our future world and Australia’s part in it.
The Campaign for Australian Aid has released its own “People’s White Paper” report called One Humanity, which is a starting point for a conversation about our changing world.
A nation blessed with abundant sun, land, waves and wind and with Pacific neighbours facing raising oceans should be leading the world on renewables and action on climate damage. 
A nation with the geographical advantage of China, India and Japan on our doorstep should be crafting a more independent foreign policy. 
The nation of the “fair go” ought to be championing reducing economic and gender inequality, including domestic policies and global pressure to ensure corporations pay fair taxes and living wages, wherever they operate. 
A nation with aspirations to have a meaningful role in shaping the world for the better ought to be significantly increasing aid and ensuring that aid is used to advance the global sustainable development goals and tackle poverty.
Most Australians recognise the need for change and don’t like the way this country is headed.

There are four decisions made in plotting these graphs that are problematic: 
Choice of baseline,Inconsistent smoothing,Incomplete representation of the initial condition and structural uncertainty in the models,No depiction of the structural uncertainty in the satellite observations.Each of these four choices separately (and even more so together) has the effect of making the visual discrepancy between the models and observational products larger, misleading the reader as to the magnitude of the discrepancy and, therefore, it’s potential cause(s).

I think the opening poster (shotcricket) was claiming 22 new CF power stations by 2020. This is an inaccurate (there aren't 22?) or at best misleading statement as it implies they are recently planned and are all in construction or planned to be. As far as I know (and no-one has come up with anything to the contrary) this 'new fleet' were permitted or applied to be permitted in 2009 or earlier and have already been built, with the last, Datteln 4 (which was permitted I think in 2009 and which was due to come on stream in 2011, you will recall) to be finally completed this year with tests programmed for next year and generation by May 2018. As far as I know, there are no further plans for any new coal fired generation beyond these. 
BQSTART
Germany is producing more electricity from lignite now than it was in 2000. It's use of lignite has increased, not decreased.
BQEND
This is barely born out by the figures and there is no trend (and you cannot really make this statement as 2017 are no known). This may sound pedantic but it isn't. The year on year variance is too high to claim a trend as your statement suggests and, if we now acknowledge that dozens of existing lignite stations representing many gWh are due to be decommissioned over the next few years combined with a huge increase in off- and some increase in onshore wind generation, I think we shall see a marked downward trend in lignite use in the coming years. Not fast enough I hear you say. I agree.
A footnote to all this is the current political situation in Germany with the rise of the right and the need to compromise with the Greens taking their foot off the peddle. Its a sorry mess at the moment.
In short, I think we agree on most things but I feel you take a hardened view on some that are open to scrutiny, and when people question you it quickly descends to ad hominem statements, claims of lying etc. which I and many others object to and, perhaps wrongly, get too defensive about.

The greatest absolute increase in large wildfires occurred in Northern Rockies forests. This sub-region harbors a relatively large area of mesic, middle and high elevation forest types (such as lodgepole pine and spruce-fir) where fire exclusion has had little impact on natural fire regimes (1, 5), but where we found that an advance in spring produces a relatively large percentage increase in cumulative moisture deficit by midsummer. In contrast, changes in Northern California forests may involve both climate and land-use effects...  Thus, although land-use history is an important factor for wildfire risks in specific forest types (such as some ponderosa pine and mixed conifer forests), the broad-scale increase in wildfire frequency across the western United States has been driven primarily by sensitivity of fire regimes to recent changes in climate over a relatively large area.

Furthermore, the rate of change of a fairly insignificant greenhouse gas is rather unimportant. At least 95% of the greenhouse effect if from water vapor.
Furthermore, the effect of increasing CO2 levels is logarithmic not linear, so even a fairly large absolute change become increasingly unimportant.

Nothingness - Thanks for the links and comments, but we need to look at the bigger picture. There are hundreds of coal fired plants in Germany.
BQEND
George Monbiot has looked at the bigger picture. Here's his view of Germany's lignite power stations:
BQSTART
Who’s the world’s leading eco-vandal? It’s Angela Merkel  George Monbiot, The Guardian, 17 September 2017 
It is hard to rank such crimes against the biosphere, but perhaps the most embarrassing is Germany’s shocking failure, despite investing hundreds of billions of euros, to decarbonise its electricity system. While greenhouse gas emissions in other European nations have fallen sharply, in Germany they have plateaued.
The reason is, once more, Merkel’s surrender to industrial lobbyists. Her office has repeatedly blocked the environment ministry’s efforts to set a deadline for an end to coal power. Coal, especially lignite, which vies with Canadian tar sands for the title of the world’s dirtiest fuel, still supplies 40% of Germany’s electricity.
Because Merkel refuses to restrict its use, the peculiar impact of Germany’s Energiewende programme has been to cut the price of electricity, stimulating a switch from natural gas to lignite, which is cheaper. (In Germany they call this the Energiewende paradox). But Merkel doesn’t seem to care. She has announced that “coal will remain a pillar of German energy supply for a prolonged time span”.

The expected jump in the carbon emissions that drive global warming is a “giant leap backwards for humankind”, according to some scientists. However, other experts said they were not alarmed, saying fluctuations in emissions are to be expected and that big polluters such as China are acting to cut emissions.
Global emissions need to reach their peak by 2020 and then start falling quickly in order to have a realistic chance of keeping global warming below the 2C danger limit, according to leading scientists. Whether the anticipated increase in CO2 emissions in 2017 is just a blip that is followed by a falling trend, or is the start of a worrying upward trend, remains to be seen.
Much will depend on the fast implementation of the global climate deal sealed in Paris in 2015 and this is the focus of the UN summit of the world’s countries in Bonn, Germany this week. The nations must make significant progress in turning the aspirations of the Paris deal into reality, as the action pledged to date would see at least 3C of warming and increasing extreme weather impacts around the world.
The 12th annual Global Carbon Budget report published on Monday is produced by 76 of the world’s leading emissions experts from 57 research institutions and estimates that global carbon emissions from fossil fuels will have risen by 2% by the end of 2017, a significant rise.
“Global CO2 emissions appear to be going up strongly once again after a three-year stable period. This is very disappointing,” said Prof Corinne Le Quéré, director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at the UK’s University of East Anglia and who led the new research. “The urgency for reducing emissions means they should really be already decreasing now.”
“There was a big push to sign the Paris agreement on climate change but there is a feeling that not very much has happened since, a bit of slackening,” she said. “What happens after 2017 is very open and depends on how much effort countries are going to make. It is time to take really seriously the implementation of the Paris agreement.” She said the hurricanes and floods seen in 2017 were “a window into the future”.
The new analysis is based on the available energy use data for 2017 and projections for the latter part of the year. It estimates that 37bn tonnes of CO2 will be emitted from burning fossil fuels, the highest total ever.
The main reason for the rise is an expected 3.5% increase in emissions in China, the world’s biggest polluter, where low rains have reduced low-carbon hydroelectric output and industrial activity has increased. India’s rise in emissions was modest compared to previous years at 2%, while the US and EU are both on track for small falls.
2017 is likely to be the hottest year ever recorded in which there was no El Niño event, a natural global cycle that temporarily nudges up global temperature. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere also saw a record jump in 2016, and other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide from agriculture and industry are also rising.
“The news that emissions are rising after the three-year hiatus is a giant leap backwards for humankind,” said Amy Luers, executive director of Future Earth, a global research initiative. “Pushing the Earth closer to tipping points is deeply concerning. Emissions need to peak soon and approach zero by 2050.”
However, climate economist Prof Nicholas Stern, at the UK’s London School of Economics, said: “I would not be alarmed. There will be some fluctuations, for example around poor rains and hydro. We should also remember that the methods used to calculate emissions will have their own errors.”
He said there is strong climate action in China: “It has a very clear strategy, particularly on coal and energy efficiency and they are getting, and will get, results.” But Stern said it remains vital that all countries ramp up the ambition of their emissions pledges and that richer countries support action across the world.
Climate scientist Prof Michael Mann, at Penn State University in the US, said the research was authoritative but also urged caution, noting that the 2% projected rise in emissions is small relative to the overall uncertainties in the data. “It seems to me they are over-interpreting the 2017 numbers and jumping the gun a bit. Can’t we wait until the actual numbers are in to do a post-mortem?”
The ability to monitor emissions quickly and accurately is of growing importance. The Paris agreement is based on voluntary cuts by nations, and without verification that pledges have been fulfilled, the trust that underpins the deal could be eroded. “This puts immense pressure on the scientific community to develop methods that can truly verify changes in emissions,” said Le Quéré.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/13/fossil-fuel-burning-set-to-hit-record-high-in-2017-scientists-warn

Because CO2 did not continue to rise without limit. Like other feedbacks, the warming caused by release of CO2 from the oceans (initiated by orbital effects on insolation) was subject to diminishing returns, limiting the warming. Eventually a new equilibrium was reached, in which both temperatures and atmospheric CO2 stabilised, but at higher levels than before.
Much later, when orbital changes decreased insolation, the same processes went into reverse, cooling the Earth and resulting in a new Ice Age.

In the IPCC AR5 spends a fair bit of time discussing how risks of things like forest fire increase:
 ""Future fire activity will also depend on anthropogenic factors especially related to land use change. For the Amazon it is estimated that at present 58% of the area is too humid to allow deforestation fires but climate change might reduce this area to 37% by 2050 (Le Page et al., 2010). Golding and Betts (2008) estimated that future Amazon forest vulnerability to fire may depend non-linearly on combined climate change and deforestation.""

Your argument is totally circular and self-referential. We are special because we are special because we are special.
Your behavioural examples are easily visible in any other animal species. Apart from they are not making other species extinct at the rate we are.
Your point on Trump is a red herring. While the 1% do burn energy disproportionately, it is not ""evil"" behaviour (another religious term) that is causing modern humans to be inexorably destroying the environment. It is the normal, everyday behaviour of modern humans. 
Note I say ""modern"" because humans have been here for millions of years living quiye happily without any of it. Without the mental illness, destruction, depression etc. But every time modern humans encounter those people, we wipe them out, as if we can not live with being reminded that other ways of living are possible.

Famous beaches, commercial districts and swaths of farmland will be threatened at this elevated level of climate change, which the UN warned this week is a very real prospect unless nations reduce their carbon emissions.
Data from the Climate Central group of scientists analysed by Guardian journalists shows that 3C of global warming would ultimately lock in irreversible sea-level rises of perhaps two metres. Cities from Shanghai to Alexandria, and Rio to Osaka are among the worst affected. Miami would be inundated - as would the entire bottom third of the US state of Florida. 
The world is currently on course to heat up by 3C, according to the United Nations. That is because nations are not doing enough to reduce emissions. Climate negotiators are now discussing how to ratchet up ambitions to avoid this outcome.
Harsher droughts, more extreme weather, worse disruption of food production, increased migration by climate refugees, heightened storm surges and steadily rising sea levels. That is what we know for sure, then there is the risk of feedback loops - for example the release of methane from melting permafrost - that could quickly push 3C to 6C.
It could take decades or centuries, but change will be locked in by a 3C temperature rise, which would extensively melt ice caps, shrink glaciers and thermally expand the oceans so many current coastlines and low-lying plains would be under sea level. Unless massive barriers or water diversions are constructed, many cities, small islands, population centres, economic hubs and iconic sights will be submerged. Imagine a map with giant chunks missing from Florida, Manhattan, Lincolnshire, Rio de Janeiro and the deltas of the Nile, Amazon, Pearl, Mekong, Ganges and Brahmaputra.
National governments need to promise greater emissions cuts and enact policies to keep global warming to the more ambitious target of 1.5C or at most 2C, which they set as the goal of the Paris climate agreement. That will mean phasing out fossil fuels more quickly and ramping up effort to protect and restore forests.
The Guardian has found, however, that local preparations for a 3C world are as patchy as international efforts to prevent it from happening. At six of the coastal regions most likely to be affected, government planners are only slowly coming to grips with the enormity of the task ahead - and in some cases have done nothing.
This comes ahead of the latest round of climate talks in Bonn next week, when negotiators will work on ways to monitor, fund and ratchet up national commitments to cut CO2 so that temperatures can rise on a safer path of between 1.5 and 2C, which is the goal of the Paris agreement reached in 2015.
The momentum for change is currently too slow, according to the UN Environment Programme. In its annual emissions gap report, released on Tuesday, the international body said government commitments were only a third of what was needed. Non-state actors such as cities, companies and citizens can only partly fill this void, which leaves warming on course to rise to 3C or beyond by the end of this century, the report said.
The UN’s environment chief, Erik Solheim, said progress in the year since the Paris agreement entered into force has been inadequate. “We still find ourselves in a situation where we are not doing nearly enough to save hundreds of millions of people from a miserable future,” he said.
Nature’s ability to help may also be diminishing. On Monday, the World Meteorological Organisation said concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere rose last year at a record speed to reach 403.3 parts per million - a level not seen since the Pliocene era three to five million years ago.
A 3C rise would lead to longer droughts, fiercer hurricanes and lock in sea-level rises that would redraw many coastlines. Depending on the speed at which icecaps and glaciers melt, this could take decades or more than a century. Colin Summerhayes of the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge said three-degrees of warming would melt polar and glacier ice much further and faster than currently expected, potentially raising sea levels by two metres by 2100.
At least 275 million city dwellers live in vulnerable areas, the majority of them in Asian coastal megacities and industrial hubs such as Shanghai, Shenzhen, Bangkok and Tokyo.
Japan’s second biggest city, Osaka, is projected to lose its business and entertainments districts of Umeda and Namba unless global emissions are forced down or flood defences are built up. Officials are reluctantly accepting they must now put more effort into the latter.
“In the past our response was focused on reducing the causes of global warming, but given that climate change is inevitable, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), we are now discussing how to respond to the natural disasters that will follow,” said Toshikazu Nakaaki of the Osaka municipal government’s environment bureau.
In Miami - which would be almost entirely below sea level even at 2C warming - the sense of urgency is evident at city hall, where commissioners are asking voters to approve a “Miami Forever” bond in the November ballot that includes $192m for upgrading pump stations, expanding drainage systems, elevating roads and building dykes.
Elsewhere, there is less money for adaptation and a weaker sense of urgency. In Rio de Janeiro, a 3C rise would flood famous beaches such as Copacabana, the waterfront domestic airport, and many of the sites for last year’s Olympics. But the cash-strapped city has been slow to prepare. A report compiled for Brazil’s presidency found “situations in which climate changes are not considered within the scope of planning”.
In Egypt, even a 0.5m sea-level rise is predicted to submerge beaches in Alexandria and displace 8 million people on the Nile Delta unless protective measures are taken, according to the IPCC. But local activists say the authorities see it as a distant problem. “As far as I’m concerned, this issue isn’t on the list of government priorities,” said Ahmed Hassan, of the Save Alexandria Initiative, a group that works to raise awareness of the effects of climate change on the city.
The impacts will also be felt on the economy and food production. Among the most vulnerable areas in the UK is Lincolnshire, where swaths of agricultural land are likely to be lost to the sea.
“We’re conscious that climate change is happening and perhaps faster than expected so we are trying to mitigate and adapt to protect people and property. We can’t stop it, but we can reduce the risk.” said Alison Baptiste, director of strategy and investment at the UK Environment Agency. She said the measures in place should protect most communities in the near and medium term, but 50 years from now the situation will become more challenging. “If climate change projections are accurate, we’re going to have to make some difficult decisions.”

The revelation, contained in the Paradise Papers, has prompted renewed criticism of the “chronic failure” of Australian climate policy and warnings against future cash handouts to multinational polluters.
It also comes in the final stages of the looming sale of the plant, Loy Yang B, one of the last remaining brown coal-fired generators in Victoria’s Latrobe valley.
In 2012, fearing an industry backlash, Julia Gillard’s government created a $5.5bn compensation scheme to accompany its carbon tax, which Tony Abbott scrapped two years later.
The $5.5bn energy security fund was dubbed by the shadow environment minister, Greg Hunt, as “the biggest cash handouts in Australian history” made to the companies thought to be the country’s “biggest polluters”.
One of the big winners was the owner of Loy Yang B, the British-listed company International Power, which in turn was owned by the French multinational GDF Suez – now known as Engie.
Loy Yang B’s owner received $116.9m in carbon tax compensation from the government’s energy security fund on 22 June 2012, money it had been anticipating since it was first announced in March. 
It was also promised 4.87m free carbon units – in effect a permission to emit – each year for four years.
Within days of the $116.9m payment from taxpayers, Loy Yang B’s owner upstreamed $1bn out of its Australian operations
The compensation package was met with derision from energy and climate experts. Chief among its critics was the Australian energy market analyst Bruce Mountain, who warned that the compensation would simply be treated by polluters as windfall profit.
Mountain’s firm, CME, published analysis in 2013 showing generators were passing on the carbon tax’s costs to consumers and keeping the compensation as profit.
New revelations about the movement of wealth from Loy Yang B’s Australian entities have now been made in the Paradise Papers, based on millions of documents from two offshore service providers and the company registries of 19 tax havens. The material was obtained by the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung and shared by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists with partners including the Guardian. 
The documents reveal that within days of receiving the compensation, Loy Yang B’s owner upstreamed $1bn in dividends out of its Australian operations as part of its aptly named “Project Salmon”.
Mountain is far from surprised. He said it was simply further evidence that the policy of polluter compensation was a “chronic failure”.
“That they would have such largesse to dispatch back to their parent, it doesn’t surprise me at all,” Mountain told Guardian Australia. “It was a pure windfall, that compensation. The compensation scheme was very badly designed.”
The Australian companies behind Loy Yang B had used internal loans to give large amounts of money back to their British parent companies in the lead-up to 2012. 
Project Salmon involved restructuring the debt, so the Australian entities could use the $1bn in dividend payments to cancel the loans.
Engie said in a statement that the dividends did not involve the distribution of any cash outside of Australia. It also flatly denied sending any of the carbon tax compensation back to its offshore owners. 
“No cash was distributed out of Australia as a consequence of these dividends,” the company said. 
“Where dividends were paid in cash they did not include compensation received from the government. Further, carbon tax compensation was not permitted to be distributed overseas under the project finance restrictions and was used to meet the future carbon tax liabilities of Loy Yang B.”
The $1bn dividend payments appear to be at odds with the company’s public statements at the time. 
In 2011 it warned that the carbon tax had the potential to send power plants in the Latrobe valley broke.
When details of the compensation were announced in March 2012, International Power issued a statement saying it was not enough.
The taxpayer assistance would only provide “some level of compensation for the impact of the introduction of a carbon tax”, but was “significantly less than the actual impact on its business”.
“Compensation through the Energy Security Fund is essential to ensure investors do not lose faith in the Australian energy market, and to ensure the secure operation of the National Electricity Market,” it said.
International Power first approached the Cayman Islands offices of an offshore law firm, Appleby, in April 2012, to seek help with part of Project Salmon. Their initial emails are among the 6.8m Appleby records exposed as part of the Paradise Papers. 
“We are acting for International Power in connection with a proposed internal restructuring involving the companies in the chain of ownership relating to the Loy Yang B power station in Australia,” International Power’s lawyers told Appleby.
“The intention is for the proposed internal restructuring to be implemented shortly after the refinancing for the Loy Yang B power station is completion [sic] (targeted for mid-end June 2012).”
It is unclear what was done with the $1bn in dividend payments once they reached the top companies.
Not long after the dividend payments, the Australian subsidiaries came under some financial pressure. In late 2014 Loy Yang’s main Australian entity, Loy Yang Holdings Pty Ltd, reported it was at risk of breaching the conditions of its loans.
Engie denied that had anything to do with the $1bn dividends.
“The risk of breach of covenants on the project finance highlighted in the 2015 accounts of the Loy Yang B entities was due to low energy prices and the performance of the business after the 2012 refinancing,” the company said.
“This related to market factors outside of the control of Loy Yang B and coincided with the introduction of the carbon tax, which negatively impacted the business, despite compensation received from the government.”
It is unclear what tax benefit, if any, was achieved through Project Salmon.
Many of the dividend payments were made to a company first incorporated in the Netherlands, but managed from the UK.
Other parts of Loy Yang’s ownership structure were incorporated in the tax havens of the Cayman Islands, Cyprus and Guernsey.
Engie said all of the Loy Yang entities situated in “so-called tax haven countries” were managed in either the UK or Australia, meaning they were subject to the tax laws in both nations. 
“As a matter of principle, Engie avoids investments in so-called tax haven countries and such investments can only be made if supported by strong economic reasons, other than tax savings,” it said. 
The main entity in Australia, Loy Yang Holdings, paid no tax in 2014-15, despite recording $452m in revenue, according to the tax office’s corporate transparency report. The year before it paid $26.4m in tax on $760m total income.
The Guardian is not suggesting the company acted unlawfully or sought to avoid its tax obligations. 
The Loy Yang dividends were paid through retained earnings, meaning they were made from profits that were already taxed in Australia.
This government can’t square the wheel on keeping its coal generators in business and meeting the Paris agreement
The Project Salmon documents suggest the company’s chief concern in Australia was the imposition of dividend withholding tax. But it said the Australian Taxation Office had already made “favourable determinations” that such a withholding tax would not apply on the payments.
Engie is in the final stages of selling Loy Yang B. Three bidders – Delta Electricity, Alinta Energy, owned by Chow Tai Fook Enterprises, and China Resources Power Holdings – are thought to be left in the race.
Mountain said the failure of the compensation scheme served as a lesson for future policy.
He said the current government would be inclined to again offer compensation to polluters for climate policies. The experience of the past, he said, showed this was simply bad policy. 
“This government can’t square the wheel on keeping its coal generators in business and meeting the Paris agreement,” Mountain said.
“If they ever do anything they’ll be inclined towards bailing out the coal generators to make them good. And I think to the extent to which you can say: ‘But we’ve already done that, and then some, when there was no good reason at all’ – I think it’s important. It’s important for the public policy debate and where it all ends up. So that, for me, is a critical lesson.”

The conclusion contradicts a favorite talking point of senior members of the Trump administration.
A 477-page report released on Friday said it was “extremely likely” – meaning with 95 to 100% certainty – that global warming is manmade, mostly from carbon dioxide through the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. 
The energy secretary, Rick Perry, and Environmental Protection Agency chief, Scott Pruitt, have said carbon dioxide is not the primary contributor to global warming. 
Despite fears by some scientists and environmental advocates, David Fahey of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) and several authors said there was no political interference or censoring. It is the most comprehensive summary of climate science since 2013, showing a warming, worsening world. 
“A lot of what we’ve been learning over the last four year suggests the possibility that things may have been more serious than we think,” said Robert Kopp of Rutgers University, one of the dozens of scientists inside and outside the government who wrote the studies.
Since 1900, the report says Earth has warmed by 1C and seas have risen by 8in. Heatwaves, downpours and wildfires have become more frequent. 
Scientists calculated that human contribution to warming since 1950 is between 92% and 123%. It’s more than 100% on one end, because some natural forces such as volcanoes and orbital cycle are working to cool Earth, but are being overwhelmed by the effects of greenhouse gases, said study co-author Katharine Hayhoe of Texas Tech. 
“This period is now the warmest in the history of modern civilization,” she said. For the first time, scientists highlighted a dozen “tipping points” of potential dangers that could happen from warming, things that Hayhoe said “keep me up at night”.
They include the slowing down of the giant Atlantic Ocean circulation system that could dramatically warp weather worldwide, much stronger El Niños, major decreases in ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, which would spike sea level rise, and massive release of methane and carbon dioxide from thawing permafrost that could turbo-charge warming. 
Researchers did not provide an estimate of how likely it was that tipping points would occur, but “there is certainly some chance of some of these things happening,” Fahey said. 
The report also documented how different climate change-caused events can interact in a complex way to make life worse such as the California wildfires and Superstorm Sandy five years ago. 
“It shows that if anything the findings of scientists have become more dire” since 2013, said University of California Berkeley climate scientist Zeke Hausfather, who was not part of the work.

""The authors give clues. If, for instance, a more acidic ocean reduces the metabolic efficiency of the creatures, then they will have less energy to escape predators.""
BQENDYour mention of the word ""acidity"" caused me some alarm, because obviously the specific parameter that is being tested here is the change in CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. As it turns out, my concerns were groundless, the experiment did indeed use air that had been mixed to the appropriate concentrations of CO2.
One thing in the experimental method that did cause a raised eyebrow was the quality of the CO2 used. The paper states this to be ""industrial Grade, which is 99.5% CO2. I note that the USA FDA (Food and Drug Administration) mandates that what is called ""Beverage Grade"" CO2 must be 99.90% CO2, with the 0.09% made up of hydrocarbons. Normally the impurities in industrial grade would be ammonia, benzene, oxygen, carbon monoxide, etc. The FDA does not want people drinking coke and sparkling water that is of industrial grade.
I wonder if it is worth repeating these tests with CO2 gas of ""Research Grade"" (99.999%). Although the industrial grade is of course cheaper, it is possible that the FDA's sensitivity is for good reason. And perhaps box jellyfish are particularly sensitive to ammonia, for example?
Your overall message, about changing conditions potentially altering important behavioural balances in the ecosystem, remains valid. It would be interesting to know if the extent of the effect that we can expect by 2100, as indicated by this research, is possibly at least partly an artefact of the experimental method and the possible unintended effects of poisoning by the impurities introduced with the relatively low spec industrial grade CO2 used in the experiment..', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1510049838000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'this comment you made', u'effect': u'john the authors give clues'}, {u'cause': u'obviously the specific parameter that is being tested here is the change in co2 concentration in the atmosphere', u'effect': u'BQENDYour mention of the word "" acidity "" caused me some alarm , because obviously the specific parameter that is being tested here is the change in CO2 concentration in the atmosphere .'}, {u'cause': u'that', u'effect': None}], u'author_id': u'13022945', u'id': u'107864868', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'DottiB', u'text': u'It teaches us that the planet is being destroyed by us and 1+1 sometimes equals 5.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1509995228000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'14924399', u'id': u'107841971', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'B1ngoCrepuscule', u'text': u'Also as jellyfish become more prevalent they hoover up the planktonic larvae of their predators.', u'recommendation_count': u'1', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1509988063000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'4507134', u'in_reply_to': u'107765855', u'id': u'107837496', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Nursafitriwibisari', u'text': u'Climate change is the the unpredictable ingredient that, when added to existing social, economic and political tensions, has the potential to ignite violence and conflict with disastrous consequences.

A lot. At least that’s what I learned after reading a very recent paper out in the journal Global Climate Change. The article, “Ocean acidification alters zooplankton communities and increases top-down pressure of a cubazoan predator,” was authored by an international team of scientists – the paper looks at impacts of climate change on life in the world’s oceans.
I recall attending a horse-pulling contest as a child. The announcer at the event said something strange that stuck with me all these years. He said that two horses pulling a load at the same time are more effective than if the two horses pulled separately and their loads were added. That is, something about two horses working together made them greater than the sum of their parts. This study is a lot like those horses.
To begin, ocean acidification refers to the changing pH of ocean waters. As humans emit more greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide in particular) into the atmosphere, the chemistry of the oceans change. The effect is that the creatures living in the oceans are experiencing an environmental change that is separate from changing temperatures due to global warming. Scientists want to know how these changes will affect creatures, in particular because the biodiversity in the oceans is so very important to us as humans. 
There has been some reporting on studies of calcifying organisms and their susceptibility to changing chemistry in the oceans. For instance, echinoderms, molluscs, corals, and crustaceans have been studied in laboratories and in situ. The studies show that acidification reduces development and survival. Acidification can alter the way these creatures make and maintain their shells.
But the authors of this new study point out that there are many other non-calcifying organisms that may also be impacted by acidification. Even for these creatures, acidification has been shown to have deleterious effects that result in reduced survival, reduced reproductivity, and reduced size.
So how does ocean acidification affect these non-calcifying creatures? One hypothesis is that the new chemistry of the ocean changes these creatures’ metabolism. Upsetting the metabolism means they are less efficient at using caloric resources within their bodies. 
During this study, the authors utilized a very common zooplankton called calanoids. Calanoids make up approximately 80% of the zookplanton by mass. Consequently, they are very important. The authors also identified a predator of the calanoids - the “box jellyfish”. The fancy (scientific) word for box jellyfish is “cubozoa.” The authors wanted to know how changes to water pH affected the survival of the calanoids in the presence of a predator (the cubozoan). 
After bringing both creatures together into carefully designed tanks, the authors waited and watched. In some tanks, they just changed the ocean chemistry and did not introduce the predators. In other tanks, they introduced predators but kept the ocean chemistry fixed. In a third group of tanks, they both changed chemistry and introduced the predator. And then of course, they had control tanks with no chemistry changes or predators. 
What they found was really interesting. While both changes to chemistry and introduction of predators affected the populations of calanoids, the simultaneous actions of acidification and predators was greater than the individual actions. So, we see the analogy with the horses.
Why are the combined effects of these two changes more potent? The authors give clues. If, for instance, a more acidic ocean reduces the metabolic efficiency of the creatures, then they will have less energy to escape predators. In fact, these calanoid creatures are known to escape predators by making a jump or a series of jumps. Consequently, in non-altered water, only about 1% of hunting tries are successful. But, in altered water, with less energy for the calanoids, perhaps more jellyfish hunts end in a meal. 
There may be other explanations – certainly future research will shed more light on this. But, already we can learn a lot. First, simply adding the effects of climate change phenomena may lead to an underestimate of impact. This underestimate may be true beyond the biological world. For instance, as storms become stronger with both winds and precipitation increasing, we may find that the damage will increase more than the separate stories of increasing wind and increasing precipitation. Similarly, increased temperature and decreased frequency of rain may cause more severe droughts than expected by the separate influences of these trends
Fascinating stuff; I can’t wait to read the next study from these authors. I also can’t wait to see if others apply this new insight to different climate change problems.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/nov/03/what-do-jellyfish-teach-us-about-climate-change

OK, let's take your last post at face value. 
In the UK the left was destroyed by Thatcher. It remained cowed when Tony Blair continued Thatcherite policies and saw the UK become the strongest economy in Europe with a deregulated financial sector second only to Wall Street. Then came the crash from an out of control sub prime. The notional left wing government did as Wall Street demanded and took tax payers money and bailed out the banks and save them (socialism for the rich) and created a ten year deficit problem. The Republicans would have applauded that policy as would Reagan have. Now we have a Thatcherite conservative government that are shrinking the state to pay down the debt (Reagan would have approved) unlike Trump who is increasing the deficit.
The super rich bankers are now twice as rich because they are permitted to print new money, no complaints from me there, but I will not as a conservative deny they got off scot free for their sub prime excessive freedom crash, and even benefitted within a few years. I prefer great wealth generated by creating things, products, inventions, great businesses over mere speculation and evisceration of businesses (off shoring jobs, outsourcing, making people redundant). They are the real wealth creators that benefit the entire country. Wall Street doesn't employ enough people and off shores trillions to safe havens creating little or doing so far away in China. 
I agree America has a problem with a liberal mafia, but do not believe the poor and middle class should be punished for this. America needs to get Wall Street under control culturally, not dictatorially, and get them again to invest in people and jobs and advanced products, like in the heyday of the American 1950s when life had never been so good for the vast majority. 
Is Trump the man to do it? No, not smart enough. It needs to come from the culture. Instead of talking about race and gender the establishment should be talking about success and responsibility as successful citizens for the greater good, the great days of philanthropy invoked, the great days of ingenuity and product and services design.

It’s a delusion to think otherwise.

They simply are not. Not even close.

Franzen's discussion in the ""rules of drama"" paragraph is in fact imposing a narrative structure on an argument. Rather than posing a premise and examining it from all sides to determine the extent of its truth, the argument is steered through friendly questions to a pre-determined conclusion. The difference between an essay and a think piece can easily be seen by comparing Supreme Court decisions from the end of last term with Neil Gorsuch's separate opinions; the majority has the obligation to address squarely the rational arguments made by the parties, while Gorsuch is imposing a narrative structure designed to repel alternative formulations. This is not subjectivity by selection and arrangement (robinbale) or by authorial self-consciousness (Franzen); this is propaganda.
The problem with writers is that they are all unreliable narrators. They impose narrative structures because that makes their work readable and saleable (""publishable"", ""fashioning a compelling story""). But in today's world everyone is pushed to have a narrative. Even scientists and academic historians and Supreme Court justices embed their work in narratives (Kagan is as narrative-conscious as Gorsuch). We troll people with different narratives, like people with compatible narratives. We vote for candidates with unambiguous narratives, reject those who acknowledge inconvenient truths or the incoherence of the world. So in the end we reject the thoughtful essay and keep on swiping left or right.
As for your final sentence (referring to ""not as a denunciation but as a question""), I would have to go back to the earlier publication to determine its accuracy. Another unfortunate fact about our writers is that they tend to go to graduate school where they learn to ratiocinate and obfuscate. (They have to leave to learn to write, see Larry McMurtry.)

Jonathan Franzen on one year of Trump's America,article,http://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/04/jonathan-franzen-too-late-to-save-world-donald-trump-environment,0,"If an essay is something essayed – something hazarded, not definitive, not authoritative; something ventured on the basis of the author’s personal experience and subjectivity – we might seem to be living in an essayistic golden age. Which party you went to on Friday night, how you were treated by a flight attendant, what your take on the political outrage of the day is: the presumption of social media is that even the tiniest subjective micronarrative is worthy not only of private notation, as in a diary, but of sharing with other people. The US president now operates on this presumption. Traditionally hard news reporting, in places like the New York Times, has softened up to allow the I, with its voice and opinions and impressions, to take the front-page spotlight, and book reviewers feel less and less constrained to discuss books with any kind of objectivity. It didn’t use to matter if Raskolnikov and Lily Bart were likable, but the question of “likability,” with its implicit privileging of the reviewer’s personal feelings, is now a key element of critical judgment. Literary fiction itself is looking more and more like essay.
Some of the most influential novels of recent years, by Rachel Cusk and Karl Ove Knausgaard, take the method of self-conscious first-person testimony to a new level. Their more extreme admirers will tell you that imagination and invention are outmoded contrivances; that to inhabit the subjectivity of a character unlike the author is an act of appropriation, even colonialism; that the only authentic and politically defensible mode of narrative is autobiography.
Meanwhile the personal essay itself – the formal apparatus of honest self-examination and sustained engagement with ideas, as developed by Montaigne and advanced by Emerson and Woolf and Baldwin – is in eclipse. Most large-circulation American magazines have all but ceased to publish pure essays. The form persists mainly in smaller publications that collectively have fewer readers than Margaret Atwood has Twitter followers. Should we be mourning the essay’s extinction? Or should we be celebrating its conquest of the larger culture?
A personal and subjective micronarrative: the few lessons I’ve learned about writing essays all came from my editor at the New Yorker, Henry Finder. I first went to Henry, in 1994, as a would-be journalist in pressing need of money. Largely through dumb luck, I produced a publishable article about the US Postal Service, and then, through native incompetence, I wrote an unpublishable piece about the Sierra Club. This was the point at which Henry suggested that I might have some aptitude as an essayist. I heard him to be saying, “since you’re obviously a crap journalist”, and denied that I had any such aptitude. I’d been raised with a midwestern horror of yakking too much about myself, and I had an additional prejudice, derived from certain wrongheaded ideas about novel-writing, against the stating of things that could more rewardingly be depicted. But I still needed money, so I kept calling Henry for book-review assignments. On one of our calls, he asked me if I had any interest in the tobacco industry – the subject of a major new history by Richard Kluger. I quickly said: “Cigarettes are the last thing in the world I want to think about.” To this, Henry even more quickly replied: “Therefore you must write about them.”
This was my first lesson from Henry, and it remains the most important one. After smoking throughout my 20s, I’d succeeded in quitting for two years in my early 30s. But when I was assigned the post-office piece, and became terrified of picking up the phone and introducing myself as a New Yorker journalist, I’d taken up the habit again. In the years since then, I’d managed to think of myself as a nonsmoker, or at least as a person so firmly resolved to quit again that I might as well already have been a nonsmoker, even as I continued to smoke. My state of mind was like a quantum wave function in which I could be totally a smoker but also totally not a smoker, so long as I never took measure of myself. And it was instantly clear to me that writing about cigarettes would force me to take my measure. This is what essays do.
There was also the problem of my mother, whose father had died of lung cancer, and who was militantly anti-tobacco. I’d concealed my habit from her for more than 15 years. One reason I needed to preserve my indeterminacy as a smoker/nonsmoker was that I didn’t enjoy lying to her. As soon as I could succeed in quitting again, permanently, the wave function would collapse and I would be, one hundred per cent, the nonsmoker I’d always represented myself to be – but only if I didn’t first come out, in print, as a smoker.
Henry had been a twentysomething wunderkind when Tina Brown hired him at the New Yorker. He had a distinctive tight-chested manner of speaking, a kind of hyper-articulate mumble, like prose acutely well edited but barely legible. I was awed by his intelligence and his erudition and had quickly come to live in fear of disappointing him. Henry’s passionate emphasis in “Therefore you must write about them” – he was the only speaker I knew who could get away with the stressed initial “Therefore” and the imperative “must” – allowed me to hope that I’d registered in his consciousness in some small way.
And so I went to work on the essay, every day combusting half a dozen low-tar cigarettes in front of a box fan in my living-room window, and handed in the only thing I ever wrote for Henry that didn’t need his editing. I don’t remember how my mother got her hands on the essay or how she conveyed to me her deep sense of betrayal, whether by letter or in a phone call, but I do remember that she then didn’t communicate with me for six weeks – by a wide margin, the longest she ever went silent on me. It was exactly as I’d feared. But when she got over it and began sending me letters again, I felt seen by her, seen for what I was, in a way I’d never felt before. It wasn’t just that my “real” self had been concealed from her; it was as if there hadn’t really been a self to see.
Should we be mourning the essay’s extinction? Or should we be celebrating its conquest of the larger culture?
Kierkegaard, in Either/Or, makes fun of the “busy man” for whom busyness is a way of avoiding an honest self-reckoning. You might wake up in the night and realise that you’re lonely in your marriage, or that you need to think about what your level of consumption is doing to the planet, but the next day you have a million little things to do, and the day after that you have another million things. As long as there’s no end of little things, you never have to stop and confront the bigger questions. Writing or reading an essay isn’t the only way to stop and ask yourself who you really are and what your life might mean, but it is one good way. And if you consider how laughably unbusy Kierkegaard’s Copenhagen was, compared with our own age, those subjective tweets and hasty blog posts don’t seem so essayistic. They seem more like a means of avoiding what a real essay might force on us. We spend our days reading, on screens, stuff we’d never bother reading in a printed book, and bitch about how busy we are.
I quit cigarettes for the second time in 1997. And then, in 2002, for the final time. And then, in 2003, for the last and final time – unless you count the smokeless nicotine that’s coursing through my bloodstream as I write this. Attempting to write an honest essay doesn’t alter the multiplicity of my selves; I’m still simultaneously a reptile-brained addict, a worrier about my health, an eternal teenager, a self-medicating depressive. What changes, if I take the time to stop and measure, is that my multi-selved identity acquires substance.
One of the mysteries of literature is that personal substance, as perceived by both the writer and the reader, is situated outside the body of either of them, on some kind of page. How can I feel realer to myself in a thing I’m writing than I do inside my body? How can I feel closer to another person when I’m reading her words than I do when I’m sitting next to her? The answer, in part, is that both writing and reading demand full attentiveness. But it surely also has to do with the kind of ordering that is possible only on the page.
Here I might mention two other lessons I learned from Henry Finder. One was Every essay, even a think piece, tells a story. The other was There are only two ways to organise material: “Like goes with like” and “This followed that.” These precepts may seem self-evident, but any grader of high-school or college essays can tell you that they aren’t. To me it was especially not evident that a think piece should follow the rules of drama. And yet: doesn’t a good argument begin by positing some difficult problem? And doesn’t it then propose an escape from the problem through some bold proposition, and set up obstacles in the form of objections and counterarguments, and finally, through a series of reversals, take us to an unforeseen but satisfying conclusion?
If you accept Henry’s premise that a successful prose piece consists of material arranged in the form of a story, and if you share my own conviction that our identities consist of the stories we tell about ourselves, it makes sense that we should get a strong hit of personal substance from the labour of writing and the pleasure of reading. When I’m alone in the woods or having dinner with a friend, I’m overwhelmed by the quantity of random sensory data coming at me. The act of writing subtracts almost everything, leaving only the alphabet and punctuation marks, and progresses toward non-randomness. Sometimes, in ordering the elements of a familiar story, you discover that it doesn’t mean what you thought it did. Sometimes, especially with an argument (“This follows from that”), a completely new narrative is called for. The discipline of fashioning a compelling story can crystallise thoughts and feelings you only dimly knew you had in you.
If you’re looking at a mass of material that doesn’t seem to lend itself to storytelling, Henry would say your only other option is to sort it into categories, grouping similar elements together: Like goes with like. This is, at a minimum, a tidy way to write. But patterns also have a way of turning into stories. To make sense of Donald Trump’s victory in an election he was widely expected to lose, it’s tempting to construct a this-followed-that story: Hillary Clinton was careless with her emails, the Justice department chose not to prosecute her, then Anthony Weiner’s emails came to light, then James Comey reported to Congress that Clinton might still be in trouble, and then Trump won the election. But it may actually be more fruitful to group like with like: Trump’s victory was like the Brexit vote and like the resurgent anti-immigrant nationalism in Europe. Clinton’s imperiously sloppy handling of her emails was like her poorly messaged campaign and like her decision not to campaign harder in Michigan and Pennsylvania.
I was in Ghana on election day, birdwatching with my brother and two friends. James Comey’s report to Congress had unsettled the campaign before I left for Africa, but Nate Silver’s authoritative polling website, Fivethirtyeight, was still giving Trump just a 30% chance of winning. Having cast an early ballot for Clinton, I’d arrived in Accra feeling only moderately anxious about the election and congratulating myself on my decision to spend the final week of the campaign not checking Fivethirtyeight 10 times a day.
I turned on my phone to confirm that Clinton was winning the election. What I found instead were stricken texts
I was indulging a different sort of compulsion in Ghana. To my shame, I am what people in the world of birding call a lister. It’s not that I don’t love birds for their own sake. I go birding to experience their beauty and diversity, learn more about their behaviour and the ecosystems they belong to, and take long, attentive walks in new places. But I also keep way too many lists. I count not only the bird species I’ve seen worldwide but the ones I’ve seen in every country and every US state I’ve birded in, also at various smaller sites, including my back yard, and in every calendar year since 2003. I can rationalise my compulsive counting as an extra little game I play within the context of my passion. But I really am compulsive. This makes me morally inferior to birders who bird exclusively for the joy of it.
It happened that by going to Ghana I’d given myself a chance to break my previous year-list record of 1,286 species. I was already over 800 for 2016, and I knew, from my online research, that trips similar to ours had produced nearly 500 species, only a handful of which are also common in America. If I could see 460 unique year species in Africa, and then use my seven-hour layover in London to pick up 20 easy European birds at a park near Heathrow, 2016 would be my best year ever.
We were seeing great stuff in Ghana, spectacular turacos and bee-eaters found only in west Africa. But the country’s few remaining forests are under intense hunting and logging pressure, and our walks in them were more sweltering than productive. By the evening of election day, we’d already missed our only shot at several of my target species. Very early the next morning, when polls were still open on the west coast of the States, I turned on my phone for the pleasure of confirming that Clinton was winning the election. What I found instead were stricken texts from my friends in California, with pictures of them staring at a TV and looking morose, my girlfriend curled up on a sofa in a fetal position. The Times headline of the moment was “Trump Takes North Carolina, Building Momentum; Clinton’s Path to Victory Narrow.”
There was nothing to be done but go birding. On a road in the Nsuta forest, dodging timber trucks whose momentum I associated with Trump’s, and yet clinging to the idea that Clinton still had a path to victory, I saw Black Dwarf Hornbills, an African Cuckoo-Hawk and a Melancholy Woodpecker. It was a sweaty but satisfactory morning that ended, when we re-emerged into network coverage, with the news that the “short-fingered vulgarian” (Spy magazine’s memorable epithet) was my country’s new president. This was the moment when I saw what my mind had been doing with Nate Silver’s figure of 30% for Trump’s odds. Somehow I’d taken the figure to mean that the world might be, worst case, 30% shittier after election day.
What the number actually represented, of course, was a 30% chance of the world’s being 100% shittier.
Intolerance particularly flourishes online, where measured speech is punished by not getting clicked on
As we travelled up into drier, emptier northern Ghana, we intersected with some birds I’d long dreamed of seeing: Egyptian Plovers, Carmine Bee-eaters and a male Standard-winged Nightjar, whose outrageous wing streamers gave it the look of a nighthawk being closely pursued by two bats. But we were falling ever further behind the year-bird pace I needed to maintain. It occurred to me, belatedly, that the trip lists I’d seen online had included species that were only heard, not seen, while I needed to see a bird to count it. Those lists had raised my hopes the way Nate Silver had. Now every target species I missed increased the pressure to see all of the remaining targets, even the wildly unlikely ones, if I wanted to break my record. It was only a stupid year list, ultimately meaningless even to me, but I was haunted by the headline from the morning after election day. Instead of 275 electoral votes, I needed 460 species, and my path to victory was becoming very narrow. Finally, four days before the end of the trip, in the spillway of a dam near the Burkina Faso border, where I’d hoped to get half a dozen new grassland birds and saw zero, I had to accept the reality of loss. I was suddenly aware that I should have been at home, trying to console my girlfriend about the election, exercising the one benefit of being a depressive pessimist, which is the propensity to laugh in dark times.
How had the short-fingered vulgarian reached the White House? When Hillary Clinton started speaking in public again, she lent credence to a like-goes-with-like account of her character by advancing a this-followed-that narrative. Never mind that she’d mishandled her emails and uttered the phrase “basket of deplorables”. Never mind that voters might have had legitimate grievances with the liberal elite she represented; might have failed to appreciate the rationality of free trade, open borders, and factory automation when the overall gains in global wealth came at middle-class expense; might have resented the federal imposition of liberal urban values on conservative rural communities. According to Clinton, her loss was the fault of James Comey – maybe also of the Russians.
Admittedly, I had my own neat narrative account. When I came home from Africa to Santa Cruz, my progressive friends were still struggling to understand how Trump could have won. I remembered a public event I’d once done with the optimistic social-media specialist Clay Shirky, who’d recounted to the audience how “shocked” professional New York restaurant critics had been when Zagat, a crowd-sourced reviewing service, had named Union Square Café the best restaurant in town. Shirky’s point was that professional critics aren’t as smart as they think they are; that, in fact, in the age of Big Data, critics are no longer even necessary. At the event, ignoring the fact that Union Square Café was my favourite New York restaurant (the crowd was right!), I’d sourly wondered if Shirky believed that critics were also stupid to consider Alice Munro a better writer than James Patterson. But now Trump’s victory, too, had vindicated Shirky’s mockery of pundits. Social media had allowed Trump to bypass the critical establishment, and just enough members of the crowd, in key swing states, had found his low comedy and his incendiary speech “better” than Clinton’s nuanced arguments and her mastery of policy. This follows from that: without Twitter and Facebook, no Trump.
After the election, Mark Zuckerberg did briefly seem to take responsibility, sort of, for having created the platform of choice for fake news about Clinton, and to suggest that Facebook could become more active in filtering the news. (Good luck with that.) Twitter, for its part, kept its head down. As Trump’s tweeting continued unabated, what could Twitter possibly say? That it was making the world a better place?
In December, my favourite Santa Cruz radio station, KPIG, began running a fake ad offering counselling services to addicts of Trump-hating tweets and Facebook posts. The following month, a week before Trump’s inauguration, the PEN American Center organised events around the country to reject the assault on free speech that it claimed Trump represented. Although his administration’s travel restrictions did later make it harder for writers from Muslim countries to have their voices heard in the United States, the one bad thing that could not be said of Trump, in January, was that he had in any way curtailed free speech. His lying, bullying tweets were free speech on steroids. PEN itself, just a few years earlier, had given a free-speech award to Twitter, for its self-publicised role in the Arab spring. The actual result of the Arab spring had been a retrenchment of autocracy, and Twitter had since revealed itself, in Trump’s hands, to be a platform made to order for autocracy, but the ironies didn’t end there. During the same week in January, progressive American bookstores and authors proposed a boycott of Simon &amp; Schuster for the crime of intending to publish one book by the dismal right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos. The angriest of the bookstores talked of refusing to stock all titles from S&amp;S, including, presumably, the books of Andrew Solomon, the president of PEN. The talk didn’t end until S&amp;S voided its contract with Yiannopoulos.
The most likely rise in temperature is six degrees. We’ll be lucky to avoid a two-degree rise before the year 2030
Trump and his alt-right supporters take pleasure in pushing the buttons of the politically correct, but it only works because the buttons are there to be pushed – students and activists claiming the right to not hear things that upset them, and to shout down ideas that offend them. Intolerance particularly flourishes online, where measured speech is punished by not getting clicked on, invisible Facebook and Google algorithms steer you towards content you agree with, and nonconforming voices stay silent for fear of being flamed or trolled or unfriended. The result is a silo in which, whatever side you’re on, you feel absolutely right to hate what you hate. And here is another way in which the essay differs from superficially similar kinds of subjective speech. The essay’s roots are in literature, and literature at its best – the work of Alice Munro, for example – invites you to ask whether you might be somewhat wrong, maybe even entirely wrong, and to imagine why someone else might hate you.
Three years ago, I was in a state of rage about climate change. The Republican party was continuing to lie about the absence of a scientific consensus on climate – Florida’s Department of Environmental Protection had gone so far as to forbid its employees to write the words “climate change”, after Florida’s governor, a Republican, insisted that it wasn’t a “true fact” – but I wasn’t much less angry at the left. I’d read a new book by Naomi Klein, This Changes Everything, in which she assured the reader that, although “time is tight”, we still have 10 years to radically remake the global economy and prevent global temperatures from rising by more than two degrees Celsius by the end of the century. Klein wasn’t the only leftist saying we still had 10 years. In fact, environmental activists had been saying the exact same thing in 2005.
They’d also been saying it in 1995: We still have 10 years. By 2015, though, it ought to have been clear that humanity is incapable in every way – politically, psychologically, ethically, economically – of reducing carbon emissions quickly enough to change everything. Even the European Union, which had taken the early lead on climate, and was fond of lecturing other regions on their irresponsibility, needed only a recession in 2009 to shift its focus to economic growth. Barring a worldwide revolt against free-market capitalism in the next 10 years – the scenario that Klein contended could still save us – the most likely rise in temperature this century is on the order of six degrees. We’ll be lucky to avoid a two-degree rise before the year 2030.
In a polity ever more starkly divided, the truth about global warming was even less convenient to the left than to the right. The right’s denials were odious lies, but at least they were consistent with a certain cold-eyed political realism. The left, having excoriated the right for its intellectual dishonesty and turned climate denialism into a political rallying cry, was now in an impossible position. It had to keep insisting on the truth of climate science while persisting in the fiction that collective world action could stave off the worst of it: that universal acceptance of the facts, which really might have changed everything in 1995, could still change everything. Otherwise, what difference did it make if the Republicans quibbled with the science?
Because my sympathies were with the left – reducing carbon emissions is vastly better than doing nothing; every half-degree helps – I also held it to a higher standard. Denying the dark reality, pretending that the Paris accord could avert catastrophe, was understandable as a tactic to keep people motivated to reduce emissions; to keep hope alive. As a strategy, though, it did more harm than good. It ceded the ethical high ground, insulted the intelligence of unpersuaded voters (“Really? We still have 10 years?”), and precluded frank discussion of how the global community should prepare for drastic changes, and how nations like Bangladesh should be compensated for what nations like the United States have done to them.
Dishonesty also skewed priorities. In the past 20 years, the environmental movement had become captive to a single issue. Partly out of genuine alarm, partly also because foregrounding human problems was politically less risky – less elitist – than talking about nature, the big environmental NGOs had all invested their political capital in fighting climate change, a problem with a human face. The NGO that particularly enraged me, as a bird lover, was the National Audubon Society, once an uncompromising defender of birds, now a lethargic institution with a very large PR department. In September 2014, with much fanfare, that PR department had announced to the world that climate change was the number-one threat to the birds of North America. The announcement was both narrowly dishonest, because its wording didn’t square with the conclusions of Audubon’s own scientists, and broadly dishonest, because not one single bird death could be directly attributed to human carbon emissions. In 2014, the most serious threat to American birds was habitat loss, followed by outdoor cats, collisions with buildings, and pesticides. By invoking the buzzword of climate change, Audubon got a lot of attention in the liberal media; another point had been scored against the science-denying right. But it was not at all clear how this helped birds. The only practical effect of Audubon’s announcement, it seemed to me, was to discourage people from addressing the real threats to birds in the present.
I was so angry that I decided that I’d better write an essay. I began with a jeremiad against the National Audubon Society, broadened it into a scornful denunciation of the environmental movement generally, and then started waking up in the night in a panic of remorse and doubt. For the writer, an essay is a mirror, and I didn’t like what I was seeing in this one. Why was I excoriating fellow liberals when the denialists were so much worse? The prospect of climate change was every bit as sickening to me as to the groups I was attacking. With every additional degree of global warming, further hundreds of millions of people around the world would suffer. Wasn’t it worth an all-out effort to achieve a reduction of even half of one degree? Wasn’t it obscene to be talking about birds when children in Bangladesh were threatened? Yes, the premise of my essay was that we have an ethical responsibility to other species as well as to our own. But what if that premise was false? And, even if it was true, did I really care personally about biodiversity? Or was I just a privileged white guy who liked to go birding? And not even a purehearted birder – a lister!
After three nights of doubting my character and motives, I called Henry Finder and told him I couldn’t write the piece. I’d done plenty of ranting about climate to my friends and to likeminded conservationists, but it was like a lot of the ranting that happens online, where you’re protected by the impromptu nature of the writing and by the known friendliness of your audience. Trying to write a finished thing, an essay, had made me aware of the sloppiness of my thinking. It had also enormously increased the risk of shame, because the writing wasn’t casual, and because it was going out to an audience of probably hostile strangers. Following Henry’s admonition (“Therefore”), I’d come to think of the essayist as a firefighter, whose job, while everyone else is fleeing the flames of shame, is to run straight into them. But I had a lot more to fear now than my mother’s disapproval.
I’m such a climate-science accepter that I don’t even bother having hope for the ice caps
My essay might have stayed abandoned if I hadn’t already clicked a button on Audubon’s website, affirming that, yes, I wanted to join it in fighting climate change. I’d only done this to gather rhetorical ammunition to use against Audubon, but a deluge of direct-mail solicitations had followed from that click. I got at least eight of them in six weeks, all of them asking me to give money, along with a similar deluge in my email inbox. A few days after speaking to Henry, I opened one of the emails and found myself looking at a picture of myself – luckily a flattering image, taken in 2010 for Vogue magazine, which had dressed me up better than I dress myself and posed me in a field with my binoculars, like a birder. The headline of the email was something like “Join Author Jonathan Franzen in Supporting Audubon”. It was true that, a few years earlier, in an interview with Audubon magazine, I’d politely praised the organisation, or at least its magazine. But no one had asked for my permission to use my name and image for solicitation. I wasn’t sure the email was even legal.
A more benign impetus to return to the essay came from Henry. As far as I know, Henry couldn’t care less about birds, but he seemed to see something in my argument that our preoccupation with future catastrophes discourages us from tackling solvable environmental problems in the here and now. In an email to me, he gently suggested that I lose the tone of prophetic scorn. “This piece will be more persuasive,” he wrote in another, “if, ironically, it’s more ambivalent, less polemical. You’re not whaling on folks who want us to pay attention to climate change and emission reductions. But you’re attentive to the costs. To what the discourse pushes to the margins.” Email by email, revision by revision, Henry nudged me toward framing the essay not as a denunciation but as a question: how do we find meaning in our actions when the world seems to be coming to an end? Much of the final draft was devoted to a pair of well-conceived regional conservation projects, in Peru and Costa Rica, where the world really is being made a better place, not just for wild plants and wild animals but for the Peruvians and Costa Ricans who live there. Work on these projects is personally meaningful, and the benefits are immediate and tangible.
In writing about the two projects, I hoped that one or two of the big charitable foundations, the ones spending tens of millions of dollars on biodiesel development or on wind farms in Eritrea, might read the piece and consider investing in work that produces tangible results. What I got instead was a missile attack from the liberal silo. I’m not on social media, but my friends reported that I was being called all sorts of names, including “birdbrain” and “climate-change denier”. Tweet-sized snippets of my essay, retweeted out of context, made it sound as if I’d proposed that we abandon the effort to reduce carbon emissions, which was the position of the Republican party, which, by the polarising logic of online discourse, made me a climate-change denier. In fact, I’m such a climate-science accepter that I don’t even bother having hope for the ice caps. All I’d denied was that a right-minded international elite, meeting in nice hotels around the world, could stop them from melting. This was my crime against orthodoxy. Climate now has such a lock on the liberal imagination that any attempt to change the conversation – even trying to change it to the epic extinction event that human beings are already creating without the help of climate change – amounts to an offence against religion.
I did have sympathy for the climate-change professionals who denounced the essay. They’d been working for decades to raise the alarm in America, and they finally had President Obama on board with them; they had the Paris accord. It was an inopportune time to point out that drastic global warming is already a done deal, and that it seems unlikely that humanity is going to leave any carbon in the ground, given that, even now, not one country in the world has pledged to do it.
I also understood the fury of the alternative-energy industry, which is a business like any other. If you allow that renewable energy projects are only a moderating tactic, unable to reverse the damage that past carbon emissions will continue to do for centuries, it opens the door to other questions about the business. Like, did we really need quite so many windmills? Did they have to be placed in ecologically sensitive areas? And the solar farms in the Mojave desert – wouldn’t it make more sense to cover the city of Los Angeles with solar panels and spare the open space? Weren’t we sort of destroying the natural world in order to save it? I believe it was an industry blogger who called me a birdbrain.
As for Audubon, the fundraising email should have warned me about the character of its management. But I was still surprised by its response to the essay, which was to attack, ad hominem, the person whose name and image it had blithely appropriated two months earlier. My essay had, yes, given Audubon some tough love. I wanted it to cut out the nonsense, stop talking about 50 years from now, and be more aggressive in defending the birds that both it and I love.
But apparently all Audubon could see was a threat to its membership numbers and its fundraising efforts, and so it had to negate me as a person. I’m told the president of Audubon fired off four different salvos at me personally. This is what presidents do now.
And it worked. Without even reading those salvos – simply from knowing that other people were reading them – I felt ashamed. I felt the way I’d felt in eighth grade, shunned by the crowd and called names that shouldn’t have hurt but did. I wished I’d listened to my panics in the night and kept my opinions to myself. In a state of some anguish, I called up Henry and dumped all my shame and regret on him. He replied, in his barely legible way, that the online response was only weather. “With public opinion,” he said, “there’s weather, and then there’s climate. You’re trying to change the climate, and that takes time.”
It didn’t matter if I believed this or not. It was enough to feel that one person, Henry, didn’t hate me. I consoled myself with the thought that, although climate is too vast and chaotic for any individual to alter it, the individual can still find meaning in trying to make a difference to one afflicted village, one victim of global injustice. Or to one bird, or one reader. After the online flames had died down, I started hearing privately from conservation workers who shared my frustrations but couldn’t afford to express them. I didn’t hear from many people, but there didn’t have to be many. My feeling in each case was the same: the person I wrote the essay for is you.
But now, two and a half years later, as the ice shelves crumble and the Twitter president pulls out of the Paris accord, I’m not so sure. Now I can admit to myself that I didn’t write the essay just to hearten a few conservationists and deflect some charitable dollars to better causes. I really did want to change the climate. I still do. I share, with the very people my essay criticised, the recognition that global warming is the issue of our time, perhaps the biggest issue in all of human history. Every one of us is now in the position of the indigenous Americans when the Europeans arrived with guns and smallpox: our world is poised to change vastly, unpredictably, and mostly for the worse. I don’t have any hope that we can stop the change from coming. My only hope is that we can accept the reality in time to prepare for it humanely, and my only faith is that facing it honestly, however painful this may be, is better than denying it.
If I were writing the essay today, I might say all this. The mirror of the essay, as it was published, reflected an angry bird-loving misfit who thinks he’s smarter than the crowd. That character may be me, but it’s not the whole me, and a better essay would have reflected that. In a better essay, I might still have given Audubon the rebuke it deserved, but I would have found my way to more sympathy for the other people I was angry at: for the climate activists, who for 20 years had watched their path to victory narrow sickeningly, as carbon emissions mounted and the necessary emissions-reduction targets grew ever more unrealistic, and for the alternative energy workers who had families to feed and were trying to see beyond petroleum, and for the environmental NGOs that thought they’d finally found an issue that could wake the world up, and for the leftists who, as neoliberalism and its technologies reduced the electorate to individual consumers, saw climate change as the last strong argument for collectivism. I would especially have tried to remember all the people who need more hope in their lives than a depressive pessimist does, the people for whom the prospect of a hot, calamity-filled future is unbearably sad and frightening, and who can be forgiven for not wanting to think about it. I would have kept revising.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/04/jonathan-franzen-too-late-to-save-world-donald-trump-environment

I'll get right on that.
In the meantime, we can observe that unsubsidized wind and solar electricity is now being sold at costs as low as 2 cents per kWh, well below the 6 cent minimum for subsidized fossil fuels. So that's a corner we've already turned. Governments could and should do more to accelerate the process but it will happen with or without their help. The danger is that governments are throwing up roadblocks to stymie such advances and cost savings.
Or you can just look at what economists have written on the subject. Their assessments vary from a near-term savings of about 5 cents per person per day up to a near-term cost of up to a dollar per person per day. Most studies show a transition cost of about 30 cents per person per day.

Although Arctic sea ice has declined since 1979,that was a high point, and there is as much ice now as there was in the 1930 and 40s, which means the decline may turn out to be just cyclical.
BQEND
Great hypothesis! 
Although 1979 was clearly not a high point 
https://nsidc.org/sites/nsidc.org/files/images//mean_anomaly_1953-2012.png
So - what cyclic behaviour is causing the energy to change according to your theory? You are aware that the AMO is defined as detrended index? Like this: 
http://www.air-worldwide.com/uploadedImages/Publications/AIR_Currents/2016/images/2016hurricaneseason_fig2.png
So you can try to demonstrate that with the sea-ice figure above (it has impact)
But it also important to know that when you take the Atlantic cyclic behaviour without detrending it - there is a trend. 
https://watchers.news/data/uploads/AMO%20GlobalAnnualIndexSince1856%20With11yearRunningAverage.gif
The same is true for ENSO-variability it is by definition presented in detrended form: 
https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/enso/mei.ext/ext.ts.jpg
But when it is presented with trend it looks like this: 
http://www.globalchange.gov/sites/globalchange/files/styles/resource_image/http/data.globalchange.gov/assets/0a/b5/80808dbcee337d3a219d5b96c2db/APP_GISTEMP_land-ocean_index_V5.png?itok=yU2ltmKR
So both El Nino, La Nina and ENSO-neutral years have a trend, that is removed by creating an index. 
You may ask why science do make such indeces detrended? Well - as you may have heard, ""global warming"" is in itself not spatially stationary. So one has this Polar Amplification and stuff going on. By a priori removing back-ground trends one is happier by both easing anomaly comparisons and avoid statistics going spurious because of shared underlying dependence (most statistics need data to be independent as a priori condition to be relevant. These days science goes to great length to insure this). 
Having gotten all this out of the way - would it not be nice to have data accumulating to test your hypothesis with future and better measurements? 
You should also know that when the famous Arctic explorer Nansen went to Greenland in the very early 20th century he was in awe for ice melting back to a level he thought not seen since the Vikings came there. That is a century ago. And in later years, paleo-climatology allows us to see deeper into the past:

Finally, let me share a figure from the legendary researcher Hubert Lamb who were so far ahead of his time that he made the UK Climate Research Unit (CRU) a reality in 1972 (note this figure comes from a denial web-page because they just love to misunderstand early graphs of paleoclimate)

Well, it seems typical for conventional climate activists to resort to name calling and insults.
BQENDI called no names but did tell you straight how I find your arguments, as apparently do others. Rather than address these criticisms you cry ""foul"". Tough, but this is a deadly serious, factual matter; if you can't take challenges and hard fact on the chin, then stay out of the discussion and don't squeal. It's your choice.
To recapitulate:You proposed that we didn't need any more ice-loss studies, and that someone (who?) should spend the resultant savings on propaganda. Now you're trying to blur the issue and deliver patronising advice, claiming that political transients (the follies of Brexit, Trump) prove your case. That really isn't clever. Those transients are noise, they don't show how things will evolve and they may very well be reversed. Nor do they provide grounds for abrupt changes in direction in climate matters.
As for conferences: Tokyo and Paris have been but steps in getting some sense of political urgency. Politicians are mostly a bunch of scheming, self-absorbed crooks, but gradually we will move them on towards more sensible policies and those agreements will remain to show them the right direction. It is interesting that, despite Trump, the USA seems likely to continue reducing its CO2 emissions. Meanwhile, China is forced by its own pollution crises to move swiftly towards renewables (and doing good business by selling the world renewable energy devices and low energy lighting, and even India is beginning to address the vital need for renewable power rather than power from coal and oil, if very belatedly. I am indeed impatient for change, but I see very big changes gathering in pace despite, rather than because of, our politicians.
The full consequences of man-made global warming won't affect me, but I am deeply concerned for future generations. Since before 1960 I've known about the causes and likely consequences of ever-increasing atmospheric CO2 - I'm no newbie ""climate activist"". That's nothing special, BTW, since the fundamentals of global warming were firmly established by Arrhenius and Chamberlin in the last years of the C19th, and in 1965 a US Presidential Science Advisory Committee warned of the dangers from extensive use of fossil fuels.
You show you've a foot mired in the denialist camp by questioning modern climate change modelling. ""Very weak models"", you say? Sorry, but modern climate change models now perform excellently, although clearly you are wilfully ignorant of this.
Your ""clever"" aside about weather forecasts displays bias and ignorance in equal measure. Weather is transient, unstable and may vary widely over short time scales and distances. Climate evolves slowly, inexorably, predictably and globally.
No, I occupy no ivory tower, I'm in no way defensive, and I'm glad to hear that, despite the above, you are not ""vested in the devil"".

I think you got me completely wrong. As I said, some of you guys really cannot think out of the box.Boy, now you claim to be insulted why you first wrote to me ""with minimal grasp on science and rationality"". How can you say such a thing about someone you don't know?I've been making green house simulations myself with antique computers since long before climate change, or global warming or ""the green house effect"" were in the news.I'm not denialist at all. I've been warning about the green house effect when it was still called like that. But you don't seem to understand that I fundamentally have a problem with climate models. They don't predict that in 20 years The Netherlands will be flooded or anything like that. For the general public they are not concrete enough for the world they live in. At the same time those models are not mathematical representations of the world and the systems that affect climate. The IPCC is clear about it themselves. They are trends. Very sophisticated curve fittings that have been tested on past experiences.Can past experiences teach us about the future? They surely can. In a simple model like basic gravity, hundreds of apples falling from a tree do say something about the future (to use a very simple caricature). Climate change on such a rapid scale - especially man-made - is a land where nobody has gone before. So in that case the past does not necessarily predict the future.I know weather is transient and we know much more about it. It seems climate is easier to understand because it ""evolves slowly""? Surely you must be aware of the many physical, cosmological, solar, geographical, chemical, biological, oceanic ... processes that may or may not affect climate and are not sufficiently understood to get the full picture. Also when CO2 levels have reached certain thresholds. Yes this includes all the feed-back mechanisms, and all the known and unknown thresholds. When I talk about a mathematical model, I talk about a predictive model that takes all of those into account. Also all the ""natural"" cycles we know and the ""El Ninos"" we don't know yet. Unfortunately climate science has become like a religion that is not open for new thoughts. Because then you must be open to think why the arbitrary climate cycles are taken to be 30 years why not 20, why not 50 or 100?And even if they are 30 years, why does it matter that ice loss is so rapid in a much shorter time. Aren't you then saying that climate is changing over like 5 years? It is not consistent. If you think about it those short term ice loss studies should not be relevant for 30 year climate cycles. You then have to average ice thickness over 30-year periods.But we were talking about the way climate models are interpreted by climate scientists as compared to even my very simplistic simulation greenhouse model (on a much smaller scale of course). From this perspective you cannot but agree that the current models are very weak. Otherwise you are still occupying an ivory tower.Does it mean that I am using this as a denialist argument? Not at all. I do recognize that the trends are alarming enough to be very worried about. The global temperature does seem to rise significantly with CO2 (to use short wordings - please don't attack me on that I don't go in details here).But the long-term future is uncertain. If the trends continue as they are, it will be a disaster. But it could be worse. Read what I'm saying. It could be a lot worse. In fact I think it will be. And so do many other climate scientists. (But that also shows the disagreement on the validity of the predictive climate model, of course. Let's be honest about that!) And it also makes the point that nobody can say for sure. Even a 95% probability is not a certainty. I also have a problem with the fundamentals how IPCC uses probability. It's more qualitative than quantitative. 90% can actually be 99% or 70%.But as I said, I would say that the trends are disturbing enough to take drastic action before it's too late (and with the delay times in such a system it could already be too late)So in fact I'm even for a more drastic reduction of CO2.

There are four decisions made in plotting these graphs that are problematic: 
Choice of baseline,Inconsistent smoothing,Incomplete representation of the initial condition and structural uncertainty in the models,No depiction of the structural uncertainty in the satellite observations.Each of these four choices separately (and even more so together) has the effect of making the visual discrepancy between the models and observational products larger, misleading the reader as to the magnitude of the discrepancy and, therefore, it’s potential cause(s).

The row has erupted after a key polar satellite broke down a few days ago, leaving the US with only three ageing ones, each operating long past their shelf lives, to measure the Arctic’s dwindling ice cap. Scientists say there is no chance a new one can now be launched until 2023 or later. None of the current satellites will still be in operation then.
The crisis has been worsened because the US Congress this year insisted that a backup sea-ice probe had to be dismantled because it did not want to provide funds to keep it in storage. Congress is currently under the control of Republicans, who are antagonistic to climate science and the study of global warming.
“This is like throwing away the medical records of a sick patient,” said David Gallaher of the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado. “Our world is ailing and we have apparently decided to undermine, quite deliberately, the effectiveness of the records on which its recovery might be based. It is criminal.”
The threat to the US sea-ice monitoring programme – which supplies data to scientists around the world – will trigger further accusations at this week’s international climate talks in Bonn that the Trump administration is trying to block studies of global warming for ideological reasons.
Earth’s sea ice has shrunk dramatically – particularly in the Arctic – in recent years as rising emissions of greenhouse gases have warmed the planet. Satellites have been vital in assessing this loss, thanks mainly to America’s Defence Meteorological Satellite Programme (DMSP), which has overseen the construction of eight F-series satellites that use microwaves sensors to monitor sea-ice coverage. These probes, which have lifespans of three to five years, have shown that millions of square kilometres of sea ice have disappeared from the Arctic over the past 20 years, allowing less solar energy to be reflected back into space – and so further increasing global temperatures – while also disrupting Inuit life and wildlife in the region.
At present three ageing satellites – DMSP F16, F17 and F18 – remain in operation, though they are all beginning to drift out of their orbits over the poles. The latest satellite in the series, F19, began to suffer sensor malfunctions last year and finally broke down a few weeks ago. It should have been replaced with the F20 probe, which had already been built and was being kept in storage by the US Air Force. However it had to be destroyed, on the orders of the US Congress, on the grounds that its storage was too costly.
Many scientists say this decision was made for purely ideological reasons. They also warn that many other projects for monitoring climate change, including several satellite missions, face similar threats from the Trump administration and Congress.
Such losses have serious consequences, say researchers. “Sea-ice data provided by satellites is essential for initiating climate models and validating them,” said Andrew Fleming of the British Antarctic Survey. “We will be very much the poorer without that information.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/nov/05/donald-trump-accused-blocking-satellite-climate-change-research

It is taking place in Bonn, Germany from 6-17 November. 
Climate change is already significantly increasing the likelihood of extreme weather, from heatwaves to floods. But without sharp cuts to global carbon emissions, we can expect “severe, widespread, and irreversible impacts” for billions of people and the natural world. The landmark Paris agreement at COP21 in 2015 delivered the first truly global deal to tackle climate change, but national action needs to be significantly toughened to meet to goal of keeping global temperature rise to well below 2C, and 1.5C if possible. 
All the science, and the battering that extreme weather has inflicted this year from floods in India and Nigeria to hurricanes in the Caribbean and wildfires in the US and Europe, indicates that global emissions need to start falling urgently – in the next few years. The Paris agreement set out principles, but not the details, with one diplomat likening it to having a brilliant new smartphone but no operating system. The Bonn meeting will be vital in building the rules that will enable the Paris deal to work.
COPs are always run by a designated nation and for the first time this will be one of the small island nations that are most at risk from the sea-level rise and extreme storms that climate change is bringing. Fiji’s prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, is the COP president, though the summit is being held in Germany for practical reasons. Fiji suffered damages of well over $1bn after Cyclone Winston struck in 2016, which is likely to focus attention on the contentious issue of compensation for climate damage and adapting to future threats, as much as cutting emissions.
No. As the world’s second biggest polluter and richest nation, the US is important. But when President Trump announced the US withdrawal in June – it takes effect in 2020 – the UN’s chief climate negotiator, who delivered the Paris deal, ended up thanking him. “It provoked an unparalleled wave of support for the treaty,” said Christiana Figueres. “He shored up the world’s resolve on climate action, and for that we can all be grateful.”
The US now seems very isolated – only war-torn Syria is also outside the Paris deal. What role they will play in Bonn is largely unknown, though promotion of coal and gas as climate solutions is planned. Rumours that the climate-sceptic head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, would lead the US delegation proved unfounded however. One COP veteran said: “The mood on the ground is it is going to be OK: the US is not going to be a pain in the arse. They still don’t know what they actually want.” Nazhat Shameem Khan, Fiji’s chief negotiator was even less diplomatic when asked about dealing with the US: “You can have a dialogue [even] with somebody who is an axe murderer.”
In any case, many US states, cities and businesses have pledged to honour the Paris deal and will have a high profile in Bonn. Former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg has said he will pay the $15m in UNFCCC administration costs if the US government does not. 
The current pledges for carbon cuts by the world’s nations would mean at least 3C of global warming and severe damage. So the Paris agreement included a mechanism for the pledges to be reviewed and ratcheted up, but without setting the rules. The vital groundwork for this has to be done in Bonn before being finalised in 2018. Without serious preparation to build trust and agreement, deals don’t get done, as the failed COP in Copenhagen in 2009 showed. Fiji has renamed the ratchet talks process from the bland “facilitative dialogue” to the “talanoa dialogue” after a Pacific island concept of using storytelling and talking as a way to make good decisions.
Yes. There are deep and longstanding tensions over the issue of “loss and damage”, the idea that developing nations should be compensated for destruction resulting from climate change which they did little or nothing to cause. “The principle is one of compensation because the western countries developed their economies at the expense of the planet and of poor people,” says Dorothy Grace Guerrero, at campaign group Global Justice Now. The stakes are heightened further as some developing nations feel they lost out in the Paris agreement which, unlike previous deals, does not impose legally binding commitments on rich nations.
There is a strand of the negotiations tackling this – the Warsaw mechanism – but they have a “glaring omission”, according to aid groups: no money. The rich nations are opposed to loss and damage payments, seeing them as similar to calls for reparations for slavery.
The issue is highly charged and needs to be resolved to prevent harm spreading to other areas of negotiation. Widespread and cheap insurance against extreme weather is a compromise being heavily pushed by western nations, for example the G7’s InsuResilience initiative aimed at helping 400 million of the world’s poorest people. But it is unclear how insurance could solve slow and inevitable problems like overwhelming sea-level rise on low-level coasts.
Rich nations had already pledged to provide $100bn a year by 2020 to help poorer nations restrict their emissions as they grow and adapt to climate change. But there are rows about what kind of funding should be counted and indeed whether $100bn is enough. The US was expected to be a big contributor and so a question to be tackled in Bonn is whether other countries will pick up the tab.
Nations do the negotiating but business groups pledging action also attend, such as the Renewable Energy 100 and We Mean Business, and in Bonn the California governor Jerry Brown and Bloomberg are expected to make a splash with an announcement about their America’s Pledge initiative on 11 November.
The presence of big fossil fuel companies is always controversial: detractors say their lobbying hinders progress while defenders say the low-carbon revolution won’t happen without getting them on board. The civil society groups that are always a big part of every COP will protest on this issue, in particular against the lignite coal industry near Bonn that still provides a lot of Germany’s power. “Some of our guests will be fairly surprised to see just how much Germany still relies on coal,” says Annalena Baerbock, climate spokesperson of Germany’s Green party.
NGOs also pressure nations to increase their ambition and aid smaller nations that lack the negotiating resources of the bigger countries. COPs are certainly becoming broader, with Figueres saying: “Paris is everyone’s deal. It belongs to cities, businesses, NGOs and all of global civil society as much as it belongs to nation-states.” 
There will be 10,000 government delegates, another 8,000 people from other groups and 2,000 members of the media travelling to Bonn from all over the globe. The organisers are trying to avoid as many emissions as possible, for example by using electric buses for conference transport. But the emissions that can’t be avoided will be offset, mainly using UN-certified schemes in small island states, in recognition of Fiji’s presidency of the COP.
An editorial in the leading science journal Nature, which calls the Paris accord a “triumph”, puts it succinctly: “In theory, the annual climate roller coaster is idling through one of the low-key phases in which success is measured by nothing going wrong. In practice, the Bonn meeting will serve as a litmus test of how the rest of the world plans to stand united [without the US] and to keep the spirit of Paris alive.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/05/the-cop23-climate-change-summit-in-bonn-and-why-it-matters

The 26-year-old from Wolverhampton, who “married into Yorkshire”, quit her job working for York council in November last year, deciding to devote herself to the cause.
Since September, when Third Energy started preparing the site at Kirby Misperton for fracking, she has been one of a group of around forty Ryedale locals to have spent almost every day protesting next to the gates to the well, holding banners and placards, and watching in dismay as lorries trundle in.
Coghill says that apart from environmental concerns, her opposition to fracking comes from a desire to protect her home. “Yorkshire is stunning,” she says. “It’s so gorgeous and I don’t think people realise that’s not a given. People don’t seem to realise that it can be taken away.” 
The business secretary, Greg Clark, is expected to give Third Energy its final permission to begin test fracking any day now, with the company saying the site is nearly ready for the process to begin. The fracking would be the first to take place in the UK since 2011, when two tremors of magnitude 1.5 and 2.3 woke people from their sleep after tests near Blackpool. If the trial run is a success, it will pave the way for the site to operate permanently. 
In a bid to stop the fracking, some campaigners have deployed non-violent direct action tactics including lying on the road to prevent vehicles from entering the site, climbing on lorries and, on one occasion recently, scaling an 18-metre (60ft) rig and waving flares. North Yorkshire police have had a permanent presence at the protest since it was scaled up in September, and accusations of disproportionate and aggressive policing are rife among campaigners. 
Officers regularly outnumber protesters by more than two to one, and the force revealed last month that the additional cost of policing the protests had been £80,238 up to 31 August and £101,476 in September alone. There have been 68 arrests and 62 charges to date.
The Guardian photographer Gary Calton wrote to the region’s police and crime commissioner last week after he was restrained by police officers twice in one day in a bid to stop him from taking pictures. “I’ve been a photographer for 27 years, photographing around the world in contentious situations, I’ve never had a police man hold my arms and stop me from working,” he said.
Carol Towner, 53, from the nearby town of Pickering, says she was charged with assaulting a police officer following a claim she had spilt hot coffee on the officer’s leg during a tussle at the gates to the well site. She denies the charge. A former Tory voter, she says she always taught her children to respect authority and the police, but has had her world view turned on its head after joining the campaign.
“Having seen the way the police have been dishing out their aggression, the way I’ve been manhandled, the way my children have been kettled … I can’t stand in my former Tory blue shoes and say that I believe in what they’re doing.”
Amanda Oliver, assistant chief constable of North Yorkshire, said the force’s duty was first and foremost to ensure the safety of everyone involved in the protest at Kirby Misperton. “This is a particularly challenging task for our officers, especially when there are large groups of people which include a mixture of peaceful protesters – the majority – along with a minority who are intent on taking unlawful action to disrupt the movement of large vehicles to and from the well site,” she said.
“This unlawful action has already caused a great deal of disruption within the local community, which is unacceptable. As well as facilitating people’s right to assemble and protest peacefully, part of our role is to keep disruption to local residents and businesses to a minimum.” She added that “the valuable role [the media plays] in covering this important issue” has been stressed to officers on the ground.
A spokesperson for Third Energy said the company respected the right to lawful and peaceful protest, but that “the residents of Ryedale and Third Energy have the same expectation that we and they should be able to go about our lawful business”.
While proponents say fracking could meet the country’s energy needs for generations and reduce its reliance on imported gas post-Brexit, campaigners argue that it is dangerous industry – citing concerns over water contamination, earth quakes and the destruction of the landscape.
Government figures out on Thursday showed public opposition to fracking was at an all-time high, with 36% opposing it, 13% supporting it, and 48% neither supporting nor opposing it. While two-thirds of England’s land is available for fracking licenses, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales, France and Germany have all blocked the practice because of safety concerns.
Coghill acknowledges that she is unlikely to stop test fracking from taking place, but insists she will keep fighting the fracking industry at every corner. Kirby Misperton is the tip of the iceberg, she says. “The people who are holding out hope that this is all going to go away when the test frack is complete don’t understand what it really means for the area, and for the country.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/05/fracking-protester-warns-yorkshires-gorgeous-but-that-can-be-taken-away

Researchers believe the truffle, mostly found in northern Spain, southern France and northern Italy, was able to grow in Wales due to climate change.
It was grown in Monmouthshire as part of a project run by the truffle firm Mycorrhizal Systems Ltd (MSL) and was harvested in March 2017 by a trained dog named Bella.
The aromatic fungus was growing within the root system of a Mediterranean oak tree that was planted in 2008 and treated to encourage truffle production.
It had been inoculated with truffle spores, and the surrounding soil was made less acidic by treating it with lime.
Further microscopic and genetic analysis confirmed that Bella’s find was a Périgord black truffle (Tuber melanosporum).
Dr Paul Thomas, of MSL and the University of Stirling, said: “This cultivation has shown that the climatic tolerance of truffles is much broader than previously thought, but it’s likely that it’s only possible because of climate change, and some areas of the UK – including the area around Cambridge – are now suitable for the cultivation of this species.”
The black truffle is one of the world’s most expensive ingredients, worth as much as £1,700 per kilogram, but its Mediterranean habitat has been affected by drought due to long-term climate change, and yields are falling while the global demand continues to rise.
“This is one of the best-flavoured truffle species in the world and the potential for industry is huge,” said Thomas.
“We planted the trees just to monitor their survival, but we never thought this Mediterranean species could actually grow in the UK – it’s an incredibly exciting development.”
A study by the firm, together with Cambridge University, has been published in the journal Climate Research and suggests that truffle cultivation may be possible in many parts of the UK.
But Prof Ulf Büntgen of Cambridge’s department of geography said: “It’s a risky investment for farmers. Even though humans have been eating truffles for centuries, we know remarkably little about how they grow and how they interact with their host trees.”
The first truffle to be cultivated in the UK was a burgundy truffle in Leicestershire in 2015. This is the first time the more valuable black Périgord truffle has been cultivated in such a northern and maritime climate.
The first harvested truffle, which weighed 16g, has been preserved for posterity, but in future, the truffles will be distributed to restaurants in the UK.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/06/joining-in-the-fungi-black-truffle-grown-in-uk-for-first-time

Compressed or frozen air is pretty good, and hydrogen from excess solar/wind although the least efficient at 50% can be integrated into the current gas infrastructure.
If we were to do a Manhattan Project then it would certainly be extremely productive simply by having so many researchers work in a coordinated way.
But what do we have in the tool box-We have proven house building in the passivehaus standard - and even retrofitting has a pay back.we have an alternative to gas central heating- heat pumps and heat exchangers.we have an alternative to the car with the EV [which even now is cheaper to run and buy in its entire life]we have solar hitting parity now.we have proven tech with wind- and the next gen of 12-15 MW offshore already on the drawing board.
And you are correct- do we have equivalent of the spinning inertia that great big coal and nuclear power stations that have so much momentum that they keep the grid really close to 50 hz. I asked someone in the business- could that be replaced with batteries? and the answer was 'maybe'.
For most of the western world we can install about 50% RE before there is any problem- so we have about 10 -15 years to work out the challenge.Ideally pumped hydro would be the answer.
We are talking at national level- but say we got small, down to the household, down to the shop, business or warehouse. If you have a roof of solar then for 9 months of the year in Europe you are going to be off grid- the small business or warehouse or store probably has more roof space or carpark than they need if they converted it solar.
More intense businesses would need half from the grid.

I want to see cash committed to a massive global research-program on storage. Pumped hydro is fine where there are slopes. The rest should be fixable within a few years. In nations needing heating - energy-for-gass cycles could make sense - if using spill-heat for remote heating, for example. Molten salt is scaling nicely. Compressed gas - even flywheels for flattening day-cycles. 
Why? Because storage is democratic once efficiency/cost is right. Allowing for all sorts of local energy mixes and scales.

Hiya. No simple answer. My heating was on for an hour this morning, but temp in living room being maintained by a small ASHP (air con unit) which is mostly being supplied by PV currently.
Better insulation is always a good start. Heat pumps help. Ecotricity are looking at producing methane from grass mills, so sustainable / CO2 free over a 12 month period/cycle. Then perhaps power to gas (P2G) using excess leccy generation from renewables at times of high supply and or low demand. This could be used for leccy generation (fuel cells or gas generation plant) or even for injection into the national gas grid.
There is hope, and best of all, many of the options fit nicely together, such as renewable leccy with P2G for GCH and so on, and so on.', u'recommendation_count': u'3', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1509967160000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'11150889', u'in_reply_to': u'107820580', u'id': u'107821158', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'daveinbrum', u'text': u'Obviously Trump's withdrawal from the Paris agreement was appalling but it matters less than it once would have.

""The left, having excoriated the right for its intellectual dishonesty and turned climate denialism into a political rallying cry, was now in an impossible position. It had to keep insisting on the truth of climate science while persisting in the fiction that collective world action could stave off the worst of it: that universal acceptance of the facts, which really might have changed everything in 1995, could still change everything ... Denying the dark reality, pretending that the Paris accord could avert catastrophe, was understandable as a tactic to keep people motivated to reduce emissions; to keep hope alive. As a strategy, though, it did more harm than good. It ceded the ethical high ground, insulted the intelligence of unpersuaded voters (“Really? We still have 10 years?”), and precluded frank discussion of how the global community should prepare for drastic changes""

It is one of the building blocks of Fijian society, used for centuries to foster greater understanding among a people distributed over many small islands, and carry them through a tough existence.
This week, talanoa comes to Europe, and the rest of the world. Fiji is hosting the UN’s climate talks, following on from the landmark Paris agreement of 2015, and will hold the conference in Bonn, Germany. Talanoa will be the founding principle of the conference, the means by which Fiji hopes to break through some of the seemingly intractable problems that have made these 20-plus years of negotiations a source of bitter conflict.
“Talanoa is a process of inclusive, participatory and transparent dialogue that builds empathy and leads to decision-making for the collective good,” said Frank Bainimarama, prime minister of Fiji. “It is not about finger pointing and laying blame but about listening to each other. By focusing on the benefits of action [against climate change] this process will move the global climate agenda forward.”
The most likely subject of finger-pointing will be Donald Trump. The US president this summer announced the withdrawal of the US from the Paris agreement. This was a blow to the 194 other countries which signed up to the 2015 accord, because the US is the world’s second biggest emitter of fossil fuels, after China.
Michael Bloomberg, the former Republican mayor of New York, said Trump’s White House did not speak for the rest of the US. “[This week] I’ll help lead a delegation of US mayors, governors and CEOs and we will deliver a unified message: Americans remain committed to meeting our commitment under the Paris agreement, no matter what happens in Washington. We can get there.”
Yet the divisions likely to be caused by Trump’s stance should not be underestimated. Gaining a consensus involving the US and China was arguably the biggest achievement of Paris – the first time that all developed and developing countries had signed a pact vowing to limit global warming to 2C, which scientists say is the limit of safety. The history of the UN negotiations has been littered with attempts at such an agreement that fell short – the Kyoto protocol of 1997, the Copenhagen conference of 2009 – so when the gavel came down on the Paris agreement, it was an unparalleled landmark in the history of the world’s fight against climate change. The negotiations under the UN on a global agreement have been going on since 1992. Meanwhile, the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have steadily increased, reaching levels not seen for 800,000 years.
At Bonn, Trump’s team are reportedly preparing to inflame the talks yet further, by concentrating on the supposed benefits of coal-fired power.
Fiji hopes to confine the White House’s activities to a sideshow. There are two substantive issues to be discussed at this conference, which will carry on whatever the US position is. First is the “ratchet” – the means by which the pledges on emissions made at Paris will be increased in future years, in line with scientific advice. Second, and of huge importance to the hosts, is the question of adaptation to the effects of climate change.
Adaptation was long a dirty word at climate change conferences. Civil society groups feared that espousing, and devoting money to, the means of staving off the worst effects of warming – walls against sea level rises, dykes and floating houses, changes to agriculture to grow heat-adapted crops – would distract attention from the urgent business of reducing emissions. For Fiji and other Pacific islands, however, the effects of climate change are already being felt, and finding ways to reduce their impact will be crucial in the years to come.
One way round this has been to change the emphasis. Instead of adaptation, countries are now talking about resilience – a more positive term, suggesting empowerment and action, rather than giving in to a threat.
“We want resilient development,” said Lord Stern, former chief economist of the World Bank and author of the landmark 2006 review of the economics of climate change. “This is a development-oriented idea. We used to have the idea that it is more expensive to build things that are low-carbon, but that was wrong. Development should be resilient and sustainable. Whenever I come across the word adaptation, I delete it and put in resilience.”
Building resilience has advantages that go far beyond climate change – improvements to infrastructure, and a better evolved response to natural disasters such as tsunamis and earthquakes that have nothing to do with global warming – and can also help to improve the quality of people’s lives, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
For instance, improved public transport systems would have a huge economic benefit in many developing countries, would reduce reliance on fossil fuels, and could be built in such a way as to be resistant against encroaching climate change. Buildings constructed with climate change in mind would also be more efficient, resistant to extreme heat, and against the storms, floods and droughts that are likely to become more frequent under global warming.
At Bonn, discussions are likely to focus on how to help developing countries become more resilient, and the financing that may be available for them to do so. The latter could be a combination of overseas aid from major economies, and investment from the private sector. These discussions, however, are still at an early stage and there may be little concrete outcome on them from the talks other than a decision to keep talking.
Yet the most pressing issue of the conference is likely to be the one that receives least public attention, and deliberately so. Known as the “facilitative dialogue”, this is a crucial – but overlooked – rider to the Paris agreement.
At Paris, countries acknowledged that their pledges to curb greenhouse gas emissions fell well short of the reductions advised by scientists. In order to forge the agreement, they made a compromise: in future years, they would ratchet up their pledges to the levels required.
This made agreement at Paris possible, but it effectively put off the toughest negotiations to future years of talks. The difficulty of resolving this should not be underestimated. Currently, none of the world’s biggest emitters can agree on how any such ratchet mechanism would work. Should countries, for instance, take on more stringent emissions goals simply by adding a certain amount to their current pledges? Or should their future pledges be calculated based on their projected economic growth? How should the responsibility for historic emissions be taken into account? What status should be given to scientific advice on how to keep within the 2C limit? 
Most countries want to ensure that their pledges are entirely of their own devising, rather than reached in consensus with the rest of the UN, but it is unclear what would happen if these pledges are inadequate. The work is made harder still by deficiencies in collating reliable and up-to-date data on each country’s emissions.
The discussions on the ratchet mechanism are known in the UN jargon as “the facilitative dialogue”, a name that disguises the fraught nature of these negotiations. Given the lack of consensus among major countries on how any such ratchet mechanism should work, and the adamant refusal of the US to take part in further pledges, it may take much more than talanoa – and years more of tough negotiations – to come up with a solution to this conundrum.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/06/bonn-climate-talks-must-go-further-than-paris-pledges-to-succeed

To make it abundantly clear I will answer your question with three questions, each of which I will answer.
1) Where does the money come from to pay the price of your car? Not the taxpayer. It is the consumer of the product. It is you, the car buyer. The fact that you happen to pay taxes has nothing to do with it. No money from the US Treasury is expended. The entire amount is paid for by you.

Not the taxpayer. It is the consumer of the product. It is you, the car buyer. The fact that you happen to pay taxes has nothing to do with it. No money from the US Treasury is expended.
3) If the government implements reforms that recognize that buying and storing a strategic 90 day reserve of fuel is a legitimate cost, adding to the price of buying electricity of generating electricity, where does the money for this price increase come from?

I beg to differ. Although some of the science is clear, for example that humans are largely responsible for the current dangerously rapid global warming, much is not.
We have never watched an ice sheet retreat before, so we are making educated guesses about future rates of sea level rise.
It is not the current rate of around a third of a meter per century (up from 8cm per century in the 19th century) which concerns glaciologists, but a past rate from 14,600 years ago of 4m per century for 4 centuries.

This article has (as might be expected from the Blog) focussed entirely on Bridenstine’s (un)suitability to run climate research. Personally I think there are plenty of agencies and universities in the world doing this. My interest is in how well can this guy drive a space programme, and how ambitious is he in this regard? Following the Japanese discovery of what is apparently a suitable lava tunnel on the Moon, there appears to be international interest in establishing a base on the Moon. Will NASA help to push the initiative along, rather than leave it to the Europeans, who appear to be enthused with the idea. Will NASA also make progress towards putting people on Mars - presumably the start of some sort of colony? 
As for the climate stuff - there is no reason why NASA actually has to be at the forefront of climate research on Earth. And as for putting up satellites etc, the Kazakhs, Indians, Chinese, and even private industry appears to be capable of doing that.

How do you get people to understand the need for prompt action when the rate of change, while geologically rapid, appears slow, and for many in the wealthy countries, not yet severe?
A number of Republican lawmakers privately understand the threat, according to Michael Mann, based on conversations he’s had with them, but they said they need to hear from their constituents to act.
Even reputable newspapers like the NY Times have fallen down on educating the public about climate science. When they do run an article it is generally excellent, but they could run more articles and place them more prominently.
And news from outlets like Fox or Info Wars actively spread disinformation on the subject.
There are promising signs like decreases in cost of renewables, but I think we’re still getting over 80 percent of our energy from fossil fuels and for that to change faster we need to do things like price carbon honestly, stop subsidizing fossil fuels, increase subsidies for renewables and figure out how to remove a lot of carbon from the atmosphere.

He’s a Republican Congressman from Oklahoma and former Navy pilot. He also has a history of denying basic climate science. That’s concerning because Nasa does some of the world’s best climate science research, and Bridenstine previously introduced legislation that would eliminate Earth science from Nasa’s mission statement.
At his Senate hearing last week, Bridenstine tried to remake his image. He said that his previous science-denying, politically polarizing comments came with the job of being a Republican congressman, and that as Nasa administrator he would be apolitical. A kinder, gentler Bridenstine. But while he softened his climate science denial, his proclaimed new views remain in line with the rest of the harshly anti-science Trump administration. That’s very troubling.
The standard Trump administration position on climate change, held by administration officials like EPA Administrator Scott Priutt and Energy Secretary Rick Perry, is that humans are contributing to global warming, but we don’t know how much. Bridenstine repeated that position in a tense exchange with Senator Brian Schatz (D-HI).
To be clear, the Trump administration stance is unequivocally wrong. The last IPCC report concluded with 95% confidence that humans are the primary cause of global warming since 1950, and its best estimate was that humans are responsible for all of the global warming during that time. That’s also the conclusion of the just-released US National Climate Assessment Report, which states:
Many lines of evidence demonstrate that it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. Over the last century, there are no convincing alternative explanations supported by the extent of the observational evidence. Solar output changes and internal natural variability can only contribute marginally to the observed changes in climate over the last century, and we find no convincing evidence for natural cycles in the observational record that could explain the observed changes in climate. (Very high confidence)
As many scientists pointed out, this is not new information.
Lolz. Newsflash. https://t.co/RGeE9XpRCC
New report, same as the old report. Climate change projections remain unchanged. pic.twitter.com/ZdY5pecQfL
But it nevertheless directly contradicts Bridenstine’s comments. In response to Sen. Schatz’s question about the expert consensus that humans are the primary cause of global warming, Bridenstine said:
It’s going to depend on a lot of factors and we’re still learning more about that every day. In some years you could say absolutely, in other years, during sun cycles and other things, there are other contributing factors that would have maybe more of an impact.
Aside from being wrong about the sun’s influence on recent climate change (which if anything is in the direction of cooling), Bridenstine also displayed a lack of understanding of what climate change is. Climate changes are defined on timescales of several decades, not year-to-year variations.
As Senator Schatz noted, we shouldn’t fault Bridenstine for his lack of understanding of basic climate science. But we should fault him for failing to defer to the expert consensus on a subject about which he lacks basic understanding. Bridenstine claimed to believe that the expert consensus is merely that humans are causing some global warming. That’s incorrect, and in fact Nasa climate scientists published a paper in 2010 entitled Atmospheric CO2: Principal Control Knob Governing Earth’s Temperature. And Nasa itself is quite clear about the expert consensus.

Bridenstine’s testimony was that of a completely different person than Rep. Jim Bridenstine (R-OK). He said that he would be an apolitical administrator; he accepted at least some very basic climate science; said he would support Nasa’s climate science research; would no longer support discrimination of LBGT Americans; etc.
However, in their congressional hearings, Scott Pruitt and Rick Perry also accepted the century-old science telling us that humans contribute to global warming. In the time since the Senate confirmed their appointments, the Trump administration has begun the processes to withdraw the US from the international Paris climate agreement and repeal the Clean Power Plan. Climate change has been deleted from government websites, the EPA is barring many scientists from serving on its science advisory boards, EPA climate scientists have been censored, and the Department of Energy is perversely trying to bail out the failing coal industry with taxpayer subsidies. Oh, and one of Pruitt’s new EPA science advisors thinks America’s air is too clean.
This has been the most anti-science administration in American history, and it began with Trump’s nominees taking the same watered-down climate science denial position that Bridenstine took in his hearing. The Trump administration’s actions, combined with Bridenstine’s own history of climate science denial and opposition to Nasa’s climate science research, should trigger alarm bells for the senators voting on his confirmation.
However, the congressional hearing showed why we can expect most Republican senators to vote to confirm Bridenstine. The hearing was held by the Senate Commerce, Science, &amp; Transportation Committee, whose members one would hope are relatively scientifically literate. Sadly, much like its sister House (Anti-)Science Committee, that’s not the case.
For example, Senator James ‘global warming is the greatest hoax’ Inhofe (R-OK) sits on the senate science committee. During the hearing, Inhofe proclaimed “This 97 percent [expert climate consensus] stuff has been debunked completely and everybody knows that.” That claim is of course entirely false. Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) said, “It’s my understanding that it’s not even the position of Nasa at this point that there is a consensus that [climate change is primarily caused by human activity].” Senator Lee’s understanding is wrong. Nasa has a whole page on its website devoted to explaining why “most climate scientists agree the main cause of the current global warming trend is human expansion of the ‘greenhouse effect.’” 
Senator Roger Wicker (R-MS) had the most ant-science statement of the hearing, criticizing “the audacity to think that we are so important that we are causing that climate change.” Wicker didn’t deny the existence of the scientific consensus, but dismissed it because consensus “hasn’t always been right,” inappropriately citing Galileo as an example.
It’s almost 2018 and these are the comments being made about climate change by the Republican members of the senate science committee. Until he had an apparently sudden change of heart coinciding with his nomination to run Nasa, Bridenstine shared those climate denial beliefs, and like the rest of Trump’s cabinet, he still doesn’t accept the overwhelming scientific consensus.
In his testimony, Bridenstine promised not to interfere with Nasa’s climate science research, but given the Trump administration’s war on climate science and Bridenstine’s alignment with that political agenda in the very recent past, it’s difficult to take him at his word. Democrats on the Science Committee expressed deep skepticism of Bridenstine’s sudden change of heart, and given the anti-climate science behavior of the rest of the Trump administration, that skepticism is wholly justified. 
If the Republican majority confirms Bridenstine, we can only hope he is sincere in changing his ways and leaving behind the politicized climate science denial exemplified by his Republican congressional colleagues.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/nov/06/we-have-every-reason-to-fear-trumps-pick-to-head-nasa

So it has been alleged for decades, but Armageddon keeps getting postponed.
I don't deny that we are screwing up the environment at a frightening rate, are causing a mass extinction, and are going to live through some very perilous times. But most of that is caused by greed, not by rising populations. 
The crash in insect populations in Germany reported recently was not caused by overpopulation in Asia or Africa - it was caused by excessive use of insecticides, primarily to increase yields and profits. As Monbiot keeps repeatingly pointing out on these pages, EU agricultural policies continue to subsidise the destruction of the environment, not to feed the hungry in overpopulated regions but to keep some farmers and landowners in luxury.
Fertility has already fallen in many places and continues to fall wherever there is decent development, women's education and reasonable economic opportunity. Projected populations can easily be fed if the world adopts a diet that is much more vegetarian / vegan. Most poor people in the Third World are already on such a diet by necessity.

Why is price no object when the conversation's on renewbles+ the hidden costs of storage - but all of a sudden it's critical when discussing nuclear? 

BQSTART
it comes down to who is paying for it-
BQEND
BQENDThat's not a response to my question though.
The consumer pays for their electricity either in bills or in taxes no matter what the source - 
A few LED lights on a pv+battery in a village isn't even a stop gap, it is at best an emergency measure - India needs a power infrastructure, and we all need that to be as low a carbon source as possible.
We can demand that they be low carbon, but we cannot demand that they rerstrict their growth and requirements of the massive poverty stricken strata of their population..In the UK, the price we are currently paying for solar and wind is significantly more than the cost of nuclear and that's with only an additional £10-16/MWh for intermittency because penetration is still low and we have a massive gas counterweight... that we need to come off*. - yet people hark on about the cost of nuclear as if it is unique.
In the UK the BEIS and NAO expect the prices of new nuclear to fall to 60-99/MWh by 2030 (bearing in mind HPC is £89.50/MWh (2012 prices) then it's almost certainly going to be at the lower end of that scale).
*Funny thing gas - the pseudo greens have managed to stop the government funding CCS without any backlash, whilst at the same time opposing fraccing, thus tying us into ever increasing gas imports at a massively higher carbon footprint (90g/kwh) than our own.They also oppose nuclear - the one technology that takes us off coal AND gas.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1510111340000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'penetration is still low and we have a massive gas counterweight', u'effect': u""that 's with only an additional \xa3 10 16/mwh""}], u'author_id': u'14842422', u'in_reply_to': u'107865915', u'id': u'107900382', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'babaram', u'text': u'Please spare us the obscure references to 1970s movies.

Unless you mean everything is a ""non event"" outside of India and China, since they comprise a third of the population of the world.
But for good measure, the fact of the matter is that nuclear power is underway in most of the developed and developing nations of the world. Especially those with high populations. India, China, US, Pakistan and Mexico all have established nuclear energy programmes. Nigeria and Bangladesh are just starting their first nuclear powerstations.

'No one questions India’s right to develop' Why does development with a nation always mean it is inextricably linked with population growth?
BQEND
I didn't see them say that. You can have development for the existing people, with no population growth. Indian birthrate is down to 2.2 and still falling, so they should reach 2.1 (no growth) very soon.
BQSTART
The same is true in the UK where most politicians correlate economic growth with increasing the number of migrant workers.

Intermittency is the only issue that I concur is a problem, and this can be overcome in the short term with natural gas, and in the longer term with yet to be refined energy storage.

it comes down to who is paying for it- solar and even solar with batteries makes a lot of sense in India because individuals and business can buy it as a back up for day time use [given the intermittent nature of the grid ]. And on a village level it is cheaper to stick in some solar with a little storage [to run lights and t.v.] than connect it to the grid.
This is a disruption from below.Fast breeder reactors cost about twice as much to run rather than once through- and as frequently pointed out uranium costs could double with little impact on generation costs.India has a lot of thorium so its modified PWRs is sensible but it still needs huge investment to build more. Private investment avoids nuclear [even in the secure West] so the money comes from government - yet the big central grid producers are being undermined by solar and wind which is being paid for at consumer level and getting the international investment.So it is not about cost but who is prepared to invest.', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1510051198000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'individuals and business can buy it as a back up for day time use given', u'effect': u'makes a lot of sense in india'}], u'author_id': u'4738374', u'in_reply_to': u'107852258', u'id': u'107865915', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'BonyTony', u'text': u'Sorry, I should have tested it first.

He lives in Rajghat, a village on the border of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh states, and until very recently was one of the 240 million Indians who live without electricity. In the poverty that results, Rajghat has become a village of bachelors, with just two weddings in 20 years.
“No one wants to give their daughter to me,” says Sudama, another young man. “People come, they visit, but they see the conditions here and they leave.” 
For now, the technology is proving most useful to Rajesh as a way to charge his mobile phone, saving a lengthy journey to the nearest city, but he also hopes for future benefits: “I’ll use this to let my children study.”
According to an ambitious pledge by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, every Indian will have electricity, and the education, health and business benefits that follow, by the end of 2018. But how Modi achieves that, and the development of what will soon become the world’s most populous nation, matters to the entire world.
Of all the most polluting nations – US, China, Russia, Japan and the EU bloc – only India’s carbon emissions are rising: they rose almost 5% in 2016. No one questions India’s right to develop, or the fact that its current emissions per person are tiny. But when building the new India for its 1.3 billion people, whether it relies on coal and oil or clean, green energy will be a major factor in whether global warming can be tamed.
“India is the frontline state,” says Samir Saran, at the Observer Research Foundation in Delhi. “Two-thirds of India is yet to be built. So please understand, 16% of mankind is going to seek the American dream. If we can give it to them on a frugal climate budget, we will save the planet. If we don’t, we will either destroy India or destroy the planet.”
This view is shared internationally: Christiana Figueres, the UN’s former climate chief who delivered the landmark Paris climate change agreement says India is “very, very important” for everybody, and the nation will play a key role at the UN summit that starts in Bonn, Germany next week. 
Lord Nicholas Stern, the climate economist who has worked in India for 40 years, says a polluting, high-carbon development would leave India alone accounting for a huge chunk of the world’s future emissions, making it “very difficult” to keep the global temperature rise below the internationally agreed danger limit of 2C.
What will happen remains in the balance. “Anyone who claims to be able to predict India’s emissions in 2030 doesn’t have a lot of humility,” says Navroz Dubash, a senior fellow at the Centre for Policy Research in Delhi.
But what is clear is the scale of the challenge. “India has a vast amount of energy-using infrastructure yet to be put in place,” says Ajay Mathur, the head of the Energy and Resources Institute, an influential Delhi-based thinktank. “No matter what numbers you look at, we will at least double or double-and-a-half our energy consumption in the decade to 2030.”
India is embarking on one of the fastest rural-to-urban transitions in human history, with 200 million more city dwellers expected by 2030, all using new buildings, roads and cars. In this context, keeping the rise in emissions to just a doubling would be truly remarkable, says Stern, and leave India’s emissions per person well below the current global average.
But India’s vast population means that even small increases in emissions per person add up to a huge amount of carbon dioxide and India is likely to become the world’s biggest polluter. “The sheer numbers of the population multiplied by anything makes it a big number – that is India’s reality,” says Saran.
There are signs of hope, however, driven by astonishing drops in the price of renewable energy in the last few years. Costs are falling faster than anyone predicted, with new record-low prices set this year for solar and wind. State governments can now pay less for clean energy than they pay for new coal power.
Mathur, who was the Indian delegation’s spokesman at the 2015 Paris climate summit, says that once batteries become powerful enough to store renewable energy for night time or when winds are weak, India’s energy emissions are likely to plateau and then fall. “I personally saw this happening around 2035, but in the past three years, that has shifted to 2025, driven by the news in the solar prices and the sharper than expected fall in the price of batteries.”
India’s government has now forecast that no new coal-fired power stations will need to be built for at least 10 years. By that time, Mathur argues, it will be cheaper to supply new demand using renewable power. “As [existing] coal plants retire they will be replaced by renewables, because that’s what makes economic sense.”
Another crucial driver is India’s appalling air pollution – half of the world’s most polluted cities are in the nation. “It is far, far worse than China,” says Stern. “That has really started to build into Indian consciousness and politics.”
That awareness is growing fast – India’s supreme court even banned Diwali festival fireworks in Delhi this year – and is putting heavy pressure on the government to act. In April, ministers announced that the sale of new petrol or diesel cars would be banned from 2030, a decade before the UK.
Cutting pollution also cuts carbon emissions, but filthy air is not the only incentive to act. Unchecked global warming will hit India hard, increasing extreme weather, like the floods that killed thousands in August, and affecting the monsoon upon which India’s farmers depend. 
Heatwaves already cause thousands of deaths in India and rising temperatures that make outdoor work impossible have already seen the labour equivalent to about half a million people lost since 2000. But in coming decades, heatwaves could reach a level of humid heat classed as posing “extreme danger” for three-quarters of the population.
Despite the compelling reasons for India to follow a green path into the future, serious obstacles remain, not least the sorry state of the country’s coal-fired power industry, currently forced to slow its operations by a surplus of electricity in the market.
“These guys are hurting,” Mathur says, and that has knock-on effects for India’s slowing economy. “They have taken loans, and they can’t sell electricity, so they can’t repay the loans. And if they can’t repay the banks, the banks have no money to lend for more growth.” Recent months have seen a backlash against renewables, with intensified lobbying for coal.
Another problem is ensuring the buildings and transport systems shooting up in cities around India are energy efficient. “There is the risk of great, sprawling messes, and it is a very big risk,” says Stern, requiring the institutional ability of the government to shape the future to grow as fast as the cities themselves. 
The political climate is – for now – behind the green growth story, says Saran: “Modi, unlike other populist leaders, has made climate into a strength and not an adversarial debate, like Donald Trump.” But he warns that could change: “The street capture of irrationality is not something India is immune from either.”
What happens in India also matters to the rest of the world for a practical reason, says Saran, by driving down the costs of, for example, rolling out solar plants and super-efficient LED bulbs. This would mean all developing countries can leapfrog a polluting fossil fuel phase as they grow. 
“We will mass produce it, mass aggregate it, mass process it for the world,” he says. “America did it for the first billion people. India is now doing it for the rest of the six billion on the planet.”
The whole world would benefit from a clean, green India and can help make it happen, says Stern, by bringing down the interest rates on the loans used to fund the low carbon transition: “The best thing the world could do is help bring down the cost of capital.” That means long term finance and help to cut project risks.
The path India’s chooses will affect the whole world and, despite the uncertainties and risks, the mood is optimistic, for a variety of reasons. “India has all the institutions of democracy and a very smart entrepreneurial class which will respond, and that gives me optimism,” says Saran.
Dubash says: “We’ll [do] it because we don’t have that much high-quality coal. We are already hitting high pollution [levels]. We already have issues with imports, and so energy security is a big factor. All of those things will lead us to moderate.”
For those currently without any electricity, solar power is the perfect solution, both fast and affordable, says Stern. Back in Rajghat, a young mother called Ramhali agrees. Three days earlier, a group of students from a nearby city, Dholpur, installed a single, five-watt light in her home, powered by solar panels on the roof. It has replaced the old liquor bottle filled with kerosene, that flickered with toxic, black-tipped smoke and gave the children headaches. 
So can India’s leaders bring light to its poorest people, build clean, green cities for its billion-strong population and end the plague of air pollution? Figueres says: “More important than my opinion is their opinion, and they think they can, and do so with many benefits.” ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/06/how-indias-battle-with-climate-change-could-determine-all-of-our-fates

The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said temperatures in the first nine months of this year were unlikely to have been higher than 2016, when there was a strong El Niño weather system, but higher than anything before 2015.
Petteri Taalas, secretary general of the WMO, said: “The past three years have all been in the top three years in terms of temperature records. This is part of a long term warming trend. We have witnessed extraordinary weather, including temperatures topping 50C in Asia, record-breaking hurricanes in rapid succession in the Caribbean and Atlantic reaching as far as Ireland, devastating monsoon flooding affecting many millions of people and a relentless drought in East Africa.”
He said further detailed scientific studies would be carried out, but that it was already possible to say many “bear the tell-tale sign of climate change” caused by increased greenhouse gas concentrations from human activities, such as burning fossil fuel and deforestation.
This recent increase in average global temperatures confirms a renewed warming trend in recent years, which had slowed its pace slightly in the previous decade, leading some climate sceptics to claim global warming had “paused”.
The results were revealed to delegates at the UN’s global climate talks being held in Bonn, Germany, this week and next. The COP23 talks, a follow-up to the landmark Paris agreement of 2015, will focus on a new process by which countries’ pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions can be toughened, in line with scientific advice.
Current pledges would, according to estimates, leave the world 3C warmer than in pre-industrial times. At that level, sea levels would rise, heatwaves and droughts would become more common in large swathes of the globe, and fiercer storms and floods would become more likely.
Patricia Espinosa, the UN’s climate chief, said the talks showed “unprecedented momentum”, but warned of the consequences of failure.
Recent research also found that the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are now higher than they have been for 800,000 years.
Scientists reacted with concern to the WMO’s findings, which are still provisional and only cover January to September. Martin Siegert, co-director of the Grantham Institute at Imperial College, London, said: “The state of our climate is being reset by humans. What were once one-in-a-hundred-year events are now turning into regular events. We see this in terms of extreme weather impacts, with examples from the south of the US this year. For the future we can expect more of the same.”
Richard Betts, professor of climate impacts at the Met Office Hadley Centre, said: “We expect developing countries to be hit the hardest in terms of human impact. Flooding will be a particular threat in south Asia, particularly due to increased rainfall and rising sea levels, and partly because of the large and growing numbers of people who have little choice about being in harm’s way.”
Petteri Taalas, secretary-general of WMO, said at the Bonn conference that he saw little likelihood of the warming trend being reversed in the short term. “This trend can be expected to continue for the coming 50 years. In this system, once you reach a certain level it does not drop soon.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/06/2017-set-to-be-one-of-top-three-hottest-years-on-record

“We want to advance further, faster, together to meet the goals set out in the Paris agreement,” said Patricia Espinosa, the UN’s chief official on the climate, at the opening of the talks. “We need an operating manual for the Paris agreement. This has to be the launchpad for the next level of ambition on climate change action, because we know the pledges [to cut emissions] made so far are not enough to take us to [meeting the Paris goals].”
Nazhat Shameem Khan, of the Fijian presidency, said she wanted delegates to answer three questions: where we are on meeting the Paris commitments; where we want to be; and how to get there.
“This needs high level commitment,” she said. “We do not have the luxury of having lots of philosophical discussions. We have to roll our sleeves up and get through the agenda points.”
Although the document agreed in Paris was extensive, it could not set out in full detail all of the ways in which governments would be expected to implement the agreement, and the process of checking how this is being achieved. Some of these technical issues could be relatively easily resolved, but others have a broader political import that will require delicate negotiation.
One key issue will be “enhancing ambition”, which means making good on the commitment made in Paris to strengthen countries’ pledges on cutting emissions, given that current pledges are inadequate to hold warming to no more than 2C, as required by the landmark agreement. A key date falls next year, when countries are supposed to start coming forward with higher pledges.
However, Espinosa stopped short of saying that COP23 would result in a full timetable for when countries would be required to make new commitments. “That’s a difficult question to answer at this point. But I remain optimistic.”
Elina Bardram, head of the EU’s delegation for COP23, said the bloc wanted to “flesh out the technical guidelines of implementation”, including allowing for “transparency and accountability”. This means ensuring not only that pledges are sufficient, but that they are being met by the national governments signed up to the Paris accord. It can be a tricky issue at the UN talks, where countries set their own targets and ways of meeting them.
The EU is soon expected to set out its own progress on meeting its emissions-cutting target, and how it intends to ensure its 2030 target of a 40% emissions cut is met.
Discussions would also take place on climate finance, which involves ways of helping poorer countries to cut their emissions, Espinosa promised. She declined to give any targets on how much finance should be raised and where it should come from, but said the outlook was positive. “There is a very clear tendency going in the direction of green financing,” she said, referring to estimates that more money worldwide is going into low-carbon projects.
She also said the US delegation was present and taking a full part in the talks. President Donald Trump announced last summer his intention to begin the withdrawal process, the only country to have done so. Despite this, the US will be party to the agreement until 2020, as the the withdrawal process will take several years.

Governments have drastically underestimated methane emissions from natural gas and will miss the Paris agreement’s goal of limiting global warming to 2C unless they urgently scale down its use, a major new study has found.
Continuing natural gas emissions at present levels will add 0.6C to global warming and, with other fossil fuel use, exhaust Europe’s carbon budget – the amount it can safely and fairly emit – in less than a decade, says the report by the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research.
It concludes that Europe must phase out all fossil fuels including gas by 2035 and decrease emissions by 12% per year – far beyond its current ambitions – to keep to the Paris 2C pledge.
EU countries, including the UK, have committed to burn more natural gas as a “bridging fuel”, because it offers a baseline alternative to wind and solar on cloudy and windless days, and because it emits less carbon dioxide than coal.
But the report’s authors find that there is “categorically no role” for new gas, oil or coal production, because of their high CO2 and methane emissions.
“Considering both carbon dioxide and methane emissions, an urgent programme to phase out existing natural gas and other fossil fuel use across the EU is an imperative of any scientifically informed and equity-based policies designed to deliver on the Paris agreement,” says the study, which was co-written by Tyndall’s Prof Kevin Anderson and Dr John Broderick.
Their report, which is based on original modelling and a meta-analysis of 250 gas supply chain studies, logs a “sustained rise” since 2006 in atmospheric methane concentrations. These are now “at the top end of IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) scenarios” and running at unsustainable levels, according to the study.
Far from phasing out natural gas ventures though, the EU appears to be accelerating them in a new “projects of common interest” (PCI) list for gas infrastructure.
After 77 gas projects were approved in the last PCI round, the latest slate (pdf) could potentially approve more than 100 gas ventures for public funding and fast-tracked planning approval, according to analysis by Friends of the Earth Europe (FoEE).
The projects were evaluated on the basis of forecasts by the European network of transmission systems operators for gas, a coalition of gas companies and their subsidiaries.
In 2016, Europe’s gas industry spent more than €100m (£89m) and employed more than 1,000 lobbyists in an effort to promote gas as a relatively clean fossil fuel, according to a report published last week.
Antoine Simon, an FoEE spokesman said: “It is intolerable to see the European commission and its members giving support to an increasing number of gas projects that will lock us in to decades of fossil fuel addiction. As the UN reminded us last week, we are currently paving the way to a 3C temperature rise. Facing the prospect of being ‘toasted, roasted and grilled’, it is unconscionable that the EU is turning its back on the urgent climate action needed to remedy this situation.”
Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, about 30 times more potent than carbon dioxide, that may still push global warming past “tipping points” beyond which it becomes irreversible.
It exists naturally in water-borne micro-organisms, agriculture and methane hydrates – some already thawing as the climate warms – and is produced in bulk by measured gas emissions, and non-measured leaks.
Uncertainties remain about the exact attribution of atmospheric methane, but recent studies estimate that anthropogenic sources caused between 48-65%, with fossil fuels accounting for about a third of the total.
“Extracting and burning natural gas produces substantial quantities of methane and carbon dioxide which warm the climate in different ways,” Broderick said. “We need to rapidly reduce emissions of both of these gases to prevent dangerous climate change, not one or the other.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/07/natural-gas-emissions-will-blow-europes-carbon-budget-at-current-levels

Regarding God allowing evil, I make the following observation:-
We might look at the world's problems and say God why don't you do something?However God gives us dominion over the world and its problems; many of which after all, are if we are honest, of our own making.Basically we haven't followed such Biblical advice as the following:-
Being salt of the earth.Being light to the world.Being forgiving.Not seeing money as the be all and end all.Loving your neighbour as yourself; even if your neighbour is an ass(0); doing good to your enemies as it were.To err is human, to forgive divine;
With the consequential result that we find ourselves in a world of hurt; quite literally.
It's about having life, and having it to the fullest.

ExxonMobil is accused of misleading the public for decades over the dangers of climate change – the oil company denies the allegations – and has funded climate change denial, making its presence in the church’s £7.9bn investment fund of particular concern, the group argues. Investment funds worth more than $5tn have already committed to divest from fossil fuels.
Archbishop Justin Welby, the leader of the Church of England who worked for a decade in the oil industry before becoming a priest, described climate change as a “moral crisis” on Saturday. “Climate change is pushing us toward disaster,” he wrote in the New York Times. “It is not a distant danger – it is already with us. As we continue to burn fossil fuels, its effects will only grow.”
The latest UN climate change negotiations began in Bonn on Monday and Welby also sent a personal message to Fijian prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, who is overseeing the talks. Welby said the 85 million people in the worldwide Anglican communion that he leads “support your work to ensure that issues of climate change are recognised as an urgent priority requiring immediate attention”. 
However, the Church of England argues it should remain an ExxonMobil shareholder so it can continue to engage with the company and influence it to change. 
In a letter to the Guardian, also sent to the church, a group of five bishops and dozens of clergy said: “While many of us believe that the Church of England should divest from all fossil fuel companies for ethical reasons, we are especially concerned about the Church’s continued investment in US oil and gas company ExxonMobil.”
They cite a recent journal paper analysing ExxonMobil’s activities from 1977-2014 that concludes: “ExxonMobil contributed to advancing climate science – by way of its scientists’ academic publications – but promoted doubt about it in advertorials. Given this discrepancy, we conclude that ExxonMobil misled the public.” The company is facing legal action in the US over the issue. The company’s directors have also advised shareholders to vote against all resolutions on climate change since 1990, the letter’s authors said.
“The Church of England is uniquely placed to show moral leadership through its investment policies,” says the letter. “Now is the time for decisive action. We call on Church of England investors to take the lead and immediately divest from ExxonMobil.”
Bishop Michael Doe, one of the letter’s signatories, said: “By divesting from Exxon, the Church of England would send a hugely positive signal at a time when a rapid shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy is urgently required.”
The Church of England divested in 2015 from companies involved in the extraction of coal and tar sands, the most polluting fossil fuels, but continues to hold significant oil and gas investments.
“Clearly we share concerns about ExxonMobil,” said a spokesman for the Church of England. “We firmly believe however that active investors have a role to play and strategic corporate engagement is too powerful a tool to be rendered ineffective by divesting. We remain in private engagement with the company.” 
The spokesman said concerns raised by the church and others led to the successful passing of a resolution at ExxonMobil’s 2017 annual general meeting that requests disclosure of its analyses of how global warming will affect the company from 2018.
The church also launched a new policy on investing in extractive industries on Monday. It acknowledges the industries can make a positive contribution to development but also highlights that “extractives companies are particularly vulnerable to poor governance and ethical controversy, and harmful, long-lasting impacts on communities and the environment”.
The Bishop of Manchester, David Walker, acting chair of the church’s Ethical Investment Advisory Group said: “Strong returns to support our beneficiaries can go hand in hand with robust and transparent ethical investment policies.” The new policy says: “As a last resort, and on a case by case basis, the [church] may disinvest from companies where engagement is rebuffed or is clearly not leading to progress.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/07/bishops-urge-church-of-england-to-divest-from-exxonmobil-over-climate-change

This week, governments from around the world will meet in Bonn for the next round of UN climate talks. The Paris climate change agreement, which was signed by 195 countries in December 2015, included a commitment to hold the increase in the global average temperature to “well below 2C … and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels”.
A lot has happened since then. We have witnessed the shameful decision of the president of the United States to withdraw from the Paris agreement. Average global temperatures have risen to more than 1C above pre-industrial levels. Extreme weather events, which are becoming more frequent as a result of climate change, have had devastating impacts, leading to loss of life and severe destruction in the US and the Caribbean, Africa, South Asia and as close to home as Ireland.
We believe that churches and other investors can and should support the shift from fossil fuels to clean alternatives through their investment policies. Although the Church of England divested from companies involved in the extraction of coal and tar sands in 2015, it continues to hold significant investments in major oil and gas companies.
While many of us believe that the church should divest from all fossil fuel companies for ethical reasons, we are especially concerned about its continued investment in the US oil and gas company ExxonMobil.
A recent Harvard academic study shows that Exxon knew about the risks of climate change in the 1970s, yet misled the public for decades. It says that the company sought to cast doubt on the climate science, taking out paid editorials in major US newspapers questioning whether global warming was real and caused by humans. Exxon’s board of directors has advised shareholders to vote against all resolutions on climate change since 1990.
The financial risks of investing in fossil fuels are also increasing. A recent Carbon Tracker report, 2 Degrees of Separation, showed that five out of six major oil and gas companies are risking more than 30% of potential investments – with a value of $2.3 trillion – on projects that are not aligned with the Paris agreement targets. ExxonMobil risks wasting between 40% and 50% of its future spending.
Time is running out to prevent the worst impacts of climate change. While some governments and companies pursue policies that are leading us in the wrong direction, the Church of England is uniquely placed to show moral leadership through its investment policies.
Now is the time for decisive action. We call on Church of England investors to take the lead and immediately divest from ExxonMobil.

I live in rural Wisconsin -- the dairy state. If I had a dime for every time I saw so-called vegans chowing down on processed foods (chips and eggless cookies), in their superiority. If you don't like big ag, then you should work hard to support family farms. 
I raise my own meat animals. They live good, natural lives. If you think about it, in order to eliminate all animal agriculture, you would have to slaughter all of the existing farm animals, OR use the same amount of resources to feed them until they die. Who would care for them? Who would pay? Who would go hungry so that this could be supported? 
I also know many farmers. While there may be bad actors (there are in virtually every human endeavor, including vegans) I, personally, have never met any. The large farms I've visited are very clean, and the animals are healthy. They have to be, because that's where the income comes from. If the animal rights activists were more honest, they would also show good practices, before the attempt to set policy. But, like the alt-right talking heads, they want to persuade with alternate facts.
I've watched the videos where poor animals are being held ""without food or water"". That may be in a holding pen, before the animals are slaughtered. That's probably because group watering sources can spread disease and animals are processed shortly after they enter the holding pens. Dehydration would lower the value of the meat, and the weight. No producer wants that. Our animals walk off the trailer and down the chute. The process takes seconds and no one wants it to be violent. Safe practices increase profit. 
Nature is inherently cruel. Modern agriculture tries to minimize animal discomfort because, once again, it affects the bottom line. Beating animals causes bruising, which is also waste. Lowers profits. There are dysfunctional people in all walks of life. That doesn't mean that all, or even a majority of farming is bad.
I would also encourage people to read about the surprising studies that show that agriculture, being more efficient uses the same amount of land, while producing more and that corn is a huge carbon sponge. A recent study at UW Madison surprised the scientists by showing that eliminating dairy farming would reduce corn production, which would cause carbon levels to rise.https://news.wisc.edu/crops-play-a-major-role-in-the-annual-co2-cycle-increase/', u'recommendation_count': u'4', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1510099472000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u""that 's where the income comes from"", u'effect': u'they have to be'}, {u'cause': u'group watering sources can spread disease and animals are processed shortly after they enter the holding pens', u'effect': u""that 's probably""}, {u'cause': u'once again it affects the bottom line', u'effect': u'modern agriculture tries to minimize animal discomfort'}, {u'cause': u'beating animals', u'effect': u'bruising which is also waste'}, {u'cause': u'which', u'effect': u'carbon levels'}], u'author_id': u'10756144', u'id': u'107897680', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'zootsuitbeatnick', u'text': u'imoYou set your goals and you do what it takes to attain them.If it's a cleaner environment, you don't focus on one industry or another.You focus on what harms the environment no matter what it is and where it originates.Of course, that doesn't promote big campaign donations or speaking fees.imo', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1510098987000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'15026801', u'id': u'107897554', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'haarmeyer', u'text': u'I don't have children, directly because we believe that the world has too many people.

Exactly. It's got nothing to do with eating meat.

Few meat and dairy companies calculate or publish their climate emissions. So for the first time ever, we have estimated corporate emissions from livestock, using the most comprehensive methodology created to date by the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). 
And before the meat and dairy industries descend upon COP23 to broadcast their “feed the world” narrative, let’s set the story straight: their emissions could lead us to a point of no return.
We’ve found that the top 20 meat and dairy companies emitted more greenhouse gases in 2016 than all of Germany, Europe’s biggest climate polluter by far. If these companies were a country, they would be the world’s seventh largest greenhouse gas emitter. 
It’s now clear that the world cannot avoid climate catastrophe without addressing the staggering emissions from the largest meat and dairy conglomerates. 
Over the past few decades, the meat and dairy majors have become immensely powerful and have successfully pushed policies to support rapid growth of industrial meat and dairy production and consumption around the world, at all costs. 
One consequence, among many, is that livestock production now contributes nearly 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions, even more than the transportation sector. If production continues to grow as projected by the FAO, emissions will escalate to the point where industrial meat and dairy production alone will undercut our ability to keep temperatures from rising to an apocalyptic scenario.
At the upcoming COP23 climate meeting in Bonn, Germany, the world’s largest meat and dairy companies will tell a different story. They’ll explain that their production is necessary for world food security, and that they should therefore be let off the hook, or better yet, get incentives for tinkering with their greenhouse gas emissions. 
This is not true. 
These companies produce a vast amount of highly subsidized meat and dairy in a handful of countries where these products are already overconsumed. They then export their surpluses to the rest of the world, undercutting the millions of small farmers who actually do ensure food security and bombarding consumers with unhealthy processed foods.
In Bonn, the big meat and dairy companies are also likely to spend much time and money talking about efficiency, while expanding production. They will say that the only way to effectively reduce emissions is by squeezing out ever more milk from each dairy cow or by bringing beef cattle to slaughter ever more quickly. 
Such “solutions” would only compound the industry’s horrific treatment of workers and animals and exacerbate the environmental and health crises caused by the industry. 
They would also condemn the 600 million small-scale farmers and 200 million herders who depend on livestock for their livelihoods and who do feed billions of people every day with moderate amounts of meat, dairy and eggs. These small producers are the backbone of food systems that can arrest and address climate change. They are the ones who need to be supported and strengthened.
If we are serious about feeding the planet while fighting climate change, the world needs to urgently invest in a transition to food systems that hinge on small-scale producers, agroecology and local markets. 
These systems provide for moderate levels of meat and dairy, but they do so in a way that regenerates soils, provides livelihoods to rural and urban communities and makes crops and animals resilient to the vagaries of an unpredictable climate. 
The solutions exist; they just need to be urgently implemented. The first step is to redirect public money from factory farming and agribusiness towards small-scale agroecological family farms. Governments should also use their buying power to support small producers, helping them to build jobs and markets for local products. 
As numerous cities make energy choices to tackle climate change, so too should municipalities invest in farm-to-hospital and farm-to-school programs that deliver healthier food and strengthen rural communities while emitting fewer greenhouse gases.
It is time to stop the dairy and meat giants from destroying the climate and shift our support to making our small farmers, herders and ranchers resilient.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/07/big-meat-big-dairy-carbon-emmissions-exxon-mobil

One evening I was walking along a path, the city was on one side and the fjord below. I felt tired and ill.

I am more afraid on what goes on internally in the US, behind the scenes, so to say. 
From the outside one see a political and organised campaign on science. Even on education and what is in the books. And the operational side of science as NASA and EPA and NOAA represent. 
It is a scheme of dumbing down the US population for short term limited profit of old and rich. Which is 180 degrees wrong in what is long-term needed on the way forward. And it is far more long-term than what Donald can do on emissions. 
I, for one, really want US to excel. Because when you guys do, you do it really well (you placed man on the moon, opened essentially the first national park and has this massive resource of R&D). All this is based on education. Understanding. Analytical skills. 
I even think it would be good for the US to feel the same national pride as you did with sending up the first space-shuttle in 1981 (I was watching live on Norwegian TV as one who was a kid who could remember late Apollo, in a time where USA was most about failed wars in Asia as we grew up with Deer Hunter and Rambo and other such retrospective pains while we in Europe looked at failed rescue missions in new-old friendly states like Iran etc). 
The space-shuttle was really welcomed over here as well. Because of the optimism and pure sense of effort being done for good. OK - it turned out that it did not cut prices as much as hoped in recycling the thing - so it was not a perfect solution. But it gave hope. We saw space-ships glide in for landing as mission completed. 
What US does has this gravity for the world even now I think. On science. On the best of humanity. US is still relevant. 
The dangerous part about what GOP is doing now with the the dumbing-down program is that the population becomes totally unaware of this ""power"" that you administer. 
So - the scary part is that so many in your nation risk to forget how fantastic a gift Hubble has been to the world. Or the Voyagers that has been a part of most of my life. That people in the US can go to school where it is 50/50 if the earth is more than 6000 years or if CO2 is a climate gas. 
In other words - how you now go segregation on science and education and pretend it is not real - just to allow a decade or two of profit for coal, instead of chipping in to lead in the zero-emission world we must leave for generation next within this century is poor strategy. 
US need and deserve a space-shuttle and Hubble moment.

The sensitivity to climate forcing we observe is a response to wind-driven redistribution of oceanic heat and is independent of large-scale warming of the atmosphere or ocean. Our results establish a link between the stability of Totten Glacier and upwelling near the East Antarctic coast, where surface winds are projected to intensify over the next century as a result of increasing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations.

It's -50 degrees C on parts of Antarctica, warm it up to -45 and big deal. But it is at the melting point at the coast where the floating and thinning ice shelves provide less and less friction constraining ice sheet flow.
An increase of just 1 degree C destroyed the ice shelf constraining the flow of the Jakobshavn Isbræ Glacier on Greenland and such an increase is a big insult to an ice shelf almost anywhere on the planet.

Ocean acidification has been described as its evil twin.
Increased fertilizer runoff is creating more and more dead zones along the coast.
As the surface of the ocean warms faster than the depths it gets lighter so it is harder to turn the ocean over. It gets more strongly stratified so oxygen rich waters don't make it to the depths and nutrient rich deep waters no longer feed the great fisheries.
And freshwater input from the ice sheets is likely to play havoc with deep ocean circulation as well.
Perhaps the worst possible impact is as the depths are deprived of oxygen, the hydrogen sulfide producing bacteria can thrive. 
This was a suspected kill mechanism for several previous mass extinctions.
Massive release of hydrogen sulfide to the surface ocean and atmosphere during intervals of oceanic anoxia
BQSTART
Simple calculations show that if deep-water H2S concentrations increased beyond a critical threshold during oceanic anoxic intervals of Earth history, the chemocline separating sulfidic deep waters from oxygenated surface waters could have risen abruptly to the ocean surface (a chemocline upward excursion). Atmospheric photochemical modeling indicates that resulting fluxes of H2S to the atmosphere (>2000 times the small modern flux from volcanoes) would likely have led to toxic levels of H2S in the atmosphere. Moreover, the ozone shield would have been destroyed, and methane levels would have risen to >100 ppm. We thus propose (1) chemocline upward excursion as a kill mechanism during the end-Permian, Late Devonian, and Cenomanian–Turonian extinctions, and (2) persistently high atmospheric H2S levels as a factor that impeded evolution of eukaryotic life on land during the Proterozoic.

The surprise decision, taken amid a brutal civil war in the country, will leave the US as the only country outside the agreement if it follows through on President Donald Trump’s vow to leave.
Syria’s decision brings to 197 the number of nations signed up to the landmark 2015 pact on global warming, the first in more than 20 years of UN negotiations to bind both developed and developing countries to a clear limit on temperature rises.
The 2015 Paris climate agreement is the first truly global deal to tackle climate change. It commits governments to limit temperature rises to no more than 2C – which scientists say is the threshold of safety, beyond which the effects of global warming are likely to become catastrophic and irreversible –  and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C. It has been signed by 197 countries. The US is on course to become the only country outside the agreement if it follows through on President Donald Trump’s vow to leave.
President Barack Obama signed the accord and it was ratified before his term of office ended, but this summer Donald Trump began the process of withdrawing from it. Withdrawal will take several years under UN rules, so the US officially remains a party until 4 November 2020, the day after its next presidential election. The US is the only country to renege on the agreement.
Civil society groups said the US, the world’s largest economy and second biggest emitter of greenhouse gases after China, was now isolated on the world stage.
Paula Caballero, global director of the climate programme at the World Resources Institute, said: “Now the entire world is resolutely committed to advancing climate action – all save one country. This should make the Trump administration pause and reflect on their ill-advised announcement about withdrawing from the Paris agreement.”
Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club environmental group, said: “As if it wasn’t already crystal clear, every single other country is moving forward together to tackle the climate crisis, while Trump has isolated the US in an embarrassing and dangerous position. Trump’s desperate moves to help corporate polluters by refusing to acknowledge the climate crisis shows he neither cares about leadership nor does he understand it.”
Observers said that although the White House could withdraw the federal government from the pact, cities and states in the US would continue to take action on climate change, for instance by investing in renewable energy.
The French government, according to reports, said Trump had been excluded from the invitations to more than 100 world leaders to meet in Paris for a climate conference next month, to follow on from the Paris agreement.
The US delegation in Bonn, where two weeks of UN climate negotiations are in their second day, did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment.
The US is participating in the Bonn talks, according to the UN climate chief Patricia Esposito, but its contributions so far have been low-key. Under UN rules, it will continue to be allowed to do so until the formal withdrawal can be completed in 2020.
At the Bonn talks, called COP23 in the UN jargon, countries are hoping to come up with a roadmap to meet the goals set out in the Paris agreement. In 2015, countries agreed to hold rising temperatures to no more than 2C, which scientists say is the limit of safety, beyond which the ravages of climate change are likely to become catastrophic and irreversible.
Such a roadmap must include ways to toughen the promises on curbing greenhouse gas emissions that countries made in Paris. The Paris pledges are not in themselves enough to satisfy the 2C limit, and if left unchanged would lead to a 3C rise in temperatures, according to studies. A 3C rise would mean far higher sea level rises, heatwaves and droughts afflicting large swaths of the globe and making agriculture impossible in those areas, while devastating floods would increase in other areas.
To meet the Paris goals, countries will have to ratchet up their commitments on emissions reductions, which will be a difficult negotiation. Scientific advice at the Bonn conference has been clear, however: this year is likely to be the third warmest on record, confirming a warming trend that bears the fingerprints of human activity affecting the global climate.
Syria’s decision was largely symbolic, given the country’s disarray, and follows a similar announcement before the Bonn talks by the only other holdout on the Paris accord, Nicaragua.
Also at Bonn, the Vatican Pontifical Academy of Sciences warned in unusually strong terms that unchecked climate change and air pollution would put “the very fabric of life on Earth, including that of humans, at grave risk”. The Pope warned in a preface to the Vatican report that “transport, industrial fumes, substances which contribute to the acidification of soil and water, fertilisers, insecticides, fungicides, herbicides and agrotoxins in general” were risks to millions, with the poor at particular hazard, and warned that technology from the business sector might not be the answer. The Pope has been increasingly outspoken on environmental issues, sending out an encyclical on climate change ahead of the Paris agreement.
The European Environment Agency reported that the EU was on track to meet its goals on reducing emissions by 2020, with a slight fall in greenhouse gas output last year, but would require more effort to meet its 2030 targets under the Paris agreement.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/07/syria-signs-paris-climate-agreement-and-leaves-us-isolated

But it is becoming increasingly clear that it does not need to be all bad news: a series of fast-moving global megatrends, spurred by trillion-dollar investments, indicates that humanity might be able to avert the worst impacts of global warming. From trends already at full steam, including renewable energy, to those just now hitting the big time, such as mass-market electric cars, to those just emerging, such as plant-based alternatives to meat, these trends show that greenhouse gas emissions can be halted.
“If we were seeing linear progress, I would say good, but we’re not going to make it in time,” says Figueres, now the convener of the Mission 2020 initiative, which warns that the world has only three years to get carbon emissions on a downward curve and on the way to beating global warming. “But the fact is we are seeing progress that is growing exponentially, and that is what gives me the most reason for hope.”
No one is saying the battle to avert catastrophic climate change – floods, droughts, famine, mass migrations – has been won. But these megatrends show the battle has not yet been lost, and that the tide is turning in the right direction. “The important thing is to reach a healthy balance where we recognise that we are seriously challenged, because we really have only three years left to reach the tipping point,” says Figueres. “But at the same time, the fact is we are already seeing many, many positive trends.”
Michael Liebreich, the founder of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, agrees. “The good news is we are way better than we thought we could be. We are not going to get through this without damage. But we can avoid the worst. I am optimistic, but there is a long way to go.”
Also cautiously hopeful is climate economist Nicholas Stern at the London School of Economics. “These trends are the start of something that might be enough – the two key words are ‘start’ and ‘might’.” He says the global climate negotiations, continuing this week in Germany and aiming to implement the Paris deal, are crucial: “The acceleration embodied in the Paris agreement is going to be critical.”
Carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels is the main greenhouse gas, but methane and nitrous oxide are more potent and, unlike CO2, still rising. The major source is livestock farming, in particular belching cattle and their manure.
The world’s appetite for meat and dairy foods is rising as people’s incomes rise, but the simple arithmetic is that unless this is radically curbed, there is no way to beat global warming. The task looks daunting – people hate being told what to eat. However, just in the last year, a potential solution has burst on to the market: plant-based meat, which has a tiny environmental footprint.
What sounds like an oxymoron – food that looks and tastes just as good as meat or dairy products but is made from plants – has attracted heavy investment. The buzz is particularly loud in the US, where Bill Gates has backed two plant-based burger companies and Eric Schmidt, formerly CEO of Google, believes plant-based foods can make a “meaningful dent” in tackling climate change.
Perhaps even more telling is that major meat and dairy companies are now piling in with investments and acquisitions, such as the US’s biggest meat processor, Tyson, and multinational giants Danone and Nestlé. The Chinese government has just put $300m (£228m) into Israeli companies producing lab-grown meat, which could also cut emissions.
New plant-based products, from chicken to fish to cheese, are coming out every month. “We are in the nascent stage,” says Alison Rabschnuk at the US nonprofit group the Good Food Institute. “But there’s a lot of money moving into this area.”
Plant-based meat and dairy produce is not only environmentally friendly, but also healthier and avoids animal welfare concerns, but these benefits will not make them mass-market, she says: “We don’t believe that is what is going to make people eat plant-based food. We believe the products themselves need to be competitive on taste, price and convenience – the three attributes people use when choosing what to eat.”
Plant-based milks – soya, almond, oat and more – have led the way and are now about 10% of the market and a billion-dollar business in the US. But in the past year, sales of other meat and dairy substitutes have climbed 8%, with some specific lines, such as yoghurt, shooting up 55%. “I think the writing’s on the wall,” says Rabschnuk. Billionaire entrepreneur Richard Branson agrees. “I believe that in 30 years or so we will no longer need to kill any animals and that all meat will either be [lab] or plant-based, taste the same and also be much healthier for everyone.”
The most advanced of the megatrends is the renewable energy revolution. Production costs for solar panels and wind turbines have plunged, by 90% in the past decade for solar, for example, and are continuing to fall. As a result, in many parts of the world they are already the cheapest electricity available and installation is soaring: two-thirds of all new power in 2016 was renewable.
This extraordinary growth has confounded expectations: the respected International Energy Agency’s annual projections have anticipated linear growth for solar power every year for the past decade. In reality, growth has been exponential. China is leading the surge but the impact is being felt around the world: in Germany last week there was so much wind power that customers got free electricity.
In the US, enthusiasm for green energy has not been dented by President Donald Trump committing to repeal key climate legislation: $30bn has been invested since he signed an executive order in March. “I am no longer concerned about electric power,” says Figueres.
The flipside of the renewables boom is the death spiral of coal, the filthiest of fossil fuels. Production now appears to have peaked in 2013. The speed of its demise has stunned analysts. In 2013, the IEA expected coal-burning to grow by 40% by 2040 – today it anticipates just 1%.
The cause is simple: solar and wind are cheaper. But the consequences are enormous: in pollution-choked China, there are now no provinces where new coal is needed, so the country has just mothballed plans for 151 plants. Bankruptcies have torn through the US coal industry and in the UK, where coal-burning began the industrial revolution, it has fallen from 40% of power supply to 2% in the past five years.
“Last year, I said if Asia builds what it says it is going to build, we can kiss goodbye to 2C” – the internationally agreed limit for dangerous climate change – says Liebreich. “Now we are showing coal [plans] coming down.” But he warns there is more to do.
Solar and wind are cheaper than new coal, he says, but a second tipping point is needed. That will occur when renewables are cheaper to build than running existing coal plants, meaning that the latter shut down. If renewable costs continue to fall as expected, this would happen between 2030 and 2040. At that point, says Liebrich, “Why keep digging coal out of the ground when you could just put up solar?”
Slashing oil use – a third of all global energy – is a huge challenge but a surging market for battery-powered cars is starting to bite, driven in significant part by fast-growing concerns about urban air pollution.
China, again, is leading the way. It is selling as many electric cars every month as Europe and the US combined, with many from home-grown companies such as BYD. US-based Tesla is rolling out its more affordable Model 3 and in recent months virtually all major carmakers have committed to an electric future, with Volvo and Jaguar Land Rover announcing that they will end production of pure fossil-fuelled cars within three years.
“We have a domino effect now,” says Figueres. These cars are “now being made for the mass market and that is really what is going to make the transformation”.
“I don’t think it is going to slow down,” says Viktor Irle, an analyst at EV-volumes.com. Drivers can see the direction of travel, he says, with a stream of choked cities and countries from Paris to India announcing future bans on fossil-fuelled cars.
It is true that global sales of electric cars have now achieved liftoff, quadrupling in the past three years, but they still make up only 1.25% of all new car sales. However, if current growth rates continue, as Irle expects, 80% of new cars will be electric by 2030.
The rapid rise of electric cars has left the oil giants, who have a lot to lose, playing catchup. The oil cartel Opec has increased its estimate of the number of electric cars operative in 2040 by five times in the past year alone, with the IEA, ExxonMobil and BP all bumping up their forecasts too. Heavy transport remains a challenge, but even here ships are experimenting with wind power and batteries. Short-haul electric airplanes are on the drawing board, too.
Batteries are key to electric cars and, by storing energy for when the sun goes down or the wind stops blowing, they are also vital when it comes to enabling renewable energy to reach its full potential. Here too, a megatrend is crushing prices for lithium-ion batteries, which are down 75% over the past six years. The International Renewable Energy Agency expects further falls of 50-66% by 2030 and a massive increase in battery storage, linked to increasingly smart and efficient digital power grids. In the UK alone, government advisers say a smart grid could save bill-payers £8bn a year by 2030, as well as slashing carbon emissions.
Fears that lithium-ion, the technology that dominates today, cannot be scaled up sufficiently are overblown, argues Liebreich, as the metal is not rare. “I think lithium-ion is a banker in that you can be sure it will get cheaper and you can be sure there is enough.” He is also frustrated by frequent claims that a grid based on renewables and storage cannot be cheap and reliable: “That stupidity and absolute certainty is in inverse proportion to any knowledge of how you run an electrical system.”
It is true, however, that batteries will not be the solution for energy storage over weeks or months. For that, long-distance electricity interconnectors are being built and the storage of the energy as gas is also being explored.
Just as important as the greening of energy is reducing demand by boosting energy efficiency. It’s a no-brainer in climate policy, but it can be very tricky to make happen, as it requires action from millions of people.
Nonetheless, good progress is being made in places such as the EU, where efficiency in homes, transport and industry has improved by about 20% since 2000. Improving the efficiency of gadgets and appliances through better standards is surprisingly important: a new UN Environment Programme report shows it makes the biggest impact of any single action bar rolling out wind and solar power.
But again, continued progress is vital. “We need to drive energy efficiency very, very hard, even for European countries,” says Prof Kevin Anderson at the University of Manchester. “We could power down European energy use by about 40% in something like 10-15 years, just by making the most efficient appliances available the new minimum.”
In countries with cool winters, better insulation is also needed, particularly as a fossil fuel – natural gas – currently provides a lot of heating. “What is a crime is every time a building is renovated but not renovated to really high standards,” says Liebreich, who thinks labelling such homes as “zero-energy-bill” homes, not “zero-carbon” homes, would help overcome opposition.
One sector that is lagging on energy efficiency is industry, but technology to capture and bury CO2 from plants is being tested and ways to clean up cement-making are also being explored.
The destruction of forests around the world for ranching and farming, as well as for timber, causes about 10% of greenhouse gas emissions. This is the biggest megatrend not yet pointing in the right direction: annual tree losses have roughly doubled since 2000.
This is particularly worrying as stopping deforestation and planting new trees is, in theory at least, among the cheapest and fastest ways of cutting carbon emissions. But it is not getting the support it needs, says Michael Wolosin at Forest Climate Analytics. “Climate policy is massively underfunding forests – they receive only about 2% of global climate finance.” Furthermore, the $2.3bn committed to forests by rich nations and multilateral institutions since 2010 is tiny compared with the funding for the sectors that drive deforestation. “Brazil and Indonesia’s governments alone invested $276bn in the same timeframe, in just the four key driver commodities: palm oil, soy, beef and timber,” says Franziska Haupt at Climate Focus.
In fact, new research has shown that better land management could deliver a third of all the carbon cuts the world needs, and Wolosin says there are some grounds for hope that new forests can be planted. “Achieving large-scale forestation is not just theoretical. We know we can do it because a few countries have done it successfully.”
In the past two decades, tree-planting in China, India and South Korea has removed more than 12bn tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere – three times the entire European Union’s annual emissions, Wolosin says. This action was driven by fears about flooding and food supply, meaning that global warming needs to be seen as equally urgent in this sector. Regrowing forests can also play a crucial role in sucking CO2 out of the atmosphere, which is likely to be necessary after 2050, unless very sharp cuts are made now.
Will these megatrends move fast enough to avoid the worst of climate change? Opinions vary and Anderson is among the most hawkish. He says it remains possible for now, but is pessimistic that the action will be taken. “We’re pointing in the right direction but not moving [there]. We have to not just pursue renewables and electric vehicles and so forth, we have to actively close down the incumbent fossil fuel industry.”
Stern is cautiously optimistic, saying that what has changed in recent years is the realisation that green economic growth is the only long-term option: “There is no long-run high-carbon growth story because it creates an environment so hostile that it turns development backwards.
“There are some tremendous developments so I am very confident now we can do this, but the change, attractive as it is, has to be radical,” he says. “Will we have the political and economic understanding and commitment to get there? I hope so.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/08/seven-megatrends-that-could-beat-global-warming-climate-change

The con trails are not just heat, but are also the chemical waste product from the jet fuel. Depending on the circumstances this can disperse as far as our eyes go, or can remain visible for hours. It's essentially the same thing as cloud seeding - add a chemical that causes water to precipitate around the chemical. 
We learned a lot about this on September 11, 2001 here in the U.S. because grounding all planes caused the clearest couple of days anyone had seen in more than a half century. It's not especially dangerous, but climate scientists do factor it into their work. The increased cloudiness has a small but relevant impact on total insolation (sunlight arriving). I don't know if con trails have a greenhouse impact other than the CO2, but it is something that some of the scientists are aware of and taking into account. Greenhouse impact means infrared light leaving the planet. Greenhouse gases are transparent to visible light but block infrared.
The most pragmatic approach to climate that I know of doesn't worry too much about things that affect a single decimal point of the problem or there-abouts.

But this is different – look at the archeological record,article,http://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/nov/09/the-climate-has-changed-before-but-this-is-different-look-at-the-archeological-record,0,"The United States government recently published the Climate Science Special Report authored by 13 federal agencies, which states unequivocally that climate change is occurring and it is caused by human actions. The report follows several months of uncommonly strong hurricanes caused by warmer-than-typical ocean temperatures. The Trump Administration responded to the report by stating: “The climate has changed and is always changing.”
Climate change is part of life on planet Earth; however, context is needed to understand past change and the current situation. Archaeology can explain how temperature change of just a few degrees cause extreme weather events, affect crops, and impact human lives. It also shows how the current changes are different from those in the past.
Looking deep into time, anatomically modern humans lived during three epochs: Pleistocene, Holocene, and now Anthropocene. Earth during the Pleistocene was very different from today; the epoch was characterized by a harsh climate, strong winds and storms, and large ice sheets. Climate was highly variable and humans survived in small nomadic groups for around 190,000 years through this period.
18,000 years ago, the ice caps began to melt and approximately 11,000 years ago we entered a period of unusually stable climate called the Holocene. Everything we know and recognize as human civilization dates to this epoch: agriculture, cities, and complex societies. Any person’s name you can think of comes from this period; most of the objects from the past that we identify with (architecture, farming, the wheel, and writing) are Holocene innovations. These hallmarks of civilization originate from a period of relative climatic stability that is less than 6% of our time on Earth. Our species has been fortunate, perhaps more than we realise. The stability of the Holocene climate allowed our species to thrive.
Mixed into this relative stability were periods of climatic interruption. These were brief, several centuries, of warmer or cooler temperatures in certain regions. Though these changes hardly compare to the great variability of the Pleistocene, they had a significant impact on societies. These regional climatic changes include the Late Antique Little Ice Age from 536-660 AD (2C cooler), Early Medieval Warm Period from 950-1200 AD (1.2-1.4C warmer), and the Little Ice Age from 1300-1700 AD (0.6C cooler).
Though these were temperature changes of less than 2 degrees, we know these periods for their social upheaval. The climate change in Europe around the 6th-7th century AD led to the large-scale migrations that contributed to the decline of the Western Roman Empire. Change in Mesoamerica caused a decline in rainfall and droughts that led to collapse of Mayan cities during the Terminal Classic Period. The effects of climate change begin quite subtly, but lead to tipping points. A small change in temperature or precipitation can cause droughts or floods, which in turn prompt civil unrest and migrations. In the past, these periods of climatic interruption affected rainfall, caused extreme weather events and changes in crop yields, diseases, and eventually cities.
Europe during the Little Ice Age experienced increased flooding along its major rivers. This period had a relatively small temperature change, but it caused increased precipitation and extreme weather events. Rome, built on the Tiber River, saw dramatic flooding. This affected life in the city and increased the rates of diseases among the population. Disease included St Anthony’s Fire, which caused the body’s limbs to swell and fall off before the patient succumbed to death.
When discussing climate change, scientists are referring to global climate. Humans have not previously impacted global climate; however, archaeology shows that our ancestors did make global impacts in other forms. For instance, the amount of atmospheric lead found in Greenland ice cores demonstrates that lead manufacturing from the 6th century BC through the 4th century AD affected the global atmosphere, peaking during the Roman Period. Additionally, many civilisations caused environmental change within their geographic region that significantly impacted their ability to survive. Archaeology does not show previous anthropogenic climate change, but it does demonstrate that humans can have a global impact and there are numerous examples of large-scale environment degradation affecting societies. In many cases, the archaeological record shows that human societies do not react well to change.
Social change due to climate does not mean we will return to the Stone Age or experience a post-apocalyptic society as depicted in Hollywood films. In the past, a change of a degree has led to gradual but persistent change. A tipping point was reached and climate change contributed to the restructuring of people’s lives. What would this look like today? A lot like Syria, where decreased crop yields led to migration to cities, causing unemployment to increase and eventually civil unrest when people could not find food, shelter, or security. In 2009 – 2 years prior to the Arab Spring – the International Institute for Sustainable Development warned that rising temperatures due to climate change could impact crop yields and increase violent conflict in the Middle East.
Currently, we have already experienced an increase of 1C, a change that is greater than the Little Ice Age and on par with the Early Medieval Warm Period, and it will be 2C by 2050, which will exceed Holocene temperature changes. The social upheaval and migrations seen in Syria may become more prevalent as we enter this new epoch, the Anthropocene, characterised by human impact on the planet. Archaeology has the benefit of the long view and findings demonstrate something very clearly: climate change is a fact of our dynamic planet and societies do not handle change well. The current change is something new – caused by humans – and potentially greater in magnitude.
We have built our lives and societies for a Holocene Earth. However, this climate is now changing. Political factions have entrenched themselves over whether it is human-induced change or not, despite a preponderance of scientific evidence in support that it is. Perhaps it is time to take action rather than engage in partisan debates. Past civilizations have not fared well when faced with climate change; however, this time science says we have the ability to do something about it.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/nov/09/the-climate-has-changed-before-but-this-is-different-look-at-the-archeological-record

It occurs to me that we are living at one of the most pivotal times in human history - when what we do will make more difference than at any time in the past. A bit like when Britain had the option of fighting Hitler or suing for a humiliating peace in 1939, but this time it's even more crucial. In the current climate battle, the odds are against us.

I don't think one can say Hurricane Sandy was caused by global warming, however the oceans were several degrees above normal for both Sandy and Typhoon Haiyaan and the base sea level was higher than before the industrial revolution, so global warming exacerbated the storms. The extra foot or so of sea level rise we’d seen by then caused Sandy to flood an extra 25 square miles.
Another interesting thing about Sandy, changes in the jet stream—which recent science indicates may be an effect of arctic ice decline—allowed Sandy to follow a highly unusual and unusually destructive path. This path was directly into land with the dangerous semi-circle of the storm piling water ashore.

I thought the science was settled?
Given we are discussing the trend in storm frequency and intensity over the last 40 years, how and why would that data change in recent years? Threre is fixed historical record of storm strength and activity and nothing since 2012 would change that. I suppose if there had been some sort of sudden acceleration of storm activity since 2012 one might justify claiming that the data now showed some trend whereas in 2012 and before, it hadn't. The problem is that the years since 2012 have been one of the quietest for storm activity on record.
Trying to create a spurious link between recent astorms, which in the context of the historical record have not been particulalry unsual or exceptional, is just a desperate (and I have to say shabby) wrangling of the science in order to whip up support for a poltical position.

Here I define an index of the potential destructiveness of hurricanes based on the total dissipation of power, integrated over the lifetime of the cyclone, and show that this index has increased markedly since the mid-1970s. 
This trend is due to both longer storm lifetimes and greater storm intensities. I find that the record of net hurricane power dissipation is highly correlated with tropical sea surface temperature, reflecting well-documented climate signals, including multi-decadal oscillations in the North Atlantic and North Pacific, and global warming. 
My results suggest that future warming may lead to an upward trend in tropical cyclone destructive potential, and—taking into account an increasing coastal population—a substantial increase in hurricane-related losses in the twenty-first century.

And what about the 5 DECADES' worth of emissions which are ALREADY in the atmosphere? 
There is latency in the system. i.e. LAG. If you boil a huge VAT of cold water it will take at least half an hour to come to the boil.
The earth system is massive. Emissions which go into the atmosphere cause warming DECADES down the line.
The record temperatures we are now experiencing with all the dire knock-on effects are from CO2 emissions from as early as back in the 1960s. IF we're very lucky, from emissions as recently as the mid 1980s, 30 years ago.
But emissions have gone up 10 fold since the 1980s. So the record temperatures, drought, warming oceans, acidifyied oceans, wildfires, intensified hurricanes, dying coral reefs, floodings and sea level rises are all climate responses to emissions way back in time and we have NOT yet experienced a climate response to HUGELY increased emissions from say, the mid 1980s onwards.

Hang on, you've just said that it's too late. So now we can do something about it? .
BQEND
To be clear (but you know this already, you're just playing mind games), I'm saying it is too late to ONLY be relying on stopping future emissions at some indefinable point in the future. Because anything up to FOUR DECADES worth of emissions are ALREADY in the atmosphere.
Therefore, the greatest urgency is to clean up the atmosphere.
BQSTART
For sequestration to work as you suggest, it would have to be at a greater rate than we're emitting CO2 
BQEND
Ooh. A big word to pretend you know what you're talking about. 'Sequestration' is carbon storage or stripping out carbon at source so as to prevent it entering the atmosphere.
Geo-engineering is not sequestration. It involves trying to find a method of stripping out CO2 ALREADY in the atmosphere. That's the first and greatest challenge. Then afterwards, of course, to continue to filter CO2 out of the atmosphere. That comes later.
Get it?
Now, why do I think you don't!

Western Europe uses around three times the energy per person that the world as a whole does. So reducing energy consumption by a third seems a “reasonable” change wouldn’t you agree?
BQEND
No, because the effect, on climate change, of energy use, or CO2 emissions, is not per person, but cumulative. So 300 poor people using the same as 100 wealthier people are doing equal damage. That it's spread over more people means nothing. 
This idea that poorer areas can continue consuming at increasing rates, through some kind ""fairness"" policy, is very dangerous. Because they will not want to stop doing so unless and until (and maybe not even then) they have got what Westerners have. And why should they?
But as there are so many more of them, the effects of that happening will be proportionally worse. What needs to happen is for everyone to stabilise or reduce their usage and emissions.

The unbearable reality of climate change.
These events will continue to take place, though, won't they? And even IF the world begins radically to reduce emissions, the atmosphere is still responding to emissions from back in the 1980s, possibly as far back as the 1960s.
So temperatures will continue to rise, the seas will continue to warm, runaway heating will occur. And what then? 
This article is absolutely essential to try to force nations to see the reality for what it is. Global warming cannot be halted by taking action in the future. There is still at least 2 decades if not 3 decades if not 4 or 5 decades worth of emissions that are in the atmosphere which will result in devastating increases in warming.
The hurricane season next year is likely to be at the same intensity. Drought and floods will also likely be at the same intensity or worsening.
Which is why this country wasting its time and money on Brexit and any country spending its time doing anything other than concentrating on finding a geo-engineering solution to rid the atmosphere of CO2 and methane is a country displaying total and utter dereliction of duty.
The countries wrecked by the hurricane season should absolutely be restored by other nations around the world who have CAUSED climate change. The USA, UK, Europe, China - the whole world should rebuild these wrecked countries.
But - next year the devastation will return. So next year, or the year after, or the year after that, we will likely see hundreds of millions of people being forced to leave these devastated regions.
And then what? Will we be calling them 'economic migrants'? Will we be hoarding them onto fields at Callais, forcing them to live in tents in some barren wasteland, guarded over by men with rifles, in case they try to escape to another country in an effort to rebuild their lives?
Across the world, right now, today, there are hundreds of thousands of people displaced by war, starvation, famine, violence - seeking sanctuary but ignored, reviled and imprisoned, in their desperate poverty and need; locked up in detention centres in the UK, herded onto guarded islands offshore Australia, cramped into refugee camps in Africa.
The world has to act as one to protect all citizens across the world as climate devastation hits us. It will be pointless, in a way, as the planet is in terminal danger. But fair's fair. Over the next 20 - 30 years, we will see what we will see. We ain't seen nothing yet. 
But why should people who have not caused climate change be the ones to suffer the consequences, while developed nations continue on exactly as before, as we do today, still burning coal, still living our high consumerist lifestyles - and still denouncing and rejecting or imprisoning migrants?

On her right there was a fridge and on her left a ruined mattress – the only recognisable possessions among the jumble of concrete, wood, metal, glass, galvanised iron and everything else that just a few weeks ago used to be her home. She and her family had been spared but they had lost everything when the wrath of Hurricane Maria exploded there, another terrifying manifestation of climate change.
Just down the road, MP Denise Charles, who was taking me round the island to assess the damage, pointed to a spot marked with debris, trees and boulders. At first I thought she was showing me a damaged road. Then she told me there used to be three houses on that spot. Fourteen people are thought to have perished when Maria smashed these homes into nonexistence.
Everywhere I went these stories were repeated. Every corner of this precious island, decimated. Flying in, I did not recognise Dominica, the land of my birth. The once flourishing, green vegetation that rolled over every mountain and carpeted the valleys is gone. It has been replaced by sickly brown, bald patches of land and naked trees, stripped of their bark and lying on the ground like discarded matchsticks or sticking up in the air in stark defiance.
Travelling around the country was difficult, with recently constructed roads caved in and barely accessible. I was shell-shocked when I visited Scotts Head, a beloved fishing village that holds many fond memories for me. It was virtually unrecognisable. Every house on the water’s edge is gone. In their place is now a beach, some rubble and a solitary boat, the only reminder of the once flourishing fishing trade.
In Barbuda, another Caribbean island, there is a similar tale of utter devastation. Driving through the ghostly empty streets on the evacuated island it was hard to imagine that just two months ago this was a vibrant community. Our guides spoke about landmarks in the past tense. “This used to be a church, this was the police station,” pointing to a roofless blue building. I walked around a primary school that looked like it had been bombed, and a hospital that would have to be rebuilt almost from scratch.
These pictures are seared into my memory. The stories of utter terror in the dead of night, of not knowing if you will survive, of people emerging the next morning like zombies, of funerals and memorials, will be in my mind every time I go into a meeting about my 52 member states.
But now, the glare of the media spotlight is dimming and my fear is that this story will slide off the international agenda. We absolutely cannot allow that to happen, because what I witnessed in the last week are two countries in the Caribbean in deep humanitarian crisis.
And what makes it even more worrying are the rules that the international community has set to help make aid distribution fair. There is a huge question mark over whether some of the countries affected by Irma and Maria will be able to get the help they need.
Dominica is currently classed as upper middle income, which still makes it eligible for Overseas Development Assistance. But Antigua and Barbuda is a high-income country, which excludes it from receiving that assistance. Under criteria set by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, those islands will probably cease to be recipients of assistance this year.
The fact is, it is not fair to exclude higher income but climate-vulnerable countries from that vital assistance when they are stuck by a cataclysmic disaster. Certainly not in this new epoch in which category 5 hurricanes, which used to come once in a lifetime, are coming within weeks of each other and with a new kind of ferocity. What Hurricanes Irma and Maria demonstrated, with vicious clarity, is that a high-income country could be made destitute in a matter of hours.
It’s heartening that, after tireless advocacy from the Commonwealth and other organisations, and leadership by the UK, these rules are going to be reviewed. My worry is that change will not happen quickly enough to meet the mammoth challenges facing the Caribbean and other regions that have been so grievously damaged by a season of climatic upheaval.
All those involved in making these rules, such as the World Bank and the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee, have to consider seriously our present reality and to create eligibility criteria that adequately respond to what countries, particularly those more prone to natural disasters, are actually experiencing.
This is a concern for all of us; because just before the Caribbean hurricanes, hundreds died in mudslides in Sierra Leone and in floods in Asia, and thousands were displaced.
This is not just about a woman, thousands of miles away, sitting amid the wreckage of her home. This is about a rapid, drastic change in climate that is wreaking havoc on our planet. Even in Ireland, Storm Ophelia claimed three lives last month.
We need to accept the new reality of fast and furious natural disasters and have a plan to deal with it. We need a targeted global response that enables us to implement the Paris agreement on climate change and better coordinate a rapid reaction, with everything taken into account: search and rescue, regional coordination and legal impediments, such as the revision of aid rules.
But it also needs to recognise that the human spirit demonstrated by the Commonwealth during this traumatic period is something upon which we can build. We need all hands on deck. If not us, who – and if not now, when?

Shale gas has made energy production in the US much better for the environment and much better for public health too.
BQEND
This is to some extent true. But the climate budget of it is a bit more problematic - due to ""leaks"", much of it methane. 
I do agree that gas is a stepping-stone for a short while. But most because gas is a thermal energy-source that can be quickly adjusted/started/shut down - as it is jet-engines we talk about here. Under big scale development of intermittent renewal and storage capacity - gas is ""better"" in this respect. 
But at the same time - it is obviously not a solution. Not even with CCS. 
Good thing - in most nations around the world, solar and wind is doing better on price than all fossils. For example in India, solar with thermal storage is cheaper than fossils. 
Look at the cost of energy in Australia - a fossil-based nation. The price doubled after they cut the ""terrible"" carbon tax. Just proving that coal/source is not what defines price. How the marked works, how the infrastructure works, how regulation works is WAY more important for price than source (remember - Australia lives in the illusion that they are to sell coal for profit to China and India - while they power their own grid at a price that is world leading to their own people).', u'recommendation_count': u'7', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1510260421000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'leaks', u'effect': u'a bit more problematic'}, {u'cause': u'most gas is a thermal energy source started', u'effect': u'but shut down as it is jet engines we talk about here'}, {u'cause': None, u'effect': u'their own people'}], u'author_id': u'4706143', u'in_reply_to': u'107994304', u'id': u'107995218', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'GoldenAppleCorps', u'text': u'Quote;'The US is the ultimate evil empire, only mitigated by the ignorance of its inhabitants.

Bloomberg, a UN special envoy on climate change and former mayor of New York city, has funded a $164m campaign in the US since 2010, during which time more than half the nation’s coal-fired power plants have been closed.
On Thursday, he announced a $50m (£38m) plan to expand the programme into Europe and then the rest of the world. The money will support grassroots campaigns, research on the health impacts of coal and legal action against coal plants that are breaking pollution rules. 
Bloomberg is attending the global climate change summit in Bonn, Germany, where he is leading a group of states, cities and businesses pledging action in the US despite President Donald Trump’s opposition.
Coal burning still accounts for about 20% of all of the European Union’s carbon emissions, with Germany and Poland by far the biggest polluters. Bloomberg’s initiative aims to speed up the phase-out of coal by capitalising on the fast falling costs of renewable energy alternatives and rising concerns about air pollution.
Where action is being taken, such as in the UK, coal is declining rapidly. Until recently, the UK was Europe’s third biggest coal polluter, with the fuel providing 40% of the nation’s electricity, but this has fallen to 2% in just five years. In Germany, coal emissions have only been falling slowly, though on Tuesday the city of Munich voted to close its coal-powered plant 13 years early.
“Coal is the single biggest polluter,” Bloomberg told the Guardian. “If you could just replace coal with any other fuel, you would make an enormous difference in the outlook for climate change.”
He said rising concerns over air pollution, which causes millions of premature deaths every year around the world, is an even more immediate driver for phasing out coal: “If you live downstream of a coal-fired power plant your life expectancy is significantly shorter. This initiative will help to speed progress and save many lives.”
Bloomberg argues that the mass closure of coal plants in the US did not result from government action, but from civil society advocacy building on the falling costs of renewable energy: “Sometimes a little push will get you over, perhaps from a neighbour saying ‘I don’t want to breathe that stuff any more’.”
In October, Bloomberg said: “The war on coal … was started and continues to be led by communities who are tired of having their air and water poisoned when there are cleaner and cheaper alternatives available.”
In Europe, some of the new funding will be administered by the European Climate Foundation, which is led by Laurence Tubiana, who was France’s climate change ambassador when the landmark Paris deal was signed in 2015. “Europe still relies significantly on coal for power generation, but the rapid pace of development in cheap renewables offers a great opportunity,” she said. “Together with Bloomberg Philanthropies, we can help change the course of history and drive Europe’s shift to a cleaner, healthier and more prosperous future.”
The UK’s climate change minister Claire Perry welcomed the new initiative: “The UK was one of the first countries in the world to commit to phasing out unabated coal-fired power generation by 2025 and we encourage other nations to follow our lead. Reducing global coal consumption is a vital part of reaching our climate goals.”
Jonathan Marshall, at the UK’s Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit said: “Tackling coal across Europe is essential if we are going to keep global warming below dangerous levels. But there are some clear laggards: Germany, Poland and Turkey.”
“Public opinion is only moving in one direction, and coupled with market conditions that see coal pushed to the margins, the lifetime of the black stuff is surely limited,” he said.
Bloomberg is now looking for partners to push the coal campaign into Asia, where most coal is burned and the coal industry hopes it might see growth: “I hope to expand it in the near future.”
But he rejected arguments that coal plants are the fastest and most cost-effective way to bring electricity to the many millions of people around the world who do not have it: “Number one, it is not the cheapest or quickest, and number two, how many people are you going to kill [with air pollution]?”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/09/michael-bloombergs-war-on-coal-goes-global-with-50m-fund

So while the past may be a foreign country, the future is an increasingly familiar one – in which we continue to be alarmingly ourselves.
In this vivid and disturbing climate-change novel, Chris Beckett, winner of the Arthur C Clarke award, compellingly illustrates the consequences of our species’ fatal hard-wiring. Though a knight’s move away from his acclaimed sci-fi trilogy Dark Eden, Mother of Eden and Daughter of Eden, his new work shares a preoccupation with the survival and evolution of societies in inhospitable worlds.
From the very first page, Beckett depicts Earth as a Frankenstein’s monster of a planet in which the disturbed climate functions as both setting and antagonist. In the US, “Big Hydro” has usurped the fossil fuel industry, but the damage is still playing out: it is a nation of vast, rotting forests, choking dust bowls and hurricanes of such extremity that “unprecedented” has become a redundant adjective.
With its weather, shorelines and demographics in flux, the isolationist superpower is split into a rich north and a poor south recovering from a succession of wars triggered back in the Tyranny. (Was the tyranny Trump’s? Beckett names no names.) With 40% of the population now Hispanic, por cierto and jesucristo are part of the Anglo lexicon. The privileged classes are known as delicados, while refugees from the drought belt and the Storm Coast are referred to as barreduras (dirt), “dusties” and “storm trash”. Ignorance levels are casually shocking: most citizens have not heard of Abraham Lincoln.
Against this backdrop, fake news stories, rumours and opinions – many generated by “silvertongue” AI capable of generating jokes and sophisticated rhetoric – are so deeply embedded in the culture that real facts are mere raw material to be re-tooled, showcased or suppressed for political expediency. As the novel’s British protagonist Holly notes, persuasion operates on “a calculus of dread and comfort … Which way offers, if only fractionally, the higher level of security, the lower level of threat?”
As a PR executive, these are the waters in which the ambitious Holly has opted to swim. When she agrees to serve on the presidential campaign of her new boss, the quixotic senator Steven Slaymaker, her historian boyfriend Richard and their delicado friends become alarmed at the turn her ambitions are taking. But as an outsider, Holly shares the blue-collar Slaymaker’s disdain for bleeding hearts and hand-wringing. And the attitude is a vote-winner: according to Pollcloud, which Holly can access on the whispernet in micro-seconds, 63% of the population agrees with the statement, “I wouldn’t expect the government to help me, so why should I help others?”
Skilled in the manipulation of the masses, Holly also knows how to capitalise on liberal-elite hypocrisies: when addressing an audience of billionaires at a fundraiser, she evokes America as a nation built by people willing to make sacrifices. “This raised a big cheer. Sacrifice was always a moving and uplifting idea, and particularly so if you were not the ones who were going to have to make it.”
It’s a rare moment of humour in a dark, morally troubling world spent in the company of a protagonist whom Beckett – to his credit – seems to be almost defying us to like or respect. Having watched her parents campaigning fruitlessly for systemic change, Holly is refreshed rather than repelled by Slaymaker’s brand of pragmatism, which unashamedly accepts that successful politicians are sharks: if they stop setting the agenda, they die. Action, right or wrong, soon becomes Holly’s guiding imperative too – spawning a brainwave that will have dramatic consequences for the entire North American continent.
Beckett’s focus is less on the speculative question 'what if?' than the more provocative and poignant 'what when?'
By the time Beckett’s story reaches its dystopian conclusion, the reader is forced, through Holly, to contemplate the choice between dirty but effective action and clamorous passivity. With no obvious third way, Beckett poses the question: is it better to roll up your sleeves and do something – perhaps anything at all – than to observe or avert your gaze?
America City is an uneasy read that manages to feel both timely and urgent. In positing his story as a slice of future history, Beckett’s focus is less on the speculative question “what if?” than the more provocative and poignant “what when?” And in setting it within the lifetime of any baby born now, he offers an intelligent, visceral reminder that unless we change what today looks like, tomorrow will be turbulent indeed.

The U.S., China and India are going back to the coal mines. These three countries, the world's biggest coal users, have boosted coal mining in 2017, in an abrupt departure from last year's record global decline for the heavily polluting fuel and a setback to efforts to rein in climate change emissions. 
Mining data reviewed by The Associated Press show that production through May is up by at least 121 million tons, or 6 percent, for the three countries compared to the same period last year.

Ahh... common sense. Let’s try to apply a little more of that. First, you’re talking about the future mostly, thus you’re mostly talking about conjecture. Stay with me on facts here, not conjecture. In the study you linked, it refers to other variables as I have. To your point, it does remove some degree of attribution on things like suppression in high altitude fires. But in the case of the recent fires in the San Francisco area and any other low altitude fires (Los Angeles area fires) I deem that to mean that suppression in low altitude fires IS a crucial variable. In fact, most of the major fires this past season were low altitude fires. 
The point is these fires may have not been as destructive had there not been a suppression strategy for 100 years. At minimum, it’s a valid consideration, and certainly a reasonable challenge to the quick alarmism in the media in the days that followed the events that suggested climate change is to blame for the severity. 
You guys are a bit hypocritical about science. You preach to many about how science is the bedrock. I agree.

Although numerous factors aided the recent rise in fire activity, observed warming and drying have significantly increased fire-season fuel aridity, fostering a more favorable fire environment across forested systems. We demonstrate that human-caused climate change caused over half of the documented increases in fuel aridity since the 1970s and doubled the cumulative forest fire area since 1984. This analysis suggests that anthropogenic climate change will continue to chronically enhance the potential for western US forest fire activity while fuels are not limiting.

It's based on well-established concepts in atmospheric physics, discovered in the 19th century, plus a vast base of evidence in multiple fields of science.
The NASA earth science research programme was created and first funded in the 1980s under the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush.
This was largely in response to the accumulating evidence that climate change was an important issue.
However in the 1990s the 'right' (in some countries) walked away from the issue of climate change.
That is not the fault of scientists or even of the left.
It was for reasons connected to pressure from the organisations that financed the right-wing parties in those countries.

That isn't true is it. The wildfire study was about what has occurred in recent decades. I can also link to studies that show extreme rainfall events which can be devastating are increasing. As for your link, I've read it carefully before. It doesn't say there is not an increase, it actually says there is a small increase, the studies it's based on are mostly up to around 2008 and large increases in storms have been reduced to insignificant increases by including estimates of missed storms. It also says... 
BQSTART
Observed records of Atlantic hurricane activity show some correlation, on multi-year time-scales, between local tropical Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and the Power Dissipation Index (PDI) —see for example Fig. 3 on this EPA Climate Indicators site. PDI is an aggregate measure of Atlantic hurricane activity, combining frequency, intensity, and duration of hurricanes in a single index. Both Atlantic SSTs and PDI have risen sharply since the 1970s, and there is some evidence that PDI levels in recent. cent years are higher than in the previous active Atlantic hurricane era in the 1950s and 60s.

But just to be clear I agree that the take home message from that article is that due to several factors they are not willing to state that there is a statistical increase based on past studies. Yet. But there clearly is a scientific consensus, and the IPCC state state, that tropical storm frequency is unlikely to increase but intensity will. You cannot handwave that away like you have handwaved away evidence of increased wildfires due to global warming. Based on all evidence it would be dumb to wait until the latest studies show a definite statistically significant increase. As I've said there are also studies based on observations that show that devastating floods are increasing. Only you seem to be of the opinion that global warming is only about sea level rise. Nobody credible thinks that is a remotely likely outcome. It's also difficult not to make a connection that recent extreme storms are not likely to have been exacerbated by warmer sst's.

Once again, I’m making a point about the past record, I’m fully aware that this study makes predictions about the future. But those aren’t facts..... stick to facts and scientific findings pls.
“If we instead consider Atlantic basin hurricanes, rather than all Atlantic tropical storms, the result is similar: the reported numbers of hurricanes were sufficiently high during the 1860s-1880s that again there is no significant positive trend in numbers beginning from that era (Figure 3, black curve, from CCSP 3.3 (2008)). This is without any adjustment for “missing hurricanes”.
The evidence for an upward trend is even weaker if we look at U.S. landfalling hurricanes, which even show a slight negative trend beginning from 1900 or from the late 1800s (Figure 3, blue curve). Hurricane landfalling frequency is much less common than basin-wide occurrence, meaning that the U.S. landfalling hurricane record, while more reliable than the basin-wide record, suffers from degraded signal-to-noise characteristics for assessing trends.
While major hurricanes (Figure 3, red curve) show more evidence of a rising trend from the late 1800s, the major hurricane data are considered even less reliable than the other two records in the early parts of the record. Category 4-5 hurricanes show a pronounced increase since the mid-1940s (Bender et al., 2010) but again, we consider that these data need to be carefully assessed for data inhomogeneity problems before such trends can be accepted as reliable.
The situation for various long-term Atlantic hurricane records and related indices is summarized in Figure 4. While global mean temperature and tropical Atlantic SSTs show pronounced and statistically significant warming trends (green curves), the U.S. landfalling hurricane record (orange curve) shows no significant increase or decrease. The unadjusted hurricane count record (blue curve) shows a significant increase in Atlantic hurricanes since the early 1900s. However, when adjusted with an estimate of storms that stayed at sea and were likely “missed” in the pre-satellite era, there is no longer any significant increase in Atlantic hurricanes since the late 1800s (red curve). While there have been increases in U.S. landfalling hurricanes and basin-wide hurricane counts since the since the early 1970s, Figure 4 shows that these recent increases are not representative of the behavior seen in the century long records. In short, the historical Atlantic hurricane record does not provide compelling evidence for a substantial greenhouse warming-induced long-term increase.”', u'recommendation_count': u'0', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1510334999000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'i granted your point', u'effect': u'hmm proof that you \u2019re a little off'}], u'author_id': u'15456519', u'in_reply_to': u'108033220', u'id': u'108036532', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'rockyrex', u'text': u'Buy your electricity from a non-fossil provider - this is certainly possible in the UK - I've been doing this for about 15 years.

Deep schisms in the US over climate change are on show at the UN climate talks in Bonn – where two sharply different visions of America’s role in addressing dangerous global warming have been put forward to the world.
Donald Trump’s decision to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement has created a vacuum into which dozens of state, city and business leaders have leapt, with the aim of convincing other countries at the international summit that the administration is out of kilter with the American people.
The counter-Trump movement in Bonn is being spearheaded by Jerry Brown, the governor of California, and Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York. Brown, in particular, has assumed the role of a de facto US leader, scheduling more than two dozen events to agitate for renewable energy and emissions cuts to combat what he has called an “existential crisis”.
A US Climate Action Center has been set up for delegates in Bonn, representing the climate change priorities of several thousand US cities, states, tribes and businesses. Corporate giants Mars, Walmart and Citi are expected to push for action on climate change. The center is in lieu of an official US presence – for the first time, the US government won’t have a pavilion at the annual UN climate summit.
At the razzamatazz opening of the alternative US centre on Thursday, California state senator Ricardo Lara told the audience: “Greetings from the official resistance to the Trump administration.” Pausing for cheers and applause, he said: “Let’s relish being rebels. Despite what happens in DC, we’re still here.”
Guests were served free jelly donuts and coffee. “It’s the least we can do after Trump’s announcement that we are leaving,” said one US activist.
At 2,500 sq metres, the alternative US dome – which is marked with the hashtag #wearestillin – is the biggest pavilion at the climate talks. Organisers say it is probably the biggest for any US group in the history of climate conference.
“It’s nice that it’s hard to miss. This is big because our movement is big,” said one of the organisers, Lou Leonard of WWF. “Here we show energy, momentum and confidence. It would slow negotiations down if people in the halls were thinking the US is not with them.”
Following recent decisions by Nicaragua and Syria to join the Paris pact, the US stands alone as the only country in the world to oppose the deal.
“The US is now split and world opinion is going with the state and local players, rather than the federal player,” said Jonathan Pershing, who was the US government’s special envoy on climate change until last year.
“The US is at odds with every other country in the world and yet we see it represented by a federal government as well as competing governors, mayors and members of Congress. It reflects an enormous tension in the US political system over climate change.”
The Trump administration has sent a delegation to Bonn, with the US still officially engaged in implementing the Paris deal until it is able to exit in 2020. Thomas Shannon, an experienced state department diplomat who has previously voiced concern about climate change, is leading the US delegation, assisted by Trigg Talley, who was Pershing’s deputy.
The White House has confirmed that the US will promote the “efficient” use of coal, nuclear energy and natural gas as an answer to climate change in a presentation to delegates in Bonn. Trump has vowed to revive America’s ailing coal sector but this message is likely to to provoke outrage on the global stage.
“It will raise hackles,” said Pershing. “It’s not an argument that people will accept internationally.”
Differences may sharpen next week when countries start to discuss financing plans, but so far observers say it has mostly been business as usual.
“We are seeing 196 parties trying to move forward and put the Paris accord into effect. They don’t want to let the US impede that progress,” said David Waskow of the World Resources Institute.
But participants from other nations said the change is already apparent.
“It’s as though the US negotiators have been dipped in aspic,” said one delegate. “They are scared stiff of upsetting the White House. They try to be constructive, but they don’t want that known.”
Another delegate said: “We have lost the leadership the US used to provide. They have the best negotiating team and they are usually put forward strong arguments, but in talks this year, they have been quiet. You can feel they are a little lost. It must be so hard for them now. I sympathise.”
“I think it’s all going to be a little awkward,” said Sue Biniaz, a former state department official who was the lead US lawyer at climate negotiations for two decades. “In the past the US was the leader and brought a lot of ideas to the table. That will be a loss. But other countries, rightly or wrongly, think the US may stay in under some circumstances so I wouldn’t expect too much hostility.” 
A coalition of 14 US states, including California and New York, have said they are on track to meet the US target of a 26-28% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2025, compared to 2005 levels. The goal was set by Barack Obama’s administration as part of the Paris agreement between 195 nations to avoid dangerous global warming of more than 2C.
Brown has raised his profile in recent months by meeting China’s leadership to discuss clean energy technology and becoming a special adviser for states and regions during the Bonn talks.
On Tuesday, he met EU leaders in Brussels as a prelude to talks on how to link California’s cap and trade emissions system with the similar emissions mechanism used by the 28-state bloc. California has a legislated goal to cut its emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. 
“We are truly facing a challenge unprecedented in human history,” Brown said in a speech to the European parliament. “We have to completely transform to a zero-carbon world. We have to do it faster than most people are probably thinking about. 2050 is too late.” 
In a nod to the clout of large US states, Brown later included two of them when naming countries that could do more on climate change – “the United States, Texas, California, Russia, India.”
European leaders welcomed Brown’s words.
“The approach of Mr Trump is not necessarily as helpful as it might be. But we are delighted to have Governor Brown here because it shows there is a strong commitment from the US,” said Antonio Tajani, the president of the European parliament.
However, governors such as Brown or Andrew Cuomo, his New York counterpart, cannot officially take the place of the US president in UN climate talks. Their emissions pledges do not supersede the official US position and, in any case, the 14 committed states only have influence over around half of total US emissions.
Analysts have warned that without national leadership, the US is in danger of missing its emissions reduction goals and will jeopardize international efforts to stave off 2C of warming, which would lead to elevated sea level rise, intensified droughts, heatwaves and wildfires. 
Brian Schatz, a Democratic senator from Hawaii who is attending the Bonn talks, said members of Congress, including Republicans, were concerned over how the withdrawal has hurt America’s standing in the world.“If you show up at a climate conference to talk about coal, you’re likely to be ignored,” he said. “I think the We Are Still In delegation will get more attention than the executive branch.“We’ve gone from the indispensable leader to being the only country not engaged in climate change. Many people in Congress are troubled not only from a climate standpoint but a geopolitical standpoint. China is happy to take that leadership from us.” ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/09/bonn-climate-change-talks-us-two-tribes

Released half-way through the COP23 in Bonn, which Fiji is presiding over, the report highlights five major interventions and 125 further actions that it says are necessary to achieve Fiji’s development objectives, while facing the potentially devastating impacts of climate change. Combined those actions would cost about US$4.5bn over the next decade.
The report concluded that some parts of the country, especially those on low-lying outer islands, could be made uninhabitable by sea level rise and increased storm surges. It recommended existing towns and cities be made more resilient, but also for brand new and resilient greenfield sites to be constructed to house the growing population.
In light of the results, the World Bank and Fiji called for the world to lift its ambitions in fighting climate change, and also for the developed world to help the world’s most vulnerable people adapt and build resilience to climate change.
“The results of the [Climate Vulnerability Assessment] reinforce what we already know to be true – that the situation we face is urgent and the world needs to immediately raise its ambition to tackle this great threat,” said Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, Fiji’s attorney general and minister responsible for climate change in a foreword to the report.
But he said the report itself would assist in that happening, since it “provides a specific blueprint that quantifies the resources necessary to climate-proof Fiji, giving us a full account of the threat that climate change poses to our national development.”
Victoria Kwakwa, vice president, East Asia and the Pacific at the World Bank said the Paris Agreement was not just a commitment to keeping global temperature rise well below 2C, but “also a global commitment to help build resilience and adaptation capacity among vulnerable countries – especially those most at risk from climate change, such as Small Island Developing States.”
In the report, Fiji called on the world to take “drastic action that limits greenhouse gas emission while supporting action to enhance resilience.”
It notes that Fiji has limited capacity to manage those risks itself, and that investment from other nations was needed.
The biggest investment needed to build resilience in the country was into transport, where US$228m was needed each year, the report found. A detailed analysis in the report found specific parts of the road network that were critical for the country, and should be strengthened to protect against worsening storms.
Significant sums were needed to protect the country’s water, health and education facilities, housing and environmental assets.
“These investments and expenditures would have resilience-related benefits that extend over decades – far beyond their implementation period – as well as significant non-resilience benefits, improving the population’s well-being and development prospects,” the report found.
Fiji is expected to face as much as a metre of sea level rise by the end of the century, increasing the risk of coastal flooding, with flood events that currently happen only once a century expected to recur every second year if global emissions are not abated.
In just a few decades – by 2050 – the fraction of the country’s GDP lost every year due to tropical cyclones is expected to increase by up to 50%, reaching more than 6.5%. That estimate didn’t include the additional risk caused by sea level rise, which would magnify it further.
The report also concluded that some parts of the country, especially those on low-lying outer islands, could be made uninhabitable by sea level rise and increased storm surges.
It also highlighted the impacts climate change would have on Fiji’s health system, with water-borne diseases and respiratory diseases expected to worsen. “These health issues threaten the Fiji population and will challenge the health care system, and could also have a negative impact of some key sectors of the economy, especially the tourism sector, which is highly vulnerable to negative risk perceptions,” the report said.
Coming less than two years after Tropical Cyclone Winston devastated the country, killing 44 people and costing the economy 20% of its GDP, the findings are likely to raise some attention at COP23.
In a statement released with the report, prime minister of Fiji and current president of COP23 Voreqe “Frank” Bainimarama said: “As the president of the COP23 and on behalf of the small island nations, and building on the findings of this report, Fiji is asking the world for drastic action on climate change-building resilience through adaptation and reducing greenhouse gas emissions so that climate change does not impose a limit to our development and the aspiration of our people to live in their own lands.”
The talks going on this week and next at COP23 are focused on writing the “rulebook” for implementing the Paris Agreement – including how countries will be required to “ratchet up” their commitments to achieve the agreed aims.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/10/fiji-told-it-must-spend-billions-to-adapt-to-climate-change

 Brett Mullan, from the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (Niwa), crunched the temperature records from two 30-year-periods over the last century to see if New Zealand was experiencing the same contraction of winter weather noted in other parts of the world.
New Zealand’s winter starts at the beginning of June and runs to 31 August, a total of 92 days. In the South Island and some parts of the North Island winter weather usually means snow, frosts, “black ice” on the roads and temperatures as low as -7C overnight.
Mullan defined a winter’s day as one in which the daily average temperature was less than 9C. He examined temperatures between 1909 to 1938, and 1987 to 2016 from seven geographically representative regions around New Zealand.
Mullan discovered there was an average of 100 days per year between 1909 and 1938 when the temperature was less than 9C, compared with only 70 days per year between 1987 and 2016. 
Winter has contracted about equally from both ends of the season, he said. 
“I was quite surprised to get essentially the same results as the US – a decline of a month,” Mullan told the Guardian. 
“The temperatures are rising, they are milder, they are also starting half a month later and ending half a month earlier, so they are becoming more concentrated in the centre of the June, July, August period.” 
The temperatures are rising, they are milder, they are also starting half a month later and ending half a month earlier
Mullan’s study showed that winter as defined by temperature also varied from year to year and did not fall neatly within the three month southern hemisphere parameters. 
Last year winter was “essentially” confined to July and August and June was unusually warm, while this year the reverse was true, and August was unusually warm. 
The number of frosts throughout the winter months has also declined, Mullan found.
“I expected the general pattern because we know New Zealand is warming, but it interested me that it was a full month and was so close to the US experience,” he said. 
“It will certainly affect things like kiwi fruit production because the north of the country is becoming too warm, they are gradually moving kiwi production south. ” 
“Wintertime is also very important for famers when it kills pests. If it stays too warm pests can reproduce right through the year. There are benefits too. If temperatures are higher you increase the growing-degree days and crops can mature more quickly, but the natural system has evolved to live with the winter conditions and it is quite important.” 
New Zealand temperatures would continue to increase and winters would continue to get shorter and shorter, he said. 
The new Labour government in New Zealand has said climate change is this generation’s nuclear moment and has committed to several new policies to tackle the warming climate.

But Anderson and Bows go further, pointing out that this target cannot be met with the array of modest carbon pricing or green-tech solutions usually advocated by big green groups. These measures will certainly help, to be sure, but they are simply not enough: a 10 per cent drop in emissions, year after year, is virtually unprecedented since we started powering our economies with coal. In fact, cuts above 1 per cent per year “have historically been associated only with economic recession or upheaval”, as the economist Nicholas Stern put it in his 2006 report for the British government.
 Even after the Soviet Union collapsed, reductions of this duration and depth did not happen (the former Soviet countries experienced average annual reductions of roughly 5 per cent over a period of ten years). They did not happen after Wall Street crashed in 2008 (wealthy countries experienced about a 7 per cent drop between 2008 and 2009, but their CO2 emissions rebounded with gusto in 2010 and emissions in China and India had continued to rise). Only in the immediate aftermath of the great market crash of 1929 did the United States, for instance, see emissions drop for several consecutive years by more than 10 per cent annually, according to historical data from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Centre.

The mayor then reneges on payment and the piper exacts a savage revenge on the town’s ingrates by luring away their children, who are never seen again.
The tale could also be an allegory for today’s grim intergenerational smash-and-grab – the global economy. As environmentalist Paul Hawken put it: “We have an economy where we steal the future, sell it in the present, and call it GDP.”
Like the hapless mayor of Hamelin, elected officials all over the world are today blindly pursuing growth-as-usual, while the gathering climate catastrophe rumbles ever closer. We adults may, if we’re lucky, get to die peacefully in our beds, but it’s our children who will be left to pay the ecological piper.
As COP23 negotiators meet this week in another German town, the children are fighting back. Sophie Kivlehan, the 18-year-old granddaughter of former Nasa scientist Prof James Hansen, spoke in Bonn of her anger and fear “at the problems that greedy and foolish adults have created”. She is one of a group of 20 youths who filed the Juliana v US climate lawsuit in Oregon in 2015. 
Despite determined efforts by lobbyists to quash the case, it is now set to be heard in February 2018. “I have no doubt that the right to a climate system capable of sustaining human life is fundamental to a free and ordered society” was the view of US district judge Ann Aiken, in denying motions filed by the Trump administration opposing the suit.
Last month NGO Friends of the Irish Environment (FIE) filed a legal challenge against the Irish government over its failure to take steps to honour its climate commitments under the Paris agreement, and so endangering future generations. The FIE suit is modelled on a successful similar action taken in the Dutch courts by the Urgenda Foundation. They ruled in 2015 that the Dutch government had acted unlawfully in failing to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 25% by 2020. Similar cases are being brought in New Zealand, India, the Philippines and South Africa, among others. 
Despite being on track for climate neutrality by 2030, the Norwegian government is being sued by citizen activists for issuing oil drilling licences in the Arctic Ocean, which make a mockery of its supposed domestic green credentials. 
Pope Francis, the first pontiff from the global south, weighed in powerfully on the moral arguments against the havoc to the biosphere wrought by neoliberalism: “The thirst for power and possessions knows no limits. In this system, which tends to devour everything which stands in the way of increased profits, whatever is fragile, like the environment, is defenceless before the interests of a deified market.”
Geophysicist Dr Brad Werner made waves five years ago with the publication of his paper titled: Is Earth F**ked? (the asterisks are his). When pressed for an answer to his own question, he ventured: “more or less”. In his analysis, the system itself is incapable of internally responding to the deepening ecological crises that encircle civilisation. The only possible hope, he suggested, lay in active resistance. He identified this as “environmental direct action, resistance taken from outside the dominant culture, as in protests, blockades and sabotage by indigenous peoples, workers and other activist groups”. 
Those who resist face arrest, harassment, and worse. Almost four murders a week of environmental and land defenders were recorded in 2016.
With politicians failing to step up to the climate challenge, what are the alternatives? One intriguing experiment in direct democracy has just concluded in Ireland, where a government-appointed Citizens’ Assembly composed of a nationally representative group of people selected at random heard detailed expert testimony on climate change from a range of experts. No lobbyists or politicians were allowed in the room. 
The result: 13 recommendations for sharply enhanced climate action were overwhelmingly endorsed early this month, including citizens being personally prepared to pay more tax on high-carbon activities. The recommendations will now be discussed in parliament. Democracy may be dysfunctional, but rumours of its death have, perhaps, been exaggerated.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/10/can-direct-democracy-offer-a-third-way-to-meet-the-climate-challenge

Yeah, ya know, nobody actually thinks that.
There are, however, certain problems that only governments can fix. This is one of them. The markets created this problem. They're not going to fix it.
US emissions have declined but they are still way too high. The markets have not done, and will never do, nearly enough.

It's one of the major problems with set term democratic systems - that terms are too short for long term serious structural planning vs the need to make policy on short term interests. As the two party system becomes more polarized this is only going to get worse - health care is a prime example. One side will win and push one way investing billions, then the other side will win investing billions reversing what the opposition did. The only way I can see to resolve it is to make our systems more participatory - especially on large structural policy issues. That we have referendums on how much we spend on energy, healthcare, military or education. We have the technology but we just need to figure out how to have the honest conversations that are needed

Not one professional scientific organisation on Earth agrees with him.
As of now, all exploration for new fossil fuel needs to stop.
There's enough fossil fuel already 'on book' around the world to make Antarctica ice-free.
There's a scientific paper - ""Combustion of available fossil fuel resources sufficient to eliminate the Antarctic Ice Sheet"" - Winkelmann et al 2015.
It wouldn't happen all at once, but it would add 3 metres to sea level per century during the first millennium alone.

Through measures such as slapping import tariffs on solar products, scrapping incentives to renewable energy and promoting coal power, the US president could try to alter the economics of pursuing low-carbon energy.
However, many American states, towns and businesses are moving to renewable energy as it is proving lower cost than conventional sources. The recent rise in the price of oil has underlined the volatility of fossil fuels.
Paul Bodnar, a lead US negotiator in the climate talks under former president Barack Obama, told the Guardian that Trump possessed “powerful instruments”, such as import tariffs and quotas, that could hamper the growth of low-carbon technology. “If he chooses, he could use them,” he said. But he warned this would be short-sighted, as China is forging ahead with low-carbon power and the US would risk losing any technological lead.
“It is clear the way the market is driving – towards lower carbon. It would be difficult for a Republican administration to take action that is clearly counter to the forces of the market,” he said.
Coal, he said, was losing ground in the market, even without penalties on carbon output. “A huge percentage of US coal is just flat out uneconomic,” said Bodnar. “Ratepayers are being asked to pay more for incumbent industries. Questions are going to be asked about why that is. It would cost a lot to make coal great again.”
He added: “The direction of travel [for businesses] has been set, and it is lower carbon. The only question is the pace at which that happens. And the pace is important because this is an urgent problem. Trump has the ability to slow that pace, but he cannot reverse it.”
States, mayors, local governments and businesses from the US have gathered together to present an alternative vision to Trump’s policies at the ongoing UN climate talks in Bonn. On Saturday, they will unveil a new initiative to move forward with low-carbon plans in spite of the White House’s opposition.
Trump has begun the process of withdrawing the US from the landmark Paris agreement of 2015, signed and ratified by the US under Obama, but under UN rules this process cannot be completed until November 2020, with the prospective official withdrawal date falling the day after the next presidential election. 
Earlier this week, the Syrian government became the final functioning state to sign up to the Paris agreement. It was the last holdout nation, following the decision by Nicaragua to join the agreement shortly before the current talks. This leaves the US as the only nation poised to reject the 2015 agreement.
Looking to the potential progress at the COP23 talks, Bodnar pointed to China’s actions in pursuing low-carbon policies, in contrast to the US. He said the country’s stance at the UN talks would be key, in part because the US, though present and still a party to the Paris agreement, is taking little active part in the talks, which are focused on upping countries’ commitments to reduce carbon emissions. Current emissions targets are inadequate to keep the Paris goal of limiting global warming to no more than 2C, which scientists say is the limit of safety beyond which the ravages of climate change are likely to become catastrophic and irreversible.
Countries will be expected to come forward in the next few years with new targets that match scientific advice. Bodnar said that in the process of increasing countries’ carbon-cutting, some countries had more room to manoeuvre than others. “What’s interesting is to ask whether some countries left something on the table in 2015 [when setting carbon targets]. Countries that came to Paris with high ambition may find it difficult to crank that up, but others that were more conservative will have room to make higher commitments. China is very important.”
He said he was hopeful that this round of talks would produce momentum leading to higher goals. “It’s a question of perceived self-interest. At Copenhagen in 2009, it wasn’t the case that everyone perceived [cutting carbon sharply] to be in their self-interest. That changed in the run-up to Paris, and now governments do see that they are acting in their own interests by signing up [to higher goals].”
A US state department official at the Bonn COP23 talks said: “This administration believes in corporate federalism and is therefore supportive of states and cities making their own choices within their respective borders.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/10/donald-trump-cannot-halt-us-climate-progress-former-obama-adviser-says

I’ve always been fascinated by energy and thought it was the right time to work in the sector – climate change is high on the political agenda in the UK, with the government pursuing aggressive renewable energy policies. 
I enrolled in the University of Edinburgh’s MSc in energy and climate change in 2011. What attracted me to the course was that it incorporated the latest cutting-edge techniques. I studied full-time for one year and found the programme really enjoyable. I learned about the geoscience behind climate change and renewable technologies that can be deployed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
The most valuable aspect of the master’s is the network – I am still in touch with some classmates. Many of us work in the same or similar fields and help each other solve work-related problems. An alumnus helped me land my current job as a senior policy analyst for electricity transmission at Ofgem, Britain’s independent energy regulator. She helped me understand what Ofgem was looking for and prepared me for the interview. Without the master’s degree, I would not be where I am now. 
After graduation, I worked for the Department of Energy and Climate Change, which promotes international action to mitigate climate change. Then I moved to the European Emissions Trading Scheme, a scheme for trading greenhouse gas emissions allowances. I began working at Ofgem in 2014. My team manages the delivery of several billion pounds of investment in offshore wind farms and electricity transmission networks. My job is to assess the cost of the infrastructure. It involves data analysis and negotiation with windfarm developers – the most challenging part of the job. 
I plan to move into an economist’s role within Ofgem, focusing on competition in the retail energy market. The MSc will become less relevant in that job, but it will still be important to understand the wider sector in which I operate. The industry is driven by government support and policy – exactly what I learned on the master’s.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/nov/10/study-climate-change-masters-postgraduate-students

It's a good story, but no, you got it wrong.

Secondly, if you're on a FiT then you're just making your system inefficient and losing revenue.
If you live off grid (and I do) the chances are you already optimise your panels for the summer/winter season.
One year when I was on a fixed berth I actually hung panels almost vertically to capture light reflected from the water - which didn't really work very well.I spoke to a number of experts (the real type, not pv salesmen/enthusiasts) and the conclusion was it would have worked 'better' with lower efficiency cells.

Absolutely. If this was the 1970-80s they would be supporting coal. If it was the 1990-2000s they would be supporting gas. Now they support ""RE+storage"" simply because to be seen supporting fossil fuel against nuclear power would destroy their credibility (outside of Germany;).
But for the anti-nuclear diehards it is never about tackling climate change. It is never about the environment. Or economics. It is simply about using anything-but-nuclear.
It was pretty clear that the anti-nuclear movement had lost the argument as soon as they started campaigning on cost: If the economics of nuclear power are a real issue, it simply won't be built.

If nuclear costs too much, then it opens the door to a mix of cheap renewables with overcapacity and spill, or storage. Simples.
BQEND
Now you are getting there.
The key question is how much is ""too much""? Nuclear could cost 2 or 3 times solar and still not cost ""too much"" because the cost of storage/overspill multiplies the cost of solar.
You have gotten excited about the situation in the UK because the most expensive nuclear electricity contract in history is HPC at £92.5/MWh whereas the lowest ever UK offshore wind contract has been awarded at £57/MWh.
Now, £57/MWh is a good price but it is not nearly good enough to compete with £92.5/MWh once storage/overspill is accounted for.
And bear in mind £92.5/MWh is the absolute top-end of nuclear prices ever, anywhere; whereas £57/MWh is at the extreme bottom end of yet-to-be-built future renewables prices in the UK.
For your projection to hold, renewables would need to drop by another 30%-50%, storage cost would need to drop by 80%-90%, and nuclear would need to fail to drop by 20% or so.

Energy Watch Group: 100% renewable electricity is both feasible and cost effective
BQSTART
A joint study by Finland’s Lappeenranta University of Technology and Energy Watch Group presented on the sidelines of the COP23 talks in Bonn demonstrates that a global transition to 100% renewable electricity could be achieved by 2050, and would be more cost effective than the current electricity system.
BQEND
BQSTART
The study’s key overall finding is that a global shift to 100% renewable electricity is feasible with current technology, and would be more cost effective than the current system led by fossil fuels and nuclear generation. 
The study found that in a projected scenario for energy demand in 2050, 100% could be met by current renewable technologies, at a global average LCOE of €52/MWh, compared with 2015’s average LCOE of €70.

No, you post the costs and then say you are ""against nuclear which is more expensive, and far slower to deliver than quick, cheap renewables.""
But a complete solution cannot be composed solely from quick and cheap renewables. Even with promising developments in storage.
The conclusion from Lazard, which you have omitted to mention, is:
""Although alternative energy is increasingly cost-competitive and storage technology holds great promise, alternative energy systems alone will not be capable of meeting the base-load generation needs of a developed economy for the foreseeable future. Therefore, the optimal solution for many regions of the world is to use complementary conventional and alternative energy resources in a diversified generation fleet.""
When they say the optimal solution requires ""complementary conventional"" energy resources they mean fossil or nuclear. Nuclear is far cleaner than fossil.
BQSTART
I'm guessing that even you can understand that there is a cost differential (between nuclear and non-nuclear options) beyond which nobody will go. 
BQEND
But that is not even on the horizon. That is why Lazard says ""alternative energy systems alone will not be capable of meeting the base-load generation needs of a developed economy for the foreseeable future"". There is no cheaper ""non-nuclear option"", unless you fall back on fossil fuel.
You are wishfully speculating that a cheaper non-nuclear option might one day be possible because you are fundamentally anti-nuclear. Just like anti-nuclear campaigners have been doing since the 1970s. Meanwhile the non-nuclear solution is fundamentally dependent upon fossil fuel, as ever.
Obviously variable renewables can supply a proportion of the solution more cheaply than the most expensive nuclear power. But they cannot supply all of it more cheaply, even with storage.
Look, the UAE and Bangladesh and Nigeria are all constructing new nuclear plants. Do I think solar is cheaper in those countries? YES.

Lazard finds the cost of both onshore wind and solar has decreased by 6% over the past 12 months, 
Nuclear power is getting more expensive, Lazard reports. In the last 6 years, the cost of building and operating a nuclear power plant has increased by 35%. That has put pressure on a number of utilities who still have nuclear construction projects underway and forced some projects to be abandoned before they are even completed.

BQSTART
My argument is not against 100% nuclear, not even against 10% nuclear, my argument is against any nuclear that is far more expensive, and far slower to deliver than quick, cheap renewables. 
BQEND
If you simply pursue the cheapest option you probably end up with 40%-50% renewables and the rest gas.
Wind and solar can provide a minority proportion of a country's electricity cheaper than the most expensive nuclear (HPC). But they cannot provide all of it.
Your simplistic assumption is that nuclear is not required because the cheapest renewables are lower cost than the most expensive nuclear (HPC). But that only provides a partial solution. The more wind and solar you add, the less cost-effective it becomes. 
You don't need to take my word for it. Just look at how many countries are deploying nuclear power.
The speed of deployment really should not be much of an issue. Since nuclear powerstations have 3-4 times the capacity factor and 2-3 times the lifespan, nuclear capacity only needs to be deployed at about an 8th of the speed of wind or solar. If you look at somewhere like China the rate of growth of nuclear output is about the same as wind or solar (and so, given the lifespan of the plant, it is actually well ahead of the long-term rate required for wind and solar).
If other countries are not building nuclear fast enough, you should be campaigning for them to do better, not coming up with ever more desperate rationalisations for why they should stop.
The bottom line is that if your anti-nuclear hypothesis was correct, you would not need to bother with your desperate campaign against it. Govts would just stop deploying it.

Intermittent renewables should bear the costs of providing backup generation for periods when the wind does not blow or the sun does not shine, then we would see a more level playing field between smaller nuclear reactors under pressure in from negative energy pricing and intermittent, subsidized wind.
BQEND
But we already have gas plants to follow the load, which they are quite good at. 
Most of the cost in a gas plant is the fuel cost itself, so when the wind does blow or the sun does shine, you just burn less gas. At least until storage technology improves, then we can start cutting that out to.
Most of the argument about intermittency seem to depend on a hypothetical situation of 100% renewable energy.
But if we do that, then shouldn't we compare to a 100% nuclear situation? 
Nuclear is great at baseload, but not economically viable for peak following. The capital costs and maintenance costs are huge relative to the fuel. So current nuclear plants are always costed to run pretty much flat out. 
The solutions to run a 100% Nuclear system look remarkably similar to those needed for a 100% renewables system, including pumped hydro storage, lots of excess capacity and demand response (remember storage heaters?). The French nearly managed it, but it cost a bomb (excuse the pun).

I do believe the Chinese have looked significantly further than just the economic cost and are more concerned about the amount of fossil fuels that need to be burnt to support renewables.
BQEND
That old myth!
Anyway, no point arguing, let's just let the economics speak for themselves:
Energy Watch Group: 100% renewable electricity is both feasible and cost effective
BQSTART
A joint study by Finland’s Lappeenranta University of Technology and Energy Watch Group presented on the sidelines of the COP23 talks in Bonn demonstrates that a global transition to 100% renewable electricity could be achieved by 2050, and would be more cost effective than the current electricity system.
BQEND
BQSTART
The study’s key overall finding is that a global shift to 100% renewable electricity is feasible with current technology, and would be more cost effective than the current system led by fossil fuels and nuclear generation. 
The study found that in a projected scenario for energy demand in 2050, 100% could be met by current renewable technologies, at a global average LCOE of €52/MWh, compared with 2015’s average LCOE of €70.
BQEND
BQSTART
In EWG’s 2050 scenario, solar PV covers 69% of electricity demand, wind 18%, hydro 8% and bioenergy 2%. The study predicts that wind will briefly overtake solar in the 2020s, before further price drops put solar back in the lead. 
Storage is outlined as the key supporting technology for solar, with around 31% of total demand covered by storage technologies. 95% of this is projected to come from short term storage provided by batteries, with power to gas conversion providing seasonal storage.

“There is no reason to invest one more dollar in fossil or nuclear power production,” exclaims EWG President Hans Josef. “All plans for a further expansion of coal, nuclear, gas and oil have to be ceased. More investments need to be channeled in renewable energies and the necessary infrastructure for storage and grids. Everything else will lead to unnecessary costs and increasing global warming.”

Since we can only obtain energy when the sun shines or the wind blows at the appropriate speed, without effective storage or nuclear capacity we can only fill the gap between production and demand by burning fossil fuels.

Lazard: Wind & Solar Power Costs Continue To Fall, Putting Coal & Nuclear At A Disadvantage
BQSTART
In its latest report on the cost of electricity generation, Lazard finds the cost of both onshore wind and solar has decreased by 6% over the past 12 months, according to ArsTechnica. The cost of coal has remained the same and the cost of nuclear has increased. “This is expected to lead to ongoing and significant deployment of alternative energy capacity,” Lazard says in a press release. The upshot of all this is that operating a coal-fired facility like the Navajo Generating Station in Arizona may be more than the cost of building and operating a solar or wind power installation. 
Nuclear power is getting more expensive, Lazard reports. In the last 6 years, the cost of building and operating a nuclear power plant has increased by 35%. That has put pressure on a number of utilities who still have nuclear construction projects underway and forced some projects to be abandoned before they are even completed.

BQENDHaving a President that denies AGW and wants to promote coal, should be demonised. As simple as that.
I did say that boycotting the US is extreme, even ridiculous, but let's be honest, it won't happen - just the real threat of international action would be enough to solve this.
In reality Trump's actions won't have a massive effect on the world, but the US is big enough to have some impact, and more importantly having all countries acting together is a additional push/bonus that tells everyone that AGW is real, serious and needs immediate attention.
Trump sold himself as a deal maker, if he loses trade, he'll break, so a strong united front against the US would be enough.

An event next Monday, opening the second week of the ongoing UN negotiations, was originally billed as promoting clean energy. However, it has since been changed to emphasise coal and nuclear power.
The event was first billed with the title Action on Spurring Innovation and Deploying Advanced Technologies but was subsequently changed.
The same event has now been retitled to: The Role of Cleaner and More Efficient Fossil Fuels and Nuclear Power in Climate Mitigation. The speakers are listed as the same, but the explanation of the event’s focus has also changed markedly, from talk of “innovative solutions” and “transforming development pathways” to a strong statement in favour of fossil fuels.
It now reads: “It is undeniable that fossil fuels will be used for the foreseeable future, and it is in everyone’s interest that they be efficient and clean. This panel will explore how the US will be a leader in cutting carbon emissions through cleaner, more efficient fossil fuels and other energy sources.”
There was no explanation of the change. A US state department official declined to comment before the event but noted it would be open to all at the conference.
However, observers said the change was in line with the US government’s stance at the talks, which are focused on how to improve countries’ carbon-cutting targets under the Paris agreement of 2015.
Andrew Light of the World Resources Institute said: “Whoever the Trump administration is trying to target with this event, it isn’t people in the negotiating hall – they’re clearly focused on the booming global markets in renewable energy. At best, this event will be a curiosity, given the isolation of the US now in the international process.”
Although US president Donald Trump has begun the process of removing the US from the Paris agreement, this will not take effect, under the UN processes, until 2020. This means the US is still a party to the agreement and still present at the talks. However, for the first time in at least a decade, the US has no visible official representation. Under Obama, there was always a large US pavilion at the annual meetings – and even under George W Bush, who vowed to keep the US out of the Kyoto protocol even when other countries had ratified it and brought it into force in 2005.
At Bonn, the US occupies a small locked room that often seems unoccupied. There is no pavilion, and Monday’s event on coal and nuclear power is the first public sign of the US government’s engagement, though the UN said US delegates were present at at least some of the many meetings taking place around the event.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/10/us-switches-focus-of-its-bonn-event-from-clean-energy-to-fossil-fuels

Some EU member states could use a sizable chunk of these funds to carry on burning fossil fuels, with Poland, for instance, looking to prolong the lifespan of its ageing coal infrastructure. Using emissions trading revenues to extend the life of coal-fired power plants is extremely irresponsible and works directly against efforts to halt catastrophic climate change.
But coal financing is just the tip of the iceberg. Emissions trading-linked subsidies to big polluters could reach close to €200bn between 2021 and 2030. The largest share of this figure represents free pollution permits handed out to steel and cement producers, helping them to delay the transition away from fossil fuel dependency.
Emissions trading benefits big polluters far more than it does the climate. With the conclusion of the negotiations between the EU commission, parliament and council, the EU has shown that it remains a long way from taking responsibility for its fair share of global climate action.

• Chancellor Philip Hammond has a chance to use his autumn budget, on 22 November, to help tackle Britain’s toxic air crisis. Despite calls for change, the Treasury continues to subsidise certain highly polluting diesel engines, allowing them to burn red diesel. One example of this outdated subsidy supports the second engines that cold delivery trucks often have. Main diesel engines, used to propel the truck, are subject to increasingly tough Euro emission standards.
But second engines, used to keep the back compartment cold while transporting food, are extremely weakly regulated, enabling them to emit six times as much nitrogen oxide and 29 times as much particulate matter as the main engine.
But the Treasury subsidises the diesel for these second engines by £126m a year. The chancellor was right to announce a consultation into red diesel use earlier this year, and he must now end the diesel subsidies for a delivery truck’s second engine. Especially when zero-emission engines are affordably available on the market and could make an immediate positive impact on the air we breathe across the UK.

However, both Gore, the former US vice-president, and Jerry Brown, governor of California, told the Guardian they were confident the US will regain its leadership position on climate change if Trump is defeated in the next presidential election.
Gore, Brown and Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York, are heading a broad coalition of climate change hawks from US states, cities and businesses in Bonn, where UN climate talks are being held. This alliance is in sharp contrast to the official US delegation, which is representing the only national government in the world that doesn’t want to be part of the Paris climate accords.
“I haven’t had any conversations with [Trump] since his speech to withdraw from Paris. I tried my best and thought he’d come to his senses but I’ve been proven wrong,” Gore, who met with Trump during the transition to try to influence his thinking, told the Guardian. “I don’t feel I have the ability to change his mind. He’s surrounded himself with the absolute worst of climate deniers who seem to have captured his mind on the issue.”
Trump has aligned with Scott Pruitt, the head of the US Environmental Protection Agency who is a vocal critic of the Paris deal. Pruitt has cast doubt on whether carbon dioxide drives global warming, and claimed there is “tremendous disagreement” among scientists over climate change. 
Several former and current members of the administration, including Stephen Bannon and Mick Mulvaney, have also previously dismissed evidence for climate science. 
Gore, who is now one of the world’s leading voices on climate change, said other countries are “aghast” at Trump’s retreat from climate policy but said the backlash both within the US and abroad is encouraging.
“The US cities and states have made a tremendous difference and I think the reaction of the rest of the world has minimized the damage done by Donald Trump,” he said. “The reaction to Trump is if anything stronger than the actions Trump is taking.
“This experiment with Trump is less than a year old and in science, experiments are sometimes cut short early. I’m not saying this will happen this time, but this feels like a movie I’ve seen before.
“We went off the rails a bit in the last election. I think the rest of the world understands that the Trump period is an unfortunate departure from what the US is known for when we are at our best. Those who have appreciated US leadership grieve its loss and hope it’s temporary.” 
Brown also said he sees little point attempting to sway the Trump administration. “The official policy of the US is that climate change is a total and complete hoax conceived by Chinese conspirators,” the California governor told the Guardian. “That is so preposterous that engagement on that basis is just useless.”
However, the California governor said mid-term elections in the US next year may pressure Trump to change position. “He’s an action orientated person, not a politician, so who knows,” he said.
“Ultimately we won’t have a denier in the White House forever. We are engaged in a great political struggle between the deniers who want to turn the world over to fossil fuel interests and scientists and concerned activists who want to see decarbonization.
“Donald Trump is a very small point in the overall climate factor. We are facing a moment of truth over whether we can decarbonize or see civilization itself decline over the next 100 years. 
“We have a political sidebar we can tweet about but the existential problem is that species are being destroyed, ecologies are being degraded and mankind is on the chopping block. This isn’t the time for politics, it’s the time for courageous action.”
Brown has attempted to step into the vacuum created by US withdrawal by holding dozens of events and meetings with national leaders, UN officials and NGOs across Europe ahead of the Bonn talks. 
The Democratic governor has taken on a role highlighting the impact of sub-national entities such as California, which would have the sixth largest economy in the world if it were a country and has implemented a ‘cap and trade’ emissions trading system that may soon be linked to a similar mechanism used by European Union countries.
“I want to strengthen the coalition of states and provinces in order to do everything possible to reduce carbon emissions,” Brown said. 
“The great threat to the world is the radically changing climate and the level of indifference and inertia is so powerful that I find it incumbent to build a counterforce of mayors and governments to work together to protect our climate and get us off the carbon addiction.”
The Bonn talks, which will run until 17 November, are largely a technical exercize in helping countries implementing the goals of the Paris agreement, where nearly 200 nations agreed to limit global warming to 2C above the pre-industrial era. 
Trump has vowed to pull the US from the agreement but under the pact’s rules he will be unable to do so until 2020.

To date, 20 US states and more than 50 of its largest cities, along with more than 60 of the biggest businesses in the US, have committed to emissions reduction goals.
Added together, they have an economic power of about $10tn, placing this group behind only the US as a whole ($18.6tn) and China ($11tn) in terms of GDP.
On Saturday at the Bonn conference on climate change, these groups joined together to make “America’s pledge”, a commitment to combat global warming, in stark opposition to the Trump administration.
“This is very powerful,” said Paul Bodnar, a former lead negotiator at the climate talks for the US under Barack Obama. “These states and cities would be larger than 195 out of the 197 countries signed up to the Paris agreement.” 
Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, led the group in vowing to take measures, such as reducing coal-fired power and investing in renewable energy and efficiency, which would substantially reduce their carbon output.
But some delegates want the companies and local governments involved to go further, by submitting reports on their progress towards their emissions-cutting goals to be subject to the kind of monitoring and accountability that is required from national governments under the UN process. They have put forward a draft text which, if accepted, would mean such voluntary commitments were made in line with UN standards, and could therefore be included in the national greenhouse gas inventories required from countries.
Kevin Conrad, of Papua New Guinea, told the Guardian: “We welcome their contributions, but they should be accountable [on their progress in meeting their voluntary goals]. Will they be willing to be reviewed on their results, not just on the blather?”
He said the draft text was aimed at giving these contributions “a legitimacy” under the UN’s rules. “They should be transparent,” he said. “We do not want to pre-judge America’s Pledge, we just want rigour on the results.”
The group’s commitments fall outside the pledges under the landmark 2015 Paris agreement, and are likely to fall short of the requirements on carbon-cutting under the pact. Trump has vowed to withdraw the US from this agreement, the first to bind developed and developing countries to a specific temperature goal.
At the Bonn COP23 talks, scheduled to continue to the end of the week, nations are discussing how to improve their pledges on cutting carbon in line with scientific advice. Under the Paris agreement, they must hold global temperature rises to no more than 2C, which scientists say is the limit of safety, beyond which climate change is likely to become catastrophic and irreversible.
Current pledges under the Paris agreement are inadequate to reach this goal and it is estimated they would bring the world to 3C of warming, which would cause drastic changes in sea level rises, bring droughts and floods to many areas of the world, and make agriculture impossible in huge swaths of the globe.
However, consensus on how to strengthen the pledges is proving elusive, and is unlikely to be finalised at these talks.
Meanwhile, the Trump White House has indicated its priorities, to the consternation of many delegates, by scheduling a meeting at the talks focusing on the future of coal and how its use can be continued with new technologies.
The America’s Pledge report will be released in the alternative US headquarters at the talks, the US Climate Action Center. The giant inflatable dome sits on the edge of the conference – which many of its supporters claim is a sign of its endorsement as a semi-official player.
Despite the geographical proximity of the “America’s Pledge” delegation, there are limits to what non-state actors can do. They are excluded from many of the technical talks and cannot tap into federal funds that states use to finance commitments to slow climate change or reduce its impacts. More importantly, it is harder for them to set a course for the country.
But while that is missing, Antha Williams, head of the Bloomberg Philanthropies environment team, said it was necessary to fill the void.
“It would be better if we saw leadership from the White House, but the overarching point is that cities, states and companies that represent more than half of the US are showing their support for climate action.”
Nick Nuttall, communications chief of UN Climate Change, said the organisers were willing to work constructively with non-state actors.
“We are extremely supportive of the whole mass of cities, states and territories who have been aligning themselves with the Paris agreement,” he said. “American cities and states have been very active, which is welcome – and it mirrors what is happening elsewhere in the world.”
His comments were echoed by several delegates.
“We don’t turn a blind eye to anyone,” said Antonio Marcondes, the chief negotiator for Brazil. “We talk to the federal government and we have been approached by non-state bodies. Our policy is that we are willing to work with anyone who can move this process forward.”
But some climate activists warned against expecting too much from the America’s Pledge team.
Thanu Yakupitiyage, of the NGO 350.org said the climate pledges by many mayors and governors were a welcome step, but she urged still greater ambition and concrete policies to phase out fossil fuels.
“America’s Pledge is a start and we’ll be holding our elected officials, including governor Jerry Brown, to his word. As we look towards the climate summit that the governor has announced for 2018, we want more than words; we want a tangible action plan and steps taken,” she said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/11/us-groups-honouring-paris-climate-pledges-despite-trump

In an apparent bid to circumvent US president Donald Trump’s moves to withdraw from the Paris accord, the billionaire philanthropist also said the world body should accept an alternative set of US climate commitments alongside national pledges to reduce carbon emissions.
The former New York mayor was speaking at the UN’s climate change conference in Bonn, Germany, during the launch of the America’s Pledge report. The report has found that US states, cities and businesses that have signed up to reduce greenhouse gas emissions together represent a GDP of about $10tn. That is more than any nation except the US and China.
“If this group were a country, we’d be the third-biggest economy in the world. We should have a seat at the table,” Bloomberg said. “If Washington won’t lead, then mayors and governors will.”
Bloomberg – who is also a UN special envoy for cities and climate change – was among a high-level alternative US delegation that included Californian governor Jerry Brown, four senators, several mayors and representatives of major US corporations. Together they claim to represent a majority of people in the US.
“The American government may have pulled out of the Paris accord but the American people are still committed to its goals,” Bloomberg said. “And there is not a thing the government can do to stop us.”
The rival US group have overshadowed the muted official US delegation, which has shown the priorities of the Trump White House by scheduling a meeting at the talks focusing on the future of coal.
The packed America’s Pledge launch event took place in the US Climate Action Center, an inflatable dome that the alternative US delegation is using as its headquarters. Although it is outside the official conference hall, its close proximity, huge space and packed crowds highlighted the high status of the rival body.
It also got a top-level endorsement from the organisers. “They may be non-state actors, but they are leaders in this process. America’s Pledge sends a powerful message to the world that America is still in the game,” said Frank Bainimarama, the prime minister of Fiji, which is the president of this year’s UN conference.
Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, said she would take the report to the official parties at the conference centre. “We’re standing at the edge of something truly special,” she said in an upbeat assessment of the progress made so far in the US and elsewhere on the adoption of clean energy such as wind and solar. She said the world was moving from the information age to the “age of renewal.”
In an atmosphere often reminiscent of a campaign rally, Senator Ed Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said the solar industry in the US had created 50,000 jobs in 2016 – equivalent to the entire coal mining industry – and that the renewable industry as a whole would employ half a million workers by 2020. “This is the greatest blue-collar job creation in two generations,” he said.
Many major US corporations have also signed up to the campaign. Laura Phillips, senior vice-president of sustainability at Walmart, said a transition to clean energy made economic sense. 
She said the world’s biggest retailer had enough solar cells on its supermarkets to cover 190 football fields and had saved $1bn in fuel bills: “It’s good for business, it reduced emissions and it’s good for our community.”
But critics argue carbon trading and massive investments in technology do not deal with the root causes of the problem, which are overconsumption and capitalism. The event was interrupted by protesters who raised banners declaring “False Solution for the Planet” and chanted “We are the solution. Don’t trade pollution!” in reference to California’s carbon cap-and-trade scheme.
In a raucous five-minute exchange with the hecklers, Jerry Brown accepted that governments need to do more, but he said it was necessary to make the transition in stages rather than all at once. 
“That is good noise,” he said to the chanters. “But it doesn’t get the job done. You need a plan ... the perfect can be the enemy of the better.”
Several speakers highlighted the progress made in their regions.
Pittsburgh mayor Bill Peduto said a blue-green alliance between labour unions and renewables companies had revitalised his city after the post-industrial decline of its traditional steel industry. 
“Time goes in only one direction. If you wait for the mills and mines to reopen, you’ll be left in the past,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/11/alternative-us-group-honouring-paris-climate-accord-demands-seat-at-the-table-bonn

Norway is big on forest conservation via i.e. CAFI. On top of that it is foreign aid. And it seems that policy now is to use FA as support for creating jobs and potential for export, instead of just sending down cash. 
Thirdly - everyone know that the resources are there - and a well-managed sustainable model is better than wild-chopping down of forests (given that the regulated and managed industry does not come on top of forbidden logging). 
A problem is always and everywhere that industries moves way faster than science. Has ever an industrial start-up waited until science has documented/got a wide picture of what is present in terms of ecology/systems and how they will be affected? Never. Our economical model is to discover resource, start to use it, and figure out how it works later. 
Can logging in Congo be done sustainable? I do not know. I would guess so. But at what cost-margin it can happen? We also know that nations with on paper more mature administrations have logging gone completely out of control around the world. 
So what is the smart thing to do? I do not know. 
In an ideal world, Congo would be peaceful, with a strong environmental department, well set up to manage their resources in ways better than we in the west are doing. With good monitoring and regulations and enforcement of their plan. Because we know Africa has crazy amounts of natural resources that managed well really would be excellent for the continent, it's nations and the entire planet. 
The African tragedy is not a lack of resources, but how poor sentral government, wars, bribe-economies, almost unregulated freedom of global companies etc doing their things. How to give local people ownership and true place during management and decision making?
So how to break these circles? 
The alternative is to say that because our over-consumption in the west we are not going to allow the developing world to explore their natural resources at all - while keeping their resources neat and natural so we rich from the North can jump a plain to visit and see big wild-life in their natural habitat, since we pretty much cleared away that thing for ourselves during the last couple of centuries. 
It is kind of difficult pointing fingers are Congo - with their modern emission-rate of 0.5 tons per capita. So how are we morally going to argue here - and what nations are willing to pay for low-emission developing nations to stay that way? From what I see, people in rich nations do not want people to come here, but to help them where they are. But they do not wish to increase those budgets to help them where they are either. And we do not want to massively decrease own emissions/footprints. 
So what is the solution for all these nations? Sit completely still in poverty to act like sinks for our lifestyles? 
Or should we explore the potential to help with sustainable profits to be made? 
An alternative is of course to pull a carbon tax of a few hundred dollar per ton. This is something most in the west can understand because it gives it a price. At least we then start to pay for them managing our sinks.

whilst I fully appreciate the carbon cycle, it is very rare that 40 year old trees are immediately replaced with 40 year old trees. that leaves us with a carbon capture deficit in real time. We can't afford to allow CO2 emissions to rise, even if we do plan on planting trees to balance the books.

The group halt and unpack what looks like a spear, which is plunged over and over again into the waterlogged forest floor. Each time it brings up a metre-long core of rich, black peat made up of partly decomposed leaves and ancient plantlife. The deepest the steel blade reaches before meeting the underlying clay is 3.7 metres.
Leeds University forest ecologists Simon Lewis and Greta Dargie cheer. The peat bed below the tangle of trees and water in the geographical heart of Africa is much deeper than they expected; and because peat stores carbon and slows global warming, their new research conducted last week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)will be welcome news for the 194 countries meeting in Bonn for the annual UN climate conference.
Lewis and Dargie surprised the world earlier this year when they showed that the peatlands on either side of the Congo river contained one third of all the world’s tropical peat and were five times more extensive than anyone had thought, stretching over 145,500 sq km (56,000 sq miles), an area larger than England.
Since 2012, the two researchers have spent months at a time wading through bogs and sleeping on makeshift platforms built above the crocodile-infested swamp forests in the Cuvette central region of the neighbouring Republic of the Congo. “We would see elephant feet and gorilla hands imprinted in the peat. We were increasingly in awe that a remote, almost unknown, wilderness such as this could still be found on Earth today,” said Lewis.
Working mainly in the dry season, they took more than 500 peat samples, and calculated that the central African peatlands hold 30.6 billion tonnes of carbon accumulated over 10,000 years – the equivalent to three years of the world’s fossil fuel emissions. This would make them one of the world’s most important carbon “sinks”, they said.
But their new exploratory research, conducted with the Congolese botanist Corneille Ewango, 50km from Mbandaka in DRC, suggests that central Africa’s inaccessible forest swamps could be even more important as a global carbon storehouse than they thought, and could need a global initiative to research and protect them.
“While the extent of the peat is known, its depth is not. There is just no data. We are a long way from really knowing how much is there and need to do more research,” said Dargie.
“Maintaining these large stores of carbon must be a global priority. Only with strong scientific data on the peatland, and how it behaves or might react to future changes, can governments establish baselines and protections in international agreements to ensure it is preserved,” said Greenpeace forest campaigner Matt Daggett.
There is growing understanding that the fate of carbon sinks like the Congo basin peatlands will determine future climate change. If left alone, they are vital collectors of CO2; but if the forests above them are felled and the land is converted to farming, as has been widely practised for the past 30 years in south-east Asia, then the dried-out peat emits vast quantities of CO2 and intensifies climate change.
Tropical peatland stores around 2,000 tonnes of carbon per hectare but this has been barely recognised by governments which have continued to promote intensive farming on peatlands.
The draining of south-east Asia’s peat swamps and the felling of its trees has been a climate disaster, say scientists. Two months of intense peat fires started in August 2015 to clear land for palm oil and pulp and paper plantations in Indonesia released an estimated 884m tonnes of carbon dioxide, more than the European Union in its entirety emitted that year.
The Congo basin forest, the second largest in the world after the Amazon, has been relatively protected by its inaccessibility, but environmentalists say it is highly vulnerable and its peat could easily be destroyed. Pressure is building, they say, from logging companies and European governments to lift a 15-year-old moratorium on the allocation of new industrial logging concessions.
Logging on swamplands is prohibited in the DRC but, says the Rainforest Foundation UK (RFUK), Congolese legislation does not precisely define what constitutes a swamp. Its analysis suggests 3.4bn tonnes of carbon could be emitted if the concessions become active.
According to Greenpeace, nearly half of the DRC’s current logging concessions are in breach of the law because their permissions have run out and they do not have approved management plans. These concessions overlap around 10,000 sq km of peat swampland.
“If this forest is cut, there will be decomposition of the peat and vast quantities of CO2 will be released into the atmosphere, said Dagett.
The Congolese government, which has welcomed the scientists, is cautious about further protection. “There must be a balance between the forests and development. It comes down to money,” said Joseph Katenga, forest adviser to Amy Ambatobe, the minister for the environment and sustainable development.
But communities living close to the carbon-rich swamps near Lokolama have welcomed the discovery of peat, hoping it would attract money to better protect their forests which they traditionally use for fishing and hunting.
“As indigenous people, peatlands are part of our heritage and their discovery for the world to see represents a great hope for future generations,” said Valentin Egobo, who speaks for the Lokolama community.
“We hope our government will support us in our role as guardians of this ancient forest and provide us with the needed support to safeguard peatlands for our children and for the world.
“We did not know the peat was there. This is very important for us but we also need development. Our schools are dilapidated. We are marginalised and impoverished,” Egobo added.
The future of the DRC rainforest may be determined next month when the Norwegian government is expected to decide whether to fund a French Development Agency plan to expand “sustainable” industrial logging in the region. This would allow local communities to benefit from their resources, according to the agency.
But Greenpeace, RFUK and a petition signed by 135,000 people in Norway and the UK have condemned the plan. “Norway risks putting globally significant stores of carbon at risk through misguided support for so-called sustainable forest management in DRC. Instead of expanding large-scale timber-felling, Norway should work with the Congolese government to shut down the half of the country’s logging areas which the law requires to be closed and returned to the state,”, said Simon Counsell, the director of the RFUK.
The need to protect the forests above the peatlands was emphasised last week by a major report showing that there is 40% more carbon stored in forested lands than in known fossil-fuel deposits worldwide.
“Releasing this carbon into the atmosphere through continuing deforestation not only commits us to the worst impacts of climate change, but also results in the loss of a globally important carbon sink.
“Protecting the carbon stored in forests is no different than taking action to ensure fossil deposits like coal stay underground,” said the report’s lead author, Martin Herold of Wageningen University in the Netherlands.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/12/congo-basin-swamps-peatlands-carbon-climate-change

In a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange before its annual general meeting in Melbourne on Monday, its chair, Elizabeth Alexander, said the company would move to low-carbon investments “in line with our commitment to the health and wellbeing of our customers”.
“We understand that the health of the environment has an impact on the health of the community,” she said. “Medibank acknowledges the science of climate change and the impacts on human health.”
The company would move to low carbon investments in its international investment portfolio “within the next 12 months”.
Medibank is Australia’s largest private health insurer with more than 3.8 million members and annual revenue of more than $6bn. The divestment announcement follows similar decisions by other private insurers, such as HCF and NIB.
Major health and medical bodies such as the Australian Medical Association have warned of the effects climate change will have on human health.
The World Health Organisation has estimated that climate change will kill 250,000 people a year between 2030 and 2050 by increasing the rates of malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat stress.
Alexander said Medibank did not “directly invest in fossil fuels”, but had exposure through high-carbon investment.
“Overall, high-carbon-emitting companies make up less than 0.5% of our investment assets,” she said.
“To offset this we have invested $25m in green bonds to support carbon-reducing and environmentally responsible projects. 
“As the global economy makes the transition to low-carbon-emitting energy we believe it is important that our investment portfolio reflects this.”
Pablo Brait, from campaign group Market Forces, said: “It’s extremely positive that Medibank has ended its unhealthy addiction to fossil fuels.
“The medical profession has long understood that climate change has a devastating effect on people’s health, so it stands to reason medical insurers should not be invested in the industries which drive it.”
At its last AGM in 2016 shareholders asked about the health impacts of fossil-fuel companies that it was investing in.
At the time the company’s non-executive director, Peter Hodgett, said the company had divested from tobacco and would consider further divestments.
Alexander said the company had made a commitment to “carbon neutrality within our direct emissions and energy consumption by the end of 2018”.
“Our commitment also extends to our investments and we have reduced our exposure to investments that have the ability to adversely impact the health of our customers and the community,” she said.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/13/medibank-drops-fossil-fuel-investments-worth-tens-of-millions-of-dollars

But with sea levels rising, a managed retreat is underway that threatens to become a full-scale rout if global temperatures rise by 3C. The UN warns that they will unless governments take far more drastic action to reduce emissions.
In short, the entire shape of eastern England would change. The iconic British Isles map, learned from an early age in schools, would look very different. Locals already quip about Peterborough, 35 miles from the shore in Cambridgeshire, becoming a seaside city.
Global warming of 3C would lock in changes that would ultimately – several decades down the line – swamp most of the farm fields and much of the coastline in this eastern county.
The world is currently on course to heat up by 3C, according to the United Nations. That is because nations are not doing enough to reduce emissions. Climate negotiators are now discussing how to ratchet up ambitions to avoid this outcome.
Harsher droughts, more extreme weather, worse disruption of food production, increased migration by climate refugees, heightened storm surges and steadily rising sea levels. That is what we know for sure, then there is the risk of feedback loops - for example the release of methane from melting permafrost - that could quickly push 3C to 6C.
It could take decades or centuries, but change will be locked in by a 3C temperature rise, which would extensively melt ice caps, shrink glaciers and thermally expand the oceans so many current coastlines and low-lying plains would be under sea level. Unless massive barriers or water diversions are constructed, many cities, small islands, population centres, economic hubs and iconic sights will be submerged. Imagine a map with giant chunks missing from Florida, Manhattan, Lincolnshire, Rio de Janeiro and the deltas of the Nile, Amazon, Pearl, Mekong, Ganges and Brahmaputra.
National governments need to promise greater emissions cuts and enact policies to keep global warming to the more ambitious target of 1.5C or at most 2C, which they set as the goal of the Paris climate agreement. That will mean phasing out fossil fuels more quickly and ramping up effort to protect and restore forests.
 The growing threats of flooding, storm-surges and coastal erosion are already evident.
Lincolnshire was designated a high-risk area in the most recent national flood assessment, with 30,000 vulnerable properties. The Environment Agency advises residents to check the potential threat to their homes because many are unaware of how far inland the sea can already reach. During the great coastal flood in December 2013, the surge overwhelmed a pumping station 40 miles from the shore.
The county is a major recipient of the government’s six-year £2.5bn programme to strengthen sea and flood barriers in England. This is done with a mix of soft defences (sandy shores, mudflats and wetlands to absorb wave impact) by the coast along with hard defences (concrete walls) further inland.
The authorities replenish eroded beaches such as Skegness each year with 350,000 cubic metres of of sand. Earlier this year, two new flood-alleviation reservoirs were completed in Louth and Horncastle. A public inquiry has also been held for a £100m flood barrier scheme in Boston.
Increasingly, planners are also turning to “managed retreat”, which cedes previously reclaimed land. In this realignment (as the authorities prefer to call it), parts of the sea bank – for example, at North Somercotes in 2009 and Alkborough Flats in 2015 - are deliberately breached and converted back to salt marsh. This creates new wildlife habitats and adds an extra defence against flooding.
“We’re conscious that climate change is happening and perhaps faster than expected so we are trying to mitigate and adapt to protect people and property. We can’t stop it, but we can reduce the risk,” said Alison Baptiste, director of strategy and investment at the Environment Agency. 
She said the measures in place should protect most communities in the near and medium term, but 50 years from now the situation will become more challenging. “If climate change projections are accurate, we’re going to have to make some difficult decisions.”
The greatest hits will be on food security and the economy. Lincolnshire boasts nearly a quarter of the land used in England for horticulture and an even higher proportion for peas, beans and vegetables (pdf). Most would be swamped as coastlines are redrawn. Fishing ports and seaside towns would also disappear.
Jason Elliott, who works at a Skegness beach shop selling buckets, spades and saucy postcards said people in the town had been warned about the long-term threat.
“We’ve heard that the coast will move so far inland that Peterborough will become a seaside town,” he said, referring to an area 35 miles from the shore. “We all assume we’ll be OK for a good while, but it would be sad if one day Skegness was to go. So many people live here and so many holidaymakers have had fun here.”

Evidence says that the wildfire season, the rate of onset and frequency of droughts plus the frequency of extreme downpours have increased with global greenhouse warming.
If these are what you call catastrophes, they've already increased.
The destructiveness of tropical cyclones such as Harvey and Irma has increased with warming.
The Queensland or Colorado towns affected by the increase in flash flooding have their own society. In Queensland the response to the flash flooding of those towns and the later riverine flooding of the cities downstream involved the whole society and its political and economic system.
Crop failures in African countries with insufficient capital and governance can lead to famine if food is not distributed but certainly lead to exacerbation of poverty. In Queensland crop failure does lead to famine as government provides drought relief but farmers do experience economic loss. In both cases anthropogenic global warming is increasing the frequency of extreme El Nino events and their associated drought while warmer temperatures are hastening the onset of drought often in the neutral ENSO phase years leading up to the extreme El Nino event.

ENSO phases both El Nino and La Nina are responsible for droughts and their opposite in different places at opposite times. Once you know which of the extreme ENSO phases you're dealing with you have a fair idea which regions will be subject to drought conditions.
Climate scientists have not ignored ENSO phases in relation to global climate warming as shown by the work of Australian researcher Wenju Cai on the increased frequency of extreme El Nino events and La Nina events plus their associated droughts with greenhouse warming.
Poleward migration of rain bearing weather patterns and consequent drought independent of ENSO phase has also been observed with global climate warming. Overall temperature increase increases evaporation of soil moisture hastening the onset of drought during neutral ENSO phase years. The 2012 to 2016 drought in western Queensland started with three very hot neutral ENSO years and culminated in an extreme El Nino. By the time the El Nino arrived most farmers had destocked.
Famines occur when crops fail and there is no political will or ability to deliver famine poor farming communities. Crops fail because of drought, the rate of onset and frequency of which has increased with greenhouse warming. Famine relief fails because of politics, poor governance and war.
The historical record shows that extreme El Nino and La Nina phases and their associated droughts have increased, that rainfall has decreased in regions where rain bearing weather systems have migrated poleward, that extreme rainfall events have increased from 1900 to 2009, that wildfire seasons (the period where the fuel load easily catches fire) have increased in duration, and that the rate of drought onset and consequent crop failure leading to the risk of famine has increased.', u'recommendation_count': u'3', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1510811685000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'drought', u'effect': u'crops fail the rate of onset and frequency of which has increased with greenhouse warming'}, {u'cause': u'politics poor governance and war', u'effect': u'famine relief fails'}, {u'cause': None, u'effect': u'the risk of famine'}], u'author_id': u'12483673', u'in_reply_to': u'108284986', u'id': u'108308293', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Walsunda', u'text': u'Science that is well supported by evidence, such as the causative link between global climate warming and the observed increase in extreme rainfall events or downpours as well as the equally well supported by evidence causative link between global climate warming and atmospheric CO2 increase due to the burning of fossil fuels, is not disingenuous.', u'recommendation_count': u'3', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1510808300000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'the burning of fossil fuels', u'effect': u'the equally well supported by evidence causative link between global climate warming and atmospheric co2 increase'}], u'author_id': u'12483673', u'in_reply_to': u'108284986', u'id': u'108307417', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Walsunda', u'text': u'""Couple that"" (implication of increased rainfall events as the globe has warmed from 1900 to 2009) ""with media alarmism that jumps to blame fossil fuel burning for heavy rainfall events is a bit disingenuous"" .
As discussed above there is no implication but instead a reality that extreme or very heavy rainfall events have increased from 1900 to 2009 as the Earth has warmed. The peer reviewed scientific paper by Westra et al, which describes the evidence of this increase and concludes the global climate warming is the cause of the increase and which was published in a proper scientific journal, is not media alarmism; nor are the other peer reviewed scientific papers that link our current fast global warming to the burning of fossil fuels which also have been published in proper scientific journals.', u'recommendation_count': u'3', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1510806142000}, u'causal_relations': None, u'author_id': u'12483673', u'in_reply_to': u'108284986', u'id': u'108306988', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Walsunda', u'text': u'""the implication that AGW"" (anthropogenic global warming) will increase the likelihood of global downpours"".
I assume you mean the likelihood of of downpours (or extreme precipitation events) globally.

BQEND
Don't know how to make it clearer. Re-read what I said. Modeled predictions say that wildfires, droughts and downpours will increase. But there is nothing in the climate record that currently supports those assertions. If we all agree that the globe is warming caused by CO2 emissions, then we should be able to attach some trending now on these types of ""catastrophic"" events that they are in fact CLEARLY impacting society because the Earth is CLEARLY warming. Maybe someday, we'll have enough data to say that. But with the amount of variables in each type of event, we can't yet. And when science makes those assertions, I challenge whether or not all variables have been considered, especially when attribution claims are made before data has even been studied on specific events (california wildfires were attributed to climate change very quickly by some media and politicians....same thing with Hurricanes Harvey and Irma).
In my mind, a societal catastrophe is SLR, and it's likely impacts in several decades or a disease epidemic etc. A downpour in Colorado for example may lead to a local catastrophe with flash flooding etc., but it's not societal. Societal emergencies need to be dealt with on a grand scale. The flash flood in Colorado? No. Another example....famines are supposedly going to be attributable to AGW.

I realize that, but the media and others here in the US went off the deep end about the fires near San Francisco a few months ago claiming attribution. So that's why I'm talking about it. And California may be experiencing more lightning storms statewide, but they are still very rare in the coast ranges from the coast to about 50 miles inland from about Mendocino down to Santa Barbara, and again down through the LA/San Diego area. An August fire around the Bay Area/LA/San Diego is far more likely to start from carelessness or a something other than a lightning bolt.

As anyone who has attempted to ignite a fire knows you need both a source of ignition and dry fuel before you get a fire.

You realize you just made my point with this. I already said that certainly, the amount of fuel is an issue in the later summer months. But what ignites these fires has changed dramatically in the past 150 years or so. In your example, the only thing that would start that ""rough pile of sticks"" is your match or smoldering campfire, or a lightning bolt. If you're not there, that fire doesn't start. Also, your example is beautiful because it illustrates the importance of undergrowth density in your ""pile of sticks"" imagery. Undergrowth density has increased dramatically at low elevations in an effort to do the right thing since civilization, ie. put out fires. When fires did occur naturally historically, they burned until winter rains came, and were common and large enough to keep undergrowth thin. Not any more.

""Downpours? Not catastrophes and in some cases they're helpful"" was not correct.
BQEND
Given how I worded that, I'll grant your statement. However, studies are claiming that the increases of downpours are due to AGW. In no way, can an assertion be made to claim that these downpours are becoming a ""societal"" catastrophe. There will be, and always have been individual catastrophes as you point out, but there are so many variables when considering each flooding event that given the newness of this potential AGW effect, there impacts to human society globally is a bit of a reach (i.e. the implication that AGW will increase the likelihood of global downpours.) Couple that with media alarmism that jumps to blame fossil fuel burning for heavy rain events is a bit disingenuous.

More and stronger hurricanes (the science was pointing to ""more"" only a decade or so ago, now it's changed to only ""stronger"").

Droughts attributable to AGW - Given the unpredictability of droughts and their existence globally almost anywhere at any one time, the assertion of more or new catastrophic droughts to be blamed on AGW is very hasty and lacking consideration of other variables (ENSO etc). 
Just some examples. It's not to say that these events won't happen, but seems hasty to assert these things because nothing (yet) in the historical record shows that human activity is leading to more now.

I do not trust the nuke boosters who constantly attack renewable energy. These are people associated with enormous trans-national companies who want to keep the population on a leash of centrally controlled enormous power stations so they can bleed them dry for the rest of their lives. They are just as dishonest in some of their claims as full on denialists and share support for other destructive right wing practices. They ignore the massive cost over runs of new plants being built and ignore the disposal of waste material. They ignore the plants that shut down when the coolant water is too hot (which will increase). They pretend that the power stations are 100% reliable and constant when the truth is that such technically complicated systems develop faults and need to be shut down. The same amount of money could finance vast amounts of renewable energy. The whole process still requires mining for fuel and all the associated continuing environmental destruction, which will only get worse as the best quality, easily available uranium runs out. They always have the 'next generation' of power stations that they promise faithfully, cross my heart will be totally safe. The same people that told us the old systems were totally safe. People with $billions waved in front of them will say anything while hoping they will be long gone if some construction short cut by a sub-contractor to a sub-contractor leads to massive failures. 
Nuke boosters spend most their time attacking renewable energy and are happy to do so alongside those that claim global warming is not happening or that global warming is happening but it is natural. One big happy club of delusionists. 
When nuke boosters spend as much time attacking those who reject climate science as they do attacking renewable energy then I will give them more support. I will only fully support nuclear if it is entirely government owned and government run with 100% transparency. Until then I will class nuke boosters as shills for mega-corporations with the same total disdain for telling the truth as your bog standard right wing denialist.', u'recommendation_count': u'7', u'time_stamp': {u'$date': 1510617432000}, u'causal_relations': [{u'cause': u'they', u'effect': u'massive failures'}], u'author_id': u'12928860', u'in_reply_to': u'108191419', u'id': u'108193546', u'schema_org_type': u'http://schema.org/Comment'}, {u'author': u'Tony B', u'text': u'I have no doubt that modern nuclear reactors are extremely safe.

A new report on Monday from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) reveals that the number of natural world heritage sites being damaged and at risk from global warming has almost doubled to 62 in the past three years.
 Those at high risk include iconic places from the Galapagos Islands to the central Amazon and less well known but equally vibrant and unique sites such as the karst caves of Hungary and Slovakia and the monarch butterfly reserves in Mexico.
 Coral reefs are particularly badly affected by rising ocean temperatures, from the Seychelles to Belize, where the northern hemisphere’s biggest reef is situated. Global heating is also causing mountain glaciers to rapidly shrink, from Kilimanjaro in Tanzania to the Rocky Mountains in Canada and the Swiss Alps Jungfrau-Aletsch – home to the largest Alpine glacier.
 Other ecosystems being damaged are wetlands, such as the Everglades, where sea level is rising as the ocean warms and salt water is intruding. In the Sundarbans mangrove forest on the delta of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers on the Bay of Bengal, two islands have already been submerged and a dozen more are threatened. Fiercer storms are also increasing the risk of devastation.
Rising numbers of wildfires are damaging the beautiful Fynbos flowerscapes in the Cape region of South Africa and the Monarch butterfly site in Mexico. Elsewhere, warming is melting the permafrost in the newly declared Qinghai Hoh Xil heritage site, which is at 4,500m altitude in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. 
 Australia is especially exposed as it has 10 natural heritage sites where climate change damage is rated as high or very high risk, from its Gondwana rainforests to Shark Bay in western Australia and islands such as Fraser and Macquarie.
 The new IUCN report was launched at the UN climate summit being held in Bonn, Germany, where the world’s nations are working to put the 2015 landmark Paris agreement into operation.
“Protection of world heritage sites is an international responsibility of the same governments that have signed up to the Paris agreement,” said Inger Andersen, IUCN director general. “This report sends them a clear message: climate change acts fast and is not sparing the finest treasures of our planet. This underlines the need for urgent and ambitious national commitments and actions to implement the Paris agreement.” 
Climate change is one of a range of factors that mean about a third of the world’s 241 natural heritage sites are being damaged, with invasive alien species being the top threat. Then, after global warming, comes unsustainable tourism, followed by other problems like poaching and construction.
Prince Charles, the UK’s heir to the throne and longtime environmentalist, said: “Climate change is in actual fact becoming regarded as the fastest growing threat, its impacts already visible in many of the sites. This report highlights the incredibly urgent need to expedite the global response to climate change.” A further 55 sites around the world are expected to be harmed by climate change in the future unless warming is curbed.
 “Natural world heritage sites also play a crucial role supporting local economies and livelihoods,” said Tim Badman, director of IUCN’s World Heritage Programme. “Their destruction can thus have devastating consequences that go beyond their exceptional beauty and natural value. In Peru’s Huascarán national park, for example, melting glaciers affect [people’s] water supplies.”
 The report does include some success stories, showing that the destruction of nature’s most precious sites can be tackled. In Ivory Coast’s Comoé national park, for example, elephant and chimpanzee populations have recovered thanks to better management and international support after the end of conflicts.
 But overall, the number of sites with good status has fallen, leaving Andersen to ask: “If we cannot secure the highest quality protection for the world’s most precious natural areas, what will this say about our ability to fulfil our collective commitments towards the planet, including the Paris agreement?”
